This is another one of those films that I remember going to bed late to watch on TV, scaring myself to shit at an impressionable age of 12 and subsequently condemning myself to life with an obsession with a horror movie. This is a BIG film, and it serves as living proof that there really were realistic effects in front of CGI. <br /> <br /> Being on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems to be almost the same as the original version (The Thing). From another world) stopped. American scientists discover the destroyed Norwegian base a few miles away. All are dead, and only the half burnt remains of some unidentified thing left smoldering outside the complex can offer any answers to what might have happened. Things are returning to the American base, and scientists realize too late that they are alive and deadly. The substance thaws and turns off, not only killing anyone and everything that crosses His path, but also absorbing them, turning Himself into who and whatever he wishes. Then the film turns into a brilliant play of paranoia. Everyone is suspicious, everyone can be one, and no one trusts anyone else. Strength and security are gone when people come together, despite their differences, to fight a monster. The group has split, and fear dominates everything. Who is it? <br /> <br /> The effects of the blood here are absolutely amazing and incredibly realistic. I could have done without the dog's head splitting like a banana peel, but itâ€™s just an animal lover's addiction to me: kill all the people you want, but leave the kittens and puppies alone. Mind and intelligence quickly fall apart, because one after another people are captured by a changeable alien. The strength of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat lies inside and more frightening due to the fact that it is impossible to see or easy to detect. When forced to hide, this anger is huge and the results are terrible. <br /> <br /> This is one of Carpenters' best films, Fog and Halloween. All the actors give strong, realistic performances, and special effects are so powerful that they act as their main character. In this film, there is something for any lover of the horror genre. Do not miss it.
