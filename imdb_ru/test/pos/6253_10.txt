“Tourist trap” is a really creepy low-budget horror film that will surely satisfy horror fans. It has a very strange atmosphere, and there are some very unnerving moments in it full of fear and fear. Some scenes are completely strange, for example, there is one scene when Chuck Connors sits down to have dinner with a dummy that comes alive and starts talking to him before his head falls. There is very little blood, but the violence is pretty strong for a horror movie rated PG. The mannequins look very sinister and the climax is terrifying. David Schmeller has returned to make several other genre films, including “Caterpillar Space”, “Puppet Master” and “The World of the Dead”. Still, The Tourist Trap is definitely his best horror movie, so if you want to get scared, give this little gem a look 9 out of 10.
