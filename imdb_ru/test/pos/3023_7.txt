The serial killer, Karl Starger, kidnapped and killed young women, allowing them to drown in a water-filled cell. He is detained by the FBI, but is in a coma, and his latest kidnapping victim is waiting in a cell filled with water. <br /> <br /> Take a look at the above premise, and you will see that there is a lot to see before looking at it. The magic of Mark Protsevich’s script is that he turns a gray-haired old chestnut plot into something completely different from what you expect. If I mentioned that the plot includes a machine that allows a psychiatrist to penetrate Starger’s mind, then he completely sets up another film. <br /> <br /> This will not be enough to make CELL a different thriller class, but Directed by Tarsem Singh creates a visually striking surrealist thriller. Paul Laufera’s cinematography, where opaque primary colors come to the fore, is awesome, but Singh doesn’t let it end, things like costume design, when Starger wanders through its unique universe in luxurious costumes, makes a visual impact, making it much more Thriller Mill series <br /> <br /> What prevents Cell from becoming a classic film, however, you are becoming more and more aware that the whole film revolves around visual effects, and does not have a natural narration. We see the third character, the FBI man entering the Starger domain, but this is more like a plot of the plot invented in order to acquaint the audience with more amazing, but very disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that this is a rather disturbing thriller with an atmosphere that is very depressing and which prevents the film from being attractive, if not pleasant. One scene in which an FBI agent talks about a case where a pedophile beats rap just to cut out the heart of his victim will fill your heart with such desperation that you can pull the shutdown button. You may have to watch a huge number of thrillers until you see another one as embarrassing as this one.
