MONKEY is definitely one of the best shows ever shown on television. I remember when I was a kid, I went to my grandmother's house every Saturday morning, and I turned on the TV so I could watch a monkey. I like it. It had awesome action films, cool special effects, a great story, a fantastic themed song that is guaranteed to never leave your head, and fun dubbing. But it is rather strange that this is happening in China, and the actors are Japanese and are being filmed in Japan, but this is not a stop to make this series attractive. <br /> <br /> MONKEY talks about the adventures of three people: Pig (Toshiyuki Nishida), Sandy (ShirÃ´ Kishibe) and, of course, the unforgettable and cutest character, Monkey (Masaaki Sakai), who travel from China to India to Get a bunch of sacred scrolls to save the world. > <br /> Monkey - it's very fun and magical.
