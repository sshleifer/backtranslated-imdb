Sorry for the "extremely smart" summary phrase. I do not know what I was thinking, but I really could not help myself. <br /> <br /> I have long wanted to see “Bloody Birthday”, and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by chance and for such a low price. And believe me, I live in a small South American village, and such things are unlikely to happen. It's a shame that some of these "pearls" of the 80s are now almost completely forgotten. Bloody Birthday is one of those films that are surprisingly aging enough to be watched these days. Not a masterpiece, of course, but still interesting and guess what? ... in fact, there are no unintentionally funny scenes. I know that this is a shock, if you remember that this is a low-budget film from the early 80s about a group of evil children who kill people. But believe me, for the most part the film manages to remain respectable and watchable. <br /> <br /> In Bloody Birthday, the story revolves around three children who were born during a total eclipse. According to astrology, during eclipses, the sun and moon block Saturn, which controls emotions. As a result, the three children who were born on this day eventually become indifferent and angry. Since they have no sense of remorse, these 10-year-olds mostly face everyone who stands in their way, including their own parents and brothers and sisters ... and kill them! The number of victims is growing day by day, and the police authorities believe that a psychopath is hiding around this place. Meanwhile, Debbie, Curtis and Stephen, do not hesitate to kill people, since no one suspects these lovely angelic faces (?) <br /> <br /> As I said, “Bloody Birthday” is surprisingly NOT funny. I know I said this before, but I'm really surprised by this. I was expecting some funny bad scenes, but the film proved that I was wrong. True, this is not exactly what most people would consider to be a “serious” horror film, but if I were honest, I would say that the story was worthily executed. One of the most important reasons for which you can usually expect ridiculous situations (like me) is that in such films in which the main villains are children, young actors are usually terrible and they make it all funny. Let's face it: children are usually terrible actors, which is understandable, and we cannot blame them for that. But, to my surprise, the three young actors who played the merciless killers in this film looked very disturbing and not at all funny. The rest of the cast are good too, and if you're a George Clooney fan, you can see his uncle playing the doctor in this film. Yes, I know right? ... who cares? In addition, Julie Brown, a great actress, singer, comedienne and gay icon, demonstrates a solid role in the role of an older sister, and if someone is interested in nudity: she also undresses in one of the scenes and looks great naked Sorry that she had no more time on screen! Julie is "just incredible": P <br /> <br /> In general, this film is good if you are in the mood for some humble horror from the 80s. My only objection to the “Bloody Birthday” will be a way to justify the motives of the children. This is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film. Let's see: if the children born during the eclipse turn out to be heartless killers, then why were these three the only ones who actually killed people? I am sure that there were other children who were born on the same day ... and on other days of a total eclipse, but oh well! In general, it's okay, it's just a simple observation, that's all. I saw worse, believe me. Take, for example, “Children” (1980), in which the premature killer gets his evil after a poisonous cloud turns him into a zombie. No, believe me, “Bloody Birthday” is much more decent, and if you like simple slashers, you will love this one. <br /> <br /> So now you know: you are invited to the children's birthday ... and the hosts will serve a delicious poisoned cake for you and the other guests. Come on, you can't miss it;)
