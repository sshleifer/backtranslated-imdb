The story itself is a routine: a boy runs away from home and ends up in a heavy music school for children. He convinces a famous violinist to sponsor a school. The film is a continuous shooting that lasts more than 11 weeks, and leaves a lot of funny holes that the observer can find for himself. <br /> <br /> No matter how long the plot tendrils are, the film is justified by its music and acting skills. There are many pieces of music that feature the classical works of Highfitz and the Orchestra Meremblum, one of the leading youth symphonies of the time, and she says that the music is excellent. In itself, this would make a picture worthy of attention. Responsibilities for management and calculation were given to the best hands: Alfred Neumann. <br /> <br /> Acting is a study of contrasts. The kids in the orchestra, most of whom had little or no acting experience, must have driven director Archie Mayo crazy, looking at the camera, overdoing what they had, and following the instructions given to them excessively. But the spontaneity arising from the lack of training adds an interesting appeal to the picture. The veteran actors were amazed by the material with which they had to work. Walter Brennan played a great role, which he imitated in real life. Joel McCree and Andrea Leeds were perfect for their parts. And as a second person, the real actor who is who: Marjorie Maine, Arthur Holl, Paul Harvey, Charles Coleman, Perry Ivins and Porter Hall in his typical role of “heavy” played everything perfectly. And a few players: Jesse Arnold, John Hamilton, Marjorie Wood, Jimmy Flavin, Dulcie Day, Lee Steve Phelps in their normal role as a policeman and many others. If you are an actor fan, this film will bring many memories. <br /> <br /> In general, the picture is very pleasant and recommended, even if you are not a fan of classical music. . <br /> <br /> tvcat
