"Please do not kill me! I'm just an actor! "" Can you play dead? " It's hard to describe this show. It's like a crime drama. Where a bad cop is a donkey. Literally. What is so good about the series is the horrific one-line assies. Having dealt with such pearls as “Adios, Blimp”, Assi McGee gives excellent laughter in some places. Unfortunately, on other occasions the show seems to be dragging on at a slow pace, which makes it almost difficult to watch. This is definitely a show that you will love or hate, in fact, there is no intermediary. This is not the best show on {Adult Swim}, but it has its strengths. It is worth a look to see if you like it. I know what I did.
