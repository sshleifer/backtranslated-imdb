When Patricia Newell is attacked after she witnesses her cousin's murder, Detective Carrell is looking for her killer in the city. Identifying the killer after an intense hunt for people, Patricia is sent to live with relatives in the country. For Carrela, the case is closed ... or is it? "Relatives of the blood" - a lost masterpiece. Donald Sutherland plays a policeman, and it's nice to see how Donald Pleasant plays the small role of a child molester. The conclusion is quite alarming. However, Blood Relatives is more of a mystery than a horror film, so Horus fans will be disappointed. Be sure to look for fans of old-fashioned mystical films. 9 out of 10.
