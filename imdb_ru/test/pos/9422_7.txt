Beginning in 1942, the character Sherlock Holmes, portrayed by Basil Rathbone, was installed in what was then "modern" Britain. Many Holmes purists praised the first two entries in the series (produced by FOX), but rejected the next 12 functions. For example, I have never been an avid reader, and therefore I appreciate these films because they are without any initial bias. In fact, the setting of the Second World War for this entry puts it as part of a period with British propaganda evident throughout the film. The execution of modern Holmes is handled with much more care than the previous record (Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror), and the prices are much better for two reasons. Firstly, Roy William Neal is ready to rule (and will be for the rest of the series), and secondly, although Holmes is opposed to the Nazis, the inclusion of Professor Moriarty makes it more like an intellectual battle between two rivals. , Lionel Atville's work has been criticized by many for being much inferior to the play by George Zucco and Henry Daniel, but it seems to me that this is more of a script than an interpretation of a character. Especially after he saw that Atheville was very versatile and passionate about other horror roles. Basil Rathbone, on the other hand, is exceptional in this recording. He seems to be enjoying the role of Holmes, but I blame for this in writing. For example: Holmes' presentation in “The Voice of Horror” attempts to immediately establish how smart he is, as soon as he appears on the screen, while this film shows Holmes’s brilliant conclusions, but also his flaws. Even at the climax, Holmes at first has superiority, and only then his blood slowly merges with his body. Now there are several flaws in this film that I think I could point out. First discovery; Is it too easy to fool the Germans? Maybe it's just me, but the bookseller just waltzes into the bar and says that he will make Tobel not only open the door after a few weeks of cover, but also allow him to enter and then walk with him? What kind!? Secondly, Tobel seems to endanger everyone around him. Leave the secret bombs with brilliant scientists. Leaving a note with your fiance. Like what he thought? He put them in danger. I thought he was this excellent scientist trying to save England? And does the very concept of “use it on them before they use it on us” is a bit harsh. Obvious propaganda. Third, how, in the name of God, did Holmes have to fit in the bottom of this chest? It is really small! In fact, the entire execution of Holmes, who discovered Moriarty in a former disguise, does not really explain himself well. I have seen this film more than fifty times, and there are parts that, it seems to me, are performed very confusingly. Fourth, good, so that Holmes finds out that the first three scientists are dead, and then immediately assumes that Moriarty could not know the name of the fourth person, because he had not yet died. Well, if Holmes did not know the name, how could he have supposed it? The guy could well be face down in the lake. Happy guess. Fifth, again with confusion. When Holmes supposedly dies on Moriarty’s operating table, how can he recover so quickly? He, of course, behaved as if he had lost a few pints of blood, but not enough to stop him from saving the day. Now, despite these shortcomings, this is a very interesting film. The disguise is well done, the secret of the dancing men is well done (especially Holmes and Moriarty’s back-to-back scenes, each of which finds out that they overestimate them), and Dennis Howie is always a plus in the role of Lestrade's inspector. And one last note: the interrogation scene is still bothering me, I always thought it was one of the best-made scenes in the entire film. In general, this film occupies a special place for me, since it was he who strengthened my Rathbone as an obsessive idea of ​​Holmes. Classic 7/10.
