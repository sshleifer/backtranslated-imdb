It was a very good western of the 1950s, one of the best I've seen in a decade that has shown this genre on screen and on television. There must have been three major actors: Glenn Ford, Barbara Stenwick, and Edward J. Robinson. It turns out that Ford was the star of this film, while the other two stars played minor roles. Ford had the bulk of the dialogue. He was also a “good guy,” while Robinson was a “bad guy,” and Stanwick was twice as bad as Robinson. She played a very heavy role in this film, and the character she played was sometimes too controversial. <br /> <br /> Ford coped with his star status very skillfully, as usual, especially in westerns. He played a good guy who did not want to fight, was a peaceful man ...... but if you push him ..... beware! <br /> <br /> The story had a good mix of action and sleep, without overdoing it. He had an extensive western setting that was well used with a widescreen CineamaScope screen. It was also attended by realistic people in a realistic setting. This credibility of the characters, especially the supporting players, was the most impressive. Men beat women in this film, acting on the nature. Diane Foster and May Winn were weak - the only cons of production. It is easy to understand why these two actresses never became stars. <br /> <br /> Despite being over 50 years old, this Western can still be found fast enough to enjoy it, no matter how old you are. or what you used to see. For fans of classic cinema, this is almost certainly with this actor and a good story. Highly recommended.
