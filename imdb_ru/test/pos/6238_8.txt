Like one of the other reviewers (possibly @ Amazon), I first met Tourist Trap from a beloved, decrepit old WOR-9 in New York, around January 1983. Devilish dog: The hell dog I was waiting to see, since it debuted on Halloween in 1978, had just ended, and I thought that I would have enough horror for the whole day (stop laughing - this three-eyed monster "Borgost" ( sp?) Ike Eisenmann, invented in his room, Scary). <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Richard Crenna is still enjoying his terrible hat made for television, the first 10 minutes of the Tourist Trap that followed the Devil Dog that day really left Mark - and months this was the first movie i ever shot from tv. Warr used to play it quite often, often as in the Million Dollar film on Saturday, as others have already seen. This is one of those proposals that provides a powerful horror strike in front, a real left hook - and then practically begins with the rest of the actors, dances and jabs, giving the intro scene a larger context along the way, then goes to the real climax (see , Re Animator). <br /> <br /> Two paragraphs and I did not mention a single dummy. Let's face it - the damn things are scary enough, without music and script. I can also recall a few scary mannequins and the like in the attics and basements of various relatives and say what you like about the relatively simple approach of Schmeller and Carroll - no one, before or after, played it so well. In real life, a good mannequin will force you to double double - and now, this is the last thing you will likely see if you get stuck in a non-existent Slausen wax museum and roadside stand. Yes, there is a moment (“I loved her very much”) when Chuck “Slausen” Connors is trying to pass for Vincent Price. Yes, the plot could take the whole paragraph in its early stages; I don't see the script being so fat. It does not matter From direction to competent action (Meryl Streep is not fully present, and here, it helps, but does not interfere), to another useful and effective account of Pinot Dinaggio (see Carrie and various other De Palma films), to different lighting, stock films, the use of different sound levels ... I could continue - each element of this low-budget production is combined, and you get a job that far exceeds the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that it is as scary as Hell? Stephen King talked about this film at Danse Macabre a year or so after its release, and there were good reasons. Like much of his work, it may not be a great art, but it does tell a terrible story and does it well. The rest of the cast may be relatively unknown (isn’t Jocelyn Johns in the same movie about car chasing in Texas?), But Chuck Connors and Tanya Roberts were familiar enough to the audience so you could think - Stephen King’s style - happen to you or to people you know. <br /> <br /> A comparison with Psycho (plot) and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (general appearance and behavior), even if they are not the first associations in my mind, are valid. The only pity is that I could not comment on the DVD, which I look forward to buying, since in the video "Tourist Trap" it became particularly difficult to find after the almost complete disappearance of independent rental points of the video, where he had a house, except WOR and cable in The 1980s (although TMC / Showtime seems to have picked it up and now plays regularly). No, there are no spoilers here, I am afraid, there is no plot breakdown - see for yourself (ok, the bottom might be tiny, so scroll through if you want - better than sorry.) Mannequins are damn scary, and I'd rather show you than tell ... :) By the way, the Tourist Trap is also full of wonderful lines: “We will have a party! How do I look, yes, how do I look ?! "," You are so beautiful "," you can not hurt me "," I did not need to hide it - it's good! “(Listen to Vincent Price’s exaggeration again), the inevitable“ you are crazy! ” (delivered at the right moment and in the right tone) ... and try - just try - keep the hair on your hands when you hear the cry of the dummy's head "Molly!" - especially when you realize whose head it was ... :) <br /> <br /> P S ... I think that the producer was Charles Band, and he probably owned the rights to Dinajo's music. As far as I understand, the band was the brain behind Full Moon Entertainment, which could explain both the subsequent use of music in Puppet Master and the commercial approach characteristic of the 40s, which characterized Full Moon in everything from pleasant Puppet Master franchises and Subspecies, to ... uh-u ... transirs and bad channels (sorry, BOC).
