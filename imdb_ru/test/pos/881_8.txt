Unlike Bond and other detective films, the hero of Alfred Hitchcock was an ordinary man who got into trouble, and then with his grip and courage (and luck) came out of it. Jewel Thief is based on the same principle, and thus it is a tribute from Vijay Anand to the master of the unknown. It is a tribute, however, but it stands on its own foundations and establishes Vijay Anand as the greatest director. <br /> <br /> This is the story of the common man Vinaya, who once realizes that he has a counterpart named Amar. who is actually a thief of jewels. Suddenly Vinay finds himself in the center of the hatching scheme and, in order to be saved, sets off in pursuit of the wild goose to find this Amar who remains one step ahead of him. Waiting almost kills throughout the entire movie, and when the plot falls apart, you are amazed at the brilliance of the scheme. As in the Hitchcock films, Jewel Thief boasts a grand climax, filmed in the great palace of Sikkim. <br /> <br /> Everything, and I mean everyone; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Wajyanti Mala, Tanuja, S.D. Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrukh Sultanpuri, etc., etc. And so on. They are in their best forms. This is one of the best thrillers ever created in India.
