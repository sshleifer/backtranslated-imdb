Hunters of war for everything. 5 words that I love to watch. War of hunters for everything - a great Australian comedy. As the name suggests, they wage war for everything. It seems they like the most to get to the polls. <br /> <br /> “The Hunter” is one of the best comedies I've ever seen, and the most popular in Australia. It is on the Australian Broadcasting Department (ABC), where some of the best comedies are located. <br /> <br /> He received awards from the Australian Film Industry (AFI), but did not get the best comedy on the loggias. <br /> <br /> Last year (2006), the pursuer was shown on ABC on Friday evening, when everyone was gone, so no one could see it. Well, they were postponed on Wednesday evening at 21:00 (best time frame), and best of all, if I miss an episode or even just want to see it again, I can download it from www.ABC.net.au/chaser.
