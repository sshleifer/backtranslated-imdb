Aaaa ... Thing. <br /> <br /> To watch a horror movie, in which not only every character over thirty, but clearly unappealing, makes a refreshing change and reminds me of those distant times when the actors were chosen because of their talent and their ability play realistic characters, not because of their appeal to teens on the cover of a magazine. And Carpenter chooses a designer and cinematographer who can actually create a realistic environment, rather than overly stylized parodies. And there is no useless “twisting” of the ending, or the appearance of a celebrity on a cameo, or an unconvincing pseudo-romantic plot. <br /> <br /> And I DO miss the physical effects on the set; with all those 20-year-olds trying crazy new ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. For 5 years, between 1979 and 1984, we saw the Alien, the Elephant Man, Poltergeist, Howl, the American werewolf in London, the Thing, the Company of Wolves, the Nightmare on Elm Street ... what a horror era! And do not get me to the death of matte painting. Matte work in this film is beautiful and complete. <br /> <br /> What do we have now? CGI of the third level, former music video directors and professional stylists, thanks to whom even “rough” horror films look like glossy MTV videos. <br /> <br /> Now I am going to switch to Netflix "The Howling".
