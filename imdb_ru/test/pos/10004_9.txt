I saw this movie on September 1, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges at the Hartland Film Festival, who shows films for the “Truly Moving Image” prize. A truly moving picture "... explores the journey of a person, artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values ​​of life." Heartland gave this award to this film. <br /> <br /> This is a story about golf in the early 20th century. At that time it was a game of upper class and rich "gentlemen", and working people could participate only if they were nomads in country clubs. Against this background, a story based on real events unfolds with a young guy from the working class who takes on the role of a golfer and the greatest golfer in the world, Harry Vardon. <br /> <br /> And the story is inspiring. Despite everything, Francis Uymet (played by Shea LaBeouf from “Hole”) wins against the greatest golfers in the USA and Great Britain at the 1913 US Open. Francis is ill prepared and has a child for caddies. (Cuddy is cheerful and motivational and steals every scene in which he appears.) Despite these shortcomings, Francis shows courage, spirit, heroism and humility at this world-class event. <br /> <br /> And we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the arrangement of short holes, a manual scoreboard, golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, terrible conditions of greenery and fairways, and the game is not canceled even in torrential rain. <br /> <br /> This film has amazing cinematography, art direction and editing. And without big movie stars, the story becomes more believable. <br /> <br /> This adds to the list of great sports films in the spirit of “Miracle” and “Remember the Titans”. <br /> For your information - there is the website of Truly Moving Pictures, where there is a list of past winners over 70 years old.
