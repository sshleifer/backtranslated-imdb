This, unfortunately, a little-known film ..... I say "unfortunately", because it relates to the "classics" of the American silent screen! <br /> <br /> This is the legend of the “ghost chariot” that travels around the world, collecting the souls of the dead. Legend has it that the last person killed on New Year's Eve was sentenced to driving a chariot for the next whole year. <br /> <br /> This is reminiscent of the sequence “The Ghost of the Future, which is still to come” The famous “Christmas Carol” by Dicken. <br /> <br /> The effects of the dual effects of ghosts (especially when they interact with “live” people) are EXCELLENT! <br /> <br /> If you like silent films, you MUST see THIS; it "slay you"! <br /> <br /> Norm Vogel <br /> <br /> Heaven old movie Norma http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html
