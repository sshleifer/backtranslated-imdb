Haha, what a great little movie! Wayne Crawford delivers a new blow, or rather, it was his first big blow, an insanely interesting small ball of manic energy disguised as a film about a psycho-killer. This is actually ** a brilliant ** satire on American culture after the hippies on the overpass, although the film was shot in Miami independently. It doesn't lend itself to any studio-oriented or plot-oriented device that I can think of: SOMETIMES TETRA MARCH MAKES HORRIBLE THINGS, maybe it's not a very skilful film, but it's a great little piece of Americana made cheaply by people who were honest, ambitious, creative and had balls of steel. To create this film, it took courage, courage and cunning, which, oddly enough, stood the test of time. This film is fresh, lively, lively, unforgettable and strangely enough charming to recommend it to anyone who has a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I dug it out last year when I was fascinated by the “star” Wayne Crawford (here he is called under the pseudonym of Scott Lawrence), the maestro, which can only be called regional filmmaking, usually class B grade. He is a writer, producer, director and actor in one person, probably the most famous thanks to the apocalyptic favorite of the 80s teenager "THE NIGHT OF COMETS". Here he plays Stanley, pants, wearing half a pair of truly amazing characters, obviously homosexual killers of fun on the run, knocking down an old woman in Baltimore for her decorations. The plain screen legend Abe Zwick is completely convincing, like Paul, who pretends to be Aunt Stanley Martha, dressing up in the brains of an attire that made Stanley think that he committed a murder to secure his loyalty. Martha looks as feminine as the sailors from the supporting choir of SOUTHERN PACIFIC in her coconut bikini tops, but for some reason no one seems to notice - or does she care? - that he is he, he has no visible means of earning, he seems to be spending all day worrying about where Stanley is, and is fussing next door in his dressing gown, carrying a butcher’s knife. Only in America ... When the film opens, they have just arrived in Florida and settled in Ward Cleaver’s old house, a brightly lit and designed television house that is so cliché to be surreal. During one unforgettable scene, Martha and an unwelcome guest at home are sitting on the couch, discussing the problems and drinking Budweiser cans in one of the most fascinating, disruptively usual series I've ever seen outside of the John Waters film. In addition, there is Stanley, who always has problems, as he is a hippie with a mop, who has an STP bandage on his vest, who drives a psychedelic painted wagon, as thin as a Batmobile, drinks milk right out of the box, sniffs drugs light bombs bombs. and puts donuts in an old cigar box for a quick snack. I believe opposites attract. <br /> <br /> But Stanley also doesn’t like it when young ladies whom he throws stones at are trying to take off his pants, and it seems Aunt Martha should always get him out of trouble, which inevitably leads. The bodies pile up, a curious addict blackmails them to use their home as a flop, Stanley's birthday cake is crushed, and everyone meets at the local pizza shop before going to the backyard shed to have a hookah party where the girls dance in underwear. Everything gets out of control when one of the neighbors tries to get a little closer to Martha, who naturally prefers to keep people at arm's length when they rudely invite themselves to a pleasant conversation. And this is a woman who carries not only a butcher's knife, but also a charged .38. In the end, the strange duo is stuck with the body, the child, and he has nowhere to go, and eventually he finds refuge in an abandoned film studio, where, without a doubt, the technical team lent the equipment used to create the film. I just hope that they first politely asked for permission and cleaned up after themselves. <br /> <br /> Of course, you need to say a few words about the Stanley and Martha / Paul relationship, because they dance around the fact that they at least assume that being a homosexual couple would mean missing the main point of the plot. We never see that they both become close, and even though Stanley mockingly refers to the fact that in one scene they are “ballads,” their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual. This, of course, is not a “gay” film, with abundant female nudity and a kind of misogyny of the 70s, which also cannot be denied. Stanley and Paul never showed their intended sexuality on screen, although the film would certainly have the courage to do it if it were important. This is not so, the story is not about their sex, but about the connection they share, and how strange it is. Not that they are gay, but that they are special people, who are the two strangest filmmakers ever lived on my TV. <br /> <br /> This film is unique. It was done for just a few thousand dollars for what looks like borrowed studio sets, odd jobs for locating and for a couple of public places that they were able to penetrate the film crew when no one was watching. The dialogue is completely strange, ordinary and delightfully esoteric. This is a film that will surprise you, not everyone will like it, but for those who love low-budget American horror films / thrillers, such as THE NIGHT GOD SCREAMED, HELP ME! I HAVE LOST, BLOOD AND LACE, AND CHILDREN SHOULD NOT PLAY WITH THE DEAD THINGS, you have a winner here. <br /> <br /> 8/10: I would usually say something like “DVD restoration deserves,” but I think it would spoil the film’s tasteless atmosphere. And Wayne Crawford, you rule, sir.
