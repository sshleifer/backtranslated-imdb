It was a good movie. He had an interesting storyline that was performed quite well in the later part of the film. The plot reminded me of the City of God. But this is done in a more pleasant way. It was what I really loved: a touch of surrealism. A bit of interesting cinema (through a wooden camera). I'm not sure that this is culturally correct, but it definitely broadens your view of South Africa. The actors were good (for newbies, most of them anyway), I especially liked Estelle's character, which made this film quite enjoyable. What is interesting is that it makes you ask about your own life. Do you really do what you really love? Or do you agree with the norm, convention around you. Definitely worth a look.
