Quite a lot has been said about this film and its importance in shaping the language of the film. If you are interested in the history of cinema, in order to truly understand the innovations that Eisenstein brings to the environment, you can try to watch Potemkin along with most of the films made before (D.V. Griffith films offer a good contrast). It should be assumed that Eisenstein was not the only editing theorist, and the principles of editing editing would probably have been revealed to other given times. However, even today, few directors have approached the skill with which Eisenstein created meaning using a combination of images at such an early stage in the evolution of the environment. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in this kind of way, Potemkin still remains one of the most beautiful and touching films in history. You should see it, buy it, and tattoo it on your chest.
