The intellectual drama of the gnawing nail arose from nowhere in 1979 and was soon on the cover of every newspaper in America (when life imitated the film). The chief of a nuclear power plant in Southern California is threatened when he decides to make public the real history of the accident at the plant. The allegedly stuck valve problem, the film of a television crew shows that it was an accident bordering on a catastrophic scale, and, even worse, the security conditions are washed out to save millions of dollars, a cover-up that puts everyone at risk. The movie sometimes becomes too technical (especially in the second half) and can use more human interaction, however the performances of Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda (as a journalist in the right place at the right time), and Michael Douglas (as a freelance operator) are great. Instant nuances involving nuclear demonstrators are both completely accurate and bitter-satirical, and the news business (with its corporate structure and helpless “yes-people”) is brightly captured. *** 1/2 of ****
