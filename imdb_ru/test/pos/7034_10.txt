I've been waiting to see this movie for ages, and I finally! As soon as I heard the title, I realized that this film would become my favorite film, and when I saw it, trust me, I was not disappointed! <br /> <br /> This movie had everything you need for dance, love and Patrick Swayze! There were so many things in it, and he dealt with important issues (which were at that time in the 1960s), such as abortion. <br /> <br /> The dances in this film were fantastic, as was the acting skills! Swayze was great, like Gray! <br /> <br /> Although this film was fantastic, you can’t say you saw it if you didn’t see the last scene. It really is breathtaking, because the whole choreography of the last dance was brilliantly done, at the end of the movie you were dancing, and it wouldn’t surprise me if it affected people to start dancing! <br /> <br /> In general, “Dirty Dancing” is a film not to be missed, and even if half of the actors are in: “Where are they now?” period, the actors will always have this great film in their careers!
