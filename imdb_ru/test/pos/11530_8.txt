This is the year 1969. Phoebe (Camilla Belle) is an 11-year-old girl who grew up with the idealized vision of her 19-year-old sister Faith (Cameron Diaz). Faith is a doer seeking the truth, correcting all the mistakes in the world. Then one day Phoebe and her mother Gale (Blythe Danner) received a message that Vera was dead. Vera killed herself. Both Phoebe and Gale are stunned by this news, and although saddened, Gale is grieving. Phoebe can't let go. Phoebe decides to go to Europe and find out what happened. <br /> <br /> Now is 1977. Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) is 18 years old and she decides to go to Europe because of her mother’s objections to find out the truth. Being alive, Vera was inseparable from the person she called "The Wolf" (Christopher Eccleston). Although Wolf claimed that he knew nothing about Faith’s last days, Phoebe convinced him to tell her everything. For several days, Wolf realizes that he also did not let go of the past, and he joins Phoebe on her pilgrimage to Portugal. <br /> <br /> In the end, Wolf can talk about decent Faith in drug abuse and his own fault that he does not prevent suicide. Although Phoebe is angry, in the end she understands how human and fragile Faith was. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. I am old enough to remember the robberies of the banks of the Red Army, and I was 10 in 1969. This story was familiar ground for me. I still remember young people who were trying to decide whether they should go to Canada or not to avoid drafts. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but it probably happened several times in real life in that period. Camille Belle was pleased and fun to watch as she portrayed a young adorable sister excited by what was happening around her. Jordana Brewster easily moved to the role of the elder Phoebe. Blythe Danner was always a supportive mother, a role with which she, unfortunately, is too well known on American television. I would like to see her with stronger material for work. Cameron Diaz played an immature anarchist well. Although at times her performance as an activist in the 1960s seemed to come out of the news feed. Of all the characters, it was the wolf of Christopher Eccleston, who achieved the greatest growth. When we get acquainted with the character at the beginning of the film, we see that he is a worldly person. He is a patient and kind man, full of anger at injustice in the world. In the end, he realizes that the direction in which he and Faith are moving is wrong, and begins to “grow up”, deciding that he should fight injustice in his own way. Faith refuses to join him in this, and this ultimately leads to her death. Wolf Eccleston - the most real of all the characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It was nice and compelling to think. The Invisible Circus has a TV-MA rating, but there are very few curses, sex or violence in it. The subject of the film is the reason for the rating.
