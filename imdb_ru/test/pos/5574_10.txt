After two years of using this site for movie reviews, I finally signed up with IMDB to give Farscape a "10". Script writers, actors and film crews of the show have established themselves as unequivocal masters of the science fiction genre. Even those who usually do not appreciate science fiction should be encouraged to give this exceptional series a chance! <br /> <br /> The virtues of Farscape are simply too numerous to list, but one of them stands out above all; The quality of writing is amazing. I have not heard such a good dialogue after "Blake 7." In fact, Farscape resembles the "Blake Seven" with good special effects and a bit more romance. <br /> <br /> Enjoy it, everyone!
