The mystery and its solution was a great vanity. I have a few questions, maybe I did not pay enough attention. <br /> <br /> Who killed the neighbor and why? Who killed the surrogate girl and why? <br /> <br /> And some minor controversy, they had to show a stop at the hotel for the switch. Not that they had to show the switch, but they had to show that Jim and the girl go to the hotel, Jim goes to the bathroom, comes out and the bartender tells him that his girlfriend went to the car without him. <Br /> <br /> Then Jim gets into the car and sees a sleeping woman and a little girl in the back seat. <br /> <br /> This would give the viewer a sports chance to figure out a solution. <br /> <br /> I would like to tape this, I would like to see it again.
