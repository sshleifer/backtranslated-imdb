It was really one of the most enjoyable events that I saw on TV. He's just an incredible performer. His personality shines through in each of the songs he makes. I would really like this disc to be available as an uncut DVD so that I can watch it again and again without an obvious language. I did not have the opportunity to see him live, but this is what I really want to do now. I can not forget his spare singers. They really added a lot of content and humor to the show. With their marching style and vibrant dance moves, they truly complement Danâ€™s real talent. I would like to have a few more songs on his live CD, which is also incredible. Nice to see someone like him. Just incredibly personable and real, I really can't say enough good words about Dan and this show. Once again, I would just like it to be available as an uncut DVD.
