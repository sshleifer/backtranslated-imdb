This young director has a talent for quickly capturing his audience through unusual camera work and rare but intense scenarios. The idea of ​​combining animation with live frames is surprisingly well executed, and the soundtrack is very good. <br /> <br /> The decision to release a film of twelve parts online challenges the director to make each episode exciting enough for the viewer to invest in the purchase of each next episode. I just wish all movies had such an obligation to keep their viewers throughout their history. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
