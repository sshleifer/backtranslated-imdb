Thriller is great. This is a long video, but, nevertheless, just brilliant. The song itself ... great ... add Michael Jackson's dance, and you will have a beautiful phenomenon. Of all the videos I've ever seen, this is the best. If you havenâ€™t seen the video yet, then I call you ... <br /> <br /> The special effects are striking for their time ... everything from turning a weared wolf to the idea that these creepy zombies are slowly rising from their grave are great. .. frighteningly great. Vicente Price has its own line of quivering bones ... simply known as rap. Ola Ray copes well with the role of the girl Michael, and Michael Jackson himself ... dancing and singing (although not during the video itself) have no equal ... <br /> <br /> 10/10.
