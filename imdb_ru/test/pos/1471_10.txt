Well, I saw it yesterday, and it was much better than the other VH1, too bad than this one, it is rather outdated, but you can see all the staff that make South Park very interesting things. <br /> It’s also funnier than this documentary depicting Trey and Matt as selfish creators of greedy snobs who don’t work and spend all the time having fun or relaxing (which is rather ironic because show). <br /> <br /> It also shows the whole process of animation for creating an episode with a southern park, interviews with actors, voices of characters, and much more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of South Park, I’m very happy to recommend it to you.
