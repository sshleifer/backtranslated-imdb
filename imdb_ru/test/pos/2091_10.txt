When the bomber, patricide, pornographer and mad biker, along with various other forms of social scum, had enough of their infected cells, they would notice something was wrong and look for a hole. Coming out of the sewers with a group of 9 souls, take advantage of their new-found freedom and go to civilization. What follows soon is not surprising. Complete chaos and horror follow them. It seems that everyone has some unfinished business. <br /> <br /> Based on the “Great Escape” 9 “SHOWER” entered the top 5 best films that I saw this year. Running about 2 hours. 9 SOULS will give you such a powerful story that they will literally hold you breathless. The beautiful but elusive use of rolling hills adds to the realism that is expected from this story. The vision of director Toshiaki Toyoda (blue spring, porn star) is completely incredible, as he realizes the feeling of pity for the characters. As soon as each character realizes his dream, he is as fast as he is divorced from them. Now all responsibility for the success of this film should not fall solely on the shoulders of the director, but the props should also go to the actors. This film was full of superb game from top to bottom. Ryuhei Matsuda (son of Miyuki Matsuda of Audition) shows a stellar performance and appears to be displaying some of his mothers. <br /> <br /> I also have to give props on the Artsmagic DVD. This is their sixth film that I saw now, and they seem to be getting better and better with each DVD. The sound quality is excellent and the picture; clean and fresh. It is very annoying to try to watch a movie that is too dark in the program, so drives with these cats are good. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this film will soon receive masterpiece status from viewers all over the world. In 2005, watch out for 9 SOULS; This is really a terrific movie.
