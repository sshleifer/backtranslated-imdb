This film really proves that the world is too often unfair, especially the world of cinema. The “task” almost didn’t attract attention after its release and didn’t come as a surprise in the box office, but when the story is written, this film will surely get a long lost praise. <br /> <br /> Thank God, I am ”I am surrounded by friends who know what is good for me. Being a movie lover like me, my friend highly recommended “The Assignment,” a movie I hadn’t even heard of. I decided to check what Leonard Maltin gave, and it is not surprising that he gave it ** 1/2. Knowing that this is the same class that he gave to classics such as Alien, Ordinary Suspects and The Matrix (I'm not joking), I knew that its meaning did not mean dull squat. Therefore, without thinking, I went out and bought it on DVD. It was about 3 years ago, and the film is still one of my proudest things in my DVD collection, despite the cover design that echoes the low-budget stink with Casper Van Dien. <br /> <br /> “The Task” is the mastery of the director, delivering really intense moments that will keep you on the edge of your place throughout the film, besides, he can sometimes boast of a brilliant story, which, as you know, will be riddled with unexpected turns. He plays Aidan Quinn in one of his best performances and gives him great support from Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley, who are both in great shape. <br /> <br /> Something like 40 out of 42 user comments like this movie, most of them can't praise it enough. So what are you waiting for? If you call yourself a fan of militants, you had to buy it, rent it, watch YESTERDAY!
