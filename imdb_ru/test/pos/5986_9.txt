I would not compare it with “Le Placard”, in which IMHO there were more comic moments, but Romuald and Juliet, being a slow starter, surely kept your attention throughout the entire film, walking beautifully and reaching a heartbreaking conclusion :) There were many wonderful comedy moments Some brilliant pathos and realistic situation that is played by all the actors. <br /> <br /> It was a typical French film, in which, despite prejudices and phobias, the viewer faced his own shortcomings! I am definitely pleased to have it in my library, and I will certainly watch it again and again, which for me is a sign of a great movie.
