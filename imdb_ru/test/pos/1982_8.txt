eXistenZ was a good movie, at first I wondered what was going on, organic “pods” made from mutant reptiles that connected you and other players to a surrealistic virtual reality game through the umbilical cord, well, it seems a bit strange. <br /> <br /> But as soon as it comes out, his pretty good movie, with a few twists and turns with a magnificent open ending and a good aspect of inertia throughout the entire movie, will also be interesting because you are not sure what will happen next. <br /> Security personnel emit metal detectors; they have bone weapons!
