This film appeared on channel 13 in the 1990s, when they filmed a comedy from Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, to the “Merry Fat Cop” melody, they had a montage of scenes from films to present a series of laughing people, including one of Gary Cooper, who was mumbling while watching a movie in a movie theater - a sequence of this film. <br /> <br /> It all starts quite innocently when Cooper, a millionaire, goes to a trendy department store in France to buy pajamas. But he only likes to sleep in the tops. The clerk (Tyler Brooke) insists that he cannot sell half a pair of pajamas as Cooper wants. Claudette Colbert hears the argument and offers to help - she only likes to sleep in her pajama pants. What if Brooke sells them every half? Brooke never had such an offer, so he goes to the floor (Rolfe Sedan) and asks him if this can be done. He is also concerned - the request is completely unconventional. In the end, they contact the store owner (Charles Halton). Halton lies in bed and crawls out - his slim figure only supports a pajama top (if it's long enough for censorship). Can they sell one set of pajamas (half for each) to two customers? Horrified, Hulton replies: “No, of course not! This is communism !! ” So the sale is prohibited. Obviously, no one thinks that Cooper could buy the whole pair and sell half to Colbert. <br /> <br /> MAGIC WIFE Lubicz had a reputation of being missing, most viewers didn’t like it because of incorrect reading of Colbert’s character. She looks pretty hired toward Cooper — she sells herself to him on her own terms. <br /> <br /> In fact, Cooper's character is more disgusting, as he is rich and believes that everything has a price. He is right in most cases. Look at how the aristocratic beggar of Colbert's father, Edward Everett Horton, regards his new son-in-law as a golden goose, which he can use. Cooper's willingness to marry Colbertt somehow or other involves an agreement that if he hesitates or decides not to marry her, he must pay damages. Horton, when he realizes this, pulls out his watch and (in the most encouraging voice) says to Cooper: “Take your time, my boy!” To come to a decision. Later we see that Horton’s wardrobe has become more modern and elegant. <br /> <br /> The film, which was written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, compares well with their script for Midnight Mitchell Leysin (also with Colbert, but with Don A. John Barrymore) There Colbert wants to sell himself for a money marriage with (Francis Lederer), but this is complicated by a fake marriage with Amechey. She really loves Amecha (a taxi driver), but in an unexpectedly realistic moment she explains to him that her parents got married “for the love”, but poverty made them hate each other. This is not in BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE, where Colbert does not have such a background (she is, after all, the daughter of the Marquis). Her mercenary plan is to teach Cooper a lesson about his standards. <br /> <br /> The film has the wonderful work of the support staff, including Herman Bing as a private eye, which, as it turned out, hides what Colbert discovers. and young David Niven, who has many points of choice as a stand for the pear and as a finished ear for Cooper. Coop tells Nivena about her problems with Colbert and how she is so frantic. Niven listens with respect. In the end, Cooper is touched by his willingness to hear what he wanted to say. "Albert, how much am I crying to you?" Cooper asks. Niven thinks and says: "Thirty-five francs a week, sir." Cooper looks deep into his soul and says (shaking his head): "It is fair!"
