I finally got a great Sazuma DVD of this film, which is loaded with interesting additions. I read a lot about it and, unfortunately, I missed it at the Stockholm Film Festival. This is not exactly the way I thought, but still worth seeing if you like weird and unique movies. I rather watch it again than any of the recent so-called horror films that have been torn out of Hollywood these days. What distracts me from the experience are some musical signals that sound outdated and depend too much on cheap synth sounds. For me, all these tonal / harmonic elements of the score could be removed and replaced with David Christian's excellent sound design. But this is just my opinion. Otherwise, it is a bold, wicked picture with desirable meditative and poetic parts, similar to the disappearance of a beautiful sequence of photographs. I look forward to seeing Ascension, and I applaud Mitch and Karim for their efforts to create a non-core movie. They are very inspiring to me, as I will soon begin my own production of short films.
