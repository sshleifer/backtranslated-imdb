Mix of aliens and ghostbusters? <br /> <br /> Begins very promising, and then slows down to almost boring. <br /> <br /> LifeForce contains several amazing special effects that they were able to create in the mid-80s. The story is intriguing, but in the end it is not at all brilliant. It has been rated R due to nudity, sex and blood. The ethereal and wild (naked) beauty of Matilda May is very evident throughout the entire film. A strange film and cost much by the time it was made. <br /> <br /> It could have been a larger classic with a better scenario, but unfortunately it was not a very good hit, I think that in fact it fell pretty badly. <br /> <br /> So, something went wrong with that, but still, it's very interesting.
