In addition to the disco scenes that personify the oscillating sixties (especially when everyone is dancing to the instrumental versions of the Monkees hits), I am surprised at how well this light farce stands 37 years later, but in fact this is due to the rapid performance of his deception - the plot and the sharp interaction of three leashes. This 1969 comedy, directed by expert director Jean Sachs, an outstanding director, tells about Julian Winston, a successful Manhattan dentist and a proven bachelor who pretends to be married to avoid long-term commitments with his young girlfriend during the year Tony. In response to an indecisive suicide attempt, Tony Julian agrees to marry her, but Tony first insists on meeting his wife to relieve her conscience. Enter Julian Stephanie's dedicated nurse to play a wife, and the inevitable complications are accompanied by a white lie, turning into major thorns that lead to supposed connections and disengagement. <br /> <br /> Like Julian, the relaxed Walter Mattau deftly plays a deceptive dentist in his typically sardonic manner, but he allows two of his female colleagues to get away with the picture. In her big-screen debut, the naughty 24-year-old Goldie Hawn still retains her funny "Laugh-In" person, but provides unexpected wit and depth like Tony. He and Mattau have wonderful unrealized chemistry in their scenes together. The screen legend Ingrid Bergman, still serenely reigning at the age of 54, obviously plays with Stephanie, originally passionate and quick-witted, but as the plot develops, it turns into a liberated spirit. I especially like how at ease she appears after her nightly fuss. There is good support work from Rick Lenz as the bohemian neighbor Tony Igor and Jack Weston as a clever actor Julian, Harvey's buddy. Longtime employee Billy Wilder, I.A. Diamond, provides a sparkling screenplay and reveals a story outside of its limited scene of origin for Sachs, who is not the most cinematic of directors. Aside from a pair of trailers, there are no significant additions from the DVD.
