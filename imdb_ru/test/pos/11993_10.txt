One of the most interesting things is that this 1988 film is widely advertised as a continuation of “in title only”. There is nothing wrong with this except this: the return of Chevy Chase as Tai Webb. This connects the viewer with this character (from the original Caddyshack in 1980) and makes fans think or wish for the Caddyshack II to look like the first one. <br /> <br /> Rumor has it that Rodney Dangerfield should have returned, he carried most of the first movie, so his return would put Caddyshack 2 in first place. Jackie Mason is the “new” Rodney in this film, and he does a good job with his work, even though their comic films are very different. Dan Aykroyd was great, but not enough in the film. He should have been involved in the tune of how much time on the screen Bill Murray got in the first. Robert Stack (Airplane!) Was good in the “new” role of Ted Knight / Willian. (We miss you, Ted!) Danny Noonan was supposed to be back. So many others could come back to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. The bush should not have undergone a total restructuring. Instead, the characters involved, and not the club itself, should have been the center of attention, as in the first one. When you watch this movie, keep in mind that this is not the main sequel, and you might think that this is another good or bad comedy of the eighties. Fans of the first should see it, but not shocked when the comparison between the original and part II is so far apart.
