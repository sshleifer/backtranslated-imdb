“Opera” is one of the greatest achievements in the horror genre. In this masterful picture there is everything that should be in a pure horror film: a good, exciting story, lots of characters, beautiful visual effects and lots of blood. The killings are very shocking and bloody. Unforgettable atmosphere of fear and fear. Be sure to look for a real Argento fan, so if you have a chance, watch it.
