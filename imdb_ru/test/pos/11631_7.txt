I was a little surprised to see all the hate comments here. Of course, this is not the best show for children, but don't people stop contempt for Barney after the fifth grade? <br /> <br /> Okay, everyone hates Barney. Well, I think his voice and songs are annoying. Well, he's a bit creepy and weird. I am fourteen years old, so I know quite well. But that's the thing. Children? They love this show. <br /> <br /> When I was a small child of two or three years old, my parents spent more time chasing me around the house than they were doing something else. Nothing could hold my attention for more than ten minutes. Let's face it, that's how kids are. Even the most patient cannot sit still long enough to give their parents a rest. Too much to see and explore, too many problems to get into. <br /> <br /> And then Barney came. I donâ€™t know exactly what kind of purple dinosaur that is so funny for kids, but they surely love it. I know what I did. I got carried away with the show and wanted to watch it again and again. Yes, the songs kinda drove my parents crazy, but being able to observe how their children learn and are inspired by what can truly hold their attention is worth it. I learned the alphabet and 123, magic words and tooth brushing. Of course, I grew up five or six, but by this time I was a little more patient and gave a break to my parents. <br /> <br /> My nieces and nephews went through the whole scene Barney is growing up, to the delight of their mother. I know what keeps Barney on the air. He entertains. Of course there is the Big Bird, Ernie and Oscar, and they are great too. But at the baby stage, it seems that more and more children prefer the big singing dinosaur. And this is enough for me.
