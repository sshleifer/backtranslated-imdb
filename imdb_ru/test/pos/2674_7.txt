As for the Christian film, this is typical. Lack of megabudget that they are trying their best. Sometimes fails, sometimes hitting the target. This almost hit, great acting game can only carry a movie. Association H.P. Lovecraft and Frank Peretti were a good idea. All that is needed is the best background and the best character development to make it a great movie. The visual effects are not so bad, and cleverly holding the demons until the last few minutes helped keep the tension at a good pace. One could use a better ending, though. Not a bad premise that terrorist experiments go wrong. Much better than the usual Hollywood attitude to the demonic kingdom. Perhaps someone will finally make “True Darkness” like a movie.
