The glitter of this story delivers at least one cleverly crafted message to every viewer in the audience. This story is about success, about failure. It's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you. The story deals with self-realization and decisiveness on such a large scale that the angle of view of the camera cannot cover it. Within the reach of each scene is an element marked for the image in your imagination. Keep this in mind when watching a movie; it's more than just sweetie. Sexually suggestive, rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract and entertain you during the tedious process of character development.
