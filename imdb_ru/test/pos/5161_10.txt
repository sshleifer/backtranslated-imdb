There is no plot. There are no central characters. There are no moving cameras or close-ups. In fact, this film does not follow any of the traditional storytelling techniques used in the main film. However, Du Levande by Roy Andersson is a remarkable piece of cinematic narration. This is a touching look at the human psyche. <br /> <br /> Composed of a series of vignettes, Roy Andersson gives us a deep understanding of what makes us all human. In perfectly photographed static frames, supplemented by perfectly harmonious, but fanciful music, Roy introduces us to the many characters who lead everyday life. Some border on the tragic, others cheerful, we go on a trip to Scandinavia, like no other. <br /> <br /> This is a trip to the little things that make us human. Instead of excessive storytelling or visual techniques, everything is minimized, so our only focus is on the characters themselves. It focuses on the insignificant moments of our lives that make us who we are; our dreams, our despair. It is through this simple observation of others that we can accept who we are as individuals. <br /> <br /> The blurred colors and deadly pale makeup of the characters only emphasize their individual stories and remind us that unlike them, We are all alive. In this film there is no happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel, but you leave the cinema with a sense of life. Much more accessible than his earlier film “Songs from the Second Floor,” “Du Levandé,” is a truly inspiring film piece.
