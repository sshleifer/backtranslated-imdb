This film recreates the historic flight of Lindberg across the Atlantic, affecting the episodes of his aviation career through memories. Stewart was about 20 years old to play with a young pilot, but his excellent characteristics, especially on solo flights, make this a minor controversy. An inspiring Waxman score is a big plus. Despite the long hours of work, Wilder manages to make it quite exciting and able to withstand the drama, even if the result is known. What was the year 1957 for Wilder: besides, he also wrote and staged “Love in the Afternoon” and “Witness of the Prosecution” And his next two were "Some Like it Hot" and "The Apartment". What a run!
