It was the first directorial work of Sebastian Gutierrez, the author of "Snakes on an airplane" and "Gothic". Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I love capers, and that was stupid. Abduction and execution of women in the process. The FBI has Emma Thompson in the abduction case, and the police chief (Roscoe Lee Brown) instructs Alan Rickman to uncover the murder that happens to the senator's wife (Hal Holbrook). These two make an outstanding pair when they work together. <br /> <br /> The kidnappers / murderers have lovers Simon Baker (Land of the Dead) and a very hot Karla Gugino (City of Sins) along with a couple of partners. They stole a hot computer mogul and checked his accountant throughout the city until they got the dough. From this point on, things are going fast when new turns appear. All this is brilliant and definitely "piss in your pants, because you can't go to the bathroom or miss something." Trembling. <br /> <Now, to be honest, I would give this film 10, if there were more films in the opening that the guard watched. I would really like to see more of the hot springs of Beverly and Yvette Lera, but, hey, this was not part of the capers; just icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Thompson and Rickman must make more films together. It's a pleasure: <br /> <br /> Agent Hawkins: So write to me. Detective Friedman: This remark may be misinterpreted as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's get out of the way then: you have never worked under the leadership of a boss before. I got to where I am, pushing paper and playing well â€” I had never shot a gun before, I only did this job to prove to my father that I was not a coward. I uphold a decent head, so I was promoted to all worthy candidates, all men equally gifted with fellatio, but I had to fill in the sex quota. I am also stupid and idealistic; you are hard and cynical, and usually right. I'm secretly in love with you, but it's hard for me to show it. Did I miss something? <br /> <br /> Damn, this is a great dialogue! Gutierrez not only manages a great movie, but also knows how to write! <br /> <br /> Did I say that Carla Gugino was hot? <br /> <br /> Put this on your list.
