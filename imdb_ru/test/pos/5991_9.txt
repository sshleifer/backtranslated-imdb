This film is hard to find! This is the story of Juliet, a completely ordinary cleaning woman who works in the big corporate office of the yogurt company, and Romuald, the president of the same one. He does not notice her, he does not notice anyone, while several conspiracies to wrest his company from him have not suffered at the same time. He is lost, he has no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers Juliet. As a cleaning lady, no one pays any attention to her, so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to grasp and use her to help her helpless and unhappy boss. Complications are wild, she is not as ordinary as it seems, with five children from five different ex-husbands who still madly love her, and he is not as astute as he thinks. This film does not follow a predictable path, and this is what makes you look. The game is great and there are some very exciting moments on this path. The working class looks more savvy than above them, almost as much as Gosford Park has shown that the upper crust is not all that it comes up with to be mentally. I highly recommend this movie. See it! 9/10
