I first saw it as a child (LITTLE SPELL first appeared on television that year when I was born) and quite recently bought it on DVD. In the interim, I watched it when it was turned on and made careful notes in 1) the battle with the cakes itself and 2) how racist some of these parts were: Farina as a Nubian slave, for example, a voodoo. I think Roach and McGowan would be beaten to death if they tried to do it now. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to how the battles on the cakes look like in the “Holiday of the halves” and in the “Sweet cake and pie”. this one ... and this movie came out a few years before their original contract with Harry Kon at Columbia Pictures. Obviously, these films inspired SS and Laurel & Hardy "Battle of the Century" ... remember, at that time they stole everything from the best ones, each other !!! <br /> <br /> One more note: Laurel & Hardy lovers, this bakery saleswoman, was none other than Dorothy Coburn, who also appeared in TBOTC - “bang”, getting into her car and getting it in the back. . It always eludes me, why is she never credited?
