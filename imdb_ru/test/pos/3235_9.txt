Do not watch this film, waiting for the wit of Jane Austen, a clear dialogue or clever social comments. This time the room of Northanger Abbey was renewed very sensually! <br /> <br /> In this version, Catherine's erotic dreams are not just stupid fantasies, but a connection with the world of adult sexuality, in which she just peers into her daytime adventures. She is very primitive and modest in the afternoon, and her owen Henry treats her with utmost politeness. But when her own sexual nature awakens, her dreams subtly change from soft to paired and to crazy! <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this story, Katherine’s vision of sex is based solely on the Gothic novels she devours in bed. It is amazing, sexy and defiant to see how her dreamy picture of handsome Henry "dissolves" in the grim dream of being carried away and raped by romantic villains! At the same time, it is strange and touching to go to bed again in the morning - Katherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent that no one even realizes what is really happening in this cute little head! <br /> <br /> Later, after inviting Henry to the castle, Catherine overhears a family dispute and does not understand its meaning at all. Jumping into bed, she covers herself with sheets and lies awake, listening fearfully, her startling blue eyes - the only visible sign that she is on guard. Little by little, however, these beautiful blue eyes fall and close when she sinks into another hot dream of innocent desire. This time, Katherine dreams of her being in Elizabethan times, awaiting with horror the approach of "bandit" outside the castle! Obviously, she is more excited than scared by the idea of ​​being carried away by bandits. She almost shudders with excitement and anticipation! But then, after she desperately ran away to escape, we returned to the world of daylight, where a maid scolded her for ruining her room before plunging into a deep sleep. It is worth noting that Katherine's heavy yawns in the morning light are in themselves a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams were! <br /> <br /> In the end, of course, Katherine Henry’s stern and unimaginable lover divines the nature of her fantasies and gives her a strict lecture. Interestingly, the immediate fall of Katherine in tears symbolizes not retreat, but advancement in adult relationships. In the next scene, she burns her gothic romance with tears and rushes to the bed in disgrace and sobbing. It is noteworthy that this turning point is also marked by the fact that Catherine fell into a deep sleep, except that this time there are no dreams of passion. Presumably, Katherine matured enough to be ready for real things. <br /> <br /> Although Katherine Schlesinger has beautiful blue eyes and a lively expression, and all her performances are adorable, I must say that outside of the hot sequence of dreams, this adaptation of the film is painfully boring. I give him 9 stars just because a truly romantic one can enjoy it just at the level of dreams. <br /> <br /> If you want to read a book about a really strong-willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and in a real Gothic setting, I highly recommend Elizabeth Marie Pope THE PERILOUS GARD.
