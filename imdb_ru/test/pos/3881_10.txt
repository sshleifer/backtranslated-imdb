For those who like to think of themselves as sensible people who love movies, pay attention to details and enjoy indie films with funny, cleverly written dialogues, then this film is for you. <br /> <br /> For those who have poor concentration, high expectations and no brains .. well .. hmm ... you may be bored, and from time to time something prevents you. <br /> <br /> This is a charming, modest and well-paced movie with actors giving a real sense of the depth and warmth of their roles. I laughed to myself almost the whole way. <br /> <br /> This film is a little pearl.
