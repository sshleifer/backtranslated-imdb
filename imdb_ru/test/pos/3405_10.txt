I was 13 years old when this mini-series (and its sequel, North and South, Book II) first aired. I was already fascinated by stories about personal interest in our civil war in and around America, and this is what interested me in watching this program for television. <br /> <br /> I really liked her. And now I'm 29 years old, and I only love it more. It is full of history, beautiful costumes, real characters, woven into the life of fictional characters that you care about. There is intrigue, love, loyalty, betrayal, family, big family, lust, battle, victory, defeat and reconstruction. <br /> <br /> In spite of the fact that I had a full set of tape episodes that I recorded when he originally went on air, I purchased the full set of N & S and N & S II at Columbia House a few years ago, when they became available. Every few years, I take whole weekends and look through all the games in a row - and Iâ€™m sad when the last episode comes to an end, because I want to keep watching the life stories of these characters. <I can not recommend this mini-series more highly.
