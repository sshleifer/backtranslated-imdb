I stumbled upon this movie by accident. I mean, how else can I find out? This was not promoted by the studios, and I had not even heard that this was a release from my usually connected friends. After I spent my money on many bad movies this year, I would like to see it in theaters, not on DVD. Mike Judge is a master of disguising delightfully clever humor in a low brow package. Just watch the “King of the Mountain” for a while ... this is supposedly humor, but this is a very subtle blow to the goons, but at the same time very sympathetic. I read the slogan of this film and immediately ordered it on the Internet. I really do not understand where these negative reviews come from, except from Carl Jr. This film is not only funny, but also balanced. Moments of frivolity alternate between funny shows and beats in our current superstar / corporate culture. Of course, there is some frightening humor, but they only laugh ironically at him. The premise is only semi-plausible, but since when has it ever mattered? I do not see people mocking Futurama, because the premise is very similar. Just watch this movie. If you're not laughing, then something is wrong with you. Perhaps your father works for Gatorade or something else, and he was very offended by the film. Maybe you're an idiot. Probably the last.
