“Gake no Ue no Ponyo” is a great animated film that brings relief from many soulless lifeless CGI movies. Pastel and colored pencils came as a surprise after Saint-Chihiro-no-Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) and Hauru-no-Ugoku Shiro (Howl's Movable Castle) were so similar stylistically. The style worked well for the film and was done exceptionally well. The time and effort spent on his animation is greatly appreciated, as they give the characters a lot more life, the details and the care they need make the film much better. The film has some great scenes in which there is a lot of movement and action. The biggest thing for me in this scene was that the Ponyo sisters turn into a huge wave, like a fish, while she runs on them. The story is simple, but pretty well written and played out. The plot was focused on the relationship between the characters, and although it was not played out, as in My Neighbor Totoro, it is still great. I felt that each character had a sufficient amount of screen time, unlike Spirited Away, which was so packed with distinctive characters that it could be stretched into a whole series (Spirit of Radish. There was still a whole movie!) My only real problem with the film is the end. The way it is formulated in the English version, at least, gives the impression that Sosuke will be given some kind of a grand test, as a result of which he promises Ponios's mother that he will love Ponyo. Although more thought about it makes me think that translation may not be so accurate to the real meaning in the sense that the test is a promise, and in the depths of the soul he really means it. The film seems to have ended suddenly. Other than that, the film was great and I highly recommend it.
