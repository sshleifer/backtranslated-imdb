It is worth watching even the bad music of Julie Andrews, and it is not bad! Actually it is quite interesting. In fact, this is a fascinating exercise in attempts to manipulate the characters of a star. <br /> <br /> To break the “cool figure of Julie”, she plays the actress of a German spy / English music hall. Subsequently, she continued to shoot her tops in the SOB film. and play a transvestite in Victoria, Victoria and other not so good girls, usually under the direction of her husband, Blake Edward. <br /> <br /> The film is admittedly problematic. It is difficult to feel her character, because she is a German spy. We want to love Julie, but she is on the wrong side of the law. Probably why this movie failed. Julie is like a German spy? Our mary poppins? Our Maria Van Trapp suddenly became a German spy? <br /> <br /> Romance seems to happen suddenly and comes from nowhere. But never mind, this is a musical, and there is Julie in it. Yes, and did I mention that there is a clumsy rock in Hudson too? <br /> <br /> Julie gives a great show, which no lover of musical comedy should miss. Great WW 1 songs and nice Mancini melodies. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are holes in the film in the plot, and sometimes it does not seem logical. For example, why Julie and her uncle were suddenly persecuted by the Germans, when she spied on them a minute ago. <br /> <br /> But on another note, who cares? The musical numbers are fun and exciting. The costumes and decorations are unusually generous. Cinematography is quite up to par. <br /> <br /> It has annoying detective idiots that Blake Edwards puts into all his films. (Yawn) <br /> <br /> But Julia is desperately trying to change her image. (You can imagine dinner with Blake and Julia - Julie: “Blake, we need to change my image.” <br /> <br /> Blake: “I will make you a German spy, then we will remove your clothes in another”). the movie and then play the transvestite in another movie. They will not recognize you. This will be the death of Maria von Trapp. "<br /> <br /> An exciting lesson in changing the image. Beautiful Julie. Lovers of musical comedy. Much more interesting than Star!
