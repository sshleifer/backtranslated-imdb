This is a movie that makes you wonder, or not? Although many people complained about the ambiguous ending, it gives viewers the opportunity to think and interpret this by signs. This is my interpretation and theory, and I believe that this is very reasonable. <br /> <br /> First, here’s the plot. One day, Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the middle of a busy railway station. After trying to help the woman from the robbers, he was arrested and sent to Bellevue, and then transferred to the hospital of Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges). Prot speaks freely about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to give a talk on Earth. Naturally, he is classified as crazy and locked up in a low security ward. He provides support to other patients and quickly convinces them in his story. In fact, he tells them that he can take one person with him. Soon Dr. Powell begins to doubt Prot's madness, and as the story progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to prove that Prot was wrong. <br /> <br /> In the end, Dr. Powell discovers that Prot is Robert Porter, a clever man who worked in a slaughterhouse in New Mexico when his wife and daughter were killed. Prot claims he plans to leave for C-Pax at the exact time of the fifth anniversary of the killings. Time comes and goes, and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients went missing and was never found again. <br /> <br /> According to my theory: Prot is not crazy. Prot from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is Prota's friend. During one of his previous visits to the Earth Protome, Robert was a child, learning about the constellations from his father. Prot and Robert became best friends. After the death of his family and the murder of Robert the killer, Robert decides to commit suicide. The protector at that time was on K-Pax, but he rushes back (at a speed that is a multiple of the speed of light) to stop Robert. Thus, Prot takes over the thoughts of Robert, taking him, so to speak, his body. Some time later, Prot (still inhabiting the body of Robert) arrives in New York and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he has to leave Robert’s body behind. Consequently, we now have a catatonic Robert. <br /> <br /> Explanations or prompts: <br /> <br /> KNOWLEDGE OF PROT PLANETS WITHIN LIBRA: As Prot says, every child knows about his own system. Only a few people on Earth knew about the system, and Prot added to his knowledge. Robert Porter, being intelligent and knowing his constellations, was not an astrophysicist. <br /> <br /> DR POWELL FEELS TO CHOOSE PROT: That's true. Prot could leave the institute at any time, but not too much. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell: “Now that you have found Robert. Keep him safe". Prot probably stayed there to secure a place for Robert when he left. <br /> <br /> SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES. Prot has been proven to have a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and can even see ultraviolet rays. The prota provides his usual reason for the K-Pax, but no earthly reason was given. It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of drugs with no effect. <br /> <br /> HELPING PATIENTS: Throughout the entire film, you see how Prot helps other patients (or patients discussing Prot's suggestions) the best sane world. While the psychologist refuses Prot's help, at the end of the film, Dr. Powell talks about new lives led by patients. <br /> <br /> SPRINKLER SCENE: A sprinkler is connected to Porter's house in New Mexico (which ironically is where Roswell is located). Does Porter associate a sprinkler with the death of his family? Is she trying to protect Powell's daughter from this terrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is assumed that Porter committed suicide in the river. Indeed, Prot (under hypnosis) is very concerned about Robert. I believe that Prot associates danger with water, and not with a sprinkler. He is trying to protect the girl from the watery death, like Robert. <br /> <br /> HYPNOSIS: Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can reveal the true identity of Prot, but although Prot gives a lot of information, he never gives up his proto-person and claims to be K-Pax's homeland. <br /> <br /> SECURITY CAMERA: Why did the camera just give out for no apparent reason? <br /> <br /> Mysterious disappearances: First, Prot disappeared for a few days to go north. Funny, patients are not alarmed at all. Indeed, they are trying to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Naturally, the most noticeable disappearance is Besse, the winner of the essay contest. Not only does she disappear at about the same time, but the only remaining clue is her triumphant essay. <br /> <br /> This is just my humble theory. You can conclude what you want. You can take Dr. Powell’s theory that Prot was just a person that Robert Porter picked up to mentally protect himself from reality, but this would have led to the abandonment of too many holes in the plot.
