I never read a lot about (or even saw the footage) of the British comedy group of six “Crazy Gang”, but my positive experience with contemporaries Will Hayem and Arthur Asuka - and Graham Green's particularly high praise for Frozen Limits itself (“ The funniest English film created yet ... it can be compared to SAFE LAST AND GENERAL ”) - made me plunge with bare R2 R2 DVDs from the Network of this and their subsequent GASBAGS movie (1941; see below), both of which were released earlier this year with almost no fanfare. <br /> <br /> British Western is rare, but the British Western parody is still less frequent (CARRY ON COWBOY [1965] was about 25 years old), Incidentally, returning to the “Silent Classics” mentioned by Green, it seems to me that the film is more explicitly bound to Golden Frenzy (1925) and WAY OUT WEST (1937). In addition, he also plays as a variation in the fairy tale "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (which has just been immortalized on the screen thanks to Walt Disney's animated masterpiece) and where the seventh participant plays an ancient comic and frequent Will Hay. Moore Marriott foil; The gangs actually call the cute heroine Eileen Bell by this name all over the world, and there is even an amusing sequence with six of them preparing to go to bed and whistling a gnome song from a Disney movie! <br /> <br /> Six comedians (three sets of comedian duos: Flanagan & Allen, Nervo & Knox and Naughton & Gold) may be the largest such groups in the film - although not all of their personalities appear here: my favorites were the big bud Flanagan (a bit like Jim Backus), straight man Chesney Allen and a mustache, with a raspy voice, Teddy Knox; however, the bald Charlie Naughton often attracted attention to himself - since he is the one that others always seemed to pay attention to. Nevertheless, Marriott is the one who steals the film from his very first scene - where he is trying to impersonate every official in the dilapidated theater of the ghost town! very young Bernard Lee is also known as the villain of this work. <br /> <br /> The ore routine between Flanagan and Allen actually anticipates the famous “Who is ahead” of Abbott and Costello (the film, in fact, depends on the film). on many puns for his humor - which doesn't necessarily travel, especially at this moment). However, there are several fun sequences everywhere — some of which even caused tears in my eyes: the opening scene where the gang is discharged by a group of angry lenders; they are dressed like Indians when they go to the Yukon; gang trick to make everyone rich with the same piece of gold; they all imitate the lunatic Marriott to confuse the villains (a gag that may be due to the origin of the funny mirror sequence Marx Bros. in DUCK SOUP [1933]); theater etude that makes fun of gray melodramas; a surreal moment when one of the Gang, pursued by the villains, climbs the stairs, which is part of the painted landscape in the theater; and especially towards the end, when a group of singing mounted police very slowly jumps to the rescue of the Gang (despite the fact that it is annoying the increasingly impatient Ranger hero). <br /> <br /> Thin soundtrack and fierce nature. The jokes themselves prevented me from joking sometimes - subtitles in this case are certainly welcome. The Crazy Gang made only five films - the first two were also well-rated, OKAY FOR SOUND (1937) and ALF Klavdoplavka (1938), and much later reunion (although Allen had already refused because of him, he was replaced by Eddie Gray, who was called "LIFE - CIRCUS" (1960; director Val Guest, who, by the way, co-authored both of the Gangs I bought, as well as some of the Hey cars mentioned above and "Askey"!).
