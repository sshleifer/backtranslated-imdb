Despite the fact that "Inki and Minah Bird" looks outdated, in my opinion, this is a pleasant and charming cartoon. The picture is not unusual, but quite good. This cartoon has no dialogue, only sounds and music, but this combination works quite well. The cartoon itself is good, funny, old-fashioned, creative, interesting and funny. <br /> <br /> This cartoon also matters because there are only three characters in it: Inca (little black girl), Mina Bird (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion who wants to eat Inca and Mina for breakfast - so he pursues them both for most of the cartoon. <br /> <br /> I actually find this lion very beautiful, fun and cool. I really like this lion. This poor lion is so stupid and a loser that you feel sorry for him. For me, the real enemy is the Mina Bird, not the lion. At some point, the lion almost ate it - it is a great pity that he cannot swallow it, because he deserves to be eaten. <br /> <br /> Coming back to this animated short story, there is not a single boring or boring moment. At least for me. The only thing I find stupid is the ending, because the bird is seriously fighting the lion, stealing his teeth and setting them for himself. Besides, I have nothing to criticize on this occasion, except for the fact that the steak had to go exactly to the lion, and not to the bird. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a very forgotten and underestimated little gem, which definitely should get more credits.
