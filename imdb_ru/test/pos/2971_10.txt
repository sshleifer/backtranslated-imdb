When I first heard about this film, I noticed that it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed that the music was Elton John, so I decided that I had nothing to lose, so I understood. What a surprise!!! The film was awesome. It was true love. The characters (Paul and Michel) did not have luxury, money, and sometimes food, but they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but they all criticized my tastes and even called me by name, because there were two naked minors in the film. I think I just made the film more realistic. The cinematography was great and she only showed great abilities of director Lewis Gilbert.
