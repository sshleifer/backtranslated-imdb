Much about the USA. The film can be summarized in the title. He draws parallels between the position of this country in the face of war and a kind of Hollywood lie that glorifies things that should not be glorified. I’m not sure that I agree with the director’s opinion on recent events (although, frankly, I don’t always know exactly where he stands), but I admire an unusual and artistic way to convey my thoughts. Audio tracks with speeches, radio interviews, poems, etc. Play here as much a role as visual effects. Most of the time, the visual effects of the story are accompanied by these audio elements for a good effect. I'm kind of a radio lover, so it was nice to hear how the radio was included in the pace of the film. In fact, most of the dialogue takes place over the story, not with the characters who communicate with each other. This does not mean that there are no “characters” (real people), but, apart from “Jim”, the main character (something like the 60s with an erratic mood), others come and go pretty quickly. Some people make a very strong impression, especially a taxi driver who looks like a guru, who seems to be the voice of wisdom. When he starts a spontaneous prayer song, when he leads Jim to the subway, this is a very strong moment. On the cover of the DVD there is a quote “The danger is obvious”, which is taken from President Bush’s speech, which paved the way for our invasion of Iraq. In retrospect, having heard this speech at a critical moment in the film, we understood how we live in a historically tense moment that will always be remembered.
