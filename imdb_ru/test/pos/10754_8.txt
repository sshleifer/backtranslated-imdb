<br /> <br /> As a fan of Harold Lloyd, I agree with the comments of another reviewer, except that I feel that “Movie Crazy” was his best sound film; "Cat's paw" is near. (But this is just my opinion). <br /> <br /> This film is a “scream” from beginning to end, and in many scenes George Barbier (the deceiver who makes him elected mayor) almost steals the show! (Especially at the end of the film). <br /> <br /> I wish Una Merkel’s character was a little prettier to Harold, especially as the film progresses. Only in the last few minutes of the film will we recognize her true feelings for him. (And even then there is no "romance" - kisses, etc.). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is a must see!
