As in many comedic situations, “War at Home” gets better with each episode. Characters are starting to become real, and I believe them as a family. I agree with many that the first few episodes were not so funny; I thought the show would be canceled for sure. But with the lack of "Malcolm in the middle" and "Arrested development", "War" provides the much-needed live action comedy for FOX on Sunday evening. And compared to the rest of the sitcoms that are being broadcast now, “War” is an even better choice. <br /> <br /> Her appeal, at least for me, lies in her real situations. Teens have sex. Not all parents like their children. Parents fight and call each other names. But instead of relying on “meanness”, as in many TV shows, in the end, all is well, which is the number one rule in a good comedy series. <br /> <br /> One of the drawbacks of the show is the narration during / between scenes. “Arrested developer / family guy” flashbacks work quite well, but the story may be too big. <br /> <br /> Therefore, anyone who needs to watch something on Sunday evening should check out “War at Home”. especially considering what was at that time in other large networks.
