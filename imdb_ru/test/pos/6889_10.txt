Hey yall! Now the best drama on the channel Gospel Music! Check out their website to see the schedule and find out what the number is on your cable or satellite. It was one of my favorite shows when I was growing up. It has everything that I want the series to be, a pure family drama that does not annoy me. The story of a man who, having lost his job, decides to go on a great adventure over rough terrain. Along the way, they meet all sorts of interesting people and find themselves at the center of all kinds of trouble. This show was originally the release of Touched By An Angel, another really good family show. Make sure you check it out!
