For years, Samuel Goldwyn tried to display his friend Yasha Heifz on the screen. One evening, when Goldwyn and his wife, Frances, dined with Heifetz and his wife, the quiet movie star Florence Widor, Goldwin suggested that Haifetz play a movie star. After some persuasion, Kheyfetz agreed on the condition that his actions should be minimized. And the film, originally titled "Music School," was born. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty boring: a boy on the street (Gene Reynolds, who is best known as the producer of "M * A * S *"). H "), runs away from home and enters the financially disadvantaged music school, led by Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan). Trying to raise funds for the school, the boy and some other children meet through Haifetz at Carnegie Hall. After long ceremonies, Heifetz eventually appears at a school concert and sponsors a school. <br /> <br /> This story, though predictable, is surprisingly well written, although there are a few minor mistakes in the film, in which various scenes were put together, the most obvious of which is The young cellist, who is sent from the orchestra’s room on commission, is seen sitting in the orchestra a few seconds later. <br /> <br /> No wonder how good the game is. As was customary for the studios, the studio was surrounded by inexperienced stars, veteran talents : Brennan, Joel McCree, Andrea Leeds, Porter Hall, Marjorie Mine (later fame Ma and Pa Kettle), Arthur Hol, Paul Harvey and Who is who the characters are actors. Actress Diana Lynn and singer / actress Kay Connor debuted in this film, so same as Nelson Eddie’s longtime partner singing gail sherwood (like jacqueline nash). The film also features child veteran actors Reynolds, Walter Tetley and Terry Kilburn. <br /> <br /> Goldwyn hired the Peter Symphony Symphony to participate in the film, a highly respected youth orchestra from the Los Angeles area. Most of the children in the orchestra were not actors, but they were excellent musicians, as well as professionals (which many of them later became). Many of the children in the orchestra took a worthy place in their careers: Kay Connor and Diane Lynn both starred in theater and cinema, Richard Berres was the producer and director, Mitchell Lurie founded the well-known music supply company, Elliot Rapaport continued Being an outstanding cardiologist, Lewis Elias was the leader bands, Thomas Faithy conductor with various symphonies, Channing Robbins - an outstanding teacher of the Julliard School, his sister Joyce Robbins - Instructor SUNY Stonybrook, and many of the children in the orchestra played the musical Career in the main symphonies their orchestras. <br /> <br /> Although Haifetz played at the minimum level, his salary was not. He commanded 70,000 dollars in seven weeks. When some scenes had to be re-shot later, he received an additional $ 50,000 for another four weeks. What, fortunately, was not kept to a minimum, is his musical result. Composer Alfred Neumann (who was once the conductor of the Meremblum orchestra) was engaged in scoring. Heifetz performs "Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso" by Camille Saint-Saens, their own arrangements "Estrelellity" Manuel Ponce (with accompanying overs Teddy Saydenberga), devilishly complex "Hora Staccato" Danica (from recording Vitafon with Emanuel) "Bay near the piano" an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's Melody, an arrangement excerpt for a solo violin from Tchaikovsky's famous Adante Cantabile from his string quartet opus 11 (played during the opening credits at the beginning of the film), and the final part from the Violin Concerto in E minor Felik Sa Mendelssohn-Bartodi. During all these performances, there are many close-ups of Heifz's performances, including some very close shots of his fingers and bows, which would be useful for violinists who want to learn his technique. <br /> <br /> The Meremblum Orchestra also features a performance of Veri’s Caro Nome arias and Bellini’s Casta Diva (both with Sherwood's singing), an arrangement by Rossini’s Barber of Seville, a short excerpt from Mozart’s work Eine Kleine Nachtmusik "" and the previously mentioned concert of Mendelssohn (with Heifetz). Diana Lynn can be heard against the background of one scene that sang the part of Chopin's Nocturne in B flat minor, and the five-year-old Mary Ruth performs the popular "Minute" Waltz by Chopin. <br /> <br / > In general, this is a great movie AMC showed it regularly until the beginning of 1992. I did not see him on television in recent years, but it is not difficult to get a copy. If you have the chance, I highly recommend you watch the movie.
