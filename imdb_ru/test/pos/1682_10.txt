The storyline is the exposure of the depths of American politics. While the theme seems to be common, the film “makes” an unusual way of telling a story. <br /> <br /> Characters play convincingly. You feel the innocence of a leader, and his innocence is lost. A politician - a prince of double talk, a real snake. <br /> <br /> The shooting is impressive. This confirms the nuances of the game and dialogue. The same goes for music. <br /> <br /> The plot uses a parable-style with vignettes in which the message is filled with double meaning. Very tricky strategy author / director. The tension in the plot came to the last scenes. <br /> <br /> The film looked like a good mystery book. Something was "in motion"; you knew it was bad; you did not know exactly what it might be - you had your suspicions; and when evil was revealed, you hold your breath, not noticing that you are holding back. Saddened, shaking his head. <br /> <br /> The story is well written and well told. 3 greetings to a young writer / director.
