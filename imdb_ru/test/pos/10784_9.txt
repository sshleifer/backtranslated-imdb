WOW, a masterpiece from a movie not to be missed. <br /> <br /> I had no idea what the movie was when I started watching it late at night. I did not find out that it was the movie "Stone", until I came out on IMDb. Watching this, I was hypnotized. The cast, especially Eric Bogosyan, is simply amazing. One of the best scenarios and camera work in the entire history ... The film attracted me and held me captive until the very end ... I did not dare to blink for fear of missing something ... It's amazing how low-budget film can be so exciting well done, while films with a huge budget that show a variety of activities and computer special effects can be so incredibly boring. Do not miss this movie ...
