The word "impossible" prompted many to choose a particular view on any incredible task. In 1927, it was believed that no one person could control the breath of the Atlantic Ocean. Many tried, but failed, and some even gave up their efforts. However, this must be done, since each task must be solved with equal determination. Such is the heart of this film called The Spirit of St. Louis. The actor chosen for this historical film is none other than the American James Stewart, who convincingly plays Charles Lindberg. Despite the fact that there are many aspects to Lindbergâ€™s life, here is a fragment of his attempts to become the first person to fly across the Atlantic. This story is interesting for fans of the Stewards, who, at least, forced. In search of the means to build a special plane, to the fateful decision to begin the journey on a gloomy day in May 1927, Luck of Lindy, as he was christened, was subjected to enormous risks, which are shown in this excellent film. Other celebrities who helped make this film believable are Murray Hamilton, who plays Bud Gurney, Bartlett Robinson as Ben Mahoney, Arthur Space, and Charles Watts as O. U. Schultz. In general, this now famous film is that, despite the poor support of his debut, he has since become a classic in itself. Well done! ****
