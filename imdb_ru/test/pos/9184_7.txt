Not seeing the film in its commercial debut, we just caught it on DVD. Expecting the worst, “Hitchhiking” turned out to be a pleasant experience because of the three principles in it. Thanks to the direction of Andy Tenant, the film has an easy pace, and, despite the predictability, the comedy has several winning points. <br /> <br /> Hitch is a kind of “dating coordinator” for losers, such as Albert, who is not exactly what can be considered a slice. Nevertheless, Albert is a real guy who would have gone unnoticed by those without any professional help. by the women he would like to remove. Enter Hitch to prepare him to overcome obstacles that he cannot overcome, and although Albert remains overweight and can never master social graces, he defeats us because he is real, in stark contrast to all the falsifiers who make the rounds in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> The main mistake that most designers make when preparing films for Hollywood films is how far they are not true. In the apartments in which they place these characters, it is so rare to find that only thanks to the magic of films can these people live in places like them. Obviously, most people in the cinema deal with fantasies, since most of the city dwellers will kill for such incredible places as the ones they show in the films, not to mention the very people depicted in the film that they cannot afford . <br /> <br /> Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarming way to charm without doing anything. The surprise of the film, however, is Kevin James, who, as overweight Albert, not only conquered us, but also proves that he can sustain his scenes with Mr. Smith. Eva Mendez is fine, as Hitch's main interest. In the minor roles we see Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappoport and Philip Bosco and others. <br /> <br /> “Bitch” is a fun movie that can be watched thanks to Andy Tenant’s inspirational direction.
