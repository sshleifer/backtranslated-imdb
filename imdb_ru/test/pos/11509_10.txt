The film tells about Paul (Palle), a young man who plunges into the harsh world of madness and his stay in the psychiatric hospital "Kleppur" and his friends. Victor (Victor), who, while studying in England, began to think that he was Adolf Hitler. Peter (Petur), who took a lot of LSD and tried to take off from the roof, did not leave bones or physical damage as a result of the fall, only madness, he was absorbed by China. Oli Beatle (Bli Bítill) Oli spent most of his time in the hospital, although Victor is a little older than him, he claims that he wrote every Beatles song and sent it by telepathy. <br /> <br /> Roman is better then. The film tells about the life of Paul from birth to death. It has been a long time since I watched the film, but if I remember it correctly, the film does not cover Paul’s childhood. <br /> <br /> "Englar Alheimsins" is funny, sad and strong, if you haven't seen it yet, watch it now! and first read the novel, it will make the film better
