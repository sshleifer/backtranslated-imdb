I watched this movie on ITV and I really enjoyed it. It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were flawless in their roles. Julie Walters receives a special mention, as she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character that can be watched. Benâ€™s character is rather shy and stoic, but the changes he is going through are remarkably played by Rupert Grint, I would definitely say that he has a future in acting after Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney is pretty good in her role as Ben over the protective mother, the only thing they went wrong with, making her too ... The villain. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother, and in the end he is also very honorable. The only character I didn't fascinate was Brioni, she was a bit simple and unnecessary, I thought. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch. One of my favorite films of the year is easy.
