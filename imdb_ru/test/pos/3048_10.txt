all I can say is that every time I see CONCAR, dir. Martin Ritt, DP. John Alonzo, I have a great sense of inspiration and understanding of the power of cinema in such a simple film. <br /> <br /> The film Konrak takes place in 1969. It is based on a true story. It is a story about a white man (John Voight), who tells a group of small black children how incredible the world is outside their small island in South Carolina. <br /> <br /> This story puts the work of a teacher to a noble cause in changing the lives of children. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this.
