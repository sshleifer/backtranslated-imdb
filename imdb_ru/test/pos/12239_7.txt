The peculiarity of the creatures in the early 80s is associated with the long-abandoned gold mine, which some fearless miners decided to check. Naturally, they do not find there gold, except for one very hungry monster who slips in search of prey. <br /> <br /> Although I have to be honest and admit, at first it seemed boring to me (I personally prefer thematically similar "The Boogens"), it actually grew on me how it went. Now the characters are not very interesting, as well as the actors. The closest to the interesting character is Morgan, played by Keith Hurt. In any case, lead woman Terry Burland looks pretty good, and Rolf Tayson makes his powerful idiot a man who is easy to hate. The writer, played by actor Mark Savitsky, quickly wears out. <br /> <br /> It all starts quite comfortably and predictably, with a nightly staged play in which it is alleged that the two victims achieve an acceptable start. The monster itself is intrigued by its design (as you can imagine, it is slightly revealed to the late stage of the game) and by the fact that it is the product of the animation of the stop motion when this process is no longer used. Director Melanie Ann Phillips (director under the pseudonym David Michael Hillman) and the team deserve credit for creating an atmosphere. They manage to make the film look rather claustrophobic and gloomy, and their use of lighting works well. The film is growing in intensity to a good end. Suffice it to say that they are doing everything possible because of their small budget. <br /> <br /> An obscure little thing worth seeing at the merciless horror lovers. <br /> <br /> 7/10
