What can I say about this band, I was hooked at 68, I was a ten-year-old child, I grew up on the blues, although my dad, then these guys from Midlands came, a mixture of country-rock, heavy rock and blues, I would like to see them live in the early years, I was fortunate enough to be there in the 79th (Knebworth), it was the best concert I have ever seen, I hope the full version of this hot August will soon be night. This CD gave me the opportunity to see the guys again and again. The song remains unchanged, but this CD comes to the smallest detail. <br /> <br /> Long live Zapp!
