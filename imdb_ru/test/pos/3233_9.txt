I read all the Jane Austen novels every year since I was 9 years old, and as a birthday present I received a collection of her works in the modern library. <br /> <br /> I liked this film for its romance and for the music that hung over his head. Of course, it was an interpretation, not “Emma” or “Sense and Sensitivity,” but something completely different and something that Catherine herself would have loved. And oh, be loved by this passionate Henry! It was Henry Catherine's imagination, and she is the romantic heroine she read about in her novels, and who was promised to us by the practical Jane Austen, who at the very beginning tells us that the unlikely Catherine will really be alone. I wonder if Jane was completely satirical in her novel. Perhaps she, too, could imagine such a Henry. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the film for many years, at least a decade. But since then I have longed for it.
