I first saw this mini-series as a child, and although I am no longer a child, I still love it !!! Professional copies are hard to find, however, when they are on DVD, they are MY !!! =] <br /> <br /> Great cast, amazing plots, lots of action movies, romance and even a lot of successful comedies. I am not a historian by nature, but I love this masterpiece of historical fiction!
