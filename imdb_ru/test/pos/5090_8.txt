A quiet historical drama based on the story of Anne Boleyn, the newly arrived Queen's maid of honor, who deftly looks at the lascivious Henry VIII, the evil king of England, who loves to feast, drink, hunt, have fun with his court jester, watch contests and chase after young beauties who jump out of the cakes and disassemble attractive girls around the castle. Well, he soon broke up the marriage, married Anna and told her that her holy duty was to give birth to a male heir. She fails in this regard, and soon he sees another maid of honor. Meanwhile, Ann spends most of the film, looking indecisive, agitated, or completely ready to burst into tears. She just does not look like a happy tourist (or is it just a bad acting game?!). <br /> <br /> This film is a complete entertainment with an exciting story that interested me for two hours. In addition, I really liked to see a very luxurious medieval costume, depicted here in a magnificent shade of sepia. Emil Jennings is quite striking and is remembered in his well-made depiction of King Henry the Eighth - he really seemed to be Henry the Eighth. I am not sure that the performance that the actress played on Anna played seemed to me a bit redundant. The DVD of this film contains an appropriate, well-made piano score that is perfect for this story. A good movie.
