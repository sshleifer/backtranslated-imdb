It’s a mistake to call any movie of this era a horror movie. Most of the early German films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early German romantics such as E. T. A. Hoffman and others. In the Fritz Lang film "Der Mude Tod" (also from 1921), a personified death takes the young man away from his beloved, but in the Lang film the fate of the characters cannot be mitigated by behavior. None of the young lovers deserve death, but they are doomed by circumstances to reunite only in death. <br /> <br /> In Victor Sastrom’s “Korkarlen”, however, repentance is always possible. Destiny can be changed - and death is delayed - through the choice of characters. Although the scenes in which the Ghost Carriage's souls are gathered are truly eerie, these terrifying images of Death as a great rectifier are compromised by offering Death of Atonement to the real monster of this story, David Holm, a cruel drunk who, because of perverse hatred of humanity, spreading tuberculosis and emotional suffering everyone with whom he comes in contact. <br /> <br /> Once on New Year's Eve, Hill was killed in a duel with a drinking companion. Being the first person to die from a blow at midnight, Hill should become a Ghost Coach driver and collect souls during the new year. A phantom carriage, driven by an old acquaintance who started Hill on the road to death, comes to his soul and sends him on a journey of self-discovery. Along the way, Hill sees the horror he caused to his family and the people who tried to help him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps my disappointment at the end of the film is a criticism of the Selma Lagerlöf novel about which the film is based. But I would prefer that David Holm could not escape his fate, and that his repentance would come too late to prevent his wife from poisoning his two children and himself, and that Holm suffered the consequences of his sins, being forced to collect their souls. This would be an appropriate punishment and more horror than evidence of the abuse of other people. In the film, however, the unchanging nature of fate is not a message; there is a ransom. The driver of the carriage allows the spirit of the Hill to return to his body, and he saves his family at the very last moment. His repentance smacks of the repentance of Scrooge in The Christmas Carol. <br /> <br /> If a banal and sentimental ending does not offend you, there is something to admire in the images of the film. The special effects are amazing when measured by the standard standards of the day, and they persist, which is more surprising when you consider that these double exposures were created inside the camera with manual scrolling. In addition, the recovered film on the new Tartan DVD looks incredible.
