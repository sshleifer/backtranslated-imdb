It was a film that I read about again and again; and despite the fact that it is played in the cinema museum, and not in the theaters of Pat? I decided to try this movie. There were many reasons ?? in reviews it was compared with “Pulp Fiction”, it had several parallel plots, and, finally, he had already received 17 awards internationally in various categories. I could not wait to see this film, and because of the weekend in Greenpeace, I decided to please myself by watching this film. <br /> <br /> This is a story from Finland. I think this reflects the current life of people in general ?? drugs, crime, sex, anger, agony, fear and guilt. Each emotion was captured in the film. There are several characters and stories are intertwined, but several characters are returned in the second half ?? making a connection with the initial episodes, and this advances the story. <br /> <br /> A story about two friends ?? one of them is a computer geek and the other is a drug addict ?? son of an abusive father. Boy addict sells 500 euro bill ?? printed by his friend ?? buy their music system, and in return gets a lot of money back to buy more drugs. Bidding a 500 euro note continues with strange events ?? from the trader's shop to the auto mechanic cum burglar ?? car dealer ?? the seller of the vacuum cleaner ?? prostitute ?? the policeman ?? then her family and children. How does the beginning of the little thing ?? creates a chain reaction that even after 5 years of this first incident leads to a depressing last note ?? that I will not disclose here. <br /> <br /> The direction is excellent. Character development in the film is first class. A character who captures you even after you exit the film refers to the seller of vacuum cleaners. All departments of the film are processed well. Here I would like to make a couple of critical comments. First, during the sequence of one event leading to another, I felt that the coincidences were too fast and forced. But this script writing mistake is forgiveness when you see the entire canvas. Secondly, the trail of one character leading to another somehow leads to the first two characters, and I again discovered that the scriptwriter had made me decide. It was not necessary that the same characters appear again when there are different reasons leading to different effects in such a big city. <br /> <br /> But after that? this is a great movie! This is a dark movie with quite a lot of sex scenes. Characters have black, white and gray shades and emotions that change depending on the situation, which is brilliantly captured by the director. <br /> <br /> High quality film! It has all the ingredients to become a cult film. I hope that only such films should not become and attain the status of cult films and win many awards, because without crime, sex, violence, drugs, etc. Can you also shoot fantastic films ?? Bicycle thieves and Pater Panchali are his prime examples ?? The only thing is that they are long ago, and the times are changing, and I think the films reflect the current time.
