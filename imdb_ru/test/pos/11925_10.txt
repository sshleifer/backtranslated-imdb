Summary of the book: The boy, Billy Tepper, about 12 years old, is the main source of problems at school, and if he was kicked out of another school, he will be sent to boarding school. The school of his high-profile boy in Switzerland (or somewhere like that) is seized by Arab terrorists, so I’m not quite sure. Billy has no friends, and he likes to use his laptop to hack into his school’s database. With the help of two teachers, he upsets the plans of terrorists and saves the whole school. The book was not bad, but sooooo cliche. <br /> <br /> Now about the film; they switched Arab terrorists to Cuban terrorists, and made Billy about 17 years old and the leader of his group of friends. They love getting into trouble, but normal teenage things. This film was believable. Maybe not realistic, but the characters are real. You can watch Billy, Joe and the rest of the guys and see how real children behave as they (or at least want). <br /> <br /> Superb action movies. Not everything goes as planned for both sides. To overthrow the terrorists was dirty, and the good guys suffered. I will not say who, but it is heartbreaking (I know, I often use this word). Sean Astin is great. As a teenager, he used to play the bad best friend. This film once again proved that he can play a major role, a child, whatever. The only performance that could put him in the background was Wil Wheaton, who played the only son of a New Jersey mafioso. He hated his father and everything he stood for. (Away from Wesley Crusher) I usually watch this genre of film for the purpose of teasing; but not Toy Soldiers. The storyline flows, the dialogue is usually plausible. I can’t remember a single moment when I screamed on TV “Oh, that wouldn’t have happened”. Great movie, which should be in the collection of each.
