it doesn't seem like it was from a science fiction movie. The film is dark with dark shades. The soundtrack is too inspiring to such an extent that it is imposed visually. I'm sure they were striving for something combat, but it just didn’t work. The scene when Astin tries to escape is a great example. Why does this sound like goonies? There is no comedy, no brightness in it! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is great, and the acting is very good. I enjoyed all the performances. It is available on Netflix online viewing. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, but write your own soundtrack !!
