I love this film very much and have seen it many times. I recorded it on tape around 1987, when it was shown on Channel Four, but now my tape is very worn out, and I would really like to receive a new copy of it. I emailed the film Fourth to ask him to show it again, since it was never available. on video and, as far as I know, has not been repeated since the 80s. I did not have an answer, and it still did not repeat. The performances are great. The film has it all. This is ridiculous, sad, anxious, exciting and fully returns you to school years. This is a very good pace and captures you from start to finish. The scene in the shower room is especially awful. I also don’t hear the Badge by Cream song and don’t think about this movie. This film deserves to be seen by a much larger audience, as it is great. Channel 4, please show again or release it on video or DVD.
