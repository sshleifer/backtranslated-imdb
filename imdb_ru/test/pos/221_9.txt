Police squad! (1982) was a fun show that ended too soon. But I believe that it was launched before it became too repetitive and unfunny, like many American television shows. The geniuses of this funny show were the team of Zucker, Abraham and Zucker. Since his direct act in the comedy hit AIRPLANE !, Leslie Nielsen has found a new comedian career. In this short lived. In the series, he had the opportunity to play a straightforward man in a stupid comedy again. Strange titles for each episode gave the ending. But Lieutenant Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) got into so many strange cases that you need to see them to believe. <br /> <br /> Too bad that they never released it on D.V.D. If the show needed to be republished, it should be that. A whole new generation is waiting to see this show! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended!
