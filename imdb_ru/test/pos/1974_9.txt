Yes, I noticed that there are still 347 comments, I think that this is a good sign for the film, even if some of them are negative. I saw this movie 2 and a half times. I adore it and will watch it again. it's very clever, but I can understand why some people hate it. they do not receive this appeal. Yes, I have a strange taste in movies, but this is a great movie. Some lines are as fast as the whole scene in a Chinese restaurant. I started to die laughing, and when he was on the conveyor he was talking to a contact. Jude Law was wonderful, albeit funny, he tried to hide his wonderful accent. In any case, I do not consider myself the goddess of cinema as critics of this film, and if you have nothing better than to write pseudo-intellectual comments on films about films that you hate on the Internet, I feel sorry for you. why don't you write about films that you like, like me. I just like how everything is interconnected, it makes you guess, even if you guess wrong. the finale was interesting and not exaggerated. it was purely clever. I would not compare it with the matrix, because I think that people then get the wrong idea. I entered this film, expecting nothing but Jude Law and science fiction. I was shocked. I donâ€™t have a clue about other Cronenburg films, but I love it all by itself. another clever thing was a foreshadowing with a dog. Be sure to watch this movie.
