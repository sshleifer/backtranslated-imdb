Compared to this, Tarkovsky is a speed fan. <br /> <br /> Compared to this, Bela Tarr - MTV. <br /> <br /> Compared to this, the movie “Russian Ark” is a roller coaster. Trip. <br /> <br /> I just described 3 of the sllllowwwwwesssstttt experiences that I have ever known, and this one surpasses them all. But this does not mean that it is bad. On the contrary, I really liked it. But it was a routine. <br /> <br /> I will not describe the plot, because you can easily find it in another place. Suffice to say that the plot is insane. This is one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since the "Formation of John Malkovich". I think that an interesting plot is the main reason why I didn’t sleep (humor was pleasant. This is something that we rarely see in slow, fancy films). <br /> <br /> Here we see a strange change in the norm. In most films, there is little plot and little content; yet they fill 90 minutes with lots of attractive images to keep us excited. But "The Hole" has a 100% story / topic without much eye-catching pleasure. In this respect, I believe, this is indeed an intellectual experience, very much like reading a painfully verbose novel, such as Takkarey's Vanity Fair (which I NEVER could finish!). <br /> <br /> If you have a huge concentration of attention, I think you really will like this movie. Despite the tempo of molasseci, he is very creative and creative. It's like Jean-Pierre Genet for four and with a gray, dusty camera lens. Good luck.
