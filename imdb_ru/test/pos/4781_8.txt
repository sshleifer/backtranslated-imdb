This era was not just the dawn of cartoons, but also a cartoon character who will go down in history as the most famous mouse in the world. Yes, Mickey debuts here, in this funny story about life aboard a steamer. The animation is good for its time, and the plot - albeit a bit simple - is pretty funny. This is a classic, and if you ever manage to shoot it on video, you will not regret it.
