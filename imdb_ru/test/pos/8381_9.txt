I felt a little disappointed because of Tarantino’s death. But I insist that it was quite a bit, because I can estimate the amount of work aimed at paying tribute to the tricks. Inglorious bastards definitely promoted Tarantino to first places in my universe. This film can be summed up (albeit inadequately) in one word: “RAW”. <br /> <br /> There are strong emotions in every scene. Revenge and justice seem to be the main themes. From the very beginning of the film, compassion for the victims of the Nazis is felt, and it falls into Tarantino’s fictional dimension in the historical context of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Characters unpredictable, funny, scary, brutal, sexual and other adjectives, which, I am sure, escaped from my mind, just as suitable and positive. I will not go into the assessment of each character, but other comments by other users sum up the assessment of various actions. <br /> <br /> The dialogue arose from the classic Tarantinian provocative “bad ass” style, as seen in “Pulp Fiction” and “Proof of Death”. In the dialogs you can feel that Tarantino makes more open links to other films. Indeed, many dialogues were close to the lessons in the cinema for the audience, the production takes place partly at the premiere of the film; Link to the film is close around every corner. <br /> <br /> It’s nice to see that each language presented (German, French and English) is used quite equally and naturally. I speak French and English very well, and I often get disappointed by how badly spoken English characters are in French films, and how badly speaking French characters are in Anglo-American films. Surprisingly, Tarantino managed to get his actors to achieve a natural and graceful performance of their actors. It helps put the audience in the context of a historical context. Indeed ; soldiers, spies and civilians rarely understood soldiers / spies / civilians from other countries. <br /> <br /> Visual images / photographs are beautiful, and the scenery convincingly conveys the Europe of the 1940s. The outfits are perfect, and the violence is orgasmic / realistically transmitted. No blows are held back, and the Nazis are often tortured. This makes the film not open to all viewers; graphic violence can shock more sensitive demographics. <br /> <br /> Tom can write about this film. But the film is so good that during the premiere of the film “Inglorious Bastards” in North America at the Fantasia festival in Montreal, I had to pee, but I refused to go, so as not to miss a single scene. I hope that the image conveys how much I feel about this film, and it's hard for me to please.
