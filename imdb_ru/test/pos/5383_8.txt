Bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now defunct American animation company Filmation on the back of He-man: Masters of the Universe and She-Ra: Princess of Power, in 1983 and 87 ', respectively. The plot of the cartoon was about an Indian cowboy named Marshal Bravedarr, who possesses the power of a bear, wolf ears, speed of a puma and eyes of a hawk, as well as his faithful helper, speaking a horse named Thirty thirty, who carried a pistol under the exact name "Sarah Jane" and with the help of Deputy Fuzzy and Judge J. B. serves to protect New Texas from the evil Tex Hex and his group of criminals. <br /> <br /> Set in futuristic Texas, it was and remains to this day, one of the very few cartoons set in a particular city in the USA — hence, in the south — thousands of light years ahead in the future. Considering that this was done in the 1980s, the creators did an impressive job, trying to recreate the look of the Wild West, but from the point of view of science fiction. Bravestarr not only inspired morality and bad poems, but also taught children lessons about life, but also highlighted the themes of culture and society and the fact that we should not take things and life for granted. And despite the fact that it was an adventure cartoon, many storylines, themes and problems that were touched in it resonate with children and adults in such a way that it makes sense to them. In addition, Marshall Bravestarr was one of the first protagonists of cartoons from the (ethnic) minority who influenced television. <br /> <br /> The sound effects were awesome, the music was great, the theme song was equally memorable and the animation was great. The characters were well thought out, and the stories were varied and taught the children morality and the importance of what is right and what is not. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about today's cartoons. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Bravestarr was overshadowed by the success of He-man, he is still a personal favorite of many 80s cartoons fanatics. Suffice it to say that I preferred Bravestarr rather than Human because of the variety of plot lines, characters, and the fact that the depth of situations and problems that the characters encountered was greater than I would say, realistic and identifiable in difference. For some reason, they resonate more with people, because, like, for example, in “Pledge”, where a child dies from a drug overdose, the fact that there was no happy ending is important in the sense that when children watch this episode Well, in fact, anyone who watches this episode is aware of the devastating effects of drug use, and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs. <br /> <br /> Brave, brave and sometimes thought-provoking, Bravestarr is certainly brave, brave and evocative. The iconic classic caricature for many years dared to take some risks, but in the end it paid off. Many cartoon fans will remember him as one of the most interesting, as well as the best cartoon films of the 80s, and this is true. <br /> <br /> 8 and a half out of ten
