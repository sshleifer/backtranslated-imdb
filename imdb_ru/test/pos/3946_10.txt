The weakness of this lies in the tangled telling of stories, the stories often appear from nowhere. But it really didn't matter, because I still enjoyed it full-length. As soon as you really accept that these films should not be taken too seriously, you will enjoy even more. In fact, this is a love story, initially confusing, but as it develops, it really deserves attention. Of course, this was done many times before, but the complex version of this is quite inspiring and touching. <br /> <br /> The initial fantasy and cgi were stunning at first, but I still enjoyed their goal. And people stopped whining about how this is borrowed from other films !! Guess what we know !! And it does not matter, because his goal was to amuse and entertain. Sometimes people have to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start yapping. To compare this with Hollywood standards is completely stupid and ignorant, it is a completely different style and target audience. As for me, some of the best films I have loved are from oriental producers and directors. This is your police history 4, Shaolin football, kung fu hustle, dragon tiger gates, fist of legend, hero, sneaking tiger, etc. For example, I like this movie. I will always be interested in these types of films. Now try to judge my perception, but I warn you, I see things from the point of view of those five countries in which I lived. So you better be as experienced and open.
