From the collapse of the introductory theme, "The Man with the Golden Hand" is the classic entertainment of the 1950s. There's nothing tricky here, Frank returns home from prison with a monkey on his back and returns directly to the old district, where the old scum are still hiding. This is the story of his dark journey with all his emotional baggage. All performances are a little overripe, but this is part of the fun of watching. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are memorable and almost steal the show. This is the Manchurian Candidate, in my humble opinion, the two greatest chairmen of the Council on films. Do not miss any of them.
