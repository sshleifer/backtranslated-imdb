I saw the film at the final gala concert of the Illy Film Festival in West London (England). I liked it immensely. Although the crow and the Chinese policeman do not appear, Dan Milligan becomes Dan Madigan (played by Sean Hughes (I)). The interaction between Dan and the Author (writer / director) voiced / played by Lord Richard Attenborough works very well. <br /> <br /> It is rumored that Lord Attenborough and Elliot Gould (like Dr. Goldstein) appeared in the film for a pint of beer. <br /> <br /> Spike was shown a movie on video before dying, and, apparently, he enjoyed it immensely.
