Concerning the Bollywood epic melodrama about a 10-year-old girl who finds out that she is adopted and intends to find her own mother. The main success of the film - the performance of PS. Kirtana, who plays the girl. The first half of the film is very good. There are also some really good songs, especially the number that represents the main character. Unfortunately, the second half of the film, which takes place in a war-torn Sri Lanka, feels like a completely different and disappointing film. It is good for explosions and special effects when Sri Lankan soldiers and insurgents dodge grenades, run from fireballs and twitch at trick wires. All that the film has to offer is cheap platitudes like "Someday there will be peace" and "Perhaps the children will find a way out." The final sequence, where the daughter and mother are reunited, is good, but so overloaded with music and timely rain that it seems to be a hoax. I know, I know, it's all in the style of Bollywood. But this is a story where big moments just distract from the simple, powerful central story. Bollywood, of course, can sometimes be a little more restrained.
