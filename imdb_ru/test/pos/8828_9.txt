I highly recommend it to anyone who likes good stories, good actors (even if they are not very well known) (often it's just better), science and / or science fiction, presented in an intelligent way on the (small) screen, good effects, even they did not have billions of dollars to produce this ... <br /> <br /> much better than any war in the stars ... <br /> <br /> there was only one comment that was not necessary: ​​speaking about a comet, the commentator says that LIFE may have been brought to earth via a comet ... it's funny, everything but should have a chance for a magical way, huh?! This is what is good in life, can come anywhere, do not need external forces
