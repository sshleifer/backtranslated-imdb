There are several aspects of the Park films, and in particular Wallace and Gromit, that I would say make them so wonderful. The first is subtlety and observation, the flagship of which is the character of Gromit. He does not speak, he does not make any noise, all he has is his eyes, forehead and body posture, and this is what he commands the film. The park manages to give us everything we need, from this silent character to the expression of his face. Comedy and emotions are transmitted through the finest movements, and it works great. <br /> <br /> When watching a movie, you should know the whole screen. Usually you will be guided by things in the movies, the screen will not be too cluttered, there will not be many things that will distract you from the main clue or action. Looks like Park should look into their films differently. He throws additional content to his audience, in the background, away from the screen, even off-screen, there is an action, and in the foreground there is always something that catches the eye. His films about repeated viewing and opening, they are layered with jokes and auxiliary actions. <br /> <br /> In this movie, layers of things appear on the screen, jokes in the foreground can be on the label of the jar and in the background. shadows that give effect. You can imagine that for the Park films have always been an event, and the films that he loves are those that he wants to watch again and again. This is what is shown in his films and in his most beloved characters. <br /> <br /> Then come the fancy and bizarre inventions that Wallace makes, which is reflected in the plotline and plot twists. the plot, everything is strange and behind the wall, and yet it seems to be completely normal in this world. You can imagine that inside the Park is the mind of Wallace. <br /> <br /> There is one more thing that makes these films so unique: modeling and precise hand animation. I have to admit that I was worried when I knew that Dreamworks was involved in the creation of this film, and I thought they would bring their computer animation experience to the fore. What I was afraid of is that Wallace and Gromit become CGI objects, or at least CGIs are used to purify the sensation that modeling brought to the film. <br /> <br /> Not so. You can still see fingerprints and tool marks on the characters, and this is far from distracting from the film, it just adds to it the real sensations and sensations of physical depth for the characters and the scene on the screen. <br /> <br /> So from the movie? Well, I have to say that the turn of the plot was what I was thinking long before the movie was in the cinema, and this was not a surprise, but it had no effect on my pleasure. In fact, watching the plot turn and the comic time of discovery and reaction, all this was, and I was just as sucked as if it were a thriller, but I was laughing all the time. <br /> <br /> Watching the film was exciting in many ways. To see the animation complete, how wild the inventions are, how Wallace gets in trouble, and Gromit will pull him out, where all the cross-references are in the film and where all the jokes are! I have to admit that after talking with my friends I could not believe how much I missed. <br /> <br /> In this film there is something different than with others, here is a new level of humor for adults, and I do not mean rude jokes (although there are a couple who are so British that you cannot stop yourself from laughs), I mean jokes that just fly over the heads of children, but hit adults in the face. What you are used to seeing comes from something like Pixar. This only adds to the appeal of the film. <br /> <br /> Alright, let me try and be a bit negative. I did not notice the voices in this film, you know how you usually listen to the actors and see if you can recognize them? Well, I was too passionate about the film to care or notice who they were ... well, it's not negative. Let me try again. The main plot was not as strong and exciting as I expected, and I found myself embroiled in side stories and the characters themselves ... again ... this is not bad, the film was so rich in entertainment. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can't figure out what to say about this bad film, probably the worst thing I can say is that the sequence of headlines at the end is rather repetitive ... as long as bye final title! In fact, this is the worst thing I can say. <br /> <br /> The story is very funny, well thought out, well written, well executed. There are many fantastic characters here, not just Wallace and Gromit. There are so many things happening on the screen, so many mentions and jokes (see Lady Tottingham dresses), jokes with cheese everywhere, jokes for the whole family. The characters are magnificently absorbed, and you realize that you took them before you understand. There is so much for everyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> I can say and write so much, but I know that this will quickly turn into a useless exercise for Park and Aardman, and also just turn into a series of "this bit was really funny" and "there is a bit when ... ‚Äù, and I would prefer to say that this is an excellent film, watch it and experience everything for myself, I will say, though, that the rabbits are excellent!
