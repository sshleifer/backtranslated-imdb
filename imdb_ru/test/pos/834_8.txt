Well, this is a good movie. However, you have to admit that Van Dame's films have not been so good lately. On the other hand, if you are a fan of the hardcore Dame van, you should watch out for this, as there is a huge improvement in the fighting scenes. Also, what I really liked was music is beautiful music. I'm sure it will kill time if you are an action fan. As for Isaac Florentin, director of Undisputed 2, I do not think he did a good job, as he did with Undisputed. I can't wait for one day when Van Dame films will appear in theaters before the DVD. Maybe once :). <br /> <br /> In the end, it’s worth seeing if you don’t have any other action movies to watch, it can make your hour and half the fun.
