To make it as easy as possible. This is a very good show. It is well written and has a fantastic composition. It is not loaded with blood and guts. And the focus is on the disgraced policeman and his relationship with his ex-wife, his son, his former partner (Andre Brauger), his childhood friend, now a priest (George Dzunzd), and finally a man who accidentally fell into his hack . You will probably find something similar in your city NO. This is still a good story YES. And it's nice to see a man portrayed by a good father, despite his shortcomings. See more than one (2-3), and you will understand why many of us are passionate about this show. And thanks to David Morse for making this character so interesting. Another good job!
