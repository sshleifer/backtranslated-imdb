I was shocked by how good this German version of films such as Scream are. Surpassing all modern American filmmaking efforts. <br /> <br /> This is what all these films don't do. Nice characters, genuine mystery, suspense, graphic killings and a great soundtrack. <br /> <br /> This stylish horror movie is one of the best of its kind in recent years. German cinema only recently gaining momentum. It is a pity that more people will not go to watch such films, because they miss. It is easily available on DVD, so even if you hate subtitles, I think you should see it. It will be one of the best horror films that you will see all year.
