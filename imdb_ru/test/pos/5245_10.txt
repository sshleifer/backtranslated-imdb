I just saw the “Big Footprint” in the Vienna Museum for the first time. Immediately, I was amazed at the high image quality, the unusual format, and the fine detail. Who has ever seen such a documentary western style with John Wayne? And there is so much time, you can really look around on the screen, so much to see! Someone is always grateful that the scenes are often static, because every single shot is so well composed, and you want to do it. Even the game is good and fits well. The long time the pictures work is wonderful, you do not want to miss a single minute!
