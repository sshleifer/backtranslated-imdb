Margaret Colin plays a major role in this story; when I watched him, I remembered her episodic role in Adrian Lins film “Neverenny” as Diane Lane as a neighbor in a thin area of ​​New York. <br /> <br /> This film was surprisingly good, and Dian Stillman deserves praise for the exact depiction of class, crime, and wrongdoing that actually occurs in high-class neighborhoods (thoughts will perish!). This is real, but not overly dramatized; the audience is experiencing her accident, the pain he caused; negation; and the final decision. <br /> <br /> This is more than just a question of “what is a good person” when Colin talks with her husband ... this is a person’s character defined by a single action; and should they be condemned forever for their actions ?? Questions are relevant; It’s also fun to see a few cinematic references to Martha Stewart (that is, a fussy, annoying mother): her colleagues, who were once famous, consider Colin “the perfect hostess with perfect genes” ... (gag); and the scene where Colin is confronted by the police ("friends" also betray her later) .... <br /> <br /> Denial and fronts of American society are decided; (Oh, the murder does not happen here; it looks like the topic in the “Season of the purgatory” by author Dominic Dunn about the true murder of Martha Moxley; in Greenwich, Connecticut); Colin is aware of her crime; but consciously discovers that he perpetuates the facade, until he finally breaks down, rents or buys this film; she is an underestimated actress who copes well with these roles.
