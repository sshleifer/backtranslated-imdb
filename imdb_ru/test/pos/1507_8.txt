In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the decline and death of independent video companies, such as Vestron and Media, effectively closed the Italian horror films to most American audiences. Coincidentally (?) Italian genre films also declined in quality and profitability. <br /> <br /> Sometimes films such as Primal Rage, "sequels" such as Beyond The Door III, Troll 2, and a few Dario Argento films are posted on video, but most remain unreleased (before DVD) in the US for almost a decade or longer. Films from these lost years have become very popular and popular with horror fans. <br /> <br /> Of these films, “The Cat in the Brain” is probably one of the most promoted because of the legions of Lucio Fulci fans and the fact that he was not only the director, but also the star of their idol, Fulci himself . <br /> <br /> Although he’s not quite the best, he’s still better than most of his later efforts. His mad fans will love it. Italian horrors and hyallo lovers may also like it, depending on their taste, but I'm not sure of anyone else. People who only watch Hollywood things may not want to believe a word from the many vivid reviews here. <br /> <br /> One thing that struck me personally was the scenes featuring probably the only long-term contribution of Benito Mussolini to Italy, Cinecitta Studios. The name is instantly recognizable for any fan of Italian films. Until I saw it here, I could only imagine what it looked like.
