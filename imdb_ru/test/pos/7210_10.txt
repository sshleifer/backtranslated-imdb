If you have never been "Tromatized", this is the movie Troma to see first. Amazing acting, excellent soundtrack and incredible humor are perfectly combined with Troma's unique brand - storytelling and special effects. Despite the fact that the words Romeo and Juliet are retold verbatim, the fact that he remains in the iambic pentameter causes you to have a strange feeling that he is closer to Shakespeare than that perepravshy music video with DiCaprio and Danes. I assumed that I saw the final Shakespearean comedy when the cast of Moonlight revised Taming of the Shrew, but nothing comes close to Tromeo and Juliet. I highly recommend the DVD version, which contains the second sound track with director Lloyd Kaufman, which is as interesting as the main one.
