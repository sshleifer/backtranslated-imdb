I am a new convert that you could say. I borrowed a DVD from my local library. I have been interested in a samurai since I watched The Last Samurai. My dad told me that he once watched Shintaro as a child. He said it was pretty good. We are up to 3 episodes. I love it. It takes a little getting used to the duplicated English voices over characters speaking Japanese, but I still like it. It is a little strange to watch small pauses when ninja stars throw on characters, and they stick in a tree or a wall. I'm not used to it, but I am now. But I believe that this is the technology that they had in the 60s. I noticed that Shintaro is kind, friendly, ready to help those in need, he is very modest, most of the time he doesnâ€™t notice himself (he only says that he is better than a ninja enemy). I admire Shintaro for these qualities. It is really interesting to watch the fencing skills that Koichi Ose has. It's amazing. This series is for those who are interested in samurai.
