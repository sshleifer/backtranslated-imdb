The guys from Aardman made a cool, cute and wild adaptation of their short films "Wallace and Gromit" to show the length, like a man and his dog, inventors who seem to have great intelligence (or practicality) for the latter. In this case, they invented a machine that can capture all the rabbits that devour the crop throughout the quiet English village. Especially for Mrs. Tottington (or "Totti" for those who are "close"), much to the chagrin of Victor Quartermein, who simply wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust rifle. Wallace and Gromit seem to have succeeded with their car, but Wallace has some confusion: the car he made to make more food suddenly intersects with the rabbit - a curse is imposed! <br /> <br /> Much of this is as much carefree fun as a children's film can ask for, but it also inclines the hat to the oldest tradition in the classic cartoon farce: Looney Tunes, which, in turn, owes much to the silent comedy and vaudeville. Of course, the guys from Aardman (Nick Park and Steve Box) have more tricks, tricks and ingenuity in their material. It is never less surprising to see how they use stop motion, even when a joke or gag can be a little funny “ho-ho”, not a funny “ha-ha” (tired criticism, but I will say this). “The Curse of the Were-Rabbit” works so well on all fronts for the audience, in its distorted plot and sudden dives into the exposition (the Golden Bullet story discourages), Park and Box and the company never lose sight of the joy in the material. br /> <br /> It’s fuzzy, heartfelt and completely non-standard for children (even the youngest will like adventures and strange devices, such as the truck Wallace and Gromit ride), and for adults there are little notches in the classic English farce funky, absurd. Only (and I probably think of a minority here), compared to Chicken Run, this is almost frivolous work - the plot is less than a series of running jokes, and, of course, a lot of puns involving rabbits, monsters and carnivals. and cheese (and terrible people with ego in their arms like Fiennes voiced by Quartermaine). But when it sounds best, this is one of the most spectacular films of 2005. He gives me a stupid smile every time I watch on TV.
