I really liked this film when it was first released, and since then I have seen it every time. Political drama is effective, if not particularly new or inspired. The decades that have passed since the release of the film showed that the willingness to cut costs through public security is definitely not just a screenwriter. <br /> <br /> However, I think the most impressive element of this film is Jack Lemmon. It's amazing to watch him at work. He has the gift to be able to communicate so many times without saying a word. The next time you watch this movie, look at Jack's face when he says nothing. He does not need to say (or worse, to circle) so that you know what is going on in his head. <br /> <br /> I call this a spoiler because of the impression it made on me when I first saw the film: in the last scene of Lemmon in the film, when he lies on the floor, he feels a slight vibration. The horror in his eyes is one of the most frightening images I've seen in any movie. This is an ideal game, because it instantly conveys the threat that is about to arise - if Jack's character is so scared, something terrible will surely happen. And it is.
