Behind the nostalgic music, we see a boy getting off the train. He arrives from Yugoslavia to meet his father, a man whom he has not seen for ten years. At the train station, we meet a man. He never smiles. <br /> <br /> So, we begin our journey to Four Friends, the powerful and amazing film by Arthur Penn. You may ask why I began my review this way. Well, like this video box describes the movie. You may have realized that the film will be a story about a boy trying to get along with this insensitive person, and in the end he will come off the cover and show kindness. <br /> <br /> Well, if you bought, I have a bridge, I want to sell you. You see, modern Hollywood would make this movie. Penn has always been an outsider and has never resorted to the usual cliché stories. He always tells interesting stories about people (including Bonnie and Clyde, Chase, Alice's Restaurant and the underrated Mickey One), and Four Friends is no exception. <br /> <br /> A typical Hollywood film will be dedicated to a boy named Danilo. But the Steve Tesic script only focuses on this for about 4 minutes and then leaves it. We meet the adult Danilo, played by Craig Wasson (whom you can recognize from the Double Body and The Nightmare on Elm Street 3) and his friends Tom, David and passionate Georgia. The film tells us about the sixties. Now in a smaller movie, events will attract attention. But in the Quartet of Friends, such events happen, but Penn and Tesic are more involved in studying the character than the plot, and I think the film is better in this sense. We know the events; we don't need to dwell on them again. <br /> <br /> I know that I haven’t described most of the plot, but I don’t know if you can describe Four Friends. This is not one of those high-concept films that can be described in one sentence. This is a movie with a lot of moods and textures. It is also a truly emotional experience. The last twenty minutes of this movie made me cry. I am not ashamed to admit it. Rarely does a movie have such power that it can lead me to tears. Acting plays first, especially Craig Wasson, who seems to be one of the most underrated actors working today. This is such a complex, emotional presentation, and Wasson copes with it. He was supposed to get an Oscar for it. Another great performance is Jody Thelen, who plays an even more complex role than Wasson. But she copes with it very well and gives Georgia a certain dignity that most Hollywood actresses will not have enough (they will be too scared to even try; they are more interested in image than an excellent presentation;). She also deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Four friends did not get a big push in 1981. Perhaps people just didn't have the emotional ability to handle it. And ignorant leaders could not push it as just another “American graffiti” (it lacks “four friends”). So they let him die. It is a pity that this is one of the best films of the 1980s, a decade when more and more clever trash was created, and such great art was not at home. Please give this film a chance. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
