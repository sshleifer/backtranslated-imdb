I think I'm some kind of road runner fan. I don't care how predictable this is, I still laugh. "Beep, Beep" in most cases is predictable, although at the same time it is rather inventive. Of course, the coyote pursues a road runner, and, of course, the coyote cannot catch a road runner with each new attempt. Coyoteâ€™s plans are very funny. You see exactly where this goes wrong, and you will not be disappointed. Well, once you are disappointed, but what you think will happen will not happen, but it will make the joke even funnier. <br /> <br /> If you like Road Runner shorts, you'll like it. Predictable gags work, and the animation is excellent and quite original.
