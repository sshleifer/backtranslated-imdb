The films of Shah Rukh Khan and Yash Chopra never disappointed. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a romantic classic. Dil To Pagal Hai was fresh and perfect for viewing. Mohabbayein remains one of my favorite films. And Veer-Zaara was magical. Darr, though not the best, is a romantic thriller that is different from the aforementioned films, but definitely worth watching. And SRK, which impressed me with a great performance in Baazigar, repeats the villainous act. And this time he invites experienced Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol. <br /> <br /> Before I comment on acting, not only acting, but also a wonderful script, is worth a look. This is a letter that complements the great game. The story is exciting, but characterization is what stands out. The comedy track goes well. But the film tends to shift too much in romance. The spectator will surely lose interest, and you will make a couple of yawns. But the film is still good. <br /> <br /> Shah Rukh Khan brilliantly copes with the role of the author. Shah Rukh Khan is once again responsive and cruel. You must cry at the end. Juhi Chawla decent. Her screams should become annoying after a while. But in terms of expression she is excellent. But her final scene is gorgeous (although she was overshadowed by SRK). She has the role of the author, which makes her very cute. Sunny Deol adequate. His character was very pleasant, but too perfect. And after a while it gets boring. Although he does a good job. Anupam Dick is really funny, but his role is felt a bit out of place. Tanvi Azmi is well supported. <br /> <br /> The songs are nice and come at the right time. Jadoo Teri Nazar (Magic At Your Sight) is my favorite song, and the presentation is very similar to the movie of the 90s. Tu Mere Saamne (you are in front of me) and Likha Hai (written here) are good love songs. Darwaza Band Kar Lo (Close the Door) is also a good love song. The instrumental song is danced to perfection just like the mischievous wedding song Solah Button. The film may not be perfect, but it's worth it, especially if your favorite actor is in it.
