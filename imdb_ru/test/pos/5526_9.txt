The trick of this 1934 Paramount comedy is six comedians, combined into three male and female teams that all appear together. W. Fields and his frequent screen partner Alsion Skipworth appear in the second half of the film and shine in their roles as sheriff and innkeeper in a small town. It seems that Fields was given the freedom to introduce many of his unique misanthropic surrealistic comedies into his role, and it works great, especially when he is allowed to perform his famous billiard table procedure, a retreat that can only be welcomed because it is fun. <br /> <br /> At first it seemed that this might seem to be a discrepancy to the presentation of the film, which would be filmed by the subtle inner comedy of Charlie Ruggle and Mary Boland next to the film. A wide, playful Vaudeville putter from the wonderful comedic team of husbands and wives George Burns and Gracie Allen, but here it works perfectly because the scenes show the roles of George and Gracie. They are freeloaders who travel to California for Ruggles and Boland's honeymoon and constantly find ways to annoy them at every turn, including brilliantly, each of which hangs on the side of a cliff for dear life. /> <br /> Rendering comic irritations to Burns and Allen to two sympathetic characters turns out to be an ideal way to adapt their far-reaching, more than vital comedic characters to the real world situation — comedies of people reacting to them in a believable way as gold mine and the very famous naive delivery Gracie. <br /> <br /> Charlie Ruggles deserves special mention for his performance as the fussy Pinkie Winnie banker. He is surprisingly subtle and undervalued, and he laughs at the lines that in the hands of another actor were not even heard. <br /> <br /> The script is surprisingly witty, and in most cases it is a completely extended comedy. a disappointment in which we sympathize with the poor Winnies who cannot get a single minute alone, and the added bonus is that they are only frustrated by more top-notch comedy materials from Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> For those who follow the preliminary code, some of the funniest scenes have some pretty promising material, as Winnie is trying to tell George WHY he and his wife want to be alone with. some time. <br /> <br /> There are a few signs of rushing production - the occasional leap jump, one of the most obvious drop-down sets you have ever seen in the film (right there with your own WC Field short “Golf Specialist”), and The knot in Field's tie is constantly changing in shape. This, however, does not bother me, and should not bother anyone who enjoys the film. <br /> <br /> “Six of a Kind” is a real little-known gem and one of the funniest films I've ever seen in a while. If you are thinking whether to watch it, the answer should be yes.
