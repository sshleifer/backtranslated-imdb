The New York Cinema Museum recently presented an extensive retrospective of Jacques Rivette films. Having fallen in love with his “Paris Nous Appartient”, I decided that it should not be missed. <br /> <br /> Mainly due to long frames and highly structured scenes, the film depicts two avant-garde theater companies preparing their performances. Aeschylus "Seven against Thebes" and "Prometheus". In addition, we are shown the aimless daily life of two people distantly associated with companies: a working class woman named Frederick, who finds creative ways to lure men out of her money, and a young man named Colin, who visits local cafes. posing as a deaf-mute, and plays on piercing mouth harmonicas until they pay him to leave. The first four hours or so are devoted to the establishment of characters and their models, before finally there is some kind of vague, bizarre plot with a conspiracy and deciphering secret secret letters. <br /> <br /> The film is mainly about life on the edge of society. Theater companies are a matter of despair, using their complex, emotionally draining exercises (which really have something to look at) to distract themselves from the fact that their actions are unlikely to ever be staged or even seen. Colin and Frederick have very few friends who only briefly find any excitement or purpose after the conspiracy touches them, as they are encouraged to learn more about it. The film reflects on the consequences of abandoning normal society in several memorable episodes, including the long frame of Colin, who wanders through the streets of France, shouting poetry to himself. Thus, the film was called the counterculture analysis of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There is no such frame that is not filled with energy and vitality. The fact that much of the dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous, much more direct. The camera also becomes an important character in this regard; throughout the film, boom shadows or other similar errors are visible, but they seem natural and correspond to the course of action, because the camera is so important to the player. <br /> <br /> More than anything, a film seems to me to be a great example of a different way to make a movie, a place for a film outside the usual pattern. For me, it was a frank experience, even more than the Paris Nous Appartient, although the latter has much in common in the subject and structure. Be sure to look for anyone who reflects on the nature of art.
