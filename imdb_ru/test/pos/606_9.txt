SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The misunderstood classic remains one of Henson’s best and most personal films. It may seem ridiculous to call the film as beloved as this one, “misunderstood,” but people seem to remember this film mainly because of the harsh script of Jerry Jule and Paul Williams' knockout songs. Now, although these things, admittedly, are great, as is the formal playfulness of the film (script inside the script, the break of the film, etc.), What distinguishes the “Muppet Film” from other Muppet films is serious, thoughtful the thread that goes through the picture. This is a road film, well, but, like most road films, it is a pleasure to get there, and the achievement of the goals of the heroes is held back by uncertainty and the realization that they will never return. Throughout the film, we are shown the opposite side of show business, even before the dolls “did it”: Piggy throws Kermit, without thinking, on the phone from her agent, Gonzo expresses loneliness and regret for the performer’s life on the road in his pursuit I'm going to go back there sometime, ”and, worst of all, Kermit is constantly tortured and checked by Doc Hopper, who wants him to commercialize his art for the most ugly purposes. (One can only wonder what Henson would have done because of the management of the company by his family after his death.) Kermit himself suffers because of his choice in the conversation scene in the desert, and the last question about the Magic Shop raises the question whether it was worth it Moreover, before concluding that this probably does not matter in any way. All of this is interspersed with Muppet’s expected chaos and satire and delightfully terrible jokes, and, of course, serious things would not have worked if it hadn’t. But “The Muppet Film” is not just another joke, like other Muppet films with diminishing returns. No, this is a beautiful, soft metaphor about the relationship between art, entertainment and business, and today it is just as effective as it was 25 years ago. 9.5 out of 10.
