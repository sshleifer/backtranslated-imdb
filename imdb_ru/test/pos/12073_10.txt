I have nothing but praise for this film and the cast, especially Ann Margaret. But more importantly, I highly appreciate my relatives who were (are) the foster parents of Warren and Frank in real life. I met most of the “children” at the Warren wedding in 1989. This is an amazing story, and it’s even more incredible for me to know the family and what everyone went through. I am also pleased to see my relatives portrayed in the film. It was pretty accurate. My wife even likes to see such little things as a toaster that she remembered from childhood. Yes, it's a heavy film, but so amazing and soulful. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this story for me is how many children have passed through my family life; marry my daughter and have warren as brother-in-law as i met in mine. The past 20 years, this story has become part of my life thanks to the fact that my mother-in-law has shared with me. This and knowing Warren. For what it's worth, Warren lives in California with his family. He married his lover in high school, with whom he reunited during his 20-year-old reunion in high school. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s there was a show called “It's unbelievable.” They had a family reunion, which also had to meet with the actors of the show. <br /> <br /> Someone's interest, DVD is available in the UK and Australia. This is a complex video that can be viewed here in the United States, and I haven’t yet been able to find a DVD here.
