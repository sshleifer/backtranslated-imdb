In an era when almost every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being reworked for viewers who have been separated from the horrors of today, which are not very good, it is instructive to look back at THE THE THE THE 1982 THE OPHONE, which itself is a remake - The childhood favorite of the director, the science fiction / horror classic by Howard Hawks of 1951, The Thing from Space. Although Carpenter’s film was not originally such a big box office when it was released in the middle of 1982, it has since received a very large number of fans. <br /> <br /> In fact, Carpenter’s film is not a remake of Hawks’s film. how it is processed, as it returns to the original idea set forth in the source material, namely to John W. Campbell’s story “Who goes there?”, in which the US alien scientists in the Antarctic are threatened by a shape-changing alien thawed out of ice after 100,000 years . Kurt Russell, who starred in the role of Carpenter in the 1979 film director Elvis and in the film Escape from New York in 1981, heads the acting role in such intense roles as Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart and Richard Mazur . a completed paranoia study, because the form-changing “thing”, which for the first time comes to its camp in the form of a guide dog, which the Norwegian team is trying to kill, captures each of them one by one. Soon everyone in the camp starts not to trust their fellows. The end of the film, in which only Russell and David remained, has an alarming and frightening ambiguity, similar to similar codes for both “Birds” and “Dogs Dogs”. <br /> <br /> Almost everywhere, when the subject of “Things” is bought up, the focus is on the extremely bloody makeup of special effects and alien projects created by Rob Bottin, who worked with Carpenter on the 1980 horror film THE FOG, and on the werewolf film Joe 1981 Dante's "HOWLING". These effects are really quite spectacular and graphical, and even today they can also be quite exhausting. But all of this would have made Carpenter’s film nothing more than a high-class epoplei, if the direction, plot, and acting were out of sorts; and, fortunately, each of them. When he doesn’t focus on extremely horrific transformation sequences, Carpenter creates uncertainty in the same way that Hitchcock influenced, as was in his previous films HALLOWEEN and TUMAN, with cinematographer’s prowling cinematographer’s work, what is significant Help. The game enhances the already excellent adaptation of the script by Bill Lancaster; and we are also given the difficult account of Ennio Morricone, whose work on classic Italian spaghetti westerns by director Sergio Leone of the 1960s is well known to everyone, including, of course, Carpenter himself. THE THING also has additional great visual effects from Albert Whitlock (who worked on many Hitchcock films, including BIRD) and Roy Arbogast, who worked on Close Relations of the Third Kind and Jaws 2. <br /> <br / > Carpenter's. The film was not as successful as it could be, because Universal decided to release this graphic shocker just two weeks after it released Steven Spielberg’s much more family-owned ET: EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (Sparingly, critics and viewers preferred Spielberg’s a great movie on top of Carpenter, just as excellent, but extremely different). In addition, most of the box office horror films in 1982 went to another film, filmed by Spielberg, POLTERGEIST. As a result, due to lack of attention at one time, HISTORY suffered from 15 million dollars. <br /> <br /> However, over time, many people came to see Carpenter’s film about what it is - an extremely gloomy, but extremely reasonable combination of science fiction and horror, made with great sensitivity and a true understanding of psychological paranoia at the heart of its history. Although it is still pretty awful, THING should be remembered just for the skill with which the story is composed, as well as for the bloody designs of aliens and the effects of makeup; because the ability to tell stories and uncertainty make it so memorable in the long run.
