As I recall, my family decided to stay at home the night Nichols was passing (Monday? Tuesday? NBC?). It was an excellent car for James Garner, a very well-written, great cast. His character is very similar to the films "Support your ...": a retired player with a mysterious past settles in the city and makes adventures every week. In fact, it seemed pretty obvious that it was the same character. It was just a TV show caster. Asleep, like "My world and welcome to it," which may have been his contemporary - I forgot. I would really like these shows to be available on DVD. It was just a good TV. Perhaps Briscoe County Junior come closer, but only a mile away.
