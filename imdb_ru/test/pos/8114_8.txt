I liked that the mood was light and airy. I liked that the main character wanted to get guarantees about his future, and that his roommate puts him "straight" out of all people. I liked that they studied the dynamics of how the members of the male group communicated with each other, given that it was directed by a lesbian, the whole topic of masculinity was exposed, ridiculed, dissected and questioned. What is a man doing? What makes a man straight, gay or bisexual? You are not quite sure whether our main character has decided who he really wants; he lives a moment and threw caution to the wind. These and other reasons make me love this movie.
