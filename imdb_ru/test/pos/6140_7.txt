I did not plan to watch this film, however I was not disappointed when a friend dragged me along. Although there are no real surprises here, the guys feel good with their obviously modest budget. <br /> <br /> If you saw the trailer, you probably know what to expect from this type of film, and there is a fairly constant stream of jokes here, with a couple of classic moments, with a high point, probably being an excellent memory what the guys in the 1980s looked like. In addition, I read elsewhere that the final was a disappointment, but I found it refreshingly different from what I expected from this genre. <br /> <br /> In general, this film will not change your life, but it laughs enough there to entertain you everywhere.
