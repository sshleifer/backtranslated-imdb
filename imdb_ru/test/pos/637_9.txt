It is always a well-known and important directorial tool for creating the atmosphere of a film in the first 5 minutes. In the decisive introductory scenes, the film should establish itself and make the audience notice and be interested in the rest of the film. Here in Mute Witness, we find a prime example of this. <br /> <br /> * In the first 5-10 minutes of the film, the very Hitchcockian scene of a pretty blond lady in her apartment, with the radio turned on, opens the scene. She wanders around, puts on lipstick, pounces on and ignores the message about the serial killer on the loose. Of course, the serial killer is in her house and watches her actions with a knife in his hand. She hears a noise, looks into the room, and her partner is in a pool of blood. At the very moment of her screams, she turns around to face a maniac owning a knife, who repeatedly strikes her in a cruel and terrifying act .... <br /> <br /> ... then something strange happens, While the woman convulsively hurts, the killer sits down and pulls out a cigarette to watch his victim die. Before he finds his lighter, his cigarette is lit ... from someone else in the room! The camera opens, and we understand that more and more people appear in the room, some take notes, some take pictures, some record death, and that the lady dies for a very long time and does a very boorish job about it too. When the audience understands what is happening and the whole scene becomes part of the film, the intense and terrifying scene takes on an element of humor. <br /> <br /> * End Scene Spoiler * <br /> <br /> I singled out this intro scene for several reasons. First, it perfectly reflects the atmosphere of the entire film. Hitchcock or De Palma thriller, with some very disorienting and even black humorous moments. - He conveys the central subject (the difference between “death on the screen of the film” and “death from the film“ Snuff film ””, a problem that will be discussed in detail later in the film), and finally, he presents the viewer to the characters as quietly as possible . <br /> <br /> The story of the film “Silent Witness” is centered around Billy Hughes, an American special effects makeup artist who works on the film set and is shot in a large warehouse in Moscow. Billy can't speak, but she speaks sign language through her sister. After finishing the filming of the evening, in Billy involuntarily finds himself locked in a vault by accident, and in her attempt to escape, she witnesses two crew members doing what the first, it seems, porn movie, but it turns out to be a snuff film. Suddenly, her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely addictive. Billy’s saving grace and her flaw is that she cannot make a sound. (Actually, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it is not crowded with screaming women). There are some perfectly disturbing points, and some excellent elements of real tension (Corridoor and the elevator shaft are excellent examples). The timing is smooth, and the entire first half incredibly satisfies on its own. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film introduces new concepts. While there are some more tense moments, the focus is on the plot twists. Introduced new characters, and it is ambiguous on whose side they are. Although in the second half of the film there is nothing bad as such, it does not quite correspond to the first half of the film. There are some pleasant moments of black humor that blend perfectly and accentuate some very dramatic scenes, but there are also some very flimsy comedic moments (especially from sister Billy and her bride, who turned out to be the director of the film Billy is working on). ), which almost destroy the film, simply because they are irrelevant and / or incorrectly chosen and spoil the pace. - At the end, the turns continue to come at a high speed, and the climax of the film, respectively, is just as tense as the first half. <br /> <br /> There are several things that really make the film Work. The communication barriers Billy has to face, being dumb and American in Moscow, mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation. The actress who plays Billy, Natasha Zudina, does a wonderful job in the film, with an attractive on-screen prowess, a brilliant performance and, finally, directing as a whole, but especially in the first half of the film, which really is the study of Alfred Hitchcock's unknown film / thriller techniques. <br /> <br /> As I said, the frustrations in the film are due to the terrible comic moments of relief that are not really needed. to be added There is already a consistent and effective band of dark humor that appears in the film without the need for the characters Karen Hughes and Andy Clark (the sister and director) to turn their scenes into some kind of unusual sitcom. Nevertheless, despite these shortcomings, the film is an exceptionally pleasant thriller and is ideal for group viewing on Halloween. (Of course, better than regular slasher horror movie ...!)
