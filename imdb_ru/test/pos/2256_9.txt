This is a beautiful, but simple film about a single person seeking to find an answer, an answer that he does not necessarily need, but has structured his whole life. It is heartbreaking, it is fun, it is magnificent, it is painful, it is delicate and dynamic, I say that it is brilliant. <br /> <br /> I read Jonathan Safran Foer's book “Everything Is Illuminated” (mainly because I heard Elijah Wood starred in the film version), and I was just in awe of the characters. I laughed out loud more than once. And every time someone talks about what is being said, I hear the same hackneyed answer, almost like one big long word: “It looks very attractive for a woman who saved him from Nazism.” However, this story is so philosophical; it goes deeper than that. This is a conversation about the ring and "just in case." It really makes you wonder. Suddenly, this story turns from a simple quest to an internal metamorphosis, and now I look at things a little differently. <br /> <br /> I recommend renting it earlier, if I read at all, because the book has many obscene, blatantly perverted stories that were not included in the film, mainly the story of Jonathan’s family, which was not necessary for the film. <br /> <br /> A little detail, as I heard, is that the current girl Wood in this film has a cameo as a drummer in the band that Alex arranges for Jonathan to play as he leaves the train to Ukraine. <br /> <br /> You spent half the movie trying to figure out exactly what and what Jonathan was about, because his character is so closed up like a turtle in a shell. <br /> <br /> This is great and, in my opinion, one of the best films of Elijah Wood.
