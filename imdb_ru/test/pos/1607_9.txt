I cannot fully explain why I find it so tempting, but Bars is not; this may be because here the focus is on everything that was great in this film, those intimate moments that Visconti can convey so great. As in this film, it has a stately slow pace, but this time it is not too long. This is a film where nothing happens, but it takes twenty minutes. I think this should be partly related to the way the film treats memories that act as their own mini-story. Like Leopard, he has a sympathetic leader who reveals the same worn pathos - although Bogard’s speech is more ready to open himself to be unattractive, especially in his eyes: he has a really stupid smile that is easy to dislike. It is often quite beautiful in quiet moments. This is the richness of Visconti films, the splendor of ballroom scenes, which I find boring because they exchange individual clarity with mass accuracy. But this is the essence of the question - Gustav is surrounded by visual noise. <br /> <br /> The way Gustav’s love object appears to us is quite brilliant — the camera shows a girl, a girl, a girl, and then this beautiful, feminine boy. This is like a hint of Shakespeare's sonnets, and it does not seem harsh. (Only when the camera fully considers Tadzio, we move away and we see his long, slender legs, we understand that he is not a boy, but a teenager - first we have to doubt Gustav’s attractiveness; Visconti must have known this, and he does not shy away from This. Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav, we understand the person, we know him. This is basically a silent performance, and when he opens his mouth, the poison erupts; separate and with Tadzio (we never know him, just like we never know a handful of Fellini’s grotesques; but this is because his life is different, his own film), but this is not as flirty as it seems (there is one The scene, however, where it revolves around a pole, is too much.) Tadzio doesn't necessarily lead him — he looks at him; Visconti only zooms out. <br /> <br /> In the film, Gustav is not depicted as gay — Tadzio does not even not a man, he is a sophisticated version of a boy (gentle, pale, thin, with golden curls), which everyone seems to be beat (including one magnificent, slightly older young man, with whom he fights). The closest they show that can be understood as a link to Gustav's homosexuality - the famous barber scene, which reveals his depressed vanity. <br /> <br /> This is not entirely successful - the whole section with Alfred is a waste and some unnecessary scenes, people carrying bags in a long shot, could be removed. Some parts are heavy, for example, when Gustav's boat stops, and noisy boys pass by him - his expression is too obvious. (But during the same scene, Gustav rushes into a fit, wanting a new rower, something so unexplainable, that it compensates for this.) But there are some scenes — touching for the first time — that create a wonderful, quiet intensity. Tadzio, repeating a piano song again and again, notes trembling in the air, may be the best example of the anxiety the film is causing. There is one discussion in which there is a debate that interests me especially: can art be spiritual if it satisfies feelings, or does it have to go beyond them? (We can consider Tarkovsky, who appreciates both Visconti and Mann, the main example of how someone goes beyond simple sensory sensations.) I think that this manages to do both. 9/10
