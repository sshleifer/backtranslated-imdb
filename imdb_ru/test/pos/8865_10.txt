I am ashamed to say this, but I have to admit that I saw this film for the first time just a year ago. Seeing him, I immediately ran out and bought a DVD edition for collectors, and since then I have watched it many times. <br /> <br /> The movie is awesome on many levels. It works as your direct monster or action movie, as horror / sci-fi, and also as a very intriguing look at the human psyche. An incredible sense of paranoia, distrust and fear, attached not only to the guidance of Carpenter (which is staggering), but also to the incredible play of the actors in general. Kurt Russell is (obviously) impressively understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct result, he "feels" like a real person, not like a Hollywood "completely American hero." All other actors play their roles with style, and the result is an incredibly believable atmosphere and a truly fantastic film.
