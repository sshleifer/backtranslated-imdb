When I first saw this film in mid-January (2005), I did not like it. I thought it was too strange, and I thought that some of the roles played by the main star of Judith Light were so different from her. (Which of course is true). And then I watched fragments of this film the next day, when it went on the air again, and I felt almost the same. Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20, 2005), and I really liked it, and this time I recorded everything on tape. I even cried the first 2 times, but mostly because the actress was actually crying, and I'm a big fan of her. <br /> <br /> This is a very well made and filmed television film. Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses, and I think she does an excellent job with this movie! I keep watching it again and again. This is a sad movie, but very good. <br /> <br /> If you havenâ€™t seen this movie yet, I definitely recommend it! Usually this is not my type of film, but I liked it! A +++
