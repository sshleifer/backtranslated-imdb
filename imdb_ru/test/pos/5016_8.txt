Stui Unger was a legend playing cards. in one of the interviews he said: “Someday I think that someone can become a better player in no-limit hold'em than me. I doubt it, but it can happen. But I swear to you, I don’t see how anyone could play gin better than I. "In this film there is a scene of denim rum, which is so amazing that you could take it off in X-Men as showing the mutant power of a superhero. That's how incredible this man is. <br /> <br /> I have a few minor issues with this film. No matter how gloomy this film is, Stui's real life was darker. About poker Todd Brunson said: " During the last World Series of Poker, Bob Stupak, Mike Sexton and I drank and talked about Stu. Mike told us how to he could barely talk, did not take a shower for several weeks and how his fingers were burned black by the crack. " In this film, Michael Imperoli looked too healthy to be frozen in the last years of his life. when Suey won his last wsop, he looked like a skeleton, but let's face it, there wasn’t enough time or “denier” for this production to carry out such a transformation. My other problem was that I would like poker to have more games with real hands and situations. Of course, this might bore the average non-poker enthusiast, but that would be nice for hardcore players. It is a pity that the film lasted no more than 6 hours. <br /> <br /> I watched a movie with three non-poker players, and they all really enjoyed it. Just as you do not have to be a former member of the colonial army to enjoy the “patriot” of Gibson, you do not need to be a poker player to see this gem. can't wait for the dvd. (8 out of 10)
