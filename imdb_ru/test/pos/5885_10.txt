The film shows another exceptional collaboration between director William Wyler and cinematographer Gregg Toland, the first after Toland worked on Citizen Kane. But the talent of both of these people was focused on creating a perfectly thought-out film, understood in a good old American sense as a great story. Technical aspects of the film are illuminated so that the viewer is immersed in the action that takes place on the screen, not subject to the power of the image. Technique is seen as a means of representation, unlike Citizen Kane, where the Baroque Wells style almost paid attention from the story to how the story was told. One of my favorite footsteps with deep focus in this film is the drama conveyed by the homecoming greetings of Homer and Al. If Homer's girlfriend, Wilma approaches him perfectly in focus, Al goes to his wife, also ideally in focus. This is a brilliant step because it shows only through the use of the image the nature of this relationship, as we will see them throughout the film: Wilma loves Homer, and she accepts him as he is, Al's wife loves him, but she is not ready for it . fully welcome him at home. Also later in the film, we learn that their marriage was not always a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> Wyler is a filmmaker whose strength lies in being faithful to his work without feeling the need to brag. He wanted to show his audience how hard it was for the American soldiers returning from the war to fit into a society that either did not understand them or treated them with contempt. With a perfect cast and a great dialogue, Goldwyn and Wyler created a film that will forever become a template for any other returning home movie. Three hours, which coincide with the “draft”, because the test audience then did not for a minute feel that the action was slow, and, indeed, every scene from the film seems to be completely justified. Everything is built beautifully, each character receives a sufficient amount of attention, nothing is left to chance, and it is a pity that Hollywood in our day never manages to cause so many conflicts of characters on the screen. TBYOOL explores the depth of the American way of life, the American family and society to such an extent that other films look like “kid's hour”.
