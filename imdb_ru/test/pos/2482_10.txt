It kicks you in the stomach. There are other films with more convincing characters, a more realistic story, and perhaps even deeper politics. But then again, most of them are not director Peter Watkins. Perhaps the only truly brilliant artist of British Film, who appeared in the 1960s, Watkins has made quite a few rare films that perfectly reflect the spirit of the external aesthetic world - the world of political achievements, social problems and government decisions. Thus, his work is probably less “cinematic” than, say, political, which some may call a weakening of their inherent artistic quality. Again, why shouldn't art allow itself to be engaged? Watkins dares. And it succeeds. You will not feel good with this. You will not feel happy. In fact, you don’t really like the movie; uncompromising, honest, direct, unscrupulous; In short, blow your face. You can not help but be angry, you can not resist the fact that the things that you see, touch you. This is what makes Watkins films so useful.
