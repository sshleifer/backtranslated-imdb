Dirty Harry goes to Atlanta - this is what Bert called this fantastic, first-class detective thriller, which borrowed part of his story from Dana Andrews respectable film “Laura”. Not only did Bert Reynolds play a major role in this excellent saga, but he also led it, and he does not make a single mistake either in the setting of the action, or in his role of the characters. A good job in the film, and Reynolds does an outstanding job of staging it. Henry Silva is truly icy as a hired killer. <br /> <br /> Detective Tom Sharkey (Burt Reynolds) deals with a drug case in underground Atlanta when things go wrong. As a result, he pursues the suspect and shoots him with a gunman on the bus. During the fight an innocent bystander dies. John Wu's Killer repeats this scene. Anyway, the Atlanta police department interrupts Burt to Vice, and he receives an order from the new boss, Frisco (Charles Durning, “Oh, brother, where are you?”) In the basement. Sharkey falls into a real cesspool of crime. Sharkey and his fellow detectives Arch (Bernie Casey) and Dad (Brian Keith) establish surveillance of the expensive call girl Domino (Rachel Ward from After Dark, My Sweet), who has a luxurious apartment that she shares with another girl . <br /> <br /> Domino is meeting with local politician Hotchins (Count Holliman from Police Woman), who is in favor of the governor, but the main villain Victor (Vittorio Gassman from Dirty Game) wants him to finish the job. Hotkins reluctantly accepts Victor, so Victor has the snorting cocaine of Billy Scott (Henry Silva from Wipeout) destroys Domino. Billy blasts a hole the size of a twelve-inch pizza at the door of Domino’s apartment and kills it. <br /> <br /> Sharkey did an incredible. During the observation, he fell in love with Dominoes to such an extent that he was hopelessly addicted to it. Sharkey’s mission in life is to destroy Victor, but he learns that Victor has an informant at the Atlanta police station. The plot really heats up when Sharkey finds out later that Billy shot the wrong girl and that Domino is still alive! Sharkey takes her into custody, and everything becomes even more complicated. He collects his “Machine” from the title to deal with Victor and his hoods. <br /> <br /> William Fracker’s widescreen image is immaculate. Unfortunately, this highly underrated classic is only available as a full-frame movie. Fraker definitely contributes to the atmosphere of the painting, especially during injuries on the boat, when the villain cut off one of Sharkey’s fingers. This is a pretty awful scene. <br /> <br /> Bert never made a film that surpasses Sharkey’s Car.
