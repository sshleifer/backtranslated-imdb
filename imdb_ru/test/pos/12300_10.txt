I first saw this film in Austria when it first came out, and I was fascinated by this. This is a passionate and deeply touching work that all cinema connoisseurs should experience. What a shame that he was never released in DVD format. Perhaps this will be corrected the other day, as it would be truly embarrassing if one of the best films ever made was forgotten and left to disappear in some kind of film strip forever. <br /> <br /> Why is this so? Movies "B", such as "American Wedding" and "Eurotrip", receive widescreen and full-screen issues, and often this special edition with many comments and additions, while such great works as "The Dead" are almost forgotten?
