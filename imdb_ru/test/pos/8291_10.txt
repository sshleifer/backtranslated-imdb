One of my favorite children's films. Chipmunk Adventures is an incredible fun for young and old. The animation is lively and colorful, and the film itself boasts some of the best songs ever added to the animation film. Who could forget the dynamic “Boys / Girls of Rock and Roll”, the exciting “Diamond Dolls” and the heartbreaking “My Mom”? <br /> <br /> This should be considered a nostalgic classic animated stone of the eighties. It is a pity that they no longer make them so. Most animated films today resort to violence, harsh humor, or a sentimental mess ... with the exception, of course, of the guys from Pixar. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: an amazing and unforgettable adventure for all ages
