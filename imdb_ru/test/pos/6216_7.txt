This educational show focused on emotions, interactions and relationships. It was produced at the ABC branch of Detroit and syndicated to 90 markets throughout the country. Last week, a 1-1 / 2 hour video clip was shown on Detroit public television as part of their promising campaign. Wow, the memories that surfaced! While I recalled the series, there were episodes that I had forgotten, but immediately remembered how they would begin (“Hot invention, HOLY PRAY!”, Detective Tomato and the cakes on his face) <br /> <br /> For more information on special public television, search for "Hot Fudge Comin 'Atcha Concert"
