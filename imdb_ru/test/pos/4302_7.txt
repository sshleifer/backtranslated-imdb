This is a well-produced episode of "Colombo", in which there is also some good character, but the story simply does not know enough interesting and does not look as good as in the case of the film "Colombo". This also applies to the assassin's plot to kill his uncle. It is quite simple and does not seem well thought out. Perhaps this film was not serious enough, since the atmosphere of the film is mostly light. At least when compared with different films of Colombo. <br /> <br /> For example, the movie has quite a lot of funny things, mostly from the very character of Colombo. This makes the movie enjoyable to watch, but at the same time gives you the feeling that they have somehow overdone it, especially because it does not correspond to most other Colombo films. <br /> <br /> The characters are good and it helps that this shows Martina Landau in a double role. It is always fun to see how differently he looked in his youth, while, for example, a man like Peter Falk has not changed much over the years, he has just become grayer. The film also features Julie Newmar, who is best known for playing Catwoman on the Batman TV series of the 1960s. Funny how she still moves like Catwoman in this movie. Deliberate or is it just her course of action? <br /> <br /> Watching a Colombo movie is nice and pleasant, but it also creates the feeling that everything could be much better with a more thoughtful script. <br /> <br /> 7/10
