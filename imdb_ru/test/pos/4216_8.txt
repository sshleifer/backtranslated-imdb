It is just like that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucks. Now the fourth in the series, which, in my opinion, the best of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this movie. As for the dolls, they were better than a few actors that come to mind (for example, Freddie Prince Jr.), and funnier than many of the comedies I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The plot wasn't great but I really didn't care about that. Just to see Chuckie and Tiffany quarrel and fight each other. And the final leaves it wide open for the fifth sequel (which I heard is in the works). “Free Hands” premiere next week, and it looks like it will be another horror / comedy, but I doubt it will surpass it.
