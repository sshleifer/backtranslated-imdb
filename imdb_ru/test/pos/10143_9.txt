“The Man Who Knew Too Much” (1956) is a remake of the film made by Alfred Hitchcock in England in 1934 with the same name. In my opinion, his later efforts are much higher. Many critics and fans of Alfred Hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and does not cause tingling in the spine of the original with Peter Lorre. In both films, the plot is almost the same, except for the original, set in Switzerland, and a remake in Marrakesh. He tells the story of a married couple {James Stewart and Doris Day}, resting with his young son and meeting a suspicious man who is very interested in their past. As it happens, he is an agent who is looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader. He then gets stabbed at the market in Marrakek because it turns out that he is a spy, and continues to fall into the hands of Stewart. Dying, he tells him the whole story of a murder conspiracy. Then Stewart and Day learn that another couple they met was the couple the agent was looking for and kidnapped their son. The film contains excellent performances of Stuart and Day in a Direct Dramatic Role, as excited and frightened parents. This film proved that Doris Day could be filmed in exciting dramas, as well as in light-hearted musicals. Director Alfred Hitchcock is first class. The film keeps you on the edge of your place every minute. The scene at Albert Hall is a classic. The original is very slow and boring. I do not know how people can compare them. Just watch the remake and you will like it. I give the film 9 out of 10.
