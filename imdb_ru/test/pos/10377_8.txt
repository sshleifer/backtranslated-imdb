This film was pretty enjoyable for me, I mean, it was not great, but it was one of the best horror films of late. It seems that it was small, almost the size of state benefits, but it has its charms, as in the lovely ladies. The atmosphere was also good (which many horror films lack now). Acting was a typical affair of the 1980s, when you do not know that this is a “stupid” game. But this is what Lucio Fulci films were full of, they like that this film had an atmosphere that was lacking in the plot, money, etc. They more than made up for the horror, the blood and the atmosphere for the film itself. <br /> <br /> This is just a typical low-budget horror movie that you can watch, I watched it all the time and I love horror movies. I saw films in which I simply disconnect for 10–20 minutes or sit and go ahead if it’s on video, or skip the scenes on DVD. This film did not make me want to do it, I sat and watched it to the very end, not wanting to miss parts. <br /> <br /> However, I would have liked it if people like zombies were a little more scary because they were as scary as Freddy Kreugger as a nanny. But seriously, though, if they were a little better, it would be an impeccable budget, maybe. <br /> <br /> The music in this film was top notch, the perfect music of horror. I have seen horror movies where the music is good or average, but it could have been better, thank God, although there was no metal music in this film. <br /> <br /> I have been a die-hard metal fan since 1990, but in horror films metal music spoils it, the film loses much of the atmosphere when any type of music is playing, except for the score. So I am glad that in this film there was no music other than your regular score, which was rather creepy, well done. <br /> <br /> One could use “Profane Grace - Epitaph Of Shattered Dreams” in it, although, since this is keyboard music, there are no guitars, nothing but “really” creepy keyboard tracks. As on the first track "Forever Sleep", you hear the wind blowing through it, followed by some kind of goose bumps. Someday the track on this CD was the same, perfect horror music at its best, it would be perfect for this movie. <br /> <br /> The only unattractive girl in the film for me is the one who was beaten / killed (or so they make us believe) and hanged like a scarecrow, only to get free and try to escape later. Any other woman in the film was really good, the big 9 out of 10 for all of them, except the one I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> I would like Hollywood (the main part of the events) to give money to Romero and the guy who made this film. Since giving it to them at the cinema is a much better decision than giving it to the idiot map named Paul Anderson from the “Resident Evil” stuffing. <br /> <br /> Well done, guys, this is not bad, not bad. In general, I liked the role in the last credits, when they continued to show you the clips from which they were shooting the film (off-screen). Not many films do such things, which I thought added a little to the film, as it also showed you some impressions, and it is always good if you ask me. <br /> <br /> The rating of this film is 8/10, the rating of the beautiful girls in the movie 9/10, the rating of the atmosphere in the movie 9/10, the rating due to the movie 9.5 / 10.
