Taking the replicas of classical music "Liberation" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" as a basis, Jeff Lieberman's book Before Dawn may not give much new in terms of plot - the maniac pursues and kills a group of vacationers, but still he manages to be an effective shocker. thanks to the skillful handling of the material by the director, the magnificent use of stunning scenery, the greater use of women in shorts, the brooding synthesizer from Brad Fidel and the elegant twist at the end (although one that should be obvious to those who noticed). <br /> <br /> Thanks to the solid performances of his capable actors, including the winner of Oscar George Kennedy in the role of the forester Roy McLean, in Just Before Dawn there is a sense of realism, and all too often there is no such kind of fare. The film also offers a rather creepy maniac (who giggles like Dick Dastardley Mutley's dog and uses a nasty jagged machete to kill), and offers a couple of very original episodes that help raise him over many of his contemporaries: a woman without topless (gratuitous nudity box is good and indeed marked) in the lake, it discovers that the hand that felt it under water does not belong to her boyfriend; and a myopic character examines the girlfriend of his friend (jokingly), not knowing that the person who is slowly approaching is not his friend, but a murderer.
