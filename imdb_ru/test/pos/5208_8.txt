A film about the Battle of Stalingrad. For those of you who know nothing about this, this was the worst battle in World War II. More than 1 million people died during the battle. This is the only film I have seen that seems to capture how badly it was in the war between Russia and Germany. What I really liked about this was that the two ideologies (Nazism and Communism) were not in the film anywhere. Unlike most American films, the Germans are not viewed as bloodthirsty killers, but as an ordinary German infantryman, man. <br /> <br /> The film tells about four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were transferred there to try to capture the city. The film tells about these people from August 1942 to the beginning of 1943. During this time, they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle. <br /> <br /> During the entire film, the despair of the whole battle is felt. Unlike Enemy at the Gates, the filmmakers did not try to invent some juicy love story or dress up the events of the battle. This film may be fantastic, but it conveys what happened in the bloodiest battle in World War II.
