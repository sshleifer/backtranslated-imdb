Well, I have to say that I had a chance to see this show here in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, somewhere in June 06. And I really liked it. My beloved Madonna has always been the era of the 1990 Blond Ambition tour. For me, this is "MADONNA". "Now that she is the mother of three years old, she has to change some things to fit motherhood. And I completely agree. This is Madonnaâ€™s classic concert. I want to" live to tell "not was edited. We saw how the body falls from the buildings on 911 we can see the woman on the cross ... anyway, I look forward to the release of this tour on DVD and hope that this show is not completely edited and with a bunch of bonus shots. She is an artist all the time. The best is there ... and still on top and gaining strength. Long live MADONNA!
