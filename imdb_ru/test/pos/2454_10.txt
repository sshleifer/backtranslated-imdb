I have never heard of this movie and only got it because I'm a fan of Martin Sheen. Now I am overwhelmed by why he did not receive the praise and recognition he truly deserves. All four characters make you feel for them: the father tries to assert his authority, the mother still clings to traditional family values ​​and tries to maintain appearance, despite the complete fragmentation of her family, the daughter wants her life and the son pursues his experience in Vietnam. One felt that this was a scenario that was supposed to be played out in thousands of “ordinary” families after Vietnam. Emilio Estevez in the role of Jeremy was great - completely upset by his military experience, to which none of his family could relate. The screen chemistry between him and his real father, Martin Sheen, was amazing. And there were times when Emilio’s agonizing face was the same as Martin’s in Apocalypse Now. I am sure that in the same way as Martin considered Apocalypse to be one of his best films, Emilio also considers this film to be one of his best. The gun scene was simply overwhelming, as all the emotions were on the faces of the family. The brilliant game of Esteveza, Sheena and Katie Bates. I watched the movie for the first time last night - and today the main news in the news was a story about a Gulf war veteran who shot several members of his family. How many more young people will die from the war?
