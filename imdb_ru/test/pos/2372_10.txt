Dead or Alive: Final, a film that supposedly unites three films in the very free trilogy "Dead or Alive" and is associated mainly with its stars, Ricki Takeiuchi and Sho Aikawa, and that each film has its share of weird adaptations and neuroses of the world and a lot violence is admittedly the weakest of all. The fact that none of the three films turned out to be disappointing testifies not so much about the creative potential of the material, but about the pound for pound courage that the director Takashi Miike perceives with the environment and the material. Here he represents a frankly dystopian future, albeit a modest one, where the homosexual mayor / dictator (Richard Chen) rules the entire village with drugs, with the exception of the rebel group. In this year of 2346 there are also replicants-robots, one of which is Ryo (Aikawa), a robot with full lethal skill, but also capable of love, study, and so on. Then the policeman, Takeshi (Takeiuchi), is the supreme guardian of the mayor. But on both sides everything starts to fall apart, Rio unites with the rebels, and Takeshi - with his employer, although failures soaked in blood, such as the exchange of hostages, went bad, and Takeshi found out that his wife and son are robots (not done in an alien mood , keep in mind, just suddenly, as if in power came out), and that he himself is also alone. And all this leads to one last, inexplicable clash between two men. <br /> <br /> It is strange that there is another film in which Miike has peaks and downturns, sometimes finding that golden mean of success, where science fiction can make some difference to this. But in fact, there is nothing to extract from this story, except that the mayor / dictator is a dingbat without a background, who fusses, making sure that his drug does not let the couples get pregnant and that everything remains under control. I believe that he also has his love slave in the merry not speaking part of the saxophonist, who also sometimes plays the role of a man when he does not drown out the gloomy blues. Meanwhile, we get the generally accepted sides of the Rio and Takeshi stories, and they are never uninteresting, just not convincing enough to generate interest. Of course, Miike is not against having fun, for example, when Takeshi slaps Michelle (Maria Chen) into the water to make her float after the assassination attempt on the mayor close to the murder, or because the original rebel leader speaks English without a good reason for everyone. At the beginning of the film there is even a playful respect for old sci-fi cartoons. But there is nothing very convincing in essence, except for Takeshi's minor twists in becoming “good” in the middle of the film (helping one couple do the cleanliness to have a child), and for the most part, Miike's strengths are purely stylistic and in the choice of locations and scenery. <br /> <br /> This is similar to the ugly Japanese alphaville, where everything still feels modern thanks to all the special effects. And I really liked the yellow-green hue that Miike used in the film, as he very well influenced the scenes in the open air and added only sufficient grain to the scenes in the room. But as far as peaks and valleys are concerned, this is becoming more distinct - and the level of visual effects of a sci-fi film channel, perhaps with the addition of a few more dollars - during the climax. It contains some of the funniest materials in the most delusional, Freudian sensitivity from the director, even if it should start with unbearable contrivances; The way Rio and Takeshi finally meet is sort of a random and just a means for producers to try to cheaply tie together the last two films when this was not necessary. On the other hand, from the point of view of the purely entertaining value of the movie, similar to the film Miike, where everyone sees something completely unexpected and very rudely sexy, he gets right there with the best scenes in Katakuri's Happiness and Visitor Q. In general, Dead or Alive: Final is a stupid 90-minute effort that does not take itself too seriously, and is even more beneficial for its evil tricks, militaristic decay and cultural hangs set at the level of cellulose.
