Although I lived in Australia in 1975, soon after that I moved abroad, fed up with constant industrial unrest, general worship of mediocrity - unless you are an athlete! - and the complacency of many Australians, who have decided to ignore the dizzying pace of change in the countries in the north. <br /> <br /> So I missed “Dismissal,” like many other Australian TV dramas of the 80s and 90s, such as the great TV series “Janus” and “Phoenix” that I have seen since Wildside. <br /> <br /> For me, the filmed story of “Layoff” is fair and, as far as I know, accurate. However, as far as public “indignation” is concerned, this shows only one side of the picture, and not how families tear apart the contradiction. I know, because my two brothers did not talk to me for months later. <br /> <br /> But the comment, in my opinion, is very one-sided. The inescapable fact is that, despite the fiery expression of rage from a significant part of the community, the Australian electorate chose - and decisively - in favor of Fraser, as they did again two years later. <br /> <br /> This is a separate, historically accurate and beautifully operating documentation documentation.
