<br /> <br /> Giorgino is a strange, dark, obsessive object; Casting is impressive, the plot is powerful, reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe. Perhaps not a masterpiece, but it leaves us with memories of strong images, beautiful music, fear, sadness, confusion and a sentence that says it all: wolves are walking. GIORGINO was completely forgotten, and when it was released, no one seemed to appreciate it. It's a shame. If you ever have the opportunity to see it, well ... try it.
