I absolutely adore this film about a woman columnist (Barbara Stenvik) for a large home magazine that publishes a welcome article every month that tells about her amazing family life as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home. The trouble happens when the owner of her monthly publication requires that she and he and the hero of World War II be guests during the Christmas holidays. Why is she worried? Because she lives in a small New York apartment, not married, she does not have a child - and does not know how to cook at all! Fun (and romance) comes when she tries to make a believable act in an attempt to save face / avoid dismissal by the owner of the magazine (played by Sydney Greenstreet). This is an amazing comedy; one that I highly recommend to lovers of classic cinema !!!!
