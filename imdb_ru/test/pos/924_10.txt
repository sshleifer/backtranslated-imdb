I believe that I share the same psychological worldview with Kieslowski. He is a Pole, I am Dutch, but we have a common opinion: the world is not without metaphysics among the general coincidence. Hardly a controlled person or, perhaps, a poet-prime minister, so that Poland, as a social and cultural "low pressure zone", could play the role it played in World War II, being critical but Christian in relation to Jews, but often not less self-critical, there are innocence and guilt in the Kieslowski worldview, as symbols in Catholicism: White against the Black Madonna. In Rouge, the Black Madonna is the one that the judge fell in love with when he was a young man. Memories are magically realistically intertwined with the present, although completely random, for example, the camera simply turns to the other side of the street or the then judge’s red jeep passes by the young woman’s car after she accidentally hits the dog. The fact that we jumped in time in the same camera movements, we will understand later. His love remained unanswered, so his life was not as he had planned. He lost the ability to love other people and animals. As a judge, he feels that he is actually spying on other people's lives, and when he retires, he just continues to do that, spying on his neighbors this time. The innocence and sense of righteousness of a young woman (literally), accidentally caught in his life, restore his common sense, and it is thanks to her that he spontaneously admits his spying behavior to his neighbors and the police, taking and even holding on to stones stones are consistently thrown through his windows. In this process, the story is repeated between this man and the woman he loves, although this time he is old and the woman does not match. Kieslowski may have fought this bit, because the old judge is his alter ego, and they say that he was in love with Irene Jacob. Both women play the same significant role in his psychology - the one (!) Who has his heart and soul and, therefore, can make him or break him, even being an old man! It’s as if the “forces in the air” or God united them. Matches * are too * random to just be an accident or even luck. There must be some mystical, supernatural, or theological source that influences these inconceivably profound life decisions. The study book fell and opened on the exam question page another example of this. Or at that moment when the old judge turned his heart to a young woman, the wind near the opera house slammed the doors open and smashed the windows. A giant picture of a young woman predicts an image on TV after drowning on her trip through the channel. These moments are effectively emphasized by the human voice of the liturgy or by what sounds like it (Van den Budenmayer).
