I'm so glad that Zack was in the storyline of Zack and Cody, because this is my favorite show, and he is my favorite actor. This is really a funny episode and a fun show !! I love everything about shows and characters. All the performers are great. Keep playing Zach, and I'm so happy that almost all of my favorite actors (including high school music characters) are participating in this show. Zac Efron is so hot and I have his picture with an autograph! This is not a photocopy, it went all the way from America to Australia and almost did not come to Christmas. In addition, I have a high school music group with my name on it. (Scarlett 8)
