Blimey! Amazing, lost piece of Australia and lost glam-rock film of the 70s, combined into one. This film requires viewing just to see what can be done with little or no budget, but with great enthusiasm. As a retelling of the story of Oz, the film borders on what is becoming too obvious, but it is saved by its eccentricity. The opportunity to see how glam rock appeared in Australia will please fans of the genre. This film was twice shown on Rocky Horror, showing the type of film Oz is. Although it’s not as frivolous or well designed as the RHPS, it’s hard not to have fun with Oz. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Oz has aged well — perhaps a by-product of how determined he is in real Australia in 1976. The course of history shows that many of the ideas being researched will eventually become mainstream. The readiness of the film to highlight outstanding heroes is noticeable, especially when it comes to a “revolutionary” period for the Australian gay rights movement. <br /> <br /> Performances range from frivolous lover to subtle brilliance. The direction is not enough subtlety, and most of the dialogue may benefit from one or two additional projects. For some reason, these shortcomings add to the attractiveness of the film, which, fortunately, is unpretentious. As in the 1970s Australia, this film has a certain naive charm. <br /> <br /> There are several links to the original Australian productions of the Rocky Horror Show, which will keep obsessed. <br /> <br /> Oz is undoubtedly a minor classic and a potential cult favorite to be considered. Laugh at the horrible fashions of the 70s, rock with the AusRock soundtrack, leave ANY expectations on hold, and Oz will probably be happy.
