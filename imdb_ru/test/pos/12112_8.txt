Unpleasant spaghetti-western Mario Costa "Animals" with "Klaus Kinski" director "Buffalo Bill, the hero of the Far West" could be produced only in Europe. Hollywood would never dare to make a western about a sexual predator on the hunt as the main character of the film. Never mind that Kinski is perfect for the role of "Madman" Johnny. He plays a man completely without sympathy, who is ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit, pants and hat. There is nothing appetizing in this low-budget oats. Typically breathtaking Spanish landscapes around Almeria are not visible anywhere. Instead, Kosta and his film director Luciano Trasatti, who shot another western Kinski “And God Said Cain”, shot this horse opera in a rather ordinary setting around Tor Caldara, Lazio, Italy and Monte Gelato Falls, Treia River, Lazio, Italy, However, the Beast qualifies as a continental western because it deals with completely unscrupulous characters, and the action can be classified as a film noir, because the hero and heroine are trapped in intolerable circumstances that force and x resort to criminal activity. As expected, their well-thought-out plans backfire largely due to the Kinsky character. Indeed, the uncool character of Kinsky resembles a character like Willie Coyote. Consistently, he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women, but either the legalists or the criminals nullify all his efforts. Ultimately, the "Beast" is a tragic exploration of character, filled with irony. The orchestral score of Stelvio Cipriani sounds like it was shot by Western Tony Anthony's The Return of a Stranger. The Mario Costa scenario takes place on the western border between San Diego and Mexico, which is terrorized by a notorious Mexican gangster named Machete (Giovanni Pallavicino from “We still kill the old way”) and his gang. They hunt the stagecoach, and no one is immune from their attacks. The first time we see “Madman” Johnny Laster, he pauses to refresh himself in the stream, and notices a great-looking woman washing clothes. He creeps up to her from behind and attacks her, but a larger man, armed with a rifle, intervenes, and he has to flee. He appears in a nearby town, and a sniffing sniffing shooter recruits him to help ambush a rich man, Mr. Powers, on the trail and rob him. They kill him and get no money. Mr. Snuff-Sniffer accidentally leaves his snuffbox at the crime scene, and the sheriff is arrested on suspicion of murder. "Crazy" shoots his partner from his hotel room so that he does not have to worry about involvement in the crime. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a young loving couple struggles into the world. , Riccardo (Stephen Tedd of Requiem for the Murder for the Heads) lives a Mexican couple on a ranch and helps them raise their real son Juan. In the village, Riccardo Juanita's beloved girlfriend (Gabriella Jorgelli from "The Stranger in Sacramento") sings and dances in the cantina. Riccardo and Juanita plan to get married, but the last place where Juanita wants to settle down is on a dusty ranch. She wants to live in the city, but life in the city requires more money than Riccardo or hers. They unite with a bright criminal named Glen (Paolo Casella from “Kill the Living and Pray for the Dead”) and plan to kidnap Mr. Power's daughter Nancy when she comes for her inheritance. Glen makes a fatal mistake by hiring the "crazy" Johnny to help them, because Glen knows that Johnny needs money to get women. <br /> <br /> They kidnap Powers' daughter and keep her in a remote cabin, where Johnny is on guard. above her. Meanwhile, Juanita is disguised as Powers’s daughter and appears in the city to get money from Powers ’lawyer Gary Pinkerton (Giuliano Raffaelli from Blood and Black Lace), but he becomes suspicious because Juanita does not look like Riccardo brandishes six pistols and warns Pinkerton that they kidnapped Nancy. Unfortunately for Riccardo and Juanita, Pinkerton could lay hands on only 50 thousand dollars, because Machete instilled in everyone's hearts such fear that the full inheritance of the powers could not be delivered through the territory by stage. Meanwhile, in the cabin, excited Johnny is trying to rape Nancy, but she outwit him, finds out that he and the chair are under the pretext that he needs to be alone while she is undressing. After she knocks him unconscious, she steals the stroller and takes her back to the city. Johnny wakes up, chases her and kills around the same time that Glen, Riccardo, Juanita and Pinkerton meet him on the trail. They inform Johnny about the complications caused by Machete's rule, and give him 12 thousand dollars as money. Pinkerton is stunned at the sight of Nancy's bloody corpse and threatens Johnny. Naturally, Johnny coolly shot him on the spot. <br /> <br /> The situation is really starting to deteriorate, as the San Diego law establishes the seizure of Machete. Glen, Riccardo and Juanita are returning to Mexico, while Johnny attacks two women at the ranch and barely falls into the trap. He goes to Mexico, finds the Kantin whore and falls on her when generosity shoves a revolver in his face. Johnny admits that he knows where they can find more money if they let him go. Machete's people follow the tip of Johnny and capture Juanita. The villagers join Riccardo to attack Machete, and Johnny rescues Juanita, but she dies later after a big skirmish. Riccardo is now alone. Machete and his people responded to his adoptive parents, killing not only them, but also little Juan. All that Riccardo and Juanita dreamed about was rising in the clouds of a smoke pistol for an unfortunate end. "Crazy" Johnny dies and never calms down. If you think about Costa's uncompromising sage, “The Beast” becomes an interesting character study and exercise in a noir film in a western setting, where everyone is punished.
