Obviously, Ponyo can be seen as not just another stupid animated film that a studio could release in order to simply survive. Far from it, and it can easily be described as a fascinating, beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> Miyazaki does have another masterpiece. Now, for many, this is said to be the smallest of his achievements in the film industry due to the fact that his “certain oddity factor” is partially missing. This is true - the moral and insights that are not so obvious in his previous films are very obvious in this picture. Pony is not too difficult to understand or understand. I believe that his idea was to make a children's film that would be as suitable for adults as their children, and so that it would not be too complicated. He achieved it perfectly, and he also did not lose any substance along the way, and for this reason he gets 10. Besides, the film itself is so exciting from the very beginning, and the way it was presented so beautiful that sometimes it made me fear, because I remembered how they were all hand-drawn by Miyazaki himself. I have not been so enlightened and happy after watching a movie since I saw it some time ago (another movie not to be missed). Everything in Ponyo was absolutely stunning and breathtaking; even the music for this was pure perfection. The only bad thing I have to say about this was his English duplication. Don't get me wrong, they were good too, but I saw Ponyo about 2 weeks before he came out at the national level, and I thought that in some parts I would like him to keep some of his Japanese dialogue (not all he, however, also enjoyed the “English way”). In general, everyone should see Ponyo; it is absolutely flawless and in another filmmaking league in general. And, finally, do not bind me to this, but I would not be surprised if Ponyo gets a nomination for the best picture, as there are now 10 films that can be nominated for it. This is just good.
