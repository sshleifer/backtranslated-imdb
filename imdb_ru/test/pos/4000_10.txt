Fire gives everything ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most skillful meditations on artistry. A 19th century story in Korea tells the story of the famous artist Ohvon, but instead of following a bold anecdote, melodrama or a psychological hunt for eggs, it depicts a series of episodes throughout his life, which themselves are beautiful works of art. This does not give an interpretation of these episodes, but leaves them to the viewer's thoughts along with the pictures of Ohwon himself. Thus, the viewer enters the same contemplation as Obon, and his talent minus can “feel” their way to the inspiration of his paintings. <br /> <br /> In part this is so effective. Totally masterful recollection of the 19th century Korea and the musical / artistic world in which Ohwon stopped. There are so many great pictures of the world outside the pictures that we get a mirror effect where we see the beautiful world, inspiring Ohwon, Ohwon, living and looking into this world and the works of art that he creates, reflect each other. <br /> <br /> The story is told with extraordinary savings. The evoked feeling is almost never delayed or explained, it just appears quickly, and then disappears, so that the following appears. By way of analogy, it’s rather a Mozart work of art (an endless and quick succession of great ideas), rather than a Beethoven work (obsessed with one great idea). It has classic restraint, much like the pictures of Ohwon. In fact, there is no music hinting at how to feel, with the exception of a few classic Korean works that were used with great efficiency in several scenes (and mostly played by the characters in the film). One of the obsessive pictures, if I remember correctly, is a flock of birds hovering over the blue mountains, while the singer sings <br /> <br /> "This life is like a dream, and only death will wake us" <br /> One of the tips in the film from one of Ovonone’s teachers is that “the picture lies between the blows.” The film follows this position, since there are so many questions between what is being said and described in the film. I saw it twice, and it was very useful on the second viewing. A very brief film, with a few frank explanations, could be seen as it is the 96th film by It. This is an art work. As the great friend and mentor of Ohvon told him, describing one of his paintings: “Not a single stroke was not in vain.” <br /> <br /> I compare it with Andrei Rubylev in quality, although in style it is very different. It is much easier and more interesting to watch, but in the classical form, where Andrei is gothic. <br /> <br /> In general, it is highly recommended for almost everyone except those who like appetite. Both times I was leaving the film, and I felt a wonderful spiritual renewal. <br /> <br /> One point in the life of Owon, which intrigued me, was that his insane drunkenness and delirium began suddenly after visiting a nobleman who told him that “good art can only come from great knowledge and learning” In the next short scene, Avon was very angry, and the next one was blown up drunk, as he often stayed until the end of the film. just a coincidence?
