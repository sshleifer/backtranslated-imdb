Craig Brewer is now officially a writer / director for whom I’ll watch any film, no matter how bad it looks. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with his emotionally intense storyline and realistic, error-prone characters. I was not sure what I would think when I saw this sophomore. The cast seemed great, the trailer used the music efficiently, but it seemed that there was every chance that it would turn into an absurdity and quickly. Fortunately, the Black Serpent Moan fell into a dead end. The acting is striking, great writing and editing style, as well as combining music, exciting all the way. Brewer seems to be a master at making his heroes have the right combination of compassion and anger when they got in the way of redemption. <br /> <br /> The first moment when I realized that I was waiting for a treat was during the abbreviated credit sequence at the beginning. As is the case with Hustle and Flow, Brewer superimposes music onto widescreen shots, and static fonts appear just like that. The aesthetics of the 70s were welcomed and helped to show that it would be another great heroic work, in vain, of those that were among the best in the cinema in this decade. From here we continued with short passages in the life of both Lazarus and Rae, each vignette reflecting the other as they traveled to the fateful moment when their paths finally crossed. The editing between them was smooth and relevant, not a sharp cut before the scene felt finished with its goal. Boy Rey goes to the service in the service, and his wife Laz leaves him for the sake of his brother. Everyone feels lonely and returns to what he knows in this situation - Ray to sex and Laz to the bottle. Only when Rey is left dead on the side of the road, and her savior comes from his farm to pick it up, are the reasons for their actions finally clear up. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as an elderly bluesman farmer trying to reconcile his life with God, the flesh and the pain he caused him. There are moments of stoic rigor, as well as moments of kindness with his captive / patient. In fact, you never look at the installation as comic or unreal, because it sells what it does so well. In addition, the character Rei is not chained for a very long time, despite what you believe. The situation begins a little awkward until we see that the chain was for its own good and in fact is used only a day or two. As for this chained girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I have never seen anything special in her, but this role has become a real breakthrough for her. This girl is so concerned that her past sexual abuse is very hard on her. Every time she moves away from her love, she begins to see flashes of her childhood who claimed her innocence in her childhood, and longs to be touched by any person who can let this image disappear. Her nymphomania is not for pleasure, but rather for survival from obsessive nightmares, always hiding behind her eyelids. Ricci fully populates the role and shows all the emotional trauma with great effect and realism. Mention should also be made of Justin Timberlake, who again demonstrates real acting talent. Where this guy comes from, I have no idea, but hopefully he will continue to make more films and shy away from the mostly crappy music he is releasing. <br /> <br /> Although not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan, in my opinion, is still equally, because when it is turned on, it is impressive. By the end, we have a really exciting sequence with the release of “This Little Light of Mine”, and the earlier interaction between the captive and the invader, when the chain is first introduced, shows some first-class work. However, the truly magical moment is when Jackson sings (yes, it’s in all, as if it was Terrence Howard in Hustle), the title song when the thunder rattles and the lights flicker. If I do not see more beautiful shots throughout the year, I would not be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what humanity is capable of. It seems to me that I really like the work of Brewer, this is what he does not show how sinners become redeemed heroes. Instead, he shows us that no matter how bad or bad your life is, everyone can strive for redemption and be better people. We do not have saints here, but people who look at their ship are prone to error. If the course remains true or if it returns to darkness, no one knows, but at least they can say that they have tried their best.
