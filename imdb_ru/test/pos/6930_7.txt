It is assumed that in this film involved two actors (Kane and Moran), trying to deceive the gangster. The plot is unconvincing at best, as there are several holes everywhere. However, this usually should not matter, as comedy should carry such a film. There are some really funny pieces (mostly provided by Dylan Moran). However, in other cases, there are long melodramatic scenes that add nothing to the film. Kane's character seemed exaggerated to me. Especially in the beginning, he constantly quotes Shakespeare and acts as a pompous actor. It can be said that he played the role correctly, but the character seemed to me flat and unfunny. In general, I would say, see only if a fan of the actors involved. Otherwise, wait for the video or TV.
