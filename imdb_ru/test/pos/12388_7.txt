I just watched this movie at the Santo Domingo International Film Festival. When I watched the film, I had the feeling that I had seen a film with a similar story before ... a film with Ray Liotta, but I cannot remember much of it. Of course, this is much more dramatic, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> This is the story: Emilio's life becomes a lie that he can no longer stand. After 20 years of lying about his life in front of his wife, son and all the people he knows, the truth is following him, and there is nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> Watching Emilio invent a lie is exciting, but after a while you are tired of the same ... having an affair with a young girl had to advertise something, but it isnâ€™t. Despite this, the film is still fun, exciting and immersive. Either it makes you want to help Emilio with his lies, or help everyone else catch him. I liked the analogies, the photo and the good performances. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10.
