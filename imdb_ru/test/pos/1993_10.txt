Who should watch this movie? Anyone who has ever taken an acid, read Philip K. Dick, thought that the premise of the Matrix is ​​better than special effects, interested in philosophy or likes to mix their sense of reality. I laughed out loud at this film, simply because it was so outrageous and so accurate. This movie is great. This movie is cool. It’s better than “The Matrix” if you look far away (I didn’t fall asleep in Existenz, for starters: the militants / special effects tired me out, and despite the plausible philosophical gloss, this is the Matrix) ridiculous. David Cronenberg did some tricky things (Rabid) and some brilliant works (another Videodrome that deserves attention, as well as Stephen King's Dead Zone). But this is one of my favorite. I can't remember the ending - it's good, because it means that I can watch it again. Or maybe I never watched this movie at all. Maybe it is an implanted memory. Or maybe this “really” happened to me. I dont know. In any case, now it fits easily into my general illusion of reality, and I am glad.
