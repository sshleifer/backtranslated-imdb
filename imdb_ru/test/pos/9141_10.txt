With a little wine, some friends and a good mood, I had a really good time watching this movie. I especially liked the performance of Geelon Guy (like “Randy”), which was such a blow to the pants! His scenes with Mercy Rahmer ("Michel") were wildly funny. I would not want him to come to me, but it was great to see Randy trying to score with Michelle, and even better to see the results! Of course, the girls in the film are also very fun to watch. And, my friend showed me a PLAYBOY release, in which Pilar Lastra was Playmate of the Month. She definitely looks. In general, this film completely fulfilled its task, which was to entertain us in an easy and carefree way.
