Classic film of the late 50s. Long-serving headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography and acting of the young actor are irresistible. In the sense of the 50s (which I love). <br /> <br /> The look of the artsy (overly artsy?) Modern film “Far from the sky” reflects this film (and I suspect that this film may be one of the models). Stupid conspiracy, of course (hey, it's 1959!), But the film is great! As a reflection of society, it is extremely interesting. And as evidence of how Hollywood breaks away from the idealistic image of American sexual mores, it is fascinating.
