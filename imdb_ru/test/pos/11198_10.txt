The only complaint I heard about this film was that it was slow. Although, perhaps this is the point. The two characters face relentlessly, and the slow increase in tension between them causes anxiety. Complex and subtle gestures and minimal dialogue reduce tension to the point where otherwise the normal argument shocks the audience. Istanbul and the outskirts are dreamy, breathtaking landscapes, and the plot is breathtaking - not in the form, “the hero blew up another car, and now he flies on his motorcycle”. I felt a chill down my back as the characters moved towards each other and looked at each other and watched the fog cover Istanbul.
