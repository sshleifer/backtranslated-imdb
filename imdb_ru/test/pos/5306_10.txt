Whenever Hayao Miyazaki shoots tri-fecta (writes, directs and animates the film), he shoots a classic film for the ages. He did it again with Gake no ue no Ponyo. <br /> <br /> The story of a little girl who rests on a very tight leash with her younger sisters, her father, a bitter ex-wizard. by the name of Fujimoto. The fish runs away from their father and rides a jellyfish to the shore, where it is trapped and is stuck in a bottle. This underwater sequence should be one of the most carefully traced animated scenes ever undertaken, and in itself is a pretext for finding a theatrical release. Miyazaki, who is not afraid to have a lively scene, has surpassed himself. Literally hundreds of hundreds of individually painted sea creatures of all imaginable sizes were in motion at the same time. <br /> <br /> When a fish leaves a dredging operation, remaining trapped in a bottle, a five-year-old boy named Souske notices it in the water and can break the bottle, saving it. Since she is the result of her father’s magic, she herself is capable of magic - and her father is actively trying to bring it back. The boy calls the fish ponyo. As soon as Sosuke learns that Ponyo can speak, her father successfully returns her back to captivity. <br /> <br /> After a war of will with his father, Pono manages to escape again with the ability to turn into a man. She meets Sosuke again during a storm, and the story continues from there in many interesting ways. In this film, there is an attractiveness factor that competes and, perhaps, surpasses Tonari no Totoro. Joe Hisaishi, once again, provided outstanding musical support. <br /> <br /> The story itself is simple - just like Miyazaki’s films in general - and should appeal to a wide audience. Although I haven’t watched it enough to be sure, the film doesn’t seem to keep scientists in long discussions, as Sen Chihiro no Kamikakushi did. However, this is the perfect entertainment movie. I gave the film ten out of ten rating.
