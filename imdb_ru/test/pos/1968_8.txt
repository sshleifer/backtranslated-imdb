An honest and graceful little science fiction / horrible sci-fi thriller about the famous video game designer, Allegre Geller (Jennifer Jason Lee), whose latest game - “eXistenZ” - attracts the attention of not only people who voluntarily want to try the game, but also one who almost kills her (and her game too). Since she has to stay out of sight, Allegra is stuck with Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a marketing trainee (“PR nerd”), to be her bodyguard, although he only has a gun made of flesh and bones and bullets. these are teeth. Director David Cronenberg, well, in general, used some fragments from his earlier films (“Videodrome”, “Scanners”, “The Fly”, etc.) and placed them in certain parts of the story with a good timing. Lo and Lee are good here, as are some other actors (Ian Holm, Willem Defoe, Sarah Polley, Christopher Exelston, etc.), who have international meaning. Defoe is not at all devilish like Gus, the cheater of garage mechanics. One of the film’s best scenes is to watch Ted eat (fish and frogs), build weapons and admit to Allegre, “I can't help myself.” “EXistenZ” manages to show that he (Cronenberg) approaches his old tricks, and it still works like a charm.
