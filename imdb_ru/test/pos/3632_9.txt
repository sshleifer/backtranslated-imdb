A very touching film, a big surprise for Brazil, a country that usually exports materials about social themes, violence, sex ... Magical realism is a very difficult task, and I believe that Joao Falcao handled it remarkably. It seems that he really was not going to make a realistic film, it is far from it. Although many people think that the film was adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that in fact the film is based on a book. Another mistake is that Falcao influenced the series "Hoje Ã© Dia De Maria". The series, filmed "Globo", was shot after the film, but shown earlier ... Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> A negative moment is the picture of Walter Carvalho. It seems that he did not catch and did not understand the concept that Falcao created. The story is fascinating and universal, despite what happens in a tiny little town in Brazil. This can take place anywhere in the world. Great movie, I highly recommend.
