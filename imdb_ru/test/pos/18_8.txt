"Chest", perhaps the most exquisite of the backstage movies. The film is filled with wit and spirit, for the most part provided by the “energetic” Norman character (Tom Courtney). Although his character is clearly cheerful, and, of course, he attracts the lead performer (Albert Finney), whom he helps, the film never stops at what has been achieved and does not make it more than it is. <br /> <br /> The sandy style of Peter Yeats, who worked so well in Bullite, is shown again, and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence. This is very much appreciated in a story that can easily become tedious. In the end, “Dresser” will bore many people silly, but it really will please those who love British cinema. <br /> <br /> 7.7 out of 10
