Unfortunately, I have never seen the full version of this movie. I saw the 87-minute version twice, back in the 1950s. Even more brightly directed than the norm with Julien Duvivier, this is a surprisingly unusual piece, teeming with wide trekking shots, through Andreev's magnificent atmospheric scenery. Black Jack, beautifully lit by photographer Andre Thomas, is nothing more than a connoisseur's delight. Leveraging this imaginative visual style, this is a script that allows you to make a list of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Daliot, some brilliantly strange, full-blooded characteristics. George Sanders demonstrates an impeccable game, while an eccentric millionaire (who turns out to be a racketeer competitor) superbly plays Agnes Moorehead. Also understanding most of all about her role, Patricia Rock. The film was shot in Spain in 1949.
