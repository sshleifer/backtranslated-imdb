Spirit and Chaos is a biographical feature film about Miyazawa Kenji, a Japanese poet and writer who was active in the early 20th century. The film captures and interprets his artistic method (“sketching” poems), his inspiration (the spirit of nature and his fantastic beauty) and his struggle to accept the harsh reality in the face of his idealistic imagination. <br /> <br /> The film perfectly combines excerpts from Miyazawa’s poems. His relationship with his students was strong, especially in one scene, where he offers everything he has to a student who has just been caught stealing material from a class. Miyazawa’s selfless compassion for farmers in his village, his sister and other unfortunate people can serve as a lesson for all of us. In addition, Miyazawa's devotion to science was also well depicted. At a time when skepticism was still encountered, especially in provincial cities such as the one in which Miyazawa grew up, he realizes his usefulness in helping his fellow villagers and is inspired by his elegance. The way the film presented moments of creative passion and frustration in the writer was truly intense and well interpreted. <br /> <br /> I felt that CGI was integrated into the film, while innovative, faced with more organic animation, It can be argued that it was intentionally to represent the conflict within the main character, but I found it rather unaesthetic. I would also like the film to discuss Miyazawa’s Buddhist influence, but it worked fine without it. <br /> <br /> I thought this film was very well made. I give him 9/10 with one point deducted for CGI. The rest of the animation, plot and dialogue were wonderful and soulful. I have not seen any other Kawamori Shoji films, but after watching this, I will definitely give them a chance.
