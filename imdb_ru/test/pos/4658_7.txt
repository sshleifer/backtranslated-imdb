Somewhere in the dark niches of my brain cells in my head a song is playing. I can't forget it, no matter how hard I try. This is the MIDDLE MADNESS, and it gets to you! I wish I could find a copy of this on the record at 45 rpm. Five scattered teams are sent one night to Los Angeles to hunt for rubbish, and not to physical objects. The untidy game master with two great helpers is the inspiration for all this madness that will soon begin in Los Angeles. All teams are stereotypes (this film since 1980, before political correctness ruined everything): “good guys,” “nerds,” led by Eddie Diezen, stupid beer lovers, “ladies, we don't need men,” especially the redhead. Giggling twins also screams. And finally, the “bad guys” with Stephen Furst as leader. Furst is fun, as overweight Harold, whose attempt to use a computer to decipher various clues leads to an unpleasant mess. Such films are no longer made. Nowadays, films should have a “sharpness” to them with some dark characters and other nonsense. Let us return to those days when the “good guys” led by David Noton were still good and did not hopelessly conflict. So drop all serious claims and go back to 1980. This is the MIDNIGHT MADNESS. ,,
