then you will be a big fan of this movie. This is almost the same basic concept, a pleasant blend of music, soul and drama. I admit, I watched this movie a bit wary, I only saw a preview of a white scavenger girl chained to a radiator, but I'm a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson, and I liked Hustle & Flow, so I thought I would give him a chance. <br /> <br /> I am very glad I did. It turned out that this is more than just a superficial story about a nympho from the south being imprisoned by a 60-year-old black man. The story had a heart, and was very influential. <br /> <br /> The music in this film also added a nice touch. Craig Brewer mixed his style from Hustle & Flow in this film, except that he took a new spin and used the blues. His music scenes are still on top of the charts as the performance scenes pass. He also has some very interesting flashback scenes, and he gives you a total crazy feeling during some of the most controversial scenes. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, if you liked Hustle & Flow, you will like this movie, and if you are a blues fan, you should definitely watch it. I give him 9 out of 10, a very interesting film, and it is extremely undervalued. a shame. <br /> <br /> Get out and rent this movie.
