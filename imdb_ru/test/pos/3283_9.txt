Well, this episode makes fun of Al Gore. I am sure that it infuriates several liberals. The fact is that South Park laughs at everyone, just like the Simpsons. If you are offended by the fact that the politician you like is mocked, then perhaps you need a better sense of humor and you take the show too seriously. Given that, as they say, this episode is fun and one of the best. Al Gores depicts fun, Cartman's scheme goes horribly wrong, and the results make you laugh across the floor. In fact, this is all that you would like to see in the episode with the South Park, and this is one of my favorites. I will not comment on the plot in more detail, because I do not want to give anything out.
