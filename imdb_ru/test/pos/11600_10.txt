It seems that many Europeans and Americans are watching Indian films for the wrong reason; I see some people complaining that there was no dance sequence in this film! Bengali films, as a class, not like Hindi, as a rule, more realistic. Rituparno Ghosh is one of the best young directors in India, widely known for his choice of scenes for films and the power of his scripts. Choker Bali is a great example. True to the adaptation of the novel by Nobel laureate Tagore, devoted to the search for the sexual pleasure of a Bengali widow, the director gives a new dimension to this widely known and controversial work.
