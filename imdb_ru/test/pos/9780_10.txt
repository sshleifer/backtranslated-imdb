After my great-grandfather was captured and sent to Changi during World War II, I did not dare to watch it when it was first shown on TV. My great-grandfather kept a diary when he was in captivity, and when he died there, his comrades bought him out, and I was lucky to read it, and I feel that I have at least some idea of ​​what Changi really was, first-hand. br /> <br /> This is a fantastic story about what happened to those poor guys who were sent to Changi Prison, and shows what difficulties and cruelty they witnessed in order to protect their country. This is an amazing story of friendship, loyalty and the Australian spirit, which will never give up the relationship. It’s worth seeing whether you like the Australian story or something related to the Second World War. <br /> <br /> I really liked this mini-movie, and I gave it 10 out of 10.
