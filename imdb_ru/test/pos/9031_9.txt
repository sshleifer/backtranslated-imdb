It is a pity that iameracing wants to deny the reality of the goal of Faulkner and Clarence Brown in the creation of the story and the film "The Intruder in the Dust". I assume that the burden of the history of racism is difficult for any southerner, and I can understand that. But to say that this film was not specifically about racism is ridiculous and inaccurate. YES (if you use the upper register), I understand that there are many, many places where black and white people in the south get along quite well. But in order to deny how blacks were, and sometimes forced to live, the conditions and injustices that they had to endure were not imaginary. Sometimes black and white people got along because of sincere love and understanding. Sometimes it was only as long as the blacks "knew their place." The meaning of the transformation of the character of Juano Hernandez (in films and in print) into a somewhat prickly type, not warm and fuzzy, was to emphasize the fact that fanaticism is not so much in itself, and human rights are what everyone needs regardless of whether we like a particular person or not. <br /> <br /> It would have been great to stop denying the existence of racism and the enormous harm he caused to Americans of all stripes. The fact is that black people (among others), as a rule, are not an exception, receive the benefits of the justice system as impartially as white people. Segregation, discrimination and lynching is a historical fact. People like iameracing may argue that these things are not as widespread as some people think, and probably would like to free their ancestors and heroes from any connection with such behavior. It would be great if the southern ancestors of iameracing (if any) never participated in any horrific racist actions that darken the history of this country, and I hope that they have not done so. If so, then I congratulate them, but this fact, if it is true, does not erase what others have done. And even if the terrible deeds that were committed with blacks in the south (and in other areas, let's not forget about the “Project Riots of the Civil War Era”) were half as much, only a third, does that make them less terrible? Is the killing of ten children the hanging of ten men sexual assault on ten women less terrible than the same thing that happens with hundreds? <br /> <br /> Iameracing asks us to remove the Burning Mississippi chip from our shoulders before we see Intruder In The Dust. Well, I ask you, were there any killings of civil rights activists or not? Why should it be forgotten? Forgive? May be. But in order to prevent their recurrence, they cannot be forgotten or redefined in minor cases. The racism, which is displayed in "Intruder In The Dust", is displayed there very purposefully. It makes sense. <br /> <br /> At the cinema-historical level, it is also ridiculous to overly ignore the racial perspective. Anyone who watches movies shot before the 1960s knows that black actors / characters / extras were usually deliberately shot. Judging by the history of our cinema; wars have always been fought by white middle-aged men; There were no black people in the Old West; one could walk along a street in a large city and never meet a black man; there were no black orderlies, taxi drivers, clerks, salesmen, etc. Blacks were almost never selected for the role, unless the race was a factor. If Falukner (and Brown) wanted to tell a simple murder story, he probably would not have made Hernandez's hero black. <br /> <br /> Racism exists amazingly. Perhaps for various reasons, I am sure we both want it to be wrong, but it is. Wishing things to be as we would like, so they probably could not help, but it still does not make them so.
