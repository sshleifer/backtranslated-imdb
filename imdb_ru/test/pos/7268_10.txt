I am amazed that I have a real affection for this, as I am not a fan of action and adventure. But hey ... It's quite difficult to make a mistake with a film about Robert Carlisle. I read a few bad or moderate reviews of this film, taking it apart due to period errors or an unlikely plot development, but no one seems to mention the rather intriguing transition of a character that shows like a hardened, miscreant of bad luck (Carlisle) turns into a rather noble, disinterested hero and, like a handsome man, a cowardly tramp (Miller) develops a real taste for the life of a person living on the highway as soon as he "feels it." Plunkett & Macleane is a dynamic and very pleasant piece for making films, filled with a lot of bad humor, luxurious scenes (in particular, using the “fireworks” of the former apotkar Plunkett) and charmingly eclectic music. It is definitely worth your viewing time for the CLIMAX scene alone! Shoot them guys!
