Tweety is sent in its train cage from its old owner. In the same baggage car, also in a cage, is Sylvester. <br /> <br /> Sylvester instantly grabbed Tweety, but the railwayman returns and slaps the "mean cat", as he calls it, back into the cage. He puts Tweety “in a safer place” high and says to the cat: “Now remember: no tricks!” Sylvester puts on a halo and looks innocent. Yeah, right. <br /> <br /> I found that the funny thing is not Sylvester vs. Tweety, but the “sticky dog” that is in another cage next to Sylvester. The cat talks to him and very funny pays a big price. Sylvester just does not study, but this is one of the reasons why we love him! (I know that many IMDb reviewers don’t like Tweety, but I like both main characters - they both infuriated me!) <br /> <br /> The train and the passing landscape are also beautifully illustrated here - really good visual effects.
