This film is what most of the industry has forgotten how to do: Family fun, meaning something that gives pleasure to people of all ages. This particular Wallace & Gromit may appeal to everyone: from babies who like colors and cute rabbits, to their grandparents who understand the recommendations of adults. <br /> <br /> This film has the same good direction as everybody I've ever seen, and I mean it literally. It is also filled with the little things of humor, and in each scene there are so many humorous details in the background that I have to buy it, if only to read all the signs and leaflets in the world of W & G. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie at least twice more in cinemas, and then buy it on DVD. You should see this too.
