Gulliver's Travels is a satirical novel first written by a great misanthrope named Jonathan Swift. Therefore, it is not recommended to judge this film, just by itself. We have to go deep into the conscience of Man in order to reach the point where Swift would lead us. Gulliver survived the journey of truthfulness, loneliness, understanding of what could be his true life. We can't just sit and watch this movie, saying that he is so cute or boring. This is a long way off, and I would like everyone to expect it. This is the greatest film ever made, as far as you can feel the truths flowing from the character of Ted Dunson: the unforgettable Lemuel Gulliver
