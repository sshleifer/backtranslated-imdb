This is a film about love, violence, illegal deeds and Romanian tycoons. The Romanian story, combined with Western adaptation, leads to the creation of a modern international film that can be understood by both Western and Eastern European audiences, which FARGETS have forgotten about the conservative communist regime over filmmaking. <br /> <br /> A film full of violent scenes that are very numerous and create more and more tense situations as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> A story that impresses with its view on the hard life in the vicinity. Two young men doing illegal car racing. They work together as a team and succeed in their occupation, but when a local tycoon asks them to lose one race, things start to get dirty, and the bomb blaster ignites, creating a very tense film that will keep you close to the very end still you will ask yourself many questions. <br /> <br /> The brilliant play of Dragos Bukur and Dorina Chiriac, as well as the high quality of the direction and script of the young, but the talented director Radu Muntean also gives Furia a unique charm. All this and many other elements that can be seen while watching created a film that all movie lovers around the world will see, and its meaning is clear to everyone, regardless of race, language, or country. This is a real hope for Romanian cinema, as it tries to keep up with more advanced western cinema. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy watching it, as I am sure that everyone who saw it enjoyed it. I understood it.
