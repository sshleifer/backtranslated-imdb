I really love this movie! Evil Dead have NOTHING on this movie! “The night of demons 2” and “3” is an occupation, but it is a classic. It's super stupid, and at best, everything is in order, but what else can you want from the horror film of the 80s? Stooge has some of the best odnostrochnnikov who ever appeared on the screen. (he is my favorite character) Many people talk about the fondant scene in this film, but my personal favorite is the final, unfortunately, it has nothing to do with the main characters when the old man eats his apples left for Halloween and his throat is crippled . The sound track is awesome. The scene with Angela's dances is completely creepy, especially after the strobe is turned on, and you can see how she jumps from one part of the floor to the other with each camera shutter sound clicking on the song being played. The effects of makeup on this movie are pretty cute; Angela gave me nightmares as a child. If you are the kind of person who needs perfection from your shooting experience, you may want to give it a pass. But, if you are like me, and you are really digging through Halloween, the haunted house with the cliché of demons, then this one is surely a must.
