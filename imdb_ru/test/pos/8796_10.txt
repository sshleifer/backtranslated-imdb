Hello everyone, all I have to say is that Human Traffic and all its characters are so real, it's funny. I live in Australia (Melbourne), and I finally left the club and did not attend the whole weekend. This film explains everything that is happening in the world. Surely, I can't stop watching it ... I used to be exactly the same as Moff, so my friends said, and I didn't even see the movie ... I left the party on the weekend about 3 months ago after 4 years of hard work. partying to change my life around ... I was at the DVD store when I saw Human Traffic, and I remember how my old friends kept talking about it, so I bought it to see what all the noise was about ... I was so fascinated, I watched it 4 times in a row, because I could not believe that someone had shot a film that explains everything T. In any case, this film is definitely the best and funniest film I've ever seen. saw. truthfully in everything that happens in the film .. And Moff is a legend !!! That's all I have to say .. :) Enjoy the fact that 11/10 has ripped off my socks from how real it is, this is exactly what is happening in the world .. Hmm, I talk a lot <br /> <br / > take care everyone ...
