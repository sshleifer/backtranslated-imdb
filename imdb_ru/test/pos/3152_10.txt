I have a small hobby to find really cool photos that are largely unknown, and then let people know about them. This is one of the top places on my list to get the word out this summer. This indie movie (and I actually mean indie, not Miramax, Fox Searchlight indie movie) can easily be overlooked in the large celluloid maze, but if you want something completely different, you should check . <br /> <br /> Actually, I thought it was great. I should have known from the dvd cover, front and back, that it would be something completely different, but, they ALL say their things are different in order to hook you. Well, this one is really completely different. It's on your face: beautiful, scary and not ashamed to tell you to wake up. War, peace, September 11, poetry, even a creepy music video, shot with an old "patriotic" song and a strange guy in the RV. Do I need to say more? Just have a look.
