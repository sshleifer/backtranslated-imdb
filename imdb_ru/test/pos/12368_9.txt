On New Year's Eve, the Salvation Army's Tubercular Sister Edith (Astrid Holm) asks her mother and her colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm) to call David Holm (Victor Sjestrem) to visit her on her deathbed. Meanwhile, an alcoholic David tells the two other drunks in the cemetery the legend of the Ghost Trainer and his coachman: according to legend, the last sinner dying on the eve of the New Year becomes a soul collector, collecting souls into his coach. When David refuses to visit Edith, his friends argue with him, they fight, and David dies. When the coachman arrives, he recognizes his friend Georges (Torah Swenberg), who died at the end of last year. George recalls some parts of David’s abominable life, and in his memoirs shows how vile and selfish David was. <br /> <br /> “Körkarlen” is an impressive and stylish silent film with great special effects (for a 1921 film). Characters are very well developed; However, the story is outdated, and a strange and inexplicable situation arises when Sister Edith says that she loves David Holm. Why should an enlightened woman love such a disgusting man who has wasted his life corrupting other people? Despite the religious dating in our day, it gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption at the end. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): “Fantastic Carrock” (“Ghost Trainer”)
