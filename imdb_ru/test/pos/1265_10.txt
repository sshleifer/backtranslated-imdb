I am amazed that Memento (which is a great movie) is so highly regarded in the Top 250, and this one doesnâ€™t even appear !! What the heck is that?? To be honest, when this film ended, my reaction to my knees was that this film is better than Memento. After the euphoria of the fairytale finale, I came to the conclusion that they are equal in their superiority. I'm just confused why he is not in the Top 50 with Memento. I would venture to suggest that (unfortunately) this is due to the black and white image or because (again, unfortunately) that all the characters have British accents ... unfortunately, because this is not a reason not to appreciate such a good movie. <br /> <br /> I tell you that if you love Memento, you will also love Follow. Brilliant!
