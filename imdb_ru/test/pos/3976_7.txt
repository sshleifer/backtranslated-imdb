I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations from this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a bit extraordinary, everyone in the making of this film made a nice click, good for many people to laugh. Writing and jokes are much more literate than I expected. And even better, they are put to aplomb by unknown actors who do a good job with their task. <br /> <br /> The main reasons I wanted to watch this film were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long from "Ed" and the new Apple computer advertising. He was just starting to play the role of an actor in Ede, and he was great here. He is natural in front of the camera. Lewis Black is a social commentator who doesn't strike. He's in the Daily Show on Comedy Central about once every two weeks, but he really shines in the HBO movie Red, White and Screw. I regularly catch him on the comedy channel XM Radio. Give Black an idea and let him improvise. Regardless of whether his scandals are written and the lines are scripted or improvised, it doesn't matter. He is priceless, expressing his thoughts about the fear of the middle class. One thing about the delivery of Black, his hand gestures are not the same as that of a comedian. It just seems that he is talking to you, and I think this makes him unconsciously more effective.
