Several years have passed since I watched this film, so forget about most of the details. However, I loved it at the time and found the plot very exciting, the climax of the heart stopped. I remember literally sitting on the edge of my seat in the theater in 1979. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda plays a Los Angeles reporter Kimberly, who accidentally ran into an accident at a local nuclear power facility. She wants to publish the story with the help of her hippie operator (Michael Douglas), who photographed the event, but the sinister plot is trying to hide it all. Jack Lemmon is absolutely gorgeous in the role of a conflicting mid-level manager of a nuclear power plant, torn between loyalty to his company and “doing the right thing”, reporting a dangerous situation. His expression says a lot here. <br /> <br /> In addition to the exciting plot and tension, this film is about Jack Lemmon, his character and his superb acting. As for Jane Fonda (I was a big fan of her at the time), I suspect that she just moved from her anti-war protests to seizing the nuclear industry. <br /> <br /> This film seems to have been conceived as a nuclear scare tactic. Despite Chernobyl and Three Mile Island (these are different types of reactors), our Canadian CANDU reactor is safe and respected throughout the world. I do not hesitate to live near the nuclear power plant in an hour away, where my friend works as a very competent engineer. Apparently, they are closed to every little problem, regardless of financial losses. I sincerely doubt that there are any conspiracies. It’s hard to imagine that someone from managers or highly skilled operators could risk some kind of failure or something else ... this is absolute tomfoolery. Of course, the moral here is to spare no means or effort in building the facility or ensuring its permanent security. <br /> <br /> If we want to lead a Western lifestyle, we need somewhere to get energy. For those who claim that nuclear power can never be completely safe (though of course), perhaps they should voluntarily take on the role of a miner or return to pre-season electricity. <br /> <br /> By all means, enjoy this entertaining and very tense film, which is obviously based (weakly? embellished?) on a true story. This is a real chiller, thriller, and maybe (?) Even a killer, but please do not forget about your attitude to the work and safety of nuclear power plants.
