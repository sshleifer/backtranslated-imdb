First of all, it is very pleasant to hear how the legend plays such wonderful and timeless music. This film and soundtrack is a journey of power. Ray Charles is unique and amazing. I really adored this film, because it was inspiring and interesting. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx has become one of the main actors in Hollywood, which is clearly shown in Ray, and he should get an Oscar for this role, this is unprecedented. In fact, everyone who has worked on this film should receive praise. I really liked Kerry Washington, who played an exceptional wife ... Ray Charles, obviously, married well. Regina King is a wonderful actress, as well as an extraordinary Sharon Warren playing the struggling young mother. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I would say that this entire project was thoughtfully prepared. The whole cast was perfect, the script was great and the settings were awesome ... the main features of director Taylor Hackford and his team for doing such a great job of imagining Ray Charles's life on screen. This is my photo of the year, definitely one of the best biographical films ever made.
