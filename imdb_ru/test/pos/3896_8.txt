William H. Macy always gives good results. He never looks lazy and never seems like he would prefer to be somewhere else. In short, he is what an actor should be. The director of "Easy Murder Case" was directed by Stephen Miner, who appeared in two other great films with Macy (Door to Door, Woolen Cap). <br /> <br /> Television films have long become trash. overdone acting skills, bad cinematography and scripts sub. That is why it is so nice to watch a television movie that does exactly what it was created for. To tell a small story (not a simplified story) that does not require viewing on the big screen. <br /> <br /> “Easy kill” is an easy, interesting fare and a great clock. <Br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
