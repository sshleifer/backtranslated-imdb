I think Gerardâ€™s comments on the document hit on the head. An interesting film, but very long. This is definitely the antithesis of a new school of bright, sexy documents in the style of Moore. There are no narrator, no facts or related information, and no other tricks. What you see is what you get - a glimpse into the disappearing world of the Soldier of Tibet. As a big fan of documentation, I was surprised at how much I lost attention to this film, namely because of the length and lack of dialogue. In the end, I would recommend if the topic sounds interesting to you. It is beautifully filmed, informative and represents a valuable (and final) window into the lifestyle of Tibetan salts (and women :) - all important attributes of a good document. But put a big pot of coffee, it will help.
