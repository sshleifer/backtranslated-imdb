*** May contain spoilers *** Well, it was not quite as good as expected, in fact, it was not at all the way I thought, but the film still turned out to be pretty good. <br /> <br /> I usually don’t care too much about this type of music, but in this film it worked perfectly (I mean, he’s a rock star), but in any case I liked Stuart Townsend and Aalia, although she’s there was little participation in the film was awesome. <br /> <br /> And although Tom Cruise played Lestat in an interview with a vampire, I have to admit that I am glad that he refused the role, although I usually hate when they use Different people play the same characters, for example, the sequel and other <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was great and I liked to watch it, even if there were parts that could be better. Great movie about vampires.
