Accepted ... we'll see. The only reason I decided to watch this movie was a hot dog shown in commercials when Schrader (sp?) Said, "Ask me about my host." After that, I HAD to watch this movie, and I watched it with a couple of my friends ... and WOW was just awesome. One of the best films of the year. The whole movie I was laughing like crazy! The plot of this story is this: Bartleby (Justin Long) is not accepted in any of the schools he entered, so he creates another fake college for him and his friends so that he can fool his parents to ACT to the college. Thus, he makes the final touches and fools his parents ... until more and more students look at the site and see the clicker (ACCEPTING ONE PUSH), and all these failures come to this school. They face many problems, and they simply cannot understand something correctly. LOVED IT NOW WATCH IT
