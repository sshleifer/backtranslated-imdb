District of the Kingdom, Vermont, 1927. Noel Lord (Rip Thorn) lives with his Indian comrade Bangor (Tanto Cardinal) in the area where a large dam is to be built; Noel, however, does not want to surrender on his land, and he will have to fight with the dam company to prevent the possible destruction of the district. <br /> <br /> “Where the rivers flow northward” is an exciting, contemplative story based on the unforgettable views of Rip Thorne (recently seen in the small but lush role of Louis XV in the underestimated Marie Antoinette by Sofia Coppola) and Tantoo Cardinal (“Dances with Wolves”, “Smoke Signals”), directed by Jay Craven (who also wrote the script with Don Bredes on the basis of Howard’s Frank Frank Mosher’s novel) and filmmaker Paul Ryan created this powerful story with unique, contemplative tempos / visuals, which resemble t me the best moments of Terrence Malick and John Huston. This is the underestimated independent period of the first (electric) half of the 90s, usually seen as Quentin Tarantino’s burlesque growth (“Pulp Fiction” is really a masterpiece, but the person suffers from Orson Wells syndrome), anxious Todd Solondz Suburb, Danny Boyle’s dismal vision in Britain to mention that the film "The Beach" with DiCaprio) ... Jay Craven should be considered more in the lists of great indie cinematographers. He leads a respectful, restrained career, and it is always nice to see a constant talent like his. <br /> <br /> My vote is 8/10.
