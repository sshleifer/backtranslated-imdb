The film is really cool, I thought. It sticks pretty well to the original game, and some battle scenes are depicted with such high details that it is unbelievable. I thought that the film could be a little better if it gave you a little more information to the end, but trying to figure out what is happening attracts you with this film. <br /> <br /> CG is beautiful, I donâ€™t think they could do a better job in terms of graphics. Every little thing, how they move, what their swords look like, everything is perfect. The way they make characters seems like they are real people. <br /> <br /> The music was great, and it seemed funny to me to hear how much new tools and effects had been remixed from the original game. <br /> <br /> To everyone and everyone, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves fast paced and good plot. I would definitely play the game before watching the movie.
