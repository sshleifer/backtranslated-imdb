Enjoy every moment of this languid spectacle with music to match (5th Mahler is gorgeous, but listen to the vocal part of the 3rd symphony, so beautifully used in this film). This film has many aspects, but the main theme is the irresistible power of beauty, its spontaneous nature, the absence of logic for love and adoration. I am also an ardent admirer of Bogarde and I think that he is rarely as wonderful (but try it in the “Servant”). Note: I recommend several views.
