People need to learn to watch what is on the screen. This is a great movie based on slow, careful collection of details that serve to establish the identity of these two people. The passivity of Yusuf (Emin Toprak), a cousin of the country, is well described by his fear of talking to women. He has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman, and he loses them all. He has many decades of bachelor life ahead, and maybe unemployment. <br /> <br /> Mahmut is another case. He left the small town, working very hard (we represent), and his resentment on bums, such as Yusuf, is palpable (he leaves the crumbs on an expensive carpet - a slob!). We are shown a group of friends who talk about Tarkovsky, by the way, and we note that Mahmut has regretted - but only a slight regret - that his work has become commercial over the years. The gap between the cousins ​​is getting wider and wider. The theme of the mouse trap is surprisingly lively, it evokes Yusuf’s sympathy and confusion and a cold-blooded solution to Makhmut’s problems. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of two classic films about people driving each other crazy: I remember Shabrol’s cousins ​​(a rich boy with Hitler's pretensions played by Briali) and “The Spider Woman's Kiss” (William Hurt cannot understand why everyone is so angry). Nuri Bilge Ceylan takes his place among the dozen important directors who are currently active. I just hope that in the future he will rely on co-authors, instead of directing, writing and shooting his own films.
