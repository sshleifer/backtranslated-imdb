Look, this film is unclear, brilliant and classic, which should be sought by any means necessary. I believe that the authority decided that it would be permanently sent to the trash bin; nevertheless, we could only pray for the opportunity to see it on DVD. I would say that it even beats the great Phatasm. If you like a dark movie with a lot of creepy images, watch this movie and see how it should be a horror movie of the 80s.
