A film that someone had to make. <br /> <br /> Wako: The Rules of Engagement reveal evidence of a standoff in Waco, Texas, which led to the destruction of the Davidian estate and the alleged cover of the government. <br /> The first thing you need to know about this film: you will see brief but disturbing photos of the bodies of the dead. This is not done for shock values, but in order to illustrate the moments of their death, as if you were present at the coroner's investigation. <br /> <br /> The second thing you need to know about this film: at two o'clock and a quarter past an hour, it's pretty hard - especially if you were already closely following the events at that time. If you are unaware of any events other than those reported in the media, or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is an official government report, this may be important to watch. If, on the other hand, you need a shorter (albeit inexcusably one-sided) version of events, you should see “Waco: The Big Lie”. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is largely a definite documentary about this tragic event, and very sobering, but as a work on making a film can test your patience, especially if you have a short attention span. And sometimes this is unnecessary for those who followed CSPAN hearings and reports in 60 minutes. <br /> <br /> Maybe someday someone will make a documentary that covers some unfamiliar aspects of this story, such as a strange chain of events that led to the ATF raid or psychological warfare tactics that the FBI used explosive rock music in the sect, and their charismatic leaders (all rock musicians themselves) picked up their instruments and turned their massive amplifiers outward to blow their own music back onto them.
