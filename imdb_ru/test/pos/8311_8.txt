His fantasy adventures of John Dark-Kevin Connor became the basis of films about summer vacations a few days before Star Wars: they were not masterpieces, they did not have the most modern special effects, but they were exactly that audience about children in the middle 70s. <br /> <br /> In the “Core of the Earth”, it sounds exactly the sound that is suitable for Burroughs's purposeful adventure about the Victorian inventor Peter Cushing and the inevitable Doug McClure ending in the underground world of Pelucidar and the battle with his evil telepathic fighting dinosaurs. This time, the dolls went in favor of the men in the monster costumes, which is much more fun if you are ready to suspend your disbelief, and if not, there is always something to see about Caroline Munro. In addition to being the worst performance of Peter Cushing, an annoying but dotier rephrasing of his Doctor Who movie (“You can't hypnotize me, I'm British!”), This is by far the best John Dark-Kevin Connor movie. Doug McClure's fantastic adventures are surprisingly well-controlled and possess atmospheric use of color. Never coping well with exterior scenes, Alan Hume's photo greatly benefits from the control that the studio set gives him (the film was shot exclusively on sound scenes) to paint a darkly bright world worthy of the original cover. Not high art, but definitely great Saturday fun.
