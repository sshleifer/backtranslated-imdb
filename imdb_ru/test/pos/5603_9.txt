While the camera work was certainly “fun” - perhaps one voice below “hammered by stones” - the premise of the film was fantastic. It really took a sentimental (in the true tradition of Hal Hartley) a glance at God, Jesus and the Devil. The interaction of Jesus and Satan gives some funny scenes ... Even the monologues of Jesus were magnificent - it was by far the best Jesus I have ever seen. So calm, like Zen, son of God, but still such a nice guy. At one level, this is a very general view of the paradoxes of Christianity, but still there is a personal level at which you can communicate with Jesus Christ without having a complex of God (thanks to Martin Donovan and Hal Hartley).
