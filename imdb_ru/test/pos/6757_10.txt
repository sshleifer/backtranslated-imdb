A brilliant animated film that was far ahead of its time and, of course, far ahead of everything that was released in mass production at the same moment in history. The impact of this work on Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is obvious. One can only imagine how Starevich worked on all the beautifully detailed frames of this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> There were very few animated films of this scale. It is a pity that more people did not see this gem. <br /> <br /> Apparently, IMdB now requires comments to be at least ten lines long, so this is the tenth line. It must be something new - but I really have nothing more to say!
