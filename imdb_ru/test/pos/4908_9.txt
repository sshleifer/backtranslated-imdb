In the film “Four Daughters,” directed by Michael Curtis, there are four musically gifted sisters, their fiancés and their father, a minor guide. Showers like Adam Lemp and Sisters Lane, Lola, Rosemary and Priscilla, and Gail Page as his energetic daughters. His final scene takes place in the living room of Lemps. A cigarette dangles from his lips, Borden plays one of his compositions. Ann Lemp from Priscilla Lane tells him that the piece is beautiful. But he says: "Stinks." He continues: "He has no beginning or end, there is only the middle." Ann calls him to create a beginning and an end. Borden replies: “Why? Destiny against me. They threw a coin - my heads are poor, my tails are rich. But they threw a two-headed coin. ” Viewers liked the way Garfield, in his coarse city voice, said that Stinks. This scene created the character on Garfield's screen as an eternal outsider. "Four daughters" is a piece of Americana with Garfield in a convincing performance, giving more than a hint of darkness. <br /> <br />
