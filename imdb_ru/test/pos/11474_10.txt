That's fantastic! A painful and perverse story of coincidence and deception. <br /> <br /> The story is carefully and ingeniously designed. This is really the perfect mix: it has everything from waiting to humor, and the story is told with a lot of originality ... The film is built like a puzzle, which is assembled piece by piece, and solves the story ... For the viewer there are many surprises to the end !! I also had a slight impression that the director was inspired by some work of Hitchcock. I also saw films before, where you see the same event happening from different points of view, but this film goes beyond that. In this film, everything is built on what happens to the body, which appears, disappears and reappears elsewhere. Each actor in the story has a secret, and we become aware of it in a way that helps build the puzzle ... I especially liked the scenes with dark humor ... who made the whole theater laugh .... This movie is a must see for everyone!
