Romeo and Juliet were interpreted differently, but very few of the versions reflected the essence of the play. The only ones I can think of to really impress the spirit of romance were WEST SIDE STORY and, believe it or not, “Tromao and Juliet” from Troma Film. At first glance, this is another simple splattered holiday, and many will think that it is killing Shakespeare's classics. However, the film has an honest feeling about it. Updated to appeal to sick young people today, of course, but not without merit. Yes, frequent dismemberment, body piercings, car accidents, lesbian sex scenes, masturbation and incest - bad taste, but what harm if you have such a cute love story as a basis? Despite the fact that most of the roles in this film (I mean, this is TROMA, after all), the two main characters have some genuine chemistry, more than TITANIC and STAR WARS EPISODE TWO big budgetary monsters. There is a big upgrade, but most of the original text is in tact, especially when Trémo and Juliet are together. There is a wonderful scene in which Juliet says the famous “Parting is such a sweet sadness,” and in the mid-nineties Tromeo follows in a grunge style: “Yes, it sucks.” I think it is truly regrettable that this film will not receive the recognition or wide release it deserves. I hope that the people who see it on the shelves of the video store will not be turned off by the coarse woman in the film, because they will miss the rather disruptive experience.
