I caught it on TV once when I was young and loved it. In the 1970s there were a lot of unconvincing comedies who tried too hard to be funny, so it was a pleasant surprise. This is one of the best comedies of the 1970s and a unique comedy in the summer camp thanks to the excellent comedy play Murnar, which is still considered one of his greatest. This is a film that really caught the attention of director Ivan Reitman. With this movie, Reitman proves that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. While this movie is hilarious and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad it's fun, MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely horrible. Recommended for those who like STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.
