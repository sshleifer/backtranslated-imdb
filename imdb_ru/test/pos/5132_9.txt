The horn was awesome. Owls are adorable, and the film highlights an interesting environmental issue I didn't know about. Florida is full of funny characters, and the film shows it perfectly on screen. My children especially loved different animals, from snakes to owls and alligators. It's a really simple story, but also one that they have to hear at this age. When children are young, then they really develop their sense of values, and yes, one of them must take care of our environment and all the creatures that live in it. I think it was great that the film even sparked a conversation with them about going home about animals and how to help them. It was just really nice and patient to hear my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the chicks. In any case, on the whole it was a really great time, and I would recommend the film to anyone who is looking for something interesting and meaningful.
