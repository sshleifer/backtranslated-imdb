Nemesis Game is a stunning film filled with riddles, death, mystery and philosophy. In the simplest sense, the film is about finding answers and about what happens when you finally find them all. Searching for answers leads Sarah Novak along a path that is becoming darker and more interesting. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth it, but Sarah is so close to understanding all of this. What would you do if you were offered to finally understand the chaos of life? <br /> <br /> The film was shot and shot by Jesse Varn. Although it was Warne's first feature film, it doesnâ€™t reflect at all in the film, but instead demonstrates the sophistication and artistic approach to story telling. Carly Pope was strong in the lead role and showed the depth of complexity that it was interesting to watch. I would really like to see more of her work. <br /> <br /> Based on riddles, this is a very valuable movie. This is your thing, since it is mine, then I fully recommend watching the game Nemesis. Rating: 4.5 / 5
