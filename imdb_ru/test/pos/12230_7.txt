“A Fare to Remember” is an absolutely derivative, almost funny movie, but it has a warmth that makes it a very effective and optimistic holiday movie. The cast is pretty new, Chellen Cates, as a high-level advertising manager who, just before the wedding, has to flee from Los Angeles to Seattle to retain the client, who rejected any other presentation. She had difficulties with transportation from the very beginning and it looks like she has no money. This is the first nonsense - there were no ATMs anywhere? She must make a fortune. In any case, she meets a taxi driver (Warner), who looks like a homeless person, and he will take her to the presentation, and when she shows up with a huge box of dried meat (a client's product), he is there to take her to the airport. All flights are canceled, so to get to her wedding in Los Angeles, she hires him to take her there. <br /> <br /> Along the way, they connect and learn from each other. This is a very cute film, although there is absolutely nothing new in it - it combines Six Days and Seven Nights and several other films. But the chemistry between the stars is good, they are pleasant, and the game is good. Look for Jerry Springer as head of the beef selection company and the cameo role of Karl Malden. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for filming during the holiday season. This is for life.
