What are the cast and actresses in this episode with Colombo, besides Peter Falk, you have the twins Julie Newmar, Jannet Nolan, Martin Landau. Be that as it may, the old uncle mysteriously dies, and it looks like a heart attack on a bicycle, discovered by his fiance Julia Newmar, who plays this role so adorable.
