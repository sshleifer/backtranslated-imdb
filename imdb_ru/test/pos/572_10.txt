You know, before watching this film, I had little sympathy for those who got into criminal cases. I mean, if they were arrested and charged, “they must have been guilty,” I reasoned? <br /> <br /> I have formed this opinion for several years. You see my good friend who once worked as a detective in some of the dirtiest areas of Sydney. He often complained that his police efforts were wasted because of the "bleeding heart" of lawyers and magistrates. He "slammed the fraudsters in the morning, and they" would have returned to the street by noon. "It mattered ... they exhausted him. He left. <br /> <br /> He argued since then Not without reason I thought the creative gathering of evidence to keep the villains "where they belong" was ... well ... "acceptable". <br /> <br /> My arguments about the rights of innocent people were not wrong, he argued. "What are chances that you will ever be arrested and accused of a serious crime? "- he will object. And being a law-abiding citizen, the weight of his arguments convinced me that he is right. Chances are I or any of my family or friends accused of murder or a serious crime were zero, I didn’t think about anything. <br /> <br /> Hmmm. As I mentioned earlier, watching this amazingly instructive documentary changed all this. <br /> <br /> I send him a copy.
