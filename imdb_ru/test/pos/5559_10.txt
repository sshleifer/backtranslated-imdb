Growing up in the late 60s and 70s, I could not help but become a fan of science fiction. With America’s space program supremely, science fiction books, films, TV shows and comics nourished my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe. Farscape is so unlike any other sci-fi show, but it has all the ingredients that shows such as Star Trek, Battlestar Gallatica, X-Files and Deep Space Nine have done. One of Farscape’s criticisms is that the casual viewer cannot just jump in and watch one episode and understand what is happening. There were other very successful shows in which several plot arches and complex characters were used. This is for me one of the charms of the show. I don’t need or don’t want the story to be neatly connected at the end of each episode, as Star Trek’s different incarnations did. In general, Farscape has wonderful and funny characters and a storyline that says that although people may be the least developed or advanced intellectual species in the universe, they still have unique qualities and abilities. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, myopic people on Sci-Fi channel canceled the 5th season of Farscape. They stated that the cancellation was based on a downgrade. But just a few years ago, it was their most popular series with the highest rating. It is a pity that all the artists who help to create this show will not be able to continue their love work due to the financial problems of the company / channel that made all this possible in the first place. <br /> <br /> Hey, don't take my word for it, watch the show, watch the replays and decide for yourself. Help save Farscape!
