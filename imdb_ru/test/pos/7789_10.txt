I love this film. Image of Shehzad Khan as Bhalla AK "Shut up, Robert!" It was so fun. Whenever he was hit during a fight, you could hear him scream. Viju Khote - Dumbfounded Robert a.k.a. "Rabbit". I like this Shakti Kapoor a.k.a. "Crime Master Gogo". The double role of Pares Raval is so amazing for his portrayal as Ramgopal Bajaj and Shyamgopal Bajaj. Rabbi Tandon and Karisma Kapoor are out of this world. My brother is really good at repeating Bhally’s words. "Relax. PLEASE, relax." I like the scene in which Aamir Khan injects a laxative into Salman's “Muscles” Khan’s food, which caused irregular bowel movements, causing him to use the toilet many times.
