Hoot is a nice simple movie with a simple message. It seemed that this film is for small children, but I know that this film will appeal to adults. The storyline is pretty simple. A child who has moved to Florida should help a football athlete and a rogue to save burrowing owls from building a pancake house. The message in this film is especially important for activists and animal lovers. The message that you are doing everything possible to save the endangered animals. Acting in this film is worthy. All three children looked like they had good chemistry. The music is not too shabby. I liked the Jimmy Buffett songs in this movie. In general, this is a good family movie. I rate this movie 9/10.
