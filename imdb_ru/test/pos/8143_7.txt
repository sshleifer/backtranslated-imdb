“Purgatory”, recently shown via cable, is a small film with a lot of things. Harris Don leads with style. The screenplay of Mr. Doné and Dian Fain is a good fighter. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen the movie yet, perhaps you should stop reading. <br /> <br /> The film is a story about a young doctor in Los Angeles who made a mistake and lives to pay for it. After being released from prison, he wants to hide in a small town, where, according to his feelings, he will be forgotten. Bad choice! What Thomas Reed finds in Purgatory is hell in the desert. Immediately after getting a job as a bar tender, Thomas meets a pretty young woman, Sunny, who obviously is the one who should be kept away from. A young doctor is called to help because the guy Sunny Randy is shot dead by a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> We are meeting the Randy family. His uncle Dean seems fine, but his brother Owen is a free gun. Everyone in the household is associated with Nubil Sunny in different ways. <br /> <br /> The performances are in order. Vincent Ventreska is Thomas, the man who had to go to his safety practice instead of going to a small town. Alexandra Holden - Sunny, a young woman with a great desire to escape from her surroundings. Kevin Alejandro, Gregg Henry, Brian Austin play well in the men of the Meklin family. Nicholas Turturro also made a great contribution as a drug dealer. <br /> <br /> The film shows a promising director who will go far, judging from this tightly constructed film.
