The film, which received Im Kwon-Taek in the nomination “Best Director in Cannes” in 2002 (linked to PT Anderson for “Drunken Punch Love”), tells about a 19th-century Korean artist who has simple roots and significant influence on Korean painting. One of the strengths of the film is that I try to help us see through the eyes of an artist, so we see several scenes and objects that help our drunken artist friend, Chan Son-upu (Choi Min-chic), to get Inspiration. <br /> <br /> The costumes and decorations are impressive, and the acting skills are good. This is not a film that touched me, but it made me think about art and what it means to find my voice in it. That's cool. It is also interesting to see the version of Korea in those days, right before the beginning of the century, when the Chinese and Japanese powers are in Korea, and the kingdom of Joseon comes to an end. The film contains more than one revolution and political ideology, but they are never the center. It is firmly on the artist. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a well-made film about the artist's life. But he definitely doesn’t have the usual three-part story, so you should be able to take a non-standard Hollywood story to watch it. Uya for art! 8/10
