If this film were filmed by D.W. Griffith or Stanley Kubrick, he would be recognized for what he is: a cinematic masterpiece told with depth, sophistication and passion, a film that has no analogues in the visual world. This is an incredibly stunning and very cruel depiction of our great heritage of greed and destruction. And, of course, reviewers could not accept the fact that they did not tell a simple narrative story about Dick-and-Jane, like 99% of Hollywood products. His characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts, fears and emotions. They even seem to think something that ordinary film reviewers do not understand and cannot tolerate, so they destroyed it. See the original uncut widescreen version. This is amazing.
