The Curse of Monkey Island is a brilliant video game, and its ingenious design from the creators of video games in Lucasarts created this sequel. All the characters are brilliant, off-screen shots for the characters were realistic and fun. A lot of effort has been put into this game, and it deserves the 10 that I gave to the vote, keep up the good work, lucasarts!
