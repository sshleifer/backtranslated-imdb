The heroic young scout leads a large group of pioneers along the BIG TRAIL to the West, where Indian attacks, natural disasters and romantic complications are part of the adventure. <br /> <br /> Just as awesome and gorgeous as his story, Raoul Walsh's “GREAT TRAIL” is a wonderful film, as interesting as more than seven decades ago. Possessing a very good acting and excellent production qualities, he justifies his reputation as the first Talking Western epic western. <br /> <br /> John Wayne, who played his first important role in the movie because of the obscurity, looks incredibly young, but he immediately impresses with the natural charm and male authority he brings to the role of the hero; he calmly dominates the movie with attributes that will ever make him a huge star. Margaret Churchill looks like a beautiful southern beauty that slowly warms the Duke's attention. The dialect comic "El Brendel" is a great pleasure, as the Swedish immigrant is surrounded by problems of a mule and mother-in-law; his appearance in the scene signals the audience about laughter. <br /> <br /> Tyrone Power Sr., looking like a grizzly bear man, huge and disgusting, makes him a great villain. Sleek cardboard boxer Ian Keith is a sophisticated bad guy. (His famous physical resemblance to John Gilbert is very obvious here.) The silent actor of film actor Tally Marshall is impressive as a cunning old mountain man who helps to drive a train. Fat Russ Powell, as a friendly fur hunter, uses his vocal talent to create meaningless noises. Witty filmmakers will see Ward Bond as one of the Missouri settlers. <br /> <br /> What will surprise many modern viewers is that THE BIG TRAIL was filmed in an early wide-screen process called Grandeur. The picture is not just its name, but it looks amazing: Walsh demonstrates the mastery of the new technology. He fills the screen, every part of it with action. During the mass scenes, pay attention to how everyone is doing the actual work, which adds so much to the plausibility of these sequences. Walsh deserves great praise for being one of the first directors to use widescreen. In addition, there is no rear projection image in the film that overshadows many old films. It should also be emphasized that it is quite natural that the soundtrack sounds a bit primitive; the radios were still in the cradle. The fact that Walsh could even use a microphone, and most of the scenes were filmed on the street, he likes. <br /> <br /> BIG TRAIL was not successful at the box office. In 1930, the comedies of William Haynes were major sources of money, and the public was looking not only for intellectual westerns, but also for others. Most of the cast has escaped into obscurity, including Wayne. Only in 1939, when John Ford saved him at STAGECOACH, would the legend of John Wayne begin in earnest. And, despite its grandiose and broad prospects, it will be another 25 years before the widescreen film catches Hollywood, mainly as a response to the economic threat from television.
