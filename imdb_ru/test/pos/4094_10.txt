The musical version of LOST HORIZON, released in 1973, is the most wonderful and cute musical film ALL TIME. A musical remake of the 1973 novel by James Hilton about the mythical SHANGRI-LA! This is a real special pearl. BURT BACHARACH music and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight dramatic, adventure and musical episodes. This is the only anti-war musical fantasy ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money abroad. Only in America it failed. Very different and unique in his approach as a musical film, he deserves much more respect than is given. As a story, “The Lost Horizon” is an incredible adventure, and the 1937 Frank Capra film, and this 1973 musical, are faithful adaptations of the James Hilton novel. What I like about the 1973 version is the freedom of the musical numbers. The film has a prestigious cast, a talented director and cinematographer. This is BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La, and this is a great place. Songs like “The World is a Circle,” “Share Joy,” and “Living Together,” grow together, bring about the happiness Hilton wrote about in his novel. Why shouldn't Shangri-La be a little stupid place? Two love songs, “I can get scared,” and “I come to you,” are the sensitive places in the picture. In both of these songs peacefulness and soft quality reigns, which is very consistent with the philosophy of history. Moreover, “Things I won’t miss” is a good duet with a strong melody. This is a good exchange of opinions of different types, and who can be wrong when Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman stomp, sing and dance on the tables? They are a wonderful team, and the number is well organized. <br /> <br /> In this story, I always wondered how the Supreme Lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in Shangri-La. The character of the Supreme Lama is a gentle soul, but somewhat radical in his view of humanity as a whole. He has no hope for a world outside of Shangri-La. If this film were to be redone today, it would be interesting to see a greater emphasis on the main character, the RICHARD ONWAY conflict with what he left in the outside world, and not what he found in Shangri-La. <br /> <br /> Of course, in order for the film to be believable, the character of Richard Conway must be presented as suffering from amnesia at the end, as he was in the book. None of the versions of the movie "Lost Horizon" was true to the novel in this regard. Conway found Shangri-La or was it imagined? They all died in a plane crash? Each person has his own idea of ​​what his Shangri-La will be. The conflict with Conway, wanting to believe in Shangri-La and returning to his old life in the outside world, is very strong. I love the longing on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy, and Wan when they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. Interestingly, Conway does not want to leave paradise, but his brother puts pressure on him. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work differently, but both of them successfully explore James Hilton's ideas about a hidden valley, where money has no value, and moderation is the rule. So in a sense, this is anti-capitalism in its subject, where money and materialism are not motivation. Human kindness, decency, compassion, politeness, etiquette and harmonious living with each other is the rule. <br /> <br /> LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. He tries to answer the basic fundamental questions of life, and one can hardly blame him for not succeeding. It should be remembered that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was after CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for characters to appear in a song in a musical, and even more so that other singers would call them. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for tormented critics. Expectations for him were high, almost unfounded. There were two targets to hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH, and the critics were going to get both of them. Ross Hunter had decades of financial success as a producer, and Lost Horizon was his next film to his 1970 blockbuster. This film was the largest source of Universals profit by then, and the success of this film triggered a decade of disaster films. For years, AIRPORT has been the most popular film ever shown on television. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including the Best Picture. At the time, Bert Bacharah and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. Shameless sentimentality LOST HORIZON hardly had a chance after the collapse of censorship in films such as EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and GODFATHER. Sex and violence became a new frontier in the late 60s and early 70s. The audience flocked to movies with content that they could not see on the screen. Generous musicals were no longer accepted, no matter how well they were made. Today LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. This is a terrific escapist film with a strong history, beautiful music, expensive budget and unusual humor. This is unconventional in the sense that the music is introduced into the film only after 45 minutes. He changes course in the middle of the path, when the mystical valley is introduced, and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a paradise film that deserves to be re-discovered. Lost and legendary treasure, deserving much better than its reputation.
