What a wonderful documentary - I sat down, thinking that it would paraphrase the bough stories told in Light Riders, Mad Bulls, but in reality, this is a clear, glorious celebration of a strange and distorted era that spawned some truly great movies. What struck me was the lack of bitterness, evident in an interview with the director, given that the film industry now sucks on a large scale - instead, people like Friedkin and Coppola seem to sparkle positively, recalling their glory days. The video of the audience leaving the exorcist’s daily show was invaluable. “It was traumatic,” says one guy. Gorgeous epitaph for the late Ted Demme, an exciting movie, I just wish it was longer — I could sit out in three hours.
