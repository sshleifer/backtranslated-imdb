Chris Noth plays a maniac who wrote a children's book as a child, posing as a doctor who threatens the community to put his sister's son in the shoes of the genius of his school. The only person who can stop him is a policeman who plays by his own rules and is forced to go under cover with the help of his dumb father who communicates using the oujii board. Rick Springfield finds out what happened? Or someone is sabotaging his recording studio! Does a mentally retarded boy who runs a book cell phone have any tips? Watch to find out! I do not invent it!
