Not everyone likes this movie. This is still one of the best Satanist films you have ever thought. The fact that he does not have jumps or gusts of the MTV era every seven minutes does not matter. In addition, acting in the role of the one who actually KNOWS the Satanists, (part of the spoiler!) Parts of the film in which the Brotherhood exchanges its old bodies for the bodies of teenagers, it has really scary scenes. The section where (second spoiler warning) Strother Martin is organizing a replacement is almost super-realistic, because it uses very few special effects, which is a distinctive feature of this film. McIviti rarely received a large budget, but was often effective. It worked in this case.
