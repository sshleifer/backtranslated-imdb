VERY unforgettable comedy. It is interesting to observe how many situations evolve and, finally, converge after a long journey to this greatest collection of eclectic humanity (and the world's largest honky-thin) - the great American freeway. Like "... crazy, crazy world", it has a lot of modern talent, the policies of the old boy, good comedy and dialogue. By contrast, it is the goal that is seeking, not the unwitting seekers — they have no idea what they really want as they sail along America’s great road. Nor does it have the weight of having a good fall guy, who is saved only at the end by a big belly laugh. But the final sequence of stunts is nothing short of exciting, with excellent film editing, humor and timing, and the scene of a large city bank is funny with the very original play of one very talented character in particular. Full aplomb of urban residents in the face of chaos leaves a feeling like a proverb on the ceiling. The slap is fun, but the Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and seen carefully, because it is amazingly filled with nuances and reactions of characters that are easy to miss. In general, a very funny reflection of who we were and is, good or bad, and stupid situations in which we are. It was just FUNNY, and it is!
