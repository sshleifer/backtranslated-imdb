Jenny Lewis plays a clumsy girl named Jade. She smokes and drinks. She doesn't have many friends, and she has a nagging mother (Beverly D'Angelo). Jade discovers that he is getting closer to his mom Billy's boyfriend (Rob Estes), maybe she attracts him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens after that. <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite TV movie. This film shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This film also has the best acting game that I have seen in television films. Beverly D'Angelo does an excellent job as a sweet and loving, but scornful and blind mother. She could not see what was going on under her own roof. Rob Estes at his best as a scum. Jenny Lewis is outstanding. It looks like she is very similar to her character. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to love this movie!
