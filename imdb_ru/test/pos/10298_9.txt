"L'appartement" should be one of the best French films I've ever seen (along with Hatred, also starring Vincent Cassel, and these wonderful films of Gerard Depardieu / Pierre Richard) Cassel and Bellucci are great in the main cast In addition to The Brotherhood of the Wolves and Doberman, I have not seen a bad film with this couple. L'appartement sucks you right from the start, and the turns make you excited until the very end. A fragment of the plot really did not work so well with "Pulp Fiction." Let's just hope that there will not be a single horrible American remake of this unique novel / mysterious thriller. (EDIT: Guess what! Damn it, the American remake was done!)!
