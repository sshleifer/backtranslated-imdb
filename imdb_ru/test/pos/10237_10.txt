Nightbreed is not only great, but unique, even with other Barker films that never lack originality. Amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. For the horror genre, there are quite a few subtle symbols and references in it. Of course, a lot of fun, think a little, if someone wants. And, not to forget, a good musical score. Well, special effects, as usual, age the fastest, but this is perhaps the only drawback. I just saw it again in ten years, and I still find it to recommend.
