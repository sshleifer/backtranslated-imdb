Ignore everyone else’s comments on this movie and watch it on a paid cable (like me) or rent it. You owe it to yourself. This film is what films (should be) all about. It is difficult to categorize (and God knows how it was presented as a “high concept”!), But this one is for angels. Check this. What do you have to lose?
