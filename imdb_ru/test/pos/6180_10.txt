It must be that the comments on the planktonula were written on Tops Day, because everything that is said in this simple form of life is the opposite of the real truth! <br /> <br /> Bluebeard's Eighth Wife is ridiculous in every scene, in all respects the chemistry between Colbert and Cooper could not be better ... the support of the actors is great. <br /> <br /> Writing and directing are great !!! <br /> <br /> Like many other comments on this board, I again complain: “Why can't movies be like this anymore?” <br /> <br /> This is a classic 1930s Paramount prankster comedy, guys!
