I really appreciate what Jung-won did before he died. Everything. I want to say that his choice of love is disinterested. If he chose Da-Rome, it would be good for him. But Da-Rome will need more time to recover from his death. Obviously, he does not want this to happen. As in the film, he decided to give up. So for Darima it was only a temporary agony. <br /> <br /> For comparison: “My life without me” is completely different. Their behavior shows a big difference between Eastern culture and Western culture. I can not say that better. Everyone can have the right to choose. It is completely up to you. Life is the same for everyone. We can only live once. Any choice is acceptable, if only you believe that it suits you. <br /> <br /> In fact, the slow pace of the film is no excuse for abandoning the film. Just calm down. You will get more from the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best Korean films I've ever watched. 9/10
