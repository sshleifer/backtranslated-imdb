*** Spoilers ahead *** In my late childhood there were two cinematographic icons: “Star Wars” and this film by the Czech genius Karel Zeman. Encyclopedia by Jules Verne, in which the illustrations of the XIX century come to life in a refined black and white photo in combination with freeze-frame and ordinary animation. Verna's spirit of adventure is fully present throughout the film, as well as very contemporary questions about the moral limits of power and advanced technology. In fact, it brings atomic energy into the Verne universe in a very elliptical and elegant way. Also elliptical and elegant is the death of a villain with an explosion (probably nuclear), who sends his hat over the sea. The resolution of the film is symbolic and very satisfactory, something very rare today, when many films do not seem to know how to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> I was lucky to catch this gem in replays on local television in the late 70s: it increased my enjoyment of fiction and film from Verne. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 for Karel Zeman, an underestimated master of imagination.
