The Last Dinosaur is a movie that should be fun and exciting. He succeeds in both. <br /> <br /> Maston is a big game hunter who hunts big game (go figure). Owning the company, he plans to go on an expedition with a group of people, including a photographer named Frankie, a Japanese scientist, a guy who works for his company named Chuck, and an African guy who helped him on many safaris named Boon Ta. to explore what is believed to be Tyrannosaurus Rex, the dinosaur that killed the last expedition to the area. They will reach this prehistoric area by taking a drilling machine that travels under the water called the Polar Burets. Reaching this area, they soon found a tyrannosaur who Maston is trying to shoot, but his gun is stuck. Chuck immediately feels that Maston wanted to hunt a dinosaur all the time to add him to his collection of Stuffed Animals. While they were absent, the Tyrannosaurus invades their camp and takes the Polar Borer from their camp. Upon returning, the group realizes that they may be in the area longer than they expected, and Maston says that he will kill a tyrannosaur. <br /> <br /> This story is great for a sci-fi movie. Drilling in the prehistoric area is what seems to really happen. The scenery is beautiful and looks like a place where dinosaurs can still live. <br /> <br /> I also liked the characters in this film. Muston is a typical big time hunter who wants to get something that could be a trophy kill. Bun Ta was also great, played by Luther Rackley, a former NBA employee who really looks and acts like an African tracker. Jackie is a typical woman who creates problems for the group and does not seem to belong to the desert. Chuck is a former Maston employee who has a look at changing his boss when he's in the wild with him. <br /> <br /> The tyrannosaurus in this film is one of the best in the film. He stands too straight, like Godzilla, and drags his tail, so this is a guy in a suit. But the suit looks good, especially the head and tail, and Tyrannosaurus rex looks good and very scary. I have seen many other films where dinosaur costumes look a lot worse. Tyrannosaurus in this film sometimes makes a roar, sounding like Godzilla, and sometimes roars like King Kong from “Escape King Kong” and “King Kong vs Godzilla”. SO great tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> In the "Last Dinosaur" a lot of action. Particularly noteworthy is the big battle between tyrannosaurus and triceratops. Also a great scene where Boon Ta is trying to save up a tyrannosaur. There are other wonderful details that I will not give. You have to make sure yourself. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. Watch this and you will not be disappointed.
