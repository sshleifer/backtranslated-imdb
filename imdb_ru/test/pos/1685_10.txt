Everything related to “Choose Connor” was central, especially the script and the very skillful work done by the 21-year-old director, writer, producer Luc Eberl. A talented young man from whom you can expect great things. All actions were trustworthy, the dialogue was intelligent, the topic was important. Liked !!! <br /> <br /> I saw it at the Woodstock Film Festival in 2007, where he was twice shown and stunningly discussed with the public. This is more than just a film about coming of age - this child learns a hard, heart-rending lesson about trust, politics and the “system” - how things that correspond to the personal plans of people in powerful positions actually work. <br /> <I would recommend this film to anyone who has a working brain.
