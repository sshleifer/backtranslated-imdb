It took me years to finally catch this gem of the film, and it was worth the wait. In almost all of his films, Clint always plays a hero. Be it a hero, an antihero, or an avenging hero. In this film, he is a pure villain, and he plays him well. <br /> <br /> Being injured by a union soldier, students and teachers teach him to heal. Soon after, he begins to seduce the ladies, regardless of their age, and some are quite young. He also plays on their jealousy and opposes them to each other. In the end, you'll never be so happy to see Clint die a horrible death. <br /> <br /> That is why this film is a gem. Clint has never made any other similar films, and after watching this film you would like him to star. He plays the role of a villain so well that it makes you wonder why he never starred in such films. This also explains why the film was not seen very often. Most people do not want to see Clint a villain, and soon after the release of the film “Dirty Harry” he became a hidden stone. If you are a Clint Eastwood fan, you must see this movie. You may not like what you see, but you will not soon forget it.
