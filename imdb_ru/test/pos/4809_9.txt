I just bought “An Zhan” (“Not enough time”) on DVD, and I must say that it was a great movie. Not very intense, from the point of view of the game with weapons, but definitely exciting and witty. I don't think I saw Andy Lau in better shape. And the editing of this film was very well done. See it now if you are a fan of Lau or HK thiller / action movie!
