After the collapse of Yesilcam (the Turkish response to Hollywood) in the mid-90s, few, except the most far-sighted observers, could have foreseen such a recent surge in the Turkish film industry, possibly based on the work of ex-photographer Nuri Bilge Ceylan. br /> <br /> Uzak is the third feature of the director, he forms a trilogy with two of his earlier paintings (“Kasaba” and “Clouds of May”), following similar themes and techniques. The film tells us that Mahmoud, a commercial photographer, lives alone in a small apartment in Istanbul, which is sometimes visited only by his rude, married lover. Yusuf, his nephew, left his village home after the factory was closed and he lost his job. The young man stays with Mahmud, fruitlessly looking for work in the city, drinks in a cafe and nervously watches young women whom he never approaches. <br /> <br /> The title of the film translates as “Distant,” and the film beautifully illustrates all sorts of connotations of the word; The physical distance of Yusuf from his home, the emotional distance of Mahmud from the world around him and the distance between generations between two people. <br /> <br /> Ceylan films rarely contain increased drama, instead allowing for full and rich characters to develop from within tightly framed, static shots. He acts as a director, producer, writer, filmmaker and co-editor and plays friends and family in many roles. It can be expected that such a closed, isolated approach to the creation of films will lead to the fact that the films will be difficult to penetrate and communicate with the majority of viewers, which makes Uzak's undoubted humanity even more impressive. <br /> <br /> However, Ceylan is a better cinematic formalist than a playwright who took power from past masters of cinematic language like Ozu and Tarkovsky. After watching Uzak, I can come up with some of the best ones suitable for this task.
