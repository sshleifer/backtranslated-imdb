After the world tour, it dawned on me that Australia really lacks one thing that other countries have: history. <br /> <br /> Fortunately or unfortunately, Australia was not founded after the war, it did not have civil war and most of its political history is pretty ..... boring! Nothing "big" happened to mark a turning point in the history of Australia ... until the resignation of the governor-general of the government of Whitlam, John Kerr. <br /> <br /> For those who are Australian, you can skip this paragraph and move on to the next one. This is for the benefit of curious non-Australians! Australia was colonized by the British. Over time, it became apparent that Australia was able to stand on its own feet. Accordingly, the UK granted Australia permission to create its own parliaments, laws, courts, and so on. Australian law and policy will no longer be provided directly by the British; rather, Australia will be ruled by Australians themselves, although courts, precedents, parliament, etc., are largely modeled on the British system. This shift was enshrined in the Constitution of Australia. Despite the fact that the constitution lawfully establishes the Australian governments, law-making procedures, courts (but for those who are curious there is no bill of rights), they are two “pro-coronary” sections that were included and remain there to this day. They are more or less considered as “reserve powers of the crown (king / queen of Great Britain)”. The first group of sections is related to the creation of the office of the governor-general. In short, the Governor-General is considered the main representative of the Queen in Australia and is described as the “executive” branch of the Australian government. When the Australian Parliament adopts a law, the constitution states that it becomes law only after it is signed by the governor-general. Thus, the Governor-General is considered to be nothing more than a rubber stamp that performs an archaic and unnecessary constitutional function on behalf of the crown. Theoretically, the Governor-General may refuse to sign a law passed by the Australian Parliament, if he considers it appropriate. For example, if parliament passed a law allowing the police to shoot any Australian over 50 years old (hypothetically, of course), then GG could refuse to sign it, and he would not become the law of the country. However, this power is theoretical and has never been used (for today). Under the “agreement” (which is a buzzword about the events leading to the dismissal), the governor-general actually acts at the direction of the Australian government and, therefore, if the government passes the law and the prime minister instructs the governor-general to sign, he will almost always questions. In fact, according to the “agreement”, the governor-general acts in accordance with the recommendations given to him by the prime minister of that time (and only by the prime minister). The second aspect is Section 64 of the Constitution, which states that government ministers hold their posts at the discretion of the governor-general. Now the events of 1975 - covered in this film - set a precedent in this particular section: if the governor-general is somehow “dissatisfied” with the government and / or the prime minister, it seems that this section allows him to legally dismiss the government (which happened in 1975 ... hence the name of the film “firing”). Is it possible to interpret that “at the discretion of the governor-general” as a “unimpeded right to dismissal” is a controversial issue, although this led to quite hot exchanges among Australians at that time — especially considering that the governor-general was not elected . <br /> <br /> Now that this background aspect has not gone away, let's return to the discussion of the film. It was well done. The pace was patient, but it didn’t drag out at all. The drama was very low-key and very realistic. This did not dramatize the events too much and, most importantly, it did not present its point of view from one political point of view. On the contrary, I felt that this was fair and balanced, although the final text before the captions indicates that the filmmakers probably did not endorse the decision of the Governor-General about the resignation of the Whitlam government. But I would not describe the film as a whole as a bias in one direction or another. <br /> <br /> In terms of accuracy, it was almost accurate. The filmmakers certainly did their homework and, obviously, read the books and the works of all the main players concerned. There were a few minor details that were missed somewhat, mainly because it took them a long time to explain and, ultimately, they had little effect on the events of 1975, so I forgive them for that. In addition, I think it was difficult to recreate the public opinion of that era after the Vietnam War, but Noyce largely coped with this. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was glad that the film tried to raise both parties' individual policies, without becoming analytical, obsessive, or judging them. Moreover, everything that we raised, for example, Connor's conveyor, was of great importance for history. The filmmakers realized that their task was to tell the story of the events that led to the dismissal, and not to present political approval or opposition to politics and points of view. It was smart, because it meant that the film could not be accused of distorting the politics of one side. <br /> <br /> Firing is probably the most incredible piece of political history that occurred in Australia in its short life. I'm glad it crystallized in celluloid. A must see for any Australian.
