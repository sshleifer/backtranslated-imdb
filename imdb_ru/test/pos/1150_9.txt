I just can't stress what a wonderful movie it is. Just <br /> <br /> the memory of this film now fascinates me. If you want to see <br /> <br /> the exciting epic of the film with wonderful actors in vivid scenery <br /> <br />, with an excellent dialogue reminding you of what happened in the beginning of America <br /> br / > could be like [what the world could be then <br /> <br />] ... well ... I highly recommend this film. Especially during the <br /> <br /> war and conflict in Iraq ... when our American image is not exactly the same as it was ... this film takes you back to the time when we were just starting. Being an American meant really <br /> <br /> pulling yourself together and starting to act. When the world <br /> <br /> was such a wild and unknown place. Well, in this <br /> <br /> movie there is this ... and not only. Enjoy.
