Being an avid reader of Clive Barker, I really anticipated this film before its release ... I was not let down. "Night breed" is a horse of a different color. Rich in the decline of Western civilization and saturated with alternative existence, which we have never seen before. Barker is at his best when he allows us to look into his world of unprecedented horror, but shows us the other side of the coin. Here "monsters" are terribly beautiful creatures, and people are deceptively ugly creatures indulging themselves. We will soon find out that we were wrong all the time. Of course, my favorite performance, which was often used by Craig Schaeffer, and David Cronenberg's additional bonus in the role of "Decker" is the cast that was best perceived when people believed in him. The Monsters are flawlessly portrayed by a group of English master creators that many also brought to life by the Kenobits of Risen from Hell, including Doug Bradley himself Pinhead. “Nightbreed” is the absolute thing that any horror fan should see, and anyone who needs a little (Something) from their horror story. This is Clive Barker at his best.
