I was wrapped up to see that many other people also enjoyed this film. At first I watched it when I was a teenager, and then again several times late at night, several times after. Then, unfortunately, no more. I am almost 49 now, and I would like it to be available on DVD. Why not? Anthony Quinn's best role, no one could be more suited to the role or roles he plays - I mentioned this to other movie buffs of the same age, and, alas, none of those I know recall this. As the daughter of a generation that survived World War II and its aftermath (and I am deeply fascinated by what this generation experienced), I think this film at the time gave me a wonderful cinematic understanding of some of the heartbreaking problems of the day. For the classic final scenes this film stands out.
