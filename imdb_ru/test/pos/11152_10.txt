It has become one of my favorite films and, of course, one of the best westerns I've ever seen. Having a weak point for the genre (there are westerns or were, since they are no longer made very often - moral pieces that too often slandered critics with intellectual claims), I bought a DVD, an invisible spectacle, because I, I read enough about work William S. Hart (most of whom he wrote and directed) to excite my interest, and thought that in my video collection should be at least one of his films. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I approached the actual viewing with some trepidation. My previous experience with quiet cinematic "classics" made me feel depressed. The Phantom of the Opera, Cheney, The Birth of a Nation, Griffith, and Zorro from Fairbanks were good, but not as good as their reputation could lead to expectations. They were either too long, or too theatrical, or both. <br /> <br /> The toll gate, however, was a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> This is a story told in a simple and understandable form. Black Deering (played by Hart), the leader of the notorious gang of criminals, believes that the time has come to disband the group before luck ends. He is, however, confronted by his first lieutenant Jordan, who drives them all into one last trap, promising great wealth, but leads them into a trap in which he is involved. All killed, except for Deering, who was taken prisoner. When his captors recognize him as a man who once rescued several soldiers and settlers, warning the outpost about an impending attack of the Indians, they let him escape. Free, he tries to find honest work, but he is insulted and ridiculed, and, in the end, he must rob again in order to survive. Soon he was being pursued not only by the sheriff’s detachment, but also by Jordan (now thriving thanks to the collected awards), as well as his minions. His flight leads him to a remote cabin, inhabited by a single mother and her little son. After some initial fears, they take it into their hearts. Deering sees a chance for a new life, but with the approach of the squad and Jordan realizes that this may not be possible. <br /> <br /> Hart was the first great western star and the first to bring realism into the genre. As one of the pioneers of filmmaking, he created many characters and situations that have become a cliché of westerns for over ninety years. However, what makes his films interesting is his ability to go beyond clichés (perhaps his imitators did not go far enough), so the material seems fresh and innovative even now. Three such incidents in the Toll Gate illustrate this: <br /> <br /> 1) In one scene, his character shoots the crowd in an attempt to kill Jordan, and instead kills a witness. The following close-up shows that he is clearly disappointed. However, disappointment is caused not by the fact that he shot a man who has not done him any harm so far, but because he did not achieve his intended goal. <br /> <br /> 2) In the other, when he runs away from the squadron, his “borrowed” horse enters the gopher's hole and breaks his leg. Hart pulls out a pistol to save the animal from its suffering, but, before pulling the trigger, sadly, gently strokes its head, as if saying goodbye to an old friend. <br /> <br /> 3) Finally, after he strangled Jordan and threw his body on a rock, he returns to get a weapon and notices an enemy pistol lying on the ground nearby. He takes a step forward and quickly kicks him before riding a horse. This is a simple gesture, but he emphasizes the deep hatred he feels for the man who betrayed him and his comrades. <br /> <br /> And I like the name “The Toll Gate”. It is allegorical in its meaning that a person cannot start a new life until he pays for the sins of his old one. The payment of Deering is in the form of a sacrifice. Today's more sophisticated audience may not fully agree with this opinion, but it can still work for you, if you allow. <br /> <br /> Viewers who like their videos in their original form, will undoubtedly object to the quality of the image on DVD, especially the final video spoiled. I don't mind at all. The fact that a copy of this 1920 film exists at all is a miracle, since the prints of many other silent films have been lost. If you remember this and look at the film as part of the story, its visual flaws are not so difficult to accept. <br /> <br /> William S. Hart was born in 1870 in New York, but grew up in Minnesota and Wisconsin, where he learned to speak Sioux and Indian sign language. He considered Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson among his friends and collected Remington's paintings, so his knowledge of the West was first-hand. If his vision seems too romantic by today's standards, it nevertheless goes back much closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the 60s and 70s and the subsequent revisionist works. Both the star and his films are overdue for revaluation.
