Hitchcock made at least 11 films about a simple person who was mistakenly accused of running (sometimes really running, sometimes not) to prove his innocence in a situation independent of him, the first of which was “39 steps”, which made it popular in the UK. This is really his author's topic. <br /> <br /> Among others - “Young and Innocent”, “Diversant”, “Enchanted”, “Stage Fear”, “Strangers in a Train”, “I Confess”, “To” “Catch a Thief”, “Wrong man ”,“ North beyond the northwest ”and, finally,“ Madness ”. The Diversant begins Robert Cummings as Barry Kane, a military factory worker during the war, accused of killing his colleague and best friend during sabotage at the factory. He meets model Patricia Martin, played by actress Priscilla Lane, during his flight from the law, and later, of course, with various Nazi and fascist supporters. <br /> <br /> “Diversant” basically for example, “39 steps”, including the same plot devices as handcuffs, a blonde who at first does not trust the main character, race across the country (in one case London - to Scotland and in the other - California and New York). York), and on the way we meet "colorful" locals. And so, like The Man Who Knew Too Much, I think this is an American remake of one of Hitchcock’s early works. <br /> <br /> I think that Robert Cummings was chosen because he looks like a very ordinary person. An American, something like a "man in the street" with whom the public can identify themselves. I like Priscilla Lane because her character is more involved in action than Madeleine Carroll in “39 Steps” and Ruth Roman in Strangers in a Train. As mentioned elsewhere, Otto Kruger stole the show like a villain. I also liked Von Glaser’s performance as a blind uncle; his lines are gorgeous. Throughout the journey, there are some funny touches for some comic relief, such as road signs, which depict the character Priscilla Lane, circus performers show shows and truck driver Murray Alper. Contrary to other opinions here, there are not too many characters who immediately believe in the innocence of Barry Kane. <br /> <br /> There are some slow moments, mostly when the action first moves to New York, but it quickly develops when the last scheduled act of fifth observers begins. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films (I put it in the top 5), especially in these days of the new war on terrorism. I think it hits the house. <br /> <br /> It makes you wonder: “Could my colleague be involved in something evil?” In fact, one of the posters of the film “Diversant” proclaimed “Beware of the person behind your back!” Imagine how it played in the minds of adults during World War II.
