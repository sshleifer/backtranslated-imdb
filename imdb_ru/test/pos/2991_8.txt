With all this horror, this is a gentle film about young love. Yes, it is true that young love often makes something more than it deserves, but why don't people fall in love with Romeo and Juliet? Paul and Michelle are models of good behavior compared to them. <br /> <br /> Yes, they run away and create an ideal life, but this is a film, not a real life. Sex is more sexually interested than Michel, who was attacked. In the end, they have sex, but no one is forced to do so. The film makes children understand that sex can cause the appearance of children. <br /> <br /> First, there is nudity in the movies. The camera does not focus on this, but it does. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Paul has every chance of being discovered. In Paul and Michelle, they diverge for a while. If you don't like the ending of the movie, make it up yourself. Alternative endings are not just for DVD.
