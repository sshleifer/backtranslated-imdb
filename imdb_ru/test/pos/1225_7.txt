The new guy from the company specializing in armored cars, persuade him to take part in the robbery of the armored car with his fellow drivers to earn some money. The problem is that they really do not have a special plan, and when difficulties arise, everything becomes deadly. <br /> <br /> A fast-paced popcorn-style action movie turns out a lot. First, the film takes no more than 90 minutes, so the film does not have time to tie in the plot. He starts everything and just leaves. Then the film has some great sequences of actions, so you move to the edge of your seat. Finally, the film has a star cast that includes Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Lawrence Fishburne. This is a first-class cast that sells and covers short stories. <br /> <br /> This is not a brain surgery, this is a film about popcorn, and at this level it gets high marks. Worth seeing.
