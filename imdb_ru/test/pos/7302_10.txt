This film is excellent in depicting the reality of sexual abuse. Daughters beautifully express their conflicting emotions of affection and betrayal. The landscape on the site is breathtakingly authentic, and the soundtrack is unobtrusive, but moving. This film - a course for graduates in reality, which is too little recognized in American society. Personally, Iâ€™m worried about the names of the characters - the character Lange - Ginny Cook Smith - my name is Connie Cook Smith, and my mother is Jenny Cook. The youngest daughter is Caroline Cook, the name of my sister, and my father Larry Cook, the name of my cousin. But we did not have sexual abuse.
