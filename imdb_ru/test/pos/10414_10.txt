This show should be my favorite of all the horror TV shows of the 80s. Like “Tales from the Dark Side,” also from the same creators, this show is a rare gem. If you agree with me, PLEASE sign this petition, which I started to release the word for Monsters and put it on DVD. Here is the address of the petition: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes were supposed to be Glim glim and Rain Dance. I also liked the introductory intro to the monster family. That scared me! One of the things I would have to ask the creators of the DVD to turn on would be the sound of the organ heard right before the commercial break. I do not know if any of you remember this part, but this is one of the main things that brings me back memories. I mean, come on! “War of the Worlds”, the television series has already been released on DVD, so I say “Monsters”, as well as “Tales from the Dark Side”, and on Friday, the 13th series should also be released! We, the fans, have to express our opinion! We need this awesome DVD show, so please spread the word !!!
