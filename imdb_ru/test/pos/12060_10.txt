I realized that many people commented on the nature of this show as racist and homophobic, but I don’t think this is what this show is about. <br /> <br /> This is a show about parents who were not ready for children and are no longer ready for teenagers. This show helps bring humor to a very complex topic that is sometimes overlooked: parental rights. <br /> <br /> Yes, we all had shows in which we had families, for example: Family issues, Step by step, Family Ties, Full House .... but he always had the same old recipe for his episodes. "Steph" breaks away from school and gets to his father. They have a conversation from heart to heart, and the music plays, and in two weeks everything ends, that after “ooo, dad ...” a smile appears and the show ends. Where is the comedy in this situation? Where is realism? With The War at Home you get real-life situations from a real father type figure. Most parents who watch this show hear some lines that parents publish, and they either laugh (because they know they said it!), Or they nod their heads (because they know they thought about it, and they never had enough courage Say it!) In War at Home there are situations in which a great comedy when a father thinks his son is gay. It doesn't sound funny, most think it makes a father homophobic, but the comedy is about an awkward father trying to talk to his son in order to reveal himself. What parent knows what to say, especially in this situation? I highly recommend this show to anyone who, as I know, has a sense of humor, and especially to anyone who is a young parent or was young when they had children. You treat a show like this when you, too.
