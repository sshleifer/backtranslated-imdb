If you watch this movie, you will quote it and refer to it for a long time. It has been many years since I saw Dolemite, and I still quote it to this day. This is a real classic. It is so terribly stunning that it creates a cheerful look. Every horrible line of dialogue is completely amazing. Each wobbly shot a work of art (?). And every punch and punch is so sadly executed. You will not believe your eyes. That's all I can say. If I really understand how this movie fascinates, I can not stop, and I will go over the limit of 1000 words IMDb. <br /> <br /> Please watch this movie. You will be hysterical. Either 1/10 or 10/10, depending on your sense of humor.
