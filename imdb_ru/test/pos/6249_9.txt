One of the strangest, amazingly horrendous and terrible horror films that appeared in the 70s, is the “tourist trap”, even thanks to the free, reckless standards challenging conventionality “everything goes”, like real strange people. However, this is a very strange picture - the masterfully mounted supernatural atmosphere of supernatural supernatural fear, which from the very beginning is recorded as very creepy and becoming increasingly opaque and frightening as the film progresses, offering abundant turmoil among several scattered moments of incredibly beautiful fabulous elegance and ending bitterly ironic, crushingly nihilistic note with a haunting final image that is difficult to shake - that matters It is so unique and extremely unnerving. <br /> <br /> Five teenagers traveling in the desert California by car are hopelessly lost. They stumble upon the “Lost Oasis of Slausen,” an ominous, worn-down roadside dive, which consists of one part of a gas station, three parts - a stinking wax museum, and all parts are dirty and foreboding. The lonely, seemingly friendless and harmless owner of the joint Slausen (whom Chuck Conners outplayed with a contagiously impudent brio) turns out to be a mentally unbalanced killer with deadly telekinetic abilities. Sulausen brings to life a fancy assortment of uncomfortable human-like dummies and selects children one by one to add to their ever-growing collection of victims. <br /> <br /> Director David (“Pupmaster”, “Arrival”) Schmeller skillfully extracts every last ounce of tension that he can squeeze out of a pleasantly ambiguous and open script, which he wrote in collaboration with J. Larry Carroll. (The stubborn refusal of the mentioned script to provide some rational justification for all the strange things that happen in the film, often mistakenly criticized as one of the main weaknesses of the film, is in fact the main force of the film, giving the film a scary, anything and everything - it can happen , the usual logic is to be damned, the quality of a real nightmare comes to life terribly, which would never have been achieved if there was some credible explanation for what was going on.) Perfectly frightening, understated expense of Pinot Don Joe, Nicholas von Sternberg cinema Dark and dirty, tight production design by Robert A. Burns create incredibly anxious mood of the film. Excellent performances are another significant plus, with the pretty, fun Jocelyn Johns (Ellie-Joe Turner in the “Great Texas race for dynamite”), especially beautiful and personable, as the most cheerful and responsive of endangered adolescents. Even Tanya Roberts feels good, like an unlucky girl with a knife in her head. Unusual and unusual "Tourist trap" is worth a visit.
