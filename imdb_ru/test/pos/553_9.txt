The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting, and my mother-daughter relationship really sold me. This is a family story that is not dulled by excesses and special effects; a story about how it really is. I could not help but sigh at the end of this film because, alas, this is a well-told bitter-sweet story of growing up and interacting with family and friends. The game was quite sophisticated, and I hope that in the future we will see both Portman and Sarandon in familiar roles ...
