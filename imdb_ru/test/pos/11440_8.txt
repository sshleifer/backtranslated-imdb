My wife and I welcome all the positive comments below made by other IMDB members. Although this is not a box office hit, it has a special charm. Genuine and soulful. <br /> <br /> We saw this in the video at the end of a long day. We are very tired and in bed. Usually in such a situation, my wife falls asleep for a few minutes, that is, if this is not an exceptional film, and this film did not entertain us both until the very end. <br /> <br /> It is possible that young viewers of teenagers and twenties will not like it, but for everyone else this is a real gem! See it!
