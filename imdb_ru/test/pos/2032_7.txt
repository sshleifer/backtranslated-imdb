Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid click in all respects. Everything from acting to cinematography was solid. Not exactly a linear storyline, but there was nothing you could not see. Perhaps a bit melodramatic in some moments, but, again, a pretty decent movie nonetheless. Definitely worth checking out. If you are not sure which movie to rent for the weekend, try it. Although you may not want to run out and buy it, I found it worth it.
