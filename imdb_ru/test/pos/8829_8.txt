Let's stop believing for a moment and stop pretending that we can, could or should know “how it is” or “should be” there in space. Human knowledge in this area is probably primitive, since, say, medieval maps are compared with modern satellite maps, so we really have no idea. 2 Considering that this is “just” a BBC TV documentary simulator, it becomes much better than many budget Hollywood blockbusters, and this is just incredible. In general, the show, which is worth seeing, as it presents an expanded and fictional CGI report on what we know about the solar system so far. Perhaps fiction and CGI processing are the only way to make it attractive to the general public. Have you ever watched clips from real space missions and real space probes? The quality is usually average or bad, and the comparison will be between viewing a chest X-ray (and what it says about the human body) and comparing it with a cyborg film shot under CGI ... which one will be the most interesting? However, chest radiography is real, and the cyborg film is just a made-up SFX. 5 actors do a good job. I won't tell my grandchildren about anything, but very fair, because this is a BBC documentary simulator.
