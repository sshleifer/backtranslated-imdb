This is another one of my favorite Columbos. First-class actors are represented here, including John Cassavetes, who has never been prettier and sexier, Anjanette Comer, Mirna Loy and Blythe Danner. Now I always wonder: was Gwenith Paltrow born when this episode was filmed, or was Danner pregnant at the time? Thanks to IMDb, I have my answer - she was five months pregnant. Now I really feel ancient. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor, whose marriage with Danner obviously was to use her mother’s social connections (Loy). He has a mistress, Anjanette Comer, a famous pianist, but she announces that she wants more. She is tired of going back to the street. On the night of their concert, he gets rid of her and makes it suicidal. Colombo immediately raises several problems. He notices one thing: “You have a beautiful woman here — the eyes of a bedroom — she has money, a body, and a career. Where is the man? ”It's nice to see Falk and a good friend of Cassavetes together. The vet has a very funny episode with Bassett Colombo. Everyone in the cast is great. <br /> <br /> This is one of the episodes that made Colombo the classic series he became.
