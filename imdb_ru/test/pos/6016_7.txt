According to the recollections of the gypsy Rose Lee, who painted a much more delicate picture of her mother than her sister, Little Kid actress Jun House, in her autobiography, Early Chaos, on which “They shoot horses, aren't they”? ”Was poorly founded I saw Ethyl Merman in the original Broadway play “Gypsy”, and she was great in the role of “Mama Rose”, but certainly more “Merman” than Rose. I was disappointed with the image of Rosalind Russell in the 1962 film. The rest is a great actress, Russell was a very wooden replacement for Merman. Bette Midler, on the contrary, was better and more believable than Merman, and I would recommend her performance as final.
