So, we saw it on DVD in our apartment here in Paris. We are all here on the exchange program. We all laughed so hard, because a lot of what happened in the film happened to us! I mean, yes, of course, some of this was pretty trite, but still true, know what I'm saying. <br /> <br /> I think I related more to the quiet guy (Italian) than to Xavier, because I am more of an observer in our group. Anyway, I would like to have a hot roommate like Cecile de France. She looks like a cool girl in a movie and in fact, after I saw her host at the Cannes Film Festival last month. <br /> <br /> Now I think I want to go to Barcelona next summer after watching this movie. I have to check out the sequel also, which just came out here in France.
