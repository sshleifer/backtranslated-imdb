Do not look into the basement. This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the Video Nasties list. The sound of the rattle flute soundtrack is classic. The main character, although much hotter than most low-budget stars, is a fairly standard low-budget lead. The character of Doctor Masters is well written and well acted. Some of the smaller characters are pretty stupid, but add to the nostalgia of the film. This is Campi. I'm not trying to lie. The character that makes it great is the Folknar Man-Child named Sam, one of the patients of this insane madness. The blood is pretty standard, although I think the color of the blood is amazing. This is so .. Red. This film, I believe, was received poorly because of its advertising scheme. Some soulless little advertising manager took his dirty hands and thought: "Let's break the last house on the left advertising campaign, that's good." Little doodles ruined the movie world. All balls and no brain. In addition, the editor may or may not be an alcoholic. Maybe there everyone is drunk. You will understand what I mean. Another little note. Do not buy this from the Wally-Mart dollar counter. They cut it to the level and invisible. Try to find the longest cut you can.
