First of all, I would like to say that before I watched this film, I considered myself a host. Someone who cared for others, appreciated others, did not find / barely made judgments against other people, and this film (I think) radically changed my life or point of view. When I watched it, I did not know in particular what it was, I knew that it was about some type of forbidden relationship, but besides that I was ignorant, and when I began to understand what was happening between these two miraculously depicted characters, I was shocked, disbelief, confusion and surprise. The first time I watched it, I was blind. Blind to their love, to their closeness, to their connection, to their purity as human beings, to their relationship. I watched it a second time, because I finally realized how hypocritical I am, telling myself and others: “Oh, I accept all types of people and try not to judge them,” still judging this wonderful and surprisingly insightful story, because my fear, I suppose. The second time, when I watched this film, I opened my eyes, which for the first time remained closed, and really looked not at that part of the forbidden relationship, which I have heard about all my life, but simply at two people. in love. And I liked it, I liked the storyline, I liked the slightly broken, but strong people in the film, I liked to share feelings, and I liked the strong bonds created. It’s a really awesome, beautifully made film that sometimes made me cry, and I hope that people who read it and end up watching the movie will remember that everyone deserves love, no matter what form or form it is presented. . ....
