This is one of my favorite films EVER ... I watched it about a million times and never would have refused to watch it again. In fact, I love it so much that I REALLY wanted to check out the resort where it was filmed during my upcoming vacation ... Does anyone know its name? If so, please email me !!! I watched this movie for the first time when it was first released, and I was about the same age as Nikki, and for the longest time I forced my dad to take me somewhere, because, of course, I expected to the same thing will happen! This is just a terrific setting and such a cute puppy love story. This is a definite necessity for a DVD collector!
