I first saw this movie when I was four years old. I remember how I loved it and everything about it. After 13 years I am now 17 years old, and I decided to watch it about a month ago, because I study at school in the 1960s. I really did not know what to expect, since 13 years have passed since I saw him last, but I was completely shocked by this. The actors were awesome, the music was so fun, and now I will go and sing along to every song. To treat Williams great, like Berger, the "leader" of a hippie group, who always gets what he wants one way or another (except, of course, the very end). John Savage is actually very persuasive, like Claude, a Oklahoma recruit who falls in love with Sheila (Beverly d'Angelo). D'Angelo is beautiful as a first-class and proper rich girl who eventually rebel against her upbringing and joins the hippie. Other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is just as amazing as Ginny, a pregnant girl, but as sweet and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are as good as Woof and Hud, the other two members of the group, and Cheryl Barnes, who plays Hud's bride, has a stunning voice. <br /> <br /> The only problem I encountered in this film is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They almost never show up together, and when they do, they fight (remember the skinny dive scene?). It seems that their relationship is very weak, and by the end of the film we must believe that they are madly in love, based only on the few meetings that they had. I also see that many people writing reviews here are frustrated with the PG rating that this film has. I personally would raise the rating to PG-13, just because there is some drug use ... but remember that in 1979, PG-13 did not exist. I do not think that nudity is generally bad, it is by no means sexual (in fact, in this film there is no sex at all), and only to show the childlike innocence that the group supports. In most European countries, nudity is not considered bad, and I do not understand why it is here in the USA. In any case, I highly appreciate this film, and I am glad that it was shot then, because in the insanely "politically correct" world today they would not even think about creating it, and even if they did it would be a very "diluted" version and I am sure that you will not get the full effect. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a very underrated film that is definitely worth watching.
