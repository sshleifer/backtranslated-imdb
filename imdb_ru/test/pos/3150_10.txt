I recently saw the short title Reader and found that the film was well planned and executed. I really felt for both characters that Morgan Hallett and Elizabeth Franz are portrayed in this film. Elizabeth was able to show more distance with her blind temper and left me with a sense of emotional connection. Morgan was able to sell me that she devoted herself entirely to preserving Sissy or Franz, protected from the grief of losing her sister who lived in Copenhagen. The great thing about the film was that in a short time and a budget of only ten thousand dollars, Duncan Rogers was able to make a very well-made film that retained the interest of the viewer. Rogers is well versed in the abilities of an actor and uses excellent perspectives to demonstrate his talent. I always feel that if a director can make a great movie with a small budget, then what can he or she do with a much bigger movie? Great job, Duncan !!
