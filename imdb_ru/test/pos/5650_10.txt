Fires on the Plain (1959) **** <br /> <br /> You can no longer see such films. “Fires on the Plain” is an incredible depiction of the life of Japanese Imperial Army soldiers. The masterpiece of Kon Ichikawa follows Tamura, a soldier with tuberculosis who roams the Philippine landscape in the last year of the war. His commander is sent to the hospital, but he is denied treatment, and therefore he is sent back. His commander orders him to return, and if he is again refused, then his last order is to kill himself with a grenade. He is again denied, but he meets a group of squatters sitting outside the hospital. The next day, American troops fire at them and Tamura flees, deciding not to kill himself, and from there he wanders from place to place, trying to get to Palompon. He discovers that some people ate human flesh to survive, while others exchange as much tobacco as they can for anything they can return. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with a quiet sense of despair and desolation, with a hint of madness. All we see is skin and bones covered in mud in tattered and ragged rags. Ichikawa uses his camera to capture beautiful pictures of the ruined landscape and the Japanese soldiers who walk on it. Kon Ichikawa was known in Japan for doing a lot of comedy and satyr, and there are moments in The Lights on the Plain that are cool and funny. Take, for example, a shot from what appears to be a dead man, face down in a pool of water; The soldier goes, but asks himself out loud if this will all end, to which the person lifts his head out of the water and answers: “What was that?” And then lowered his face deeper into the puddle than before. Another fun sequence involves one person who finds a pair of shoes along the path. He takes the shoes, replacing them with old ones. Another man passes by and sees that pair of shoes and switches to his old shoes. The scene continues until, finally, Tamura finds a place to exchange and inspects the left shoes without a single sole. He carefully looks at himself and at the ground, and, having decided that they are both kaputs, takes off his own and goes barefoot. The film is filled with incredible scenes one after another. Like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ichikawa knew how to use his camera to draw beautiful and stunning pictures. On barren empty plains, surrounded only by smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on broken ground, there are many stunning shots. There is another incredible scene when dozens of Japanese soldiers try to cross the road guarded by the Yankees in the middle of the night, and everyone crawls on their hands and knees when the camera is looking down. <br /> <br /> The film got its name from the pillars of smoke rising from the fires on the plains that are visible throughout the film. They present life to soldiers a little more ordinary; The lives of Japanese farmers are returning home, burning corn husks. However, their rays of hope for a normal life are in hostile hands. <br /> <br /> The film provoked a strong reaction due to its graphic content. Much attention is paid to the horror of the war not only with the enemy, but also in your ranks. “Fires on the Plains” of Kona Ichikawa is an incredibly authentic and touching, somewhat disturbing portrait of the horror that the people who make up the lower ranks of the Imperial Army have suffered. Clint Eastwood's letters from Iwo Jima, although this is a very good film, do not in any way approach the understanding of the horror of the war depicted in Fires on the Plain. (Eastwood was undoubtedly influenced by the film, as he claims to be such a classic lover of Japanese cinema.) Many war films show that war is hell in the eyes of the victors. In Lights on the Plain, we are shown that the war is even more hellish when you lose. <br /> <br /> 4/4
