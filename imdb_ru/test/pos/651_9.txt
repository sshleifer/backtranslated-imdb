I remember watching this movie over and over when I was a kid. I like it. Although I have not watched it recently, I am sure that today I will still like it. This is a very easy funny movie that will surely make anyone laugh. The situations with each of the characters were so funny and original! I especially liked the one with the girl who travels with the ashes of her mother (who eventually takes them to the highway after the explosion), robbers and nuns. This good style of humor is very bored these days. In addition, this film proved that actor Paul Keenan (Dynasty / Days of Our Lives) was a great start. I recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it at their local video store.
