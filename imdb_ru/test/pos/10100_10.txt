Many horror fans complain that horror has barely progressed over the past twenty years. I was inclined to agree with this before the influx of Asian horror films, a trend that admittedly became boring. Nevertheless, he created a real classic, and “The Tale of the Two Sisters,” at least for me, stands out as an exceptional part of the movie and perhaps the best horror film in a very long time. <br /> <br /> Based on a vague Korean fairy tale, he tells the sad story of two mental-disordered sisters living with their father and stepmother. Having experienced several problems on their first night at home, they decided to stick together and deprive the stepmother of access to close relationships. Tension increases, and inevitable grasp arises. But what happens after that requires more than a pair of eyes, as the story takes several turns, and the fears become more emotional and quite real. By the end you may need a few moments to comprehend all this and put it together in your own mind, but it is this combination of horror and mystery that pushes it beyond the definitions of these genres and makes it an instant classic. One to look again and again, if only to solve it all.
