Once I was browsing IMDb when I stumbled upon the “Curious Adventures of Mr. The Wonderful Bird”. Noticing how it was unclear, I decided to go in search. Thanks to Digiview, it didn't take me long, so I bought it for a dollar, and when I returned home, I looked at it, although I must say, I was impressed. <br /> <br /> the paintings in the king’s apartment, the cowgirl, the chimney sweep, and the king’s self-portrait (which is as selfish and sadistic as the real king himself) come to life one night while the king sleeps. The shepherdess and the chimney-sweep run away, and the king's picture calls the police to catch a pair. Fortunately for the couple, Mr. Wanderburd comes to the rescue, often mocking the police and the king. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD enclosure describes this film as "surreal visual delight and an underrated film record." The history of classic animation. "I couldn’t agree with this, given that many backgrounds look rather strange, and many characters are strange, including depressed inhabitants of an underground city and hungry lions, who are soothed by the music of a blind person (who looks like Andy Warhol), not to mention Mr. Wonderberde himself is somewhat eccentric. The film is very creative and mostly funny to watch, and its only drawback is that it can be slow. But overall this film was very good and it was really recommended by you. <br / > <br /> Rating: B + (Excellent)
