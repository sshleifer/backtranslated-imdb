Barry Kane - a worker in an aircraft manufacturing plant. Suddenly, the plant is sabotaged and the fire begins. His best friend is killed. They accuse him of acting, but Kane knows that it was a man named Fry who was there. He becomes a fugitive and goes in search of this man named Fry. He is helped by a kind blind man. He lets his niece Patricia Martin with a billboard take a man to a local blacksmith to remove his handcuffs. Barry does not believe and wants to take him to the police. But soon he will change his mind about Barry, and they will find out about another attempt at sabotage, which will happen soon. This is a group of anti-American fascists. And Frank Fry is a member of this group. The Saboteur (1942) is another example of the fact that Alfred Hitchcock could not make a bad movie. Robert Cummings plays Barry Kane, and he is really good at it. Priscilla Lane with her good looks plays Pat Martin. Also very good. Otto Kruger makes a great head villain as leader of the Fascist group, Charles Tobin. Norman Lloyd, still alive at 94, plays Fry and makes him a very believable rogue. Von Glazer is the most responsive character, like the blind Philip Martin. The sequence of the dance hall is fantastic. And also moments on the Circus train. In the end, we are on the Statue of Liberty.
