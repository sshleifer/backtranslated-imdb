My boyfriend and I went to watch the Guardian. At first I didnâ€™t want to watch it, but I liked the movie. It was definitely the best movie I've ever seen. They portrayed USCG very well, he really showed me what they are doing, and I think they really should be appreciated more. It not only taught, but was also a really good movie. The film shows what really does and how difficult the work. I think that being a USCG would be difficult and very scary. It was a great movie. I would recommend this film for everyone. The end broke my heart, but I know why he did it. The storyline was great, I picked it up with 2 fingers. I cried, it was very emotional, I would give 20 if I could!
