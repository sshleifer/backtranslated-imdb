The Missing Star, which fought for the Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Film Festival, is a film that, if you think about it, is the first adjective that comes to mind: intense. An intense look, intense episodes, the intensity of this film captures the viewer from the very first scenes at a steel mill in Italy (I could not recognize the city, perhaps Genoa or even Naples), although the pace is rather slow. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Buonavolonta, the protagonist, and with it the whole public sees China, quite different from what a normal western person imagines: a terrible high-rise building with about 8 hundred apartment owners inside, skyscrapers, desolation, fog, scrapers and cranes everywhere, but also the beauty of the Yangtze River Kiang, which will soon become a big lake because of a controversial dam that will destroy many cities from. China is a country under construction, but despite all these colossal public works, poverty, backwardness and unjust laws still exist. <br /> <br /> We can relate more easily to this story because Gianni Amelio, the expert director, chose two phenomenal roles: Sergio Castellitto, a famous actor in Italy, and the Chinese surprise Tai Lin, a completely unknown girl who gives as intense interpretation as Castellitto. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect, in some places there are flaws, but this does not mean that it is a mediocre film. Try to see it.
