BLIMEY!! Talk about a movie that shares an audience! This is true love, or something like a movie. Personally, I really liked it. I noticed that other reviews compare it with Pitch Black - this is pretty stupid, because the only thing they have in common is SAND! People can be very stupid. No, this film is much more like “The Thing” (the way people don’t notice is amazing - they even have the same basic music). There are many touches of Carpenter, blue collar heroes, sharp humor, endless sliding landscapes full of death and things are not understood. It is possible that stopping this film, being a real classic, is his respect for other works of Carpenter. Not least the Dark Star, with whom she has something in common. I would be interested to know how much it really costs? $ 8,000? Is it even possible? Perhaps it was based on a short film that cost $ 8,000? But I felt strangely agitated when various space guys died. They are so undervalued that they watch documentaries from time to time. Having said that the scenario is rather clumsy, and only half of them can act, however, and I am not sure that one of them is a big guy playing captain. But his gun is AMAZING !! Give him a chance, if you like early Carpenter, you can fall in love with him, just don’t expect 2001.
