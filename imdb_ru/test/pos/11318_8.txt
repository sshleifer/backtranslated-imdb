This film was really interesting ... it is also quite shocking, since such events occurred only 10 months after the filmâ€™s premiere. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to look at the problems that can be encountered, and quite realistic. to show that no matter how prepared you are, you think that it is not. if it had been made for an American audience - it would have been different, because they would use it as a full propaganda film, and not as an awakening that the BBC did! To some extent, this is still propaganda - today there can be no film with these themes - but he successfully dealt with this problem. <br /> <br /> a film that should be shown on all courses on terrorism and counter-terrorism will not be, because it shows errors that cannot be confirmed! An excellent film, in which the BBC has taken several risks, and, unfortunately, London no longer needs a fictional story because of the reality of July 7, 2005.
