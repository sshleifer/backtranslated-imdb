During the making of this film, I once caught a television statement about it. Something like: “Killinggänget now removes Nazism?” <br /> <br /> So, my understanding of this film was from the very beginning to get an idea of ​​Nazism. When I recently watched this movie in the television version, I had this filter in front of me, and it was easy for me to see it. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, I have not seen such an interpretation of the film since I first heard it. <br /> <br /> This is what I found in the Four shades of brown. In all four stories, lack of empathy leads to catastrophe: <br /> <br /> 1. A crematorium worker does not show realistic sympathy for dead animals or those who had to say goodbye to them. In the cremation room, where it comes to death and fire, for him it is almost like a fun game. The severity of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his boy, respectively, in ignorance, presses a button that leads to a catastrophe that causes serious damage to his father. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: the importance of showing young people adequate emotions. When they grow up, they need to know what kind of behavior leads to a catastrophe and what emotions lead to good. <br /> <br /> 2. The magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer. At that moment, when she thinks that she has begun to cut the strings for the master's hand, attaining individuality, integrity and joy, he pulls strongly, and she is again in despair and despair. <br /> <br /> Their son tried a rebellion in creating his own life with perfection and "good" taste as opposed to his parents "bad" taste. The real problem he faces is far from his understanding: his father’s behavior is transmitted when he is suffocated by his wife in his immaculate environment. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: oppression breeds slavery. <br /> <br /> 3. A child who has been abused as a child sends sadism to his children when he deceives their inheritance. He takes away their childhood and, in the end, even their inheritance. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: if no love is given, you cannot give it. <br /> <br /> 4. Fathers insult his daughter creates in her merciless revenge with sadistic aggression. Here, icy Nazism-sadism becomes very obvious with physical violence. This provides a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation for the actions of the young "impudent" Nazis in oppressing others. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson? : Can Nazism be born in a perverted house? <br /> <br /> Can the disgusting consequence of ignoring empathy in family life ultimately give place to sadistic Nazism? <br /> <br /> Very rarely does a movie contain so much. This is gradually revealed when I think about it. I think it is brilliantly “painted”, and the actors are great. Especially nice guy performed by Ulf Brunnberg, who turns out to be the worst of all ..
