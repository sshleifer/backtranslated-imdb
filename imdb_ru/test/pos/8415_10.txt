Heard a lot about this film, except for the National Award and the Oscar. This is a Marathi film, and I can't see an apple from an orange in a Marathi. But when I saw the movie playing on DD1 late on Sunday, I was just stuck. Now I am not a judge of cinematographic techniques and acting skills. But I watched a large number of films of different genres, and for the average viewer, I highly recommend this film. The feeling is very mundane and realistic, although there are some melodramatic moments. Looking to feel like a man. Recently, I have not seen a single film that would touch the heart, especially in the Hindi cinema. The culminating achievement of the film is that the young guy returns home. The camera turns, showing the child, in black glasses, having lost his eyes, the child hears others splashing in water, and begins to clap. I was delighted. And the two hours I spent watching the movie are very worth it :-)
