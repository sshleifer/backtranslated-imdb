The Tale of Two Sisters, disguised as Asian horror, is in fact a complex character psychological drama that immerses the viewer in the problems of a seemingly normal family. I was very surprised by the depth of this film. Director Ji-Woo Kim's decision to focus more on telling the story, rather than providing cheap fear, turned out to be true. Creating one of the most ingenious new horror films. <br /> <br /> “The Tale of Two Sisters” tells the story, as the name implies, about the two sisters Su-mi and the younger Su-yon, who, after spending time in a psychiatric hospital, return home to their father and , abusive stepmother. Since then, we have seen sisters cope with gradually increasing aggression and chaotic behavior of the stepmother. To say what will happen next is to spoil the whole experience. So I just leave it at that. <br /> <br /> The plot is very densely written. With the characters beautifully debugged. Chih-woo Kim focuses on a small cast and offers a much more detailed look at them and their relationship to each other. In addition, each of the four main roles has a completely different role and type of character. From the defensive Su-mi, the weaker Su-yon, the obviously disinterested father, to the insane, and then the deadly behavior of the stepmother. There is a great sense of mystery, most of the plot is not revealed until the end, and even after this the film still leaves a great opportunity for interpretation. Even after one viewing, the viewer will be forced to see it at least once more in order to better understand it. <br /> <br /> Actors are great at their roles. It is especially difficult to create strong emotional scenes in psychological films, but it is a great joy when you manage to create them, and this is a vivid example of such a feat. Ji-woo Kim's direction slowly moves and captures, creating tension for the movie’s horrible scenes. Although there are few such moments, they are strong and frankly terrible. Top-level cinematography and score help to create an atmosphere suitable for a psychological film. <br /> <br /> “The Tale of Two Sisters” is a demonstration that the horror genre is actually much more than a simple thrill ride. With a strong focus on character and mystery, this is one complex film that can easily seduce you to watch it again and again, just so you can better understand it.
