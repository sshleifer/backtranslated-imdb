This is supposed to be one of the most powerful messaging films I've seen lately, it was absolutely flawless, surprisingly original and thought-provoking. The story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very, very strong. We are talking about a guy who kills the backward younger brother of his ex-girlfriend, and when he is sent to a prison for minors, through a lot of memories you get control over the story and do not let it go until the very end. The murder he commits is changing the lifestyle of every member of his family and the family of the deceased, and when you watch and understand that everyone has their own history and their own dark side, you just appreciate this film even more, this is a full tour, because these actions cannot be described in simple terms. His motive for the murder is not fully explained, and this makes the viewers think. The acting was pretty much flawless, and the cast was very good, with many familiar faces. If you like films that make you think and that make you think (for example, Donnie Darko, Dr. Mulholland), then United States Lelanda is a great choice for you, otherwise you should go through this film and watch it when you're in the mood for serious thought. <br /> <br /> 10/10
