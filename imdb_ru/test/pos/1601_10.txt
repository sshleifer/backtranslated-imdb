I saw this film many years ago and absolutely hated it - I could not wait for it to finish and would go out, but a girl was sleeping on my shoulder. You know? I have never forgotten this film, and moreover, I would say that it continues to haunt me with its images and music for many years. How many films I cried and laughed at the cinema, and then I forgot as soon as I went outside, like ... you know, I can't even remember a single one! Rare films, such as Death in Venice, penetrate your mind and make changes to the sea. The French love to say that cinema is an art, and films like this prove that they are right. I give him 10 stars, compared to the 3 I gave him that night when I saw him.
