WARNING ABOUT SPOILER <br /> <br /> I received this documentary on DVD for Christmas 2004. The score was remembered (my favorite <br /> <br /> songs are Sauropod and Winters Coming. The effects were great, you could almost believe that they were there. You really are learning something too; Stegosaurs CAN be able to pump their plates with blood. T-Rexes women MAY go kill before laying eggs. I know that many people thought it was too much based on assumptions, but there will always be questions that we can only guess at. And there are a lot of hard, undeniable facts as well. We KNOW that some dinosaurs traveled in herds, we KNOW that Diplodocus swallowed stones to grind vegetation in their stomachs. Despite this “speculation,” the series went very well. So good that he spawned a sequel, a prequel and a few specials. If you're a dino fan, then this is for you. This makes the Jurassic Park small and weak.
