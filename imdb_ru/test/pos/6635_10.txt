This envious and evil film against not only the war in which it was made, but the entire war. It doesn't matter what the war is. This may be the most emotionally exciting experience I have ever had with the work of Ingmar Bergman. In this dramatic drama, there are no sides to the two main characters who do not attach importance to any ceremonial symbolism, as Bergman usually does, but clearly demonstrate people and their lives and exercises, which, as Bergman has already proved, he understands . to the cinema. <br /> <br /> His regular performers Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow play an internalizing but quarreling married couple who were once musicians of the orchestra. Now they live in a weathered farmhouse on the island. Part of the frustration of the building we are growing to share with these two people impregnates the details that nothing in their house seems to work. They are also not secretive intellectuals. This is a rather familiar marriage that has more or less given up life and is essentially apolitical; they hear only distant rumors of a war that goes on forever. Ulmann is concerned about the danger to their lives and her desire to have children. Her husband, Von Sidow, brushes aside that the war will pass them by. Their serenity is interrupted by screaming fighters flying low over their home, the killing of a paratrooper pilot, the arrival of dubious troops, their inquisitions and, ultimately, their capture seems to be the local side, but their loyalty has long been broken. <br /> <br /> They are sent back home, they witness unjustified extermination and suffer from the revengeful consequences of such a painfully suspicious marriage. This is one of my favorite works of Bergman, this is a study of a couple, cut off from their prosperous unconscious life and disturbed by manipulative despair, checking them both to show who they really are. To some extent, she lacks compassion, she is too self-serving and restless to patiently experience his capricious tears. His suppressed emotional problems led to the suppression of the initiative and excitement, which attracted them from the very beginning. Huge last twenty minutes, interrupted from time to time by images of the gray sky, are one of the closest to real emotions that Bergman has ever shot. <br /> <br /> All systems of dogma and faith are antagonists in this very important and optimistic portrait. Mostly clear characters of Ulman and von Sydov’s characters are thrown into the degenerate world of war, because they are accused of being “sympathetic”, but the film, filmed on the small native island of Bergman in Faro, does not give any information about where or when it is established who the two sides are, and what they are fighting for. For an uneducated civilian population between them, the knowledge base is likely to be very similar. <br /> <br /> Ulman and Von Sydow do not sympathize with the obvious enemy, but they are supporters of who is obviously their side. This reactive allegory of 1968 could relate to ordinary non-combatant citizens of Iraq, or Kosovo, or Vietnam, or Israel, or Palestine, or ...
