The best movie about Batman 90s does not doubt it. This film takes place in a city where there is uncertainty and nightmares. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the villains are somewhat stupid, they are ideal for the tone of the film colorful, but nightmarish cinematography. <br /> <br /> The performances are really great, and the comic tone behind them really lives up to expectations. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the clothes, this is a film in pure Burton style. It cannot be described; Burton is a sui generis director who raised the Batman franchise to yet another incomprehensible level, but not forgetting the past of his comic style. <br /> <br /> Recommended for action movie lovers and best of all if he deals with superheroes.
