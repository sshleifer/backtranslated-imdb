Well, I just saw the debut in Buster Keaton's film in Fat Arbachle's "Butcher" and - despite the rude approach, it seems that everything happens almost without any logical reason - I found something to laugh at. For example, when Buster orders the molasses from Fatty the butcher, Fatty forces Buster to return to pay, Buster says that he puts him in a molasses bucket, Fatty drops the molasses into Buster's hat and takes the money, Buster takes the hat back to his head when he gets Stuck, the fat one tries to remove it, while the molasses falls to the floor, Buster's legs are now stuck on the floor and so on. It probably did not seem ridiculous, but on the screen it was funny, as were several other farces, in which they threw flour and a later sequence that occurs in the Fatty girlfriend’s boarding school, where Fatty dressed in dredges and Baster helped Fatty’s opponent in the dredge. As I said, many scenes do not make sense, but the visual effects, especially with Arbuckle and Keaton, cause laughter even today. Recommended for viewing for Keaton finaliters.
