I saw this movie in September with my mother. I was expecting a good movie and I saw a great one. This is my favorite movie. It did not leave me after I left the theater. The situations in this film reminded me of my late grandmother. Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger were equally incredible. This film made me realize how important family relationships are. Rent it. I can not recommend it enough.
