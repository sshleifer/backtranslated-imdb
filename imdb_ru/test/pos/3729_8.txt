I thought that Bessonâ€™s film had managed to do without words, that few films could do with them; Capture real human emotions. The struggle, triumphs, failures, hopes and desires of the protagonist are all so honestly shown that you are wondering if he is acting at all. The film has a small budget and, obviously, made without brilliance and glamor, which are inherent in most Hollywood productions, but it is this minimalism that allows this film to go beyond stereotypical science fiction and become a real drama. However, by calling this film exclusively drama, it would deprive the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot. True, this type of film was made earlier, but I think that this film captures the joys and sorrows of this type of world, perhaps better than any other.
