Inherited this from my x's DVD collection when he left with my best friend (enough said), watched it one night when there was nothing on the telly (then nothing new), and got a very pleasant surprise. Very British (you have no budget, no people you know or have not even seen before), the accents were a bit thick for my taste, but after an alarming start (a little too close to home in my case), it began to grow on me. In addition to some unnecessary cropping of jokes, which in fact did not add anything, I found that the film is very inspiring, very real, natural performances everywhere make me want more from the final, which suddenly appeared too early. Highly recommended!
