There is no doubt that Eddie Monroe's indie film is one of the best independent films I have seen in a long time. The highlight for me was the presentation of Paul Vario. I first saw Paul, or "Big Paul," as he was called in the indie hit Danny Provenzano "This Thing Of Ours". Fortunately, director (s) Eddie Monroe did the same and used Paul's undisputed skills in the main (main?) Role. A performance was released (using camera and voice), which demonstrated worthy roles in a large budget in the near future. It's nice to see a trained actor who is dedicated to the cause, proving the same to the viewers. Keep up the good work, Big Paulie, and we'll see you soon in Hollywood! Not bad for a kid of Canarsie, huh?
