www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Great TV series to be filmed on DVD. It was a show that I rarely missed. I found a petition to get it back on DVD. I remember one show where this fat lady wore glasses that allowed her to talk to her about food. Needless to say, she could not eat her friends, so she died of starvation. In another episode, the accountant visited the underground sewers and the metro security department. The accountant wanted to stop financing the project. As it turned out, the security unit was not sufficiently funded to fight cannibalistic creatures that lived in the dark. www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html
