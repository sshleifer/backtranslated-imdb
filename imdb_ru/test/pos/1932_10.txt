This is a story about events that were covered in print several times, and I read two books - A Journey for Mad Men and A Strange Final Journey of Donald Crowhurst before watching a movie in Sheffield before Christmas. I must say that he exceeded all expectations when he talked about the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe racing yacht. These people intended to do something that they had never done before without support ships, wooden boats, without satellite phones, without GPS, and only with their intelligence and ability to assemble them around the globe intact and safe. Not to mention the months of loneliness, the roaring southern ocean, a little sleep and the boats that literally lounged around them. <br /> <br /> This documentary is perfectly compiled, in my opinion, carefully edited, with a good pace with excellent narration. Archive video and interviews are exciting and lively story. The interview with Claire Crowhurst is particularly revealing and touching because she talks about the events that led to the departure of her husband Donald Crowhurst from Teignmouth, about doubts and fears in his mind and her reactions to subsequent events. <br /> <br /> I was touched and even shed a tear or two by the time the credits began to roll, and overheard other people expressing similar feelings. <br /> <br /> The two books I mentioned above are useful for more detailed information and history. which could not have been written in 90 minutes, and I would recommend them too. <br /> <br /> Ultimately this is a true story of human courage and human weakness. Be sure to look for anyone interested in sailing, adventure, human effort and real heroes.
