If I watched this movie when I reached an incredible level, I probably would have plunged into the deepest depression in my life, and perhaps would have been almost desperate to try it, the only thing in the real world when you robbing millions of dollars from unsuspecting people, everything goes wrong (if you're not an investment banker or government), so how does it matter? I was rejected from school after school, and it stings, so it's a brilliant theme for the film, and when you give yourself to the imaginary to allow yourself to watch this film without real consequences, it can really affect someone in this situation, and let they know that they are not alone. The overexposed monologue completely destroys the established education system, as we know it. in fact, all I can say is that now, when I am in college, looking back at where I was, and watching this film, I can truly appreciate it more than ever could not. it's juvenile and crushing, but it's an emotional and inspiring fantasy of freedom, and I can't think of a better way to end my night.
