Just to clarify, Matthew Poncelet was not a real person, but a combination of two murderers convicted and sentenced to death for killing two teenagers. <br /> <br /> I read the user comments, and they respond as if Matthew were real. The character is based on a mixture of two killers, Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie (who killed certain people), and the murder itself was based on the one that was committed by Willie. The conflict between the fact that Willy was present when someone else was present, and both parties swore that the other party had committed the murder, is also included in the story. <br /> <br /> Prezhin’s approach is unique in that she not only serves convicts, as they wait for their death and help them take responsibility for their actions, she also appeals to the families of the victims to help them know that the convict did feel remorse for what they did - effectively helping both parties. <br /> <br /> It seems that everyone who publishes here is firmly convinced of the death sentence. This is not my place to say that this is right or wrong - in theory, the punishment of death by death has some kind of karmic meaning, but denying a person his freedom to the end of his days, although costly, makes more sense for me, stuck in a small room 23/7 (with one hour of exercise) to remind you that the cruelty they committed was more appropriate for them - they are technically alive, but deprived of life. Let's say someone killed someone so that he could relieve himself of the responsibility that the person he killed claimed (for example, Susan Smith kills his poor children by shoving his car into the lake). I find it very ironic that they will not get the “freedom” they so long for, and now they will have to spend the rest of their days in prison. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​Prezhin is well traced in this story. She enjoys my respect - she manages to find such a balance - she does not support the murderer, she leads them to accept what they have done. If they had not felt some kind of remorse, they would not have asked for spiritual guidance. <br /> <br /> One final note, when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix's parent for the murder of his son, the girl’s parents, who also murmured something about why he didn’t apologize for her death. I think the fact is that throughout the entire movie Poncelet denies killing both children. In Prezhin’s mind, there are doubts that he committed both murders — there is a friend who was sentenced but not sentenced to death — I think that Poncelet killed the boy Delacroix, and another man killed the girl, so Poncelet took responsibility for what did he do. If he were responsible for the death of the girl, he probably would have also apologized for that.
