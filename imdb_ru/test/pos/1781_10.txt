Dekalog Five was an interesting viewing experience for me, because the question that Kislovsky seems to be fine with the audience. This chapter talks about three men, and Kieslowski presents two people involved in a murder with character traits, both good and bad (in one case, in most cases it is bad). With such vile characters, I found myself almost glad that they would receive some kind of punishment. However, when it comes time to kill (and this will follow the killer), Kislovsky shows an interesting look and seems to ask those of us who shared my point of view: â€œYou are not as guilty as this person? Such an indirect address of the audience makes the finale of Dekalog Five much deeper, since Kislovsky (as usual) does not remain within the literal limits of his theme. Just as other parts of the Decalogue do not perceive the theme of their Commandments in the literal sense, just as the Decalogue Fifth. He asks us what is murder, who is more guilty of murder, and what should be the appropriate punishment, if any? This is a fantastic film, typical of Kieslowski, absolutely stunning.
