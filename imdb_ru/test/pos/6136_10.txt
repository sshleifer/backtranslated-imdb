I have been looking for this mini-series for a long time. I saw this film when I lived in Russia many years ago. I am curious if anyone who has a recorded copy of this film can send me a copy. I am ready to cover all expenses and pay for additional tapes or DVDs. This is one of the best TV shows I've ever watched. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history and world history of Israel after the Second World War. I'm also trying to find a book (I heard that it is even better than a film), but the new book costs about $ 50 on Amazon, and I never bought a used copy. my email address is yurets777@hotmail.com Thank you so much for your help.
