Three American guys travel around Europe, urging each other to accumulate as many brave stunts as possible, and Hot Beauty lies as much as she can, but Andy is looking for true love. He finds it during their attempt to bungee jump on the Eiffel Tower, when he encounters and rescues amazingly suicidal and incredibly beautiful Julie Delpy. His attempts to find this girl and the secret that he reveals lead him and his friends on a fast-paced adventure full of action, romance, blood and inspirational humor, not taking themselves seriously and not trying to be anything other than wildly entertaining 90 minutes away . I have seen this film several times and found it much more useful than the “London” original, although both films are so different that it would be unfair to compare them or even consider it a continuation.
