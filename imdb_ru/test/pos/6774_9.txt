GREEN BOUTCHERS (Anders Thomas Jensen - Denmark, 2003). <br /> <br /> How do Danes continue to invent these films, which are invariably funny, cutting written, elegantly shot and filled with great performances? GREEN BOOTCHERS is a grim and viciously funny comedy, in many ways a Danish copy of EATING RAOUL and DELICATESSEN, but it offers more than just laughter or a parody. <br /> <br /> The film tells us about a duet with a chronic bastard Bjarne (Nikolai Li Kaas) and chronic sweat Svend (Mads Mikkelsen). Sick because of their evil boss, these two friends decided to open their own butcher shop in a small Danish town, but initially things are going slowly, and customers stay away. When an electrician is accidentally locked and frozen in his meat locker, Svend decides to turn a person’s thigh into fillets, which he quickly calls "chiki-wiki." This special dish suddenly makes everyone in the city flock to their counter, and Svend - unable to resist this sudden jump in popularity - turns into a serial killer with Bjarn, acting as his reluctant accomplice. But soon, led by their former boss, many in the city begin to wonder what special ingredients two men use. <br /> <br /> Without the unusual performances by Kaas and Mikkelsen, the film could not have risen. above the level of the average black comedy. On paper, Svenda’s character may border on a caricature, but Mads Mikkelsen’s portrait is a portrait of a serious, insecure and deeply distorted person, but Mikkelsen manages to make him frightening, funny and moving at the same time. Kaas actually plays a double role, also playing his twin brother Eigil. When watching the film, I did not even realize that it was the same actor. Other performances are just as wonderful when every character in the city refreshes his taste and really wonderful vignettes. <br /> <br /> Thematic material is naturally a bit painful, and the material may not be entirely fresh. Considering quite a few predecessors who processed the same material, but the director Jensen gives him a new twist and managed to create some real characters with with a strange duet of Svend and Bjarne, with this surprisingly strange story about two losers in society. /> <br /> Obscura Camera --- 9/10
