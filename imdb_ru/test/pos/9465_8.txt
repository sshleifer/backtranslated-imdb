I have to be honest, I had a really good time, watching that She is a Man. Despite the fact that this is a typical teen comedy or, if you like, a change in a movie about sex, she had a pretty decent laugh, which I think anyone could get. Both adults and teenagers would like this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes - your typical rebellious teenager who dresses and behaves like a boyfriend, and when she is denied to try herself on the boy’s football team, decides to take on her brother’s appearance to prove that she is worthy in the boy's soccer team. Of course, love manifests when she meets another guy who thinks she is her brother. She also has a girlfriend who is chasing her. Well, that says it all. <br /> <br /> This is a funny little drama for teenagers that I think will be remembered for a while. Amanda Bynes really proved something in the film, it's really hard to act like a guy. : D Well, that's true! <br /> <br /> 8/10
