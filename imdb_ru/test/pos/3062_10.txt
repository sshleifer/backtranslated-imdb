I can not believe that there are people who did not like this film! I thought it was the funniest movie I've ever seen. This is my b / c, I'm the biggest fan of Mel Brooks ... I know almost all the words and get very upset when they censor them when they are played on Family Channel. :) This is one of my favorite movies, so I donâ€™t know why someone would disagree! thank you Christina
