I'm not a big fan of Lucio Fulci films. Most of his bloody films of the 80s had their moments, but they often met as second-rate imitations of Dario Argento. With the exception of the entertaining “Zombies” (imitation of George Romero), I didn't like them very much. I know that Italian horror often ignores the plot, but the plot line and the characters of his films were too naked even by the standards. That is why “Don't torture the duckling” surprised me. This is actually a very well-made movie with an exciting murder mystery. This is perhaps the best jallo ever made, only seriously competing with Dario Argento's records in the genre. And unlike the previous movie Falchi "Lizard in the skin of a woman," it never drags on. <br /> <br /> The direction of Fulci is pretty good here. He maintains the plot at a good pace and maintains the interest of the viewer. In addition, the conclusion to the secret becomes a complete surprise to the audience. In addition, he adds some clever touches, such as cheerful soul music during a particularly disturbing sequence of beatings in the cemetery. In general, violence here is restrained and used only when it is necessary for the story. The acting is mostly good, full of familiar faces from Italian cinema of the 70s. Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Boucher are very cool. The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan, whose performance is too high. This is the only ridiculous aspect of the film. “Don't torture the duckling” definitely comes with my recommendation and can be a good introduction to the genre of giallo as a whole. (8/10)
