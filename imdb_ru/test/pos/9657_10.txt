I first watched this movie on Sci Fi and I must say that it was just awesome. For those of you who love Infinite Story, this is something that can bring back memories of this film. Despite the fact that this is a 1996 film, it has a hazy atmosphere and appearance, which creates a sense of fantasy. The game was great and the music was great, especially the song of the beginning and end of the song. For those of you who have not seen it yet, LOOK! I recommended completely!
