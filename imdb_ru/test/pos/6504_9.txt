A surprisingly funny, awe-inspiring feature of the pioneers of the turntable. DJ Shadow and Q-Bert are great in this awesome documentary. Look at every major DJ who appreciated their success, thanks to the classic postbop of Herbie Hancock "Rockit" and the archival material of some of the most complex and amazing player programs of all time.
