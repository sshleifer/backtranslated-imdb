One of the most dismal, depressing, but still opening the eyes of documents. I watched after a while. There is no narrative or story being told, just a “third-eye” type camera that tracks 2 pairs of heroin addicts in New York over the seasons. Watching them shoot the floor in public toilets, and then “clean” their needles in public toilets ... sometimes it’s too much and you need to pause to just rest. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is currently recovering from alcohol / narcotic supplements should watch this when he is thirsty — it really shows you what you could go back to! Seeing this, it is amazing how someone could even try this drug to begin with. <br /> <br /> The only thing he needed was to find out at the end where these people are now. Judging by what is shown in the document, none of them have any hope. They mention a desire to get better and quit smoking, but it seems the only end to their habits is to quit by death. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not for all viewers. It seemed to me that I was watching a car accident - after I started watching it, I just could not turn it off. I had a dark / painful charm to watch what happens in the lives of these addicts.
