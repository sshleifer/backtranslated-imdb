This is probably the best cinematic image of life in a Manhattan advertising agency: pressure to act; customer and agency requirements; parties; creation; money; steep surface with powerful corporate undercurrents. <br /> <br /> Throw in parenting responsibilities for Dustin Hoffman. <br /> <br /> The film is textured and deep. This follows his inner relationship when he tries to understand and live with what is happening; his relationship with Meryl Streep (and her friend, who becomes his friend), and his relationship with his son. <br /> <br /> Even though Meryl Streep was great, did she set the record for the shortest time on the screen to win an Oscar? She certainly can deliver when she is on, though.
