Escaping from a bank robbery, the criminal Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) helps Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), the chief engineer of Western Union, who is engaged in intelligence of the Wild West and had an accident with a horse. In 1861, Vance regenerates and is hired to work at Western Union with a team that installs poles and cable from Omaha to Salt Lake City. Vance and Harvard engineer Richard Blake (Robert Young) are flirting with the great sister Edward Sue Creighton (Virginia Gilmore), and she chooses Vance. However, his past haunts him when criminal Jack Slade (Barton Maclaine) steals Western Union cattle disguised as Indians. <br /> <br /> Western Union is a good but predictable western, directed by Fritz Lang. The story shows the difficulties of brave and idealistic people responsible for installing a telegraph across the West, against thieves and Indians. The entertainment story has action, drama, romance and funny situations, but with the exception of Jack Slade's personality, this story is not surprising. Randolph Scott gives another great performance with a great cast. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Conquistadores" ("Conquerors")
