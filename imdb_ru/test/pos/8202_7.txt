It was a movie that made you think a bit. Some pieces are a bit cheesy, some are pretty good. At times the conspiracy was getting thicker, and when you thought that Angela (Sandra) found a friend, his friend was a fraud or dead. All I have to say is that Denis Miller was supposed to be in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing after all the shit Angela went through. He would have raised Angela and me through landfills.
