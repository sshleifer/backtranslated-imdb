After another raid in an empty village, Viking chief Timandahaf misunderstands the explanation of his adviser Cryptographer that “fear gives wings to residents” and believes that fear really makes people fly. They decide to pursue a defender of fear in Gaul in order to learn how to fly and make them invincible warriors. In the meantime, Vitalstatistiks' nephew, Justforkiks, travels from Paris to the village of Gaul to become a man, and Asterix and Obelix are assigned to train the young man. The cryptographer's stupid son, Olaf, listens to the conversation of the cowardly Justforkiax with Asterix and Obelix and kidnaps him. Returning to the Viking village, Justforkix meets Abba, Timandhaf's daughter, and they fall in love with each other. But Machiavelli and the ambitious Cryptographer plan to marry his son Olaf on Avba and become powerful. In the end, Asterix realizes that not fear gives wings, but love. <br /> <br /> When I was a teenager, Asterix was my favorite comic, and I read all the stories about Goscinna and Uderzo. This feature film features all the original elements and comic book humor in amazing and wonderful animation. The novel of Justforkia and the magnificent Abba is amazing, and the situations in which Asterix and Obelix are involved are fun. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Astérix e os Vikings” (“Asterix and Vikings”)
