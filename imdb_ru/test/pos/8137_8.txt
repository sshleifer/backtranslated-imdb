Which films? I mean .. what are the films made for? Shooting? Killings? NO. They are made for life stories, and this is what makes this film. It represents how life has changed between two ages. Father and son, the father needs work and asks his son for help. <br /> <br /> Although there is another generation, some peculiarities remain, including family care. <br /> The main theme is, in my opinion, the sonâ€™s love for the father and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The film consists of only one dialogue, but this dialogue is more than I could ever have wanted. This film is pure art! Once again, after Marfa si Banii, Cristi Puiu presents us with another beautiful film. Well done!
