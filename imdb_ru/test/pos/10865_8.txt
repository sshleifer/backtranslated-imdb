I started watching it, expecting the worst, I was happy to find that the film was pleasant, a bit confusing in details, like when they all started singing. It gave me the opportunity to see Daniel W for the first time in battle, he is a better actor than I thought, sometimes he seemed a bit out of place. I thought the “purple storm” deserves to be released on Hong Kong legends, because it is different from most other Hong Kong films, it concerns a person’s emotional struggle, when he faces memory loss, he may sound trite, but when he eventually finds out that and who he really is really makes the film much more interesting. As soon as you get into the film, you will find that it holds you in your hands, as if you missed one bit, then much of the film will make sense, for example, I missed a little at the beginning, and I recommend to everyone who watches this, that they do not miss any of this. So I can say that this film was worth watching and I was grateful that I liked it.
