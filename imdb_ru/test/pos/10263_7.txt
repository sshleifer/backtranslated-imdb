Dr. Sayor (Philip Leroy), a wealthy doctor with psychological problems of the opposite sex, abducts employee Maria (Dagmar Lassander), a freedom-loving liberal woman who believes that men should be “corrected” and not women. Sayer retreats to his luxurious estate, leading Maria through a humiliating series of intellectual games, threatening to molest and kill her. It seems that Sayer's desire is to dominate her body, mind and soul, making her his sexual slave, obeying his instructions, following all his desires and whims. At first, after the resistance, Maria slowly leans towards her goal, but she has her own plans. She says that she wants to help Sayer to give up his sadistic behavior towards women so that he can love and not feel such desires for harm. Sayer seems to be keeping her under control, agreeing to some rather awkward scenarios (for example, lotion on toes, “making love” with an inflated doll that is his own entertainment, often spending time topless and even getting when he hit him hard a person bringing blood from his nose) that almost broke her, but something happens when the concerned doctor slowly falls in love with Maria ... and through what seems like a desperate attempt to end insanity, Maria takes over, playing with Sayer's thirst to your body. <br /> <br /> More of a battle of will, a kind of sexual war, when it seems that one responds when actually the other really has the upper hand. Through most of the film, Sayer mistreats Maria, forcing her (... seems) to submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature. Her attempts to escape failed because his home is such a well-designed fortress ... it is a typical European Art Deco style palace, fashioned and organized by a man who retained his solitude until the end of his days (... walls and doors opening by his order, with quarantine for his "victims"). But, as soon as Maria appears to drink a bottle of pills as a result of her pain in his hands, the tables turn around and she takes it where it wants. He finds that he is really thirsty for her, and Maria takes advantage of this, trying her best to get when Sayer wants to hug and ruin her (... and I can understand his disappointment because she has this charm, which can drive a man crazy) <br /> I felt that the film works, ultimately, as a battle cry for women, their empowerment and rebellion against men who believe that they should always have control, sexually and mentally. Twist completes this ideal. I could not swallow Sayer's fate because of his strict cardiovascular activity and training regimen ... we see how he develops his slim athletic figure, and how this regimen is part of the usual routine every weekend, before the real mind games start with his victim. If he is in good shape and spends such time developing himself for extracurricular activities that follow his regime, how can he suffer from the fate that follows his completion of the deal with Maria at the end when she ceases to resist his successes? <br /> <br /> Maria, as he later admits, is the first person he actually kidnapped; others from the past, call girls, were paid for their services so that Sayer could feel the power of dominating a woman, even if it was just a fictitious charade caused by a deeply worried person unable to connect with the opposite sex. The spontaneous decision to do it, bounce off the norm, costs him more than he ever knew. <br /> <br /> This whole psychosexual subtext is quite fascinating to see how it is being unraveled, but Dagmar Lassander, such a delicious sexy kitten, was my reason to enjoy it so much ... without her, I could not love it is so strong because it is vital as a sacrifice worth striving for. Perhaps the highlight of the film, a delightful dance like Lassander dressed in gauze (!), Unravels a wardrobe, exposing her breasts before a jazz score ... this is the type of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth moist and sweat forehead. Dagmar Lassander must have been a joy for clothing designers because she wears these clothes so well ... she has such classiness, refinement and screen presence along with her beauty and seductive abilities, Dagmar goes beyond to create a cult character who would define her career .. even if the film is not well known (.. I learned about it through word of mouth). The provocative nature of the script and the subject of risk may not appeal to certain crowds, as it deals with sex (.. and pain) in many different forms, the dialogue is very illustrative and complex. At times I could not help but laugh at Sayer's comments about prisoner Maria, about how he loves to make women suffer, and the excitement he feels, causing them to turn into slavery (... in an attempt to make the words poetic) It all looks rather strange ). But Dagmar is the real reason to see this, and the film, in my opinion, works best as a fetish film, a possible male fantasy with this seemingly stiff and proper idealist, captured and held against her will, forced to turn into a shaky The situation, its fate, perhaps at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist. Her submission and how she reacts to his aggressive behavior towards her (... there are cases when she manifests itself in a hesitant desire to embrace him, revealing a possible attraction to him, which in itself can strike some who are watching ), among the most exciting moments of this particular operation. My other favorite scene, other than dance, is a piano concert with Sayer, caressing Maria when she plays a soothing tune.
