As an admirer of the old Doctor Who and after the mediocre Fox film, I was dubious in this new series of Doctor Who. Although I gave him a chance, and I'm so glad I did it. <br /> <br /> Yes, some episodes are not as brilliant as others, but they are all pleasant, and yes, Dr. Eccleston is far from everyone I had before, but ... Dr. Eccleston is the best thing to have. His performance is sometimes funny, sometimes dramatic, sometimes completely insane, but always fantastic. <br /> <br /> This and Bill Piper as Rose make this series head and shoulders above the rest (Camilla Cauduri is as fantastic as Rose’s mom), and there is a depth for this series not to be present before. This series is incredibly powerful, especially given its sci-fi character. I mean, who would have thought that you could ever regret or even cry for Dalek before, how many times in the history of this series “we had moments like with Father Rose, an ambulance doctor and“ You were fantastic. ... so I was the final speech? I advise everyone, be it a fan of Doctor Who or even a TV drama, to buy this set on DVD, it really is Fantastic! <br /> <br /> Now there are only 4 episodes from the latest episodes (and I look forward to new cybermen). I have to say that Dr. David Tennant is not so good, of course, you can disagree, but I don’t think his Doctor capable of those emotional moments that were seen in the previous series. I also have to say that, in my opinion, this series is not yet as good as the previous one, but the return of Sarah Jane and K9 was a fantastic episode, a real decoration. Not to say that this series is not very good, but not very good. <br /> <br /> So, whether you like it or not, whether you prefer Tennant or Eccleston, the Doctor is back and he is here to stay. "Fantasy!" - Almost as many "Science Fiction!", How many and the Doctor! -
