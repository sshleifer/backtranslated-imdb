This film is great, especially if you like art. The landscape that two daughters draw and photograph is beautiful. At times this story is both funny and sharp. <br /> <br /> Lovers of European films and "feature films" will love this movie. This is really a feature film - there is really a lot of art in it. Rent it. <br /> <br />
