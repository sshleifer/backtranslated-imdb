Based on Micah Valtariâ€™s book, this second CinemaScope film ever created is full of rich colors, beautiful music and a panoramic spectacle. The plot is sometimes confused in a fuzzy formulation, but in general it has a strong social content: a person is governed by his emotions and that every action has equal consequences. But to truly enjoy this movie, first watch the movie, then read the book. Although it is different, it sheds light on many things that were not visible on the screen, and gives breath to a certain depth of the cinque.
