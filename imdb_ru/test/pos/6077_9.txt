The site has already had a few comments on the “prestigious” feeling of the film, and the show showed many ponderous talents: from Fiennes and Scott-Thomas to beautifully presented design and winning, to virtuoso craftsmanship. direction. Not surprisingly, Andrew Lloyd Webber's opening speech for Evita began this year at Oscar: “Well, thank God, there are no songs in the English Patient.” Letters about the Oscar winners lead me to Juliette Binoche, who in star composition gives a wonderful idea.

Her performance in this stunning film is a beautiful thing.
