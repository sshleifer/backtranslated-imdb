If you are a child of the 80s and have not seen this film, you could not become a real child of the 80s. How can you not love those great chipmunks (don't forget about the chippets), lines and songs Over the years, I can still sing every word of every song. The storyline is great and much better than movies for kids today. It's just fun and worth the rent, even if you're all grown up.
