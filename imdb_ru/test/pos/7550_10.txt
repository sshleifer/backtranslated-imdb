Unfortunately, many great movies on IMDb, such as this one, have their own scores, “corrected” IMDb. This is a truly beautiful and intriguing film, produced by experienced directors Bonnie and Clyde, Little Big Man, Night Moves, Mickey One and The Chase. <br /> <br /> If you click in the user rating area, you'll see that the actual median for Four Friends is 7.6. However, IMDb “corrected” (stunned?) Rating to 6.4. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb: “IMDb publishes weighted average values ​​of votes, not original data. Different filters are applied to the raw data in order. eliminate and reduce attempts to "vote picking" by persons more interested in changing the current film rating than in expressing their true opinion about it .... The exact methods that we use will not be disclosed. This should ensure that the policy remains effective. " In other words, we will not disclose our methods, so you can not doubt how we achieved the result! What a shame to see beautiful thought-provoking films like The Four Friends, cost no better than lame formal comedies because of the IMDb "filters".
