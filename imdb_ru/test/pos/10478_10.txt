If not the best film ever made, Babette’s Holiday is certainly one of the most loving. This is an excellent study of the meaning of artistry, generosity, devotion and grace. Humor is mixed with tender longing; Characters are treated with honesty, as well as with deep respect. There are meditations for memory, fate, old age and loyalty. Amazing cinematographer cinematographer Henning Christiansen: rarely wrinkled faces looked so bright in the candlelight. The dish is accompanied by delicious music of the period, Brahms, Mozart and simple folk hymns. Enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit, because, as the general says: “Mercy and truth have met, and righteousness and bliss will kiss each other.”
