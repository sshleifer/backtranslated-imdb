The end of the suburb, as it should be addressed both to ordinary citizens and to mass consumers, is likely to acquire the status of cultural reform. The film uses a super-cynical analysis of authors, politicians, and social philosophers with regard to the paradox created by suburban life — mainly in the post-war era. <br /> <br /> What we have created in America is a place where there is “none of the charms of country life and none of the charms of urban city life”. This is a recipe that is laid out for the suburbs, and the film focuses on the only idea “Oil”. Essentially, in the most general sense, the world is approaching peak oil production or reaches its peak, and when we are fully aware of this, there will be major changes in lifestyle, whether it is in our best interests or forced upon us by the quality of life, even to the inhabitants of Calcutta slums could not describe to us. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, then the end of the Prigorodny District will pull the viewer into their guts, creating a nauseous feeling. This is sure to happen. This is a gloomy view of our inalienable way of life. Ambivalence lies, in particular, in each relevant viewer of the film's critical analysis. I foresee that many unprepared viewers slander the film as complacent liberal propaganda - like a Michel Moore film. What they do not take into account is the fact that such a reaction is too normal when such a message so incredibly hard affects the lifestyle of the vast majority of the masses. <br /> <br /> This is true, and as a student who studies urban planning, I can tell you that we have better prepare now because we have little chance of preserving the quality of life in this dwindling cesspool of forged resources that are fading away than the race of people affected by black plague.
