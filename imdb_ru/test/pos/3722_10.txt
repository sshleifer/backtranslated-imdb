I am a longtime fan of the works of Luc Besson, and until I knew his name, I was also looking for this film. I tried to look for this film all over California for more than four years. Last summer I went on a trip to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to at least watch this movie. In short, I bought it and looked in France! I was amazed, it completely made my trip, and I finally feel satisfied that I saw Luke Besson's first job. An absolutely amazing character development, a very provoking thought, a great acting game and a perfect movie. If you are a fan of concept films, then this is one of the most original and classic films. It seems to me that it is a rare pleasure to watch a film like this, its risky, unorthodox, and, ultimately, completely unique. if you are a fan of Luc Besson, then it is really necessary to see whether you are a fan of Besson or not, this is definitely an important work, in general, a great contribution to the immortal art of cinema.
