It seems that every review I read missed an important point. Shakespeare wrote for accent and pronunciation just as he did for the Northerners in other plays. The Scottish accent changes the accent and rhythm of the language and has a profound influence on what is said and how it is perceived. So listen again and note the difference. The piece is well done, and the rhythm of the words is much better than that of people using received, polite, well-written English. I recall the time when a teacher at Leicester school unknowingly asked me, 14 years old, to read the play of Walter Scott, written in the tone of the border. I come from the Frontier, and when I read it, how it should be read, it makes all the difference.
