I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of mediocre quality and plot lines. The exceptions for this are the films Ramgopal Verma. This is a good movie with great star performances. This is a must see film for those who are tired of stupid dancing and love stories. The adaptation of the story and the characteristics were exceptionally good. You should watch this movie for Nana Patek. based on the life of police officer Mumbai Day Nike, this film is more realistic. The film goes deep into the life of the common man, which he has in addition to the collision specialist. I rate it as one of the best films of the year.
