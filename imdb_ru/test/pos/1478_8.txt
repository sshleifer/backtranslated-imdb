I rate it pretty high just because of Sam Elliot. I could have done without female nudity, but I would have spent almost all the nonsense to see Sam show off her stuff. He publishes wonderful cynical wits, with many of which I agree, and I am pleased to see him in the role in which he really shows emotions, instead of just frowning and looking as courageous as possible. My boyfriend was of the opinion that this film is in many ways similar to the film in which Ed Harris had a Latin American partner (in the sense of the word, the police!), Who was a little eager to prove himself. You can draw your own conclusions on this, but if you like Sam, you will like it. You can say that I am biased, but who is wrong? I would buy it on DVD in an instant!
