The film is about the failure of power and the selfishness of adults. The overwhelming inability to deal with the life and means that children go to try to achieve life. Only alive. Stay alive in a cruel world. The world of nightmares, we are afraid to watch it, because we see the truth and are afraid to see it. Seeing the world of despair, when we all feel so comfortable in life, and even complain about what we don’t have, when it’s so trivial compared to someone else. They, children of the film, are not sensitive. They are more than devoid of the sensitivity of what surrounds them. They view sex as an act, as if they were watching a TV show. When one boy is with a prostitute, Pixot sits on the bed and stares blankly, feeling nothing. He wants to be a little boy and have a family, but the prostitute also does not feel compassion and pushes him away. “Human” film, with “human” relationships and moral judgment in an ugly, scared, cruel world. Reminds us that life is unfair, but you can still have a human connection.
