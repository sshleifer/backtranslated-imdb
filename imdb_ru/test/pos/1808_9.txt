“Valley of the Girls” is the final film of the 1980s with captured phrases filtered across all of this wonderfully played film. The characters are so convincing that you forget that this is a film, and not a video of a real “day in the life” of any US high school. This film - by the 1980s, that the TV series about Brady Bunch - by the 1970s. If you do not like it, well then "Pin me a spoon."
