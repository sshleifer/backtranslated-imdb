I remember it in the same vein as the Young. We came back from the pub and watched it or taped it, and then spent weeks replaying the lines with each other. <br /> <br /> We called one of our buddies "Zipmole Watkins" after a brilliant episode in which Daniel At the abstractionist "Back Street" Paul has a bit of "restyling" on his nose. <br /> <br /> Lots of great phrases: “Remember that at 5:30 in the morning you can get only white bread from a brown man. this is an easy guy! - Gandhi, as a local seller. <br /> <br /> Tony Woodcock was definitely there in the episode in which Ralph (Daniel Peacock) teaches the bartender: “This is not good Amanda, I will never be a bar” man “Helen Lederer teaches him to ask people about the match” See the match last night? I thought Woodcock played well. “After a series of unsuccessful conversations at the bar, the curly star of Arsenal was sitting:“ Do you see the match last night? "“ Yes. I thought I played well. ”<br /> <br /> We still make weird stupid strings -“ Reg and Ralph ..... or ....... Ralph and Reg. Reg , Reg. ... Reg Reg Reg Reg "<br /> <br /> A lot of very surrealistic silly moments and very surrealistic songs from Flatlets - The Back Street Abortionist, a personal favorite with a great end line -" And he will mark your packages "Return to the sender "<br /> <br /> Good old Danny Peacock - you added a lot of young drinkers to the evenings, sir. <br /> <br /> ** Update - I found some episodes on the tape - I'm going to upload a sketch Gand and on Youtube **
