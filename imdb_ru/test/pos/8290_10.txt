ADVENTURE WITH BAP <br /> <br /> There are several films that I could watch all my life and never get tired of them, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE was a 1987 attempt to bring old favorites to the forefront of animation, this time on the big screen. In an era when Disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office, THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE is one of the best animated films that Disney did not produce in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and elementary when Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete in the world race with chipsets (Janette, Eleonora and Brittany). However, since the chipmunks are confronted with exotic dangers, they do not know that they are pawns in a large plunder of diamonds. <br /> <br /> The Chipmunk Adventure has never been and never will be a film that takes off thanks to a fascinating plot. And for people who did not like him in childhood, the film will probably never be more than pleasant, but forgotten animated film. But for me it will always be a little-known masterpiece. Something in this film interests me, as few films do. <br /> <br /> Each song is fun, optimistic and harmless. Highlights include Chipette in a little perilous Arab dance to calm the snakes. There is also a very cute song in which chipmunks sing about traveling around the world, and we can see them on the main attractions around the world. One of the features of Chipmunk’s characters is that, despite the potentially annoying vocals, songwriters have always managed to write songs that caught the eye, even without annoying. This film is no exception ... in fact it boasts one of the best soundtracks for animated films of the 80s, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Every joke is sweet, sincere and funny. The battle between bad guys and a spoiled puppy is very funny. And the shock of the fact that Chipetta almost got married to the child emperor, too. Comedy manages to constantly play with children so that they do not miss anything, but everything remains charming for adults with enough nostalgia to entertain them. <br /> <br /> It’s really just a fun journey that is completely modest in its ambitions. CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE never seeks to be more than harmless fun. I will be the first to admit that this is a biased review, because I have such a nostalgic love for CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE, that I can never give him a bad review ... but, nevertheless, it fills me with such children's satisfaction during . Everyone has their own random favorite from childhood, which no one knows, and for me it is a film. And any film that I can watch again and again, no matter, I am 5, 12, 23 or more - this is a great movie in my eyes. <br /> <br /> ... A- ...
