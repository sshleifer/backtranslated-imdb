Absolute classic flirs 80s. This one is unlike any other, as it pushes on psychotic young men the size of a pint the size of a pint with the desire to kill all adults in the city. Bad from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (again, the gold of the 80s) plays one of the child killers, and he is paired with one of the little girls that Jake Blues is trying to buy at BLUES BROTHERS. There is a third blond boy, but he continues to fade from the film for any reason. Sometimes violence can be fun, and in some places even surprisingly awful. The demonic gang of smiling children, although somehow obsessed with extra-planetary means, has little resemblance to child droids who never thought of using pistols, crossbows, and shovels to kill these annoying adults. Julie Brown (not in downtown Julie Brown - the other) shows her stand like three times when she dances in her bedroom. This film is a rarity I can't believe I missed my age in the 80s. It would be my favorite movie as a child if I watched it. Where is the sequel that is being asked to end? This movie is just incredible. Look for it at any cost.
