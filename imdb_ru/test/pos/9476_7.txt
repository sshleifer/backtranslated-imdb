It is interesting to see how young James Cagney does his job. He plays a guy from the group “Scales and Measures,” who takes his work very seriously, stepping on the fingers of a group of politicians in curves. He is offered peace, but he maintains his integrity. He was beaten and framed, but this is a problem. We will never know if he is really in danger. They say that he is in some place, but he seems to have a blank check to move around and do what he needs. At times he is so insolent that he doesn’t do much to protect himself. His allies are at the police station, but almost everything else is pretty corrupt. Of course, he is persistent (almost too good to be true), and we pull him. The problem for me is the lack of constant waiting. It would be much better if he had to clear his name. He never descends into the depths, even when his wife rejects. Bad guys are fun anyway. See how Cagney does his cool guy pose.
