I tend to lean toward films about people who decide to overcome censorship and express what they really want to express. Eric Bogosyan's character Barry is similar to Howard Stern, but much smarter. The character itself is very fascinating. Like the Oliver Stone film, I expected more. The film sags a little during the third act. Plus, it’s clear that Talk Radio is based on a play with its long dialogue scenes. But in general, the film works. Bogosyan is great in the title role, and the fact that he also wrote the play from which the film was based probably helped him. If you want to watch one of the best films of Stone, I would advise you to watch “JFK” or “Salvador”. This is not his best work, but, nevertheless, a good movie.
