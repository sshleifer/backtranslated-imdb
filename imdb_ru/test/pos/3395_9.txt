Just by looking at it with my mom (who got it for Christmas), I was glad to find something different from the usual things that I usually watch. All the stories were detailed, and you can have strong emotions for each character from the very beginning. Each storyline is traced brilliantly, making you feel completely different things for each character. The cast is terrific, my personal favorites are James Reed and Lesley-Ann Down, as well as George Hazard and Madeleine Fabray / Lamotte / Mine. All this is deep and wonderful, which makes viewing very intrusive, I recommend it to almost everyone.
