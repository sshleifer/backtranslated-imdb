When I saw this movie being broadcast late on the night on TV, I first decided to skip it. I'm glad I then started to look. Yes, the special effects are the same as the puppet shows of Jerry Andersen. Some of the actors / actresses from his other productions, he obviously later used the same composer, since the stupid soundtrack could only come from one of his productions, and the plot is as slow as a wet weekend. Get it all, and you have a movie that shows intriguing possibilities. Is there a planet on the opposite side of the sun? Is this a double earth? Is everything the other way around, and if so, do they speak English the other way around? I love this outdated SF, if only for the wonderful models of Jerry, the planes, the buildings and the spacecraft. Some of them are not as far-fetched as it seemed then. Have you seen the logo of the European Space Center? Very reminiscent of the euro logo today. Suspend the faith and spend a couple of hours watching it, you'll be glad you did.
