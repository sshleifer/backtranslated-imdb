I recently saw this film at the 3rd Hollywood Film Festival. It was in polarized 3-D (Gray glasses, not red and blue) It was a lot of fun to watch this movie with the audience, the print was excellent and 3-D perfect. The performances were great, and it added to the fun that in the unexpected finale (which we should not share with other moviegoers, at least according to the trailer and the poster of the film) there were people howling with laughter. By today's standards, this is probably a comedy rather than horror, but with the additional dimension of 3-D (complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen) this film has become an exciting game in the horror of the 50s.
