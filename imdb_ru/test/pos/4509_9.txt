I have never read a book, but I have always heard a lot of good things about it. So when the movie came out, I thought about watching it, but I never saw it. He was now on DVD, and I was thinking about renting for a few weeks. Last night I finally picked it up. I am very glad I did it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was incredible in this film. The scenery, etc. ... everything made you feel in Kabul. The game was very good, although I am sure that some emotions were lost in translation. And the story itself was good, clean, and inspiring. Yes, the story was very sad, but at the same time inspiring. <br /> <br /> And I will be honest, like a white American ... made me see aside from Kabul and Afghanistan that I never imagine in my mind when I think about it. Showed me Afghanistan in front of the Taliban. Showed me a place that was beautiful. Showed me a place with kindhearted people. I am a community that was like a family, except for a few hooligans. <br /> <br /> In any case, I recommend this movie to everyone. This is one of the best I've ever seen.
