Surprisingly good crime drama "Mean streets". Foreshadows elements of "Goodfellas" and "Casino". The first big role is Joe Sands. Smart dialogue. I think the Maltin guide gives it a bomb rating. I can only guess that nobody really bothered to see it. <br /> <br /> Saw it at the Tarantino Film Festival, and he said that Scorsese used several of these actors in The Bull Bull.
