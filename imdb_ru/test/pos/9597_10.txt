This is a real gem of a television movie. Based on a completely insincere story, he follows the football league club, fighting in a foul mood, through his course for the FA Cup, where chaos begins, and players of all seventies styles. The ending is unexpected, the performances are great, and Nick Hancock shows that he CAN do something else besides sports shows. My only regret is that I did not write it down.
