I just finished showing the El Padrino movie in Germany. A great movie. We look forward to new films from Mr. Chap in the future. It was great to see such a well-composed film with such tension and history that should remain an instant classic. The end, with a little ambiguity, leaves the story open to the continuation. Watching a film with excellent quality really underlines Chapa’s serious potential and his talented skill as a writer, actor, director and director. Chapa struck many with his triumphant performance in the film “blood in blood,” and now he has proved to everyone who saw his work his potential to become a recognized critic and director with genuine artistic control. Something that few directors can afford.
