To begin with, this is my favorite OS ST. <br /> <br /> In addition to StuOz's critical comments, I will add one more thing: familiarization with the technique when the Enterprise shoots photonic bolts at the blind. goal, they must be very close to direct hits (I suppose) in order to cause any anxiety to the much less damage to the Romulan ship with the vacuum of space in order to fight it. <br /> <br /> I had a bit about the problem with the Romulan commander, who questioned his belief in the Romulan “protocol” or their leadership, unless it is related to the attack of vulnerable targets (outposts in the neutral zone) that are not are at war. In addition, I do not think that the commander will fall for the main or simple tactics played by Kirk, for example, the “game of the dead” or the fall for the trick that his subordinate submits to him about whether to attack the Enterprise or not when it happens. the game of the dead. <br /> <br /> At the Enterprise: I am surprised that, having seen the method of attacking the Romulan ship earlier, Sulu said: “They give up?” when he attacks the Enterprise for the first time. <br /> <br /> It's funny how Spock can perform gun control repairs only when the emergency is over. <br /> <br /> Also in the final attack, I thought that the Romulan vessel had not been exposed for too long (so long that Spock could run a couple of passes and return to the gun room, activate and launch photon torpedoes. At this point I would use phasers, but I’m sure that this was the case with the technicians and the budget). <br /> <br /> On the positive side: a good drama is played on the Romulan ship, in which we get to know the Romulans. Magnificent scenes with Stiles telling about the human knowledge of the Romulans. Also his conflict with Spock is right there. I would like Stiles' character to stay on the show for a while, if not for anything but the energy he added. <br /> <br /> I only note negatively and nonsense as a joke (I am sure that there is more). But for me it is as good as it turns out! “Balance of Terror” is always the one I put in first place in my ST rating.
