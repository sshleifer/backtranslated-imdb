One night, bartender Randy (Matt Dillon) rescuers Jewel (Liv Tyler) from his jealous Utah boyfriend (Andrew Dees Clay). He takes the jewel to his home. But Utah is back and wants Randy to open the safe in Mc Cool. Sudden shot - Utah is dead. Then ... ... I'd rather stay here to tell the story. This is how to explain the story of "Wild Things". What seemed so interesting to me was that the plot (written by Stan Seydel, his first and last work - he died last July ...) was told from three points of view - three men who fall in love with Jewel. Everyone sees her differently - like John Goodman as a detective who fondly falls in love with her because of the memory of his dead wife ... <br /> <br /> No wonder guys fall in love with her! Liv Tyler - she is a real gem. She made the big screen shining! She played her part as if she were in the 40th year. Honey - but at the same time she was a cool vampire who walks over the bodies of the dead and uses men for her needs. And, of course, Michael Douglas. How could I forget him? Mr. Burmeister, the killer playing bingo - he was very cool! <br /> <br /> But in the last 10 minutes there was too much farce for my taste - it weakened the atmosphere. This piece began when Paul Reiser (like Randy Carl's cousin) put on a leather dress for Jewel. The song "YMCA" was not very suitable here ... ... but in general, "One night at Mc CoolÂ´s" is a pretty cool parody of film noir! <br /> <br />
