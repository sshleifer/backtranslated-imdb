Only the British could make such a film, and it would be so charming with taste! Betty (Brenda Bletin) wants something more out of life, but she doesn't know that when she realizes that she is in love with her childhood friend, Boris (Alfred Molina), who owns a local funeral home. Meanwhile, the American undertaker (Christopher Walken), who "wants to return fun at the funeral," moves to this small Welsh community with his assistant (Lee Evans) and wants Boris to run for his money through bright thematic funerals. " (Star Trek Funeral, anyone?) Brenda and Boris decide to arrange Brenda's death and funeral, with hilarious results. Very nice movie - if you are a fan of British comedies such as "Waking Ned Devine", you will like it.
