I thought this movie was perfect for little girls. It was about a magical place where Genevieve and all her sisters could do what they wanted to do the most, at any time. Most little girls will like this story, although it has a thought about death. Although no one dies, the king almost dies, but little girls would not understand this, so everything is put together to create the perfect story. All events add up, creating a great plot that can make sense if you dig deep enough. This story is perfect for little girls, and since this is a Barbie movie, children can get more pleasure from it, especially if they have their own Barbie. Anyone can have fun, because it is so cute and clear. In general, I think that this film is a good film for everyone, especially little girls, and he will smile at least once.
