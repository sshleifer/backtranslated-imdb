I saw this movie late on the free channel, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. Being a fan of horror movies, I often watch these midnight movies during school holidays. Most often, horror films shown at this time are usually big lamers. "Campfire Stories" certainly do not fit into this category. <br /> <br /> Campfire stories are, in essence, an anthology of stories based on famous urban legends. They are brought together with the participation of teenagers telling these stories around the campfire. This bonfire settlement has a mysterious plot in and of itself. However, this particular story is weak and confused, obviously used mainly to create other creepy stories. <br /> <br /> In this film there are three stories (four, if you count “Hook” at the beginning), all of which are really creepy and well made. I especially liked the third story (“Medallion”), which tells about a guy whose motorcycle breaks down in front of a mysterious house. This particular story works well when you really frighten you with sudden memories of the history of the house. In addition to this, the end of the tale will shock you completely! The first story (“Honeymoon”) was also very creepy, although the second story (“People can lick too”) was not enough. <br /> <br /> Being a veteran of a horror movie, I usually do not understand scared. This film has certainly done this job well! What I particularly liked about this film is that it is divided into three shorts. This means that the film will not pass in about an hour of character development and atmosphere creation before the real bloodshed begins. This makes "Bonfire Stories" ideal for spending the night, parties, etc. <br /> <br /> "Bonfire Stories" is a creepy, fresh horror film that will make your heart stop just once. This is definitely better than the crap you often find in theaters these days (Blair Witch 2, Urban Legends: Final Cut ... damn it!). Find a copy and see it ... if you decide! <br /> <br />
