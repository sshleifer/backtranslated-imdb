Compared with the famous Hollywood remake, this film is less indicative, but gives a much more general picture of the drug problem. The remake loses the most interesting of the three plot threads - the farmer, whose meager source of livelihood depends on drugs as a paid cash culture, and whose increased involvement in drug trafficking in an attempt to improve himself destroys himself and his family. In addition, the history of dependence of the daughter is associated with problems not only abstinence, but also a high probability of relapse. This original miniseries makes good use of extra time to go into the questions more carefully and remains strong meat on this controversial issue.
