After reading the horrible reviews of this film, including comments that were said to be quoted by Colin, I almost did not bother to add this film to my collection of films Firth, however, being a fan of Firth, which I am, intrigue overcame me! <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I really liked the movie. It was the unknown, drama and intrigue, as well as the scene of V. Sexy Colin. The plot made me guess right down to the end credits, and I felt that as soon as one passed by the opening scene of Jennifer Rubens, the actress convincingly played her role. Colin was great, as always, and it's great to see him play a character from the “Dark Side”, “a cold run through my spine”, and after watching it I can't wait to see Colins’s recent film “Soon to be trauma” on DVD . <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe it was not a film that was “in your face”, so to speak, and no one could “fall asleep on the plot,” especially towards the end, as there was a lot going on, but it was what I liked about it, the acting was thin, fortunately, not exaggerated (like many unknown thrillers), it made the film even more frightening to watch. No one could figure out what the character Colins (Ross Telbert) would do or, for that matter, the character Jennifer Rubens (Jamie Harris), and there were a lot of surprises ahead, I was sitting on the edge of my seat everywhere, with a comfortable pillow !! <br /> <br /> Personally, I am very glad that I watched Playmaker, and I will certainly rewind and look again. I think that any Firth fan will win from watching this movie, if they don’t like the plot, then just watch Colin ;-))
