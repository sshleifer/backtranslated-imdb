The network is a great movie! We are talking about Angela Bennett (in a magnificent performance by Sandra Bullock), who is a computer expert who works for the company Cathedral, is engaged in cleaning viruses and testing games for customers. Angela is a typical nerd who has no friends outside of cyberspace, he almost does not rest and does not leave, and almost all the time he stays in touch. One day, her friend Dale Hessman (Ray McKinnon) asks her to help him by sending Angela a disc with a strange program containing a lot of confidential information. That night, when Dale was going to meet her, he suddenly died in a plane crash. Going on vacation to Mexico, Angela meets a handsome guy named Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northham), who reveals himself to be a bastard-killer of composure and one of the guys hiding all the secrets of a floppy disk. <br /> <br /> Her life turns into a nightmare: all her records are erased, and she gets a new personality Ruth Marx, women with serious problems. with the police. <br /> <br /> This film is great because it shows how we, people, are dependent on computers and machines (sometimes even more than we should) and how vulnerable we are if someday someone decides to control and change our personal records without giving us the opportunity to prove a mistake.
