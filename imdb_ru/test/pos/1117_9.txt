Beautiful family film and a beautiful film about horses. 75% of entertainment. Casey, Buddy, Kelly Marsh - very interesting and cute characters. Horses are real beauties. <br /> <br /> Horse races serve as a backdrop to demonstrate that sometimes luck is nothing but common sense. Shows how children can do stupid things for silly reasons. Shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The very realistic characters depicted turn the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to. <br /> <br /> Andrew Rubin plays a remarkable role, like Buddy, the sensible big brother. Aidan Quinn reminded me a little (eyes, speech, appearance). <br /> <br /> Casey makes you fall in love with a character because of the seriousness. Sarah Blue is also beautifully depicted by Alexis Smith. Lloyd Bourdelle, father, played by Walter Mattau, and he IS a character. <br /> <br /> Although there is room for improvement in the film, this is a very pleasant, pleasant to the touch film.
