Romuald et Juliette is one of those French romantic comedies in which they seem to break all the rules, such as Trop Belle Pour Toi. Magnificent Daniel Othea learns about true loyalty and love when his life threatens to fall on his ears. The film is not a preaching story about morality, but a wonderful story that will keep you on the hook to the last. Firmmin Richard (like Juliet) is a heroine that women will cheer on - her laugh is my constant memory of this warm and witty film. The practical way in which she includes all her children from different fathers, especially birthdays, gives the film an advantage that raises it above the usual romantic comedy. But it is always the French, who seem to show us how easy it all is!
