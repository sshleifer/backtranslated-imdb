After the robbery incident at New York City Central Station, police arrested an innocent bystander (Kevin Spacey, Ordinary Suspects), who believes he is under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. We can understand why they think so, considering how a person politely informed them that he wears his dark glasses, because "the light on your planet is really bright." And so Prot (as he calls himself, pronounced rhyming with the “goat”) is sent to the Manhattan Psychiatric Institute, where tired workaholic doctor Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges, “The Big Lebowski”) tries to understand this man's so-called delusion. <br /> <br /> In the behavior of Prot courtesy and willingness to help. When he was asked why he believes that he was legalized, he, in fact, replies that it is because "you think that I am crazy." A few minutes later, after satisfying his insatiable new-found hunger from the fruits of the Earth, quite frank Prot discovered that he was an alien from the planet K-PAX, which is 1000 light years away from Earth, surrounding the Agape and Satori twin star system . He also explains in detail how his infinitely more advanced species has already mastered the journey faster than light, using the energy of light, an achievement that supposedly comes from humanity. <br /> <br /> Powell is quite understandable, very skeptical of these outrageous statements, although he is nevertheless fascinated by them and undertakes to understand how Prot came to such a conviction. Meanwhile, Prot uses his time to monitor his fellow patients in the psychiatric ward, ultimately offering everyone around him something to live for, and hope for a cure. Later on July 27, as Prot found out, he will again go to K-PAX, and he can take only one person with him. Nobody is sure what will happen on this day. <br /> <br /> Is Dr Powell originally scheduled to play ?? with Will Smith as Prot ?? Kevin Spacey took the lead when Smith had to leave the film. You can say that he had a lot of fun with his character, which was completely unnatural with his sometimes ridiculous dialogue (“Your product alone was worth the trip”), often causing a real laugh. Prota’s many words are based on undeniable intelligence, but logic asserts that it must be delusional ... shouldn't it? <br /> <br /> Is the audience moving back and forth between opportunities ?? for the first segment of the film, we almost accept the possibility that Prot is an alien (this is a science fiction film, isn't it ?!) before finally being convinced when Prot inexplicably displays the impossible knowledge of astronomy the newly discovered system of planets. Dr. Powell’s latest investigation offers us a neatly packaged earthly explanation of Prot’s delusions, but this just disappears quickly and we have to scratch our head again. In truth, the film remains open, leaving viewers the opportunity to reflect on what they have just watched and discuss it with others. However, regardless of whether you think that Prot is an alien or not, there are two insurmountable assumptions in your mind: the Universe is really a fascinating place, and perhaps there are even higher forces that we humans have not yet opened up.
