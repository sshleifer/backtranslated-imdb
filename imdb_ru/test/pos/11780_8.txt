Made with a twenty-bucks spare budget, this cheap, thirteen-minute short parody fun parodies the legendary sci-fi blockbuster George Lucas, 77, Star Wars, in the most contagiously stupid way imaginable. Writer / director Ernie Fosselius offers a winning and often mind-blowing mix of ridiculous sound effects, ineptly staged action scenes, coarse (not) special effects (you just have to love raw film-scratched lasers, asteroids from foil and household chemicals) ... err, I mean spaceships waving on the obvious wires), poorly voiced in dialogue, shamelessly impudent acting and incendiary classical music of Richard Wagner "Ride of the Valkyries". Characters are presented in fairly wide strokes; my favorites are the wailing weakling Fluke Starbucker, the venerable Jedi Knight Auggie "Ben" Doggie and the hated archimedes Villain Darf Nader (who spews only incomprehensible gibberish). In addition, the 4-Q-3 is clearly based on the tin man from The Wizard of Oz, while the Artie Deco is definitely a cheap vacuum cleaner. The true mastery of this film is the role of the legendary voice actor, High Paul Fries, in the role of the narrator; The delightfully rich and lush historical shades of Vries very complement the considerable stupid but ruthless merriment in the cheeks (choice of the line: "You will laugh! You will cry! You will kiss three dollars goodbye!"). General whistle.
