To view the film as nothing more than a skateboarding documentary will not recognize several important aspects of Dogtown. Peralta (the famous skateboard figure skater himself) created a film that not only tells about the birth of what we know today as skateboarding, but also explores the sociocultural and economic circumstances in which this sport arose and gained wide popularity. In addition, his film is quite personal: Peraltaâ€™s direct connection with this cultural phenomenon serves both as a knowledgeable cinematic researcher and as an involved subject participant. In this role, he is a typical "observer participant", bringing together many personalities who were an integral part of this movement and those who were deeply affected by the advent of skateboarding as a competitive sport and subculture. The film uses a unique stylistic form of film and sound editing, and the narration (Sean Penn) and interviews take on a rather genuine, unrepaired form, akin to the anarchic, nihilistic spirit of surfing on the sidewalk. The film demonstrates the kinetic appeal of a protracted sports music video, tempered by archaeologists sensitive to the importance of time, place, and circumstances.
