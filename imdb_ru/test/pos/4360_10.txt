Wow! This is a touching story! First I saw the Rescue Dawn. I did not like it. And now I saw a man, Dieter Dengler, about whom the Duke tells this story. Very impressive. A dieter is a controlled person who has encountered the most opposite emotions in his life on this earth. What an unusual life for this person LED. His story about the capture of Pathet Lao / Viet Cong and, consequently, his suffering is terrifying, but what is most impressive is his incredible will to survive. How could he find strength? In a criminal way, Dieter tells us with complete smooth sentences about his terrible ordeal during his captivity ... he is a great storyteller, and Herzog gives him the justice that this brave man deserves. <br /> <br /> In my opinion “Little Dieter Must Fly,” tells all this! leaving nothing to the imagination that makes the film "Rescue Dawn" superfluous. The horror does not become more real than, according to Dieter Dengler himself. He completely manages to draw a picture.
