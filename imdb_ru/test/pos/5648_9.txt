Unshakable immersion in psychological and physical oblivion, which will undoubtedly burn images of the true cruelty and suffering of war in your cerebral cortex, as not many other films do. In fact, there is simply no other war movie. <br /> <br /> Director Kon Ichikawa witnessed the unthinkable horror of Hiroshima first-hand only 10 days after the bomb was dropped. He said that from that day on, his mission would always be to express the meaningless, empty violence that people inflict on each other and on themselves. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa shows us that there are no winners in the war ... because the paths to victory and defeat are paved by the same soldiers, who are marching soullessly on roads that have only death and destruction at the end . <br /> <br /> Mr. Ichikawa succeeds in delivering his message to the world through this ghostly cinema.
