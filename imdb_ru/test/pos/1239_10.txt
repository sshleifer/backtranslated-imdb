Why should I say this? Because when the movie ended, I had a good mood. So many people exclaim at the end, wow! Bruce Willis can be funny. For those of you who believe that he has learned to act after the sixth sense, you should be completely new to his career. He won an Emmy for Best Actor in the comedy series, before he made Die Hard. It's like saying: wow, the sky has learned to put snow on the ground just because it is your first winter in life. The film was fun. What amazes me is how some of the other comments made on this film claim that there are no memorable lines or scenes. Spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Aaaa? I'm not a loser? Have you ever seen an adult cry? I'm not a loser before? <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was great. It was funny, it was never boring, and foolishly Disney-like, it was important. Something connected with life and, of course, any film about children trying to do this is above his head, but this time I didnâ€™t care. <br /> <br /> If you haven't watched it. Do it in this way. You'll like it.
