Reading some of the other comments, I have to agree that some of the (very few) flaws found in this brilliant documentary about one of the wonders of the 20th century (there with Billie Halliday, Bessie Smith, Edith Piaf, Judy Garland and Mercedes de Sosa ) justified. Because initially it was a 6-hour television documentary about her career ("ESTRANHA FORMA DE VIDA" (V) 1995/1999). A much more comprehensive and deeper understanding of Amalia’s inner world. As for the subtitles of her songs, I'm all for it! Although music, voice and performance can be - there is! - universally, in the words of so much poetry, just pleading for translation. I think it was a deliberate choice from the producers. They targeted 200 million Portuguese in Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, France, East Timor, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Canada, USA, South Africa, St. Tome and Principe, Goa, Damane, Diu, Venezuela Luxembourg, Germany and the rest of the Portuguese-speaking diaspora around the world. As for the Lady herself, she did not live to see this shortened DVD version of the documentary, but she was given a preview of “Estranha Forma de Vida”. And she seemed to like it. Even more.
