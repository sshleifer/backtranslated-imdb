I did something a little brave tonight when I watched this movie. I tried to wean myself from silent films. Of course, when this film was originally distributed, scores were probably played with it. Often the director himself chose the score (Charlie Chaplin often composed scores of his later silent films). But most of the music you hear on VHS tapes over silent films is by no means the kind of music that should have been played when the film was first released. And again, there were a lot of silent films that were played without glasses. I do not know the history of Potemkinâ€™s score, so I decided to watch it in the environment in which this work of art was created - the film. <br /> <br /> Soon after I turned off the music, without any help (or I should say freely) of the musical interpretation of the emotions on the screen, I fully became attached to the film. Visually, this is one of the most amazing movies. Eisenstein was a master of composition. Editing, perhaps the cinematic technique that Eisenstein is best known for (editing), is extraordinary. The mood of this film is anger, and he strongly inflamed my passions. <br /> <br /> To enjoy a silent film, especially drama, you need a lot of effort, but films such as The Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is worth it. Come on! You must watch this movie! Your education will be incomplete without it.
