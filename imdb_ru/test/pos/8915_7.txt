Why am I giving this 1974 porn 7 points? Because I watched it. And I found it funny! Foreigners, their strange spaceship, their strange helmets ... Oh my God, it was a sight to see. And all that is needed for these desperate alien women is sperm from the earth. <br /> <br /> And where are they looking for this? In Upper Bavaria, Germany. And this is where the main fun lies: in Europe (and especially in German-speaking countries) Bavaria is considered a traditional and backward region. And then the actors are so helpless with the alien women. Well, there were films about people who could not deal with women, such as the American Pie series. <br /> <br /> But this film is a real, funny oddity. You are constantly wondering how they came up with these crazy ideas. But it was 1974, and in retrospect, 35 years filled it with some nostalgia. You have never seen such a movie. <br /> <br /> And if you don't mind seeing occasional pubic hair and chest, look at it once. This is essentially a comedy, not a porn movie.
