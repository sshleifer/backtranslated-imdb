Although many people found this film too slow and simplistic, I really connected with it. There is no plot as such; rather, the film takes the form of a story about human survival, when three people trapped a tree, and a person who eats a crocodile hides somewhere under water. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought the acting was mostly very good, despite the fact that it was quite demanding from time to time, and I felt the warmth of the characters. The situation in which they found themselves was rather terrifying, and I was really nervous for them. I found the whole film rather nervous because of the apparent helplessness of their situation and the constant threat to their survival. <br /> <br /> Crocodile effects were treated surprisingly well for such a low-budget film, and believe me, I saw my large share of tricky crocodile films. The creature was moving well and had a real threat, and, although the audience with whom I was, did not seem too keen on the film as a whole, they still jumped and gasped whenever a crocodile appeared. <br /> <br /> According to the scenario I would make a few changes, especially by the end, but it was not a big problem. For fans of the slow survival horror set in reality, it will be a fascinating film, but unfortunately, I think that for many viewers looking for exciting adventures and higher production figures from their cinematic experience, this moment will simply be lost.
