After seeing only five episodes of the show before that (I watched replays on BBC Two), I didn’t have much experience with the League, but I was not only a fan, but also a fan of British comedy. I can say that this movie is funny. Seeing Herr Lipp (whom I did not see on the screen before the film began) Briss and Jeff on the big screen was a great comedy experience. Being on the screen is what the League uses to the full, with exploding heads (it will be a surprise who it is) and horrible murders with random battles in medieval style. <br /> <br /> Jeff is without doubt the funniest character in the three main characters in this film, because he has the best airliner and overall behavior, as in the series. One of my only disappointments with the film was that Jeff never shouted: “Well, now I have this gun” (although it is accumulated in one part of the film). , to use the phrase that everyone else does, Pythonesque, and this is very similar to movies such as Brian's Life. The appearances from Tubbs and Edward were welcome, but the Pope Lazarou line “Hello, Deaves” infuriated me more than anything they said to them (Lazaro is probably my favorite character Vasya after Tubbs and Edward). He has a rather sharp ending with one of the main characters being killed, and I can only hope that this is not the last League adventure on Vasya's screen. With Gatiss, mentioning the possibility of another series or film, I am now very excited. This is a film that I will watch again, in part because the projector has died to the end, leaving about 10 minutes of the film, but mainly because it is inventive and fun. It doesn't really bother me if it's not as good as the television series, because I liked it. <br /> <br /> One thing is, if you have never seen the League, you will love it anyway, but Dave knows that you will think about people who come up with it. As Tubbs or Edward would say, this is a local film, for locals, and a very valuable thing. <br /> <br /> **** of ***** (4/5)
