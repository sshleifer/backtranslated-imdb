I love practically everything that the late Al-Adamson has directed in his long and varied career, but “Nurse Sherry’s possession” stands head and shoulders above fun, but it’s generally accepted that these are cool school holidays like “Horror of Monsters of Blood” and “Dracula Against ". Frankenstein". This movie is really scary! I'm saying you're gonna jump out of your seat when you watch Nurse Sherry? No, of course not. But this set of elements from Exorcist, Rubin and Carrie is one of those cute, creepy little horror films that were in the 70s. You can not point the finger at what is so creepy in this, but the film is saturated with atmosphere. (And what an end! Don't worry, I won’t spoil it for you.) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really nailed him to it, and it doesn't matter if Nurse Sherry was a calculated success or a fluke Jill Jacobson is pretty but not outstanding as an unhappy nurse who is obsessed with the spirit of the recently deceased religious leader (Bill Roy, who shines in her short role). Jeffrey Land is fine, like her sullen doctor. There are some damn elements here (in the end, profits were ultimately due to these cheap entry films), but in fact they contribute to the plot, and not just the window dressing. "Nurse Sherry" was a production of "Poverty", and it is sometimes shown (scenery, special effects, etc.). However, the film has a heart, mostly decent acting and directing, as well as some sincerity. Sam Sherman also found it appropriate to use Harry Lubin's thematic music in this film for the television series of the late 50s - early 60s "One Step Ahead", which certainly adds a terrible atmosphere. The DVD contains two significantly different parts of the film (in the earlier version there are a lot of T & A that ended up on the floor of the cutting room to make room for more horrible things), as well as a theatrical trailer, a commercial and an excellent commentary. Sherman. By the way, does anyone know what happened to Bill Roy? Next to John Carradine, he is the best actor I've ever seen in Al-Adamson, and he plays a cult leader, as he means.
