Sheba Baby is always underestimated, most likely because he has a pg rating instead of the usual r rating that Greer receives. PG only means that Pam doesn't take off her top, she takes off her top in any other film she starred in, though so. it's more exciting than Coffey, more action. it slowly takes off, but by the time it appears on the screen, the thrill has already begun. like Dolemite d'urville martin is a hard attempt to get Sheba's father, but she doesn't have it. she wages the war of one woman against Martin and his squad. the best scene with a stupid pimp in his car, which I'm still laughing at. I thought it would be stupid because of the pg rating, but I was wrong, it replaces sex with violence in the movie about explosions, which can only be good!
