It was a pretty good film, which was generally made fairly well. The idea of ​​Mercy (will not spoil) was also original. I think Angelina did a good job as one of her first films. The only things that I scowled at were some of the banal scenes of struggle (won't spoil either). I liked the first movie, and I also liked it. 7/10
