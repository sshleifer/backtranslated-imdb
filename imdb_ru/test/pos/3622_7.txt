Spike Milligan's books and plays have won directors over the years, and Puckoon 2002, unfortunately, is no exception. The novel, created in 1924, concerns the division of Ireland, in particular, its influence on a solitary community (the name “Puckoon”). Due to a colossal mistake, half the village is now in Northern Ireland, and the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their way. Drinkers crowd like sardines in the corner of a pub to enjoy cheaper pints. The dead person must have a passport in his name before the villagers can get to the churchyard to bury him. <br /> <br /> Puckoon is a kind of Irish Under Milk Wood with comic characters and surreal events. abundance. The protagonist, Dan Milligan (renamed “Madigan” in the film), improvisedly plays Shawn Hughes and talks with the narrator (Richard Attenborough). Also in the film are Milo O'Shea, Griff Rhys Jones, David Kelly (from Robin's Nest), Freddie Jones, Joe McGann and Elliot Gould. <br /> <br /> Interview for Puckoon "Making of" Documentary, writer / director Terence Ryan expressed his undying admiration for the book. It shows on the screen. But, alas, as the ill-fated film Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a good book does not necessarily make a good movie. The problem with Puckoon is that, like the other Milligan books, they simply do not work on the big screen. “Puckoon” is, in fact, a collection of anecdotes in search of a plot. <br /> <br /> In no case can you compare the film with train wrecks like Sex Lives Of The Potato Men, Fat Slags and Lesbian Vampire Killers, but then it’s not as good as it should . The last half hour includes a lot of running from the police, the British army, some locals who hid explosives in a coffin, and it is really exhausting to sit. Ryan's decision to keep a close eye on the book is the main reason for his inability to work as a film. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the complete lack of charm. In Awakening Ned, it was on the peaks, while Father Ted was much funnier. Spike lived long enough to watch a movie, and apparently he liked it. His daughter Jane has a cameo in the role of Madigan's bride. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me was the quotation at the beginning: “I don’t mind death!” Spike said: “I just don’t know” I don’t want to be there when this happens!
