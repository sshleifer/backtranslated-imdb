ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> Blake French: <br /> <br /> “Rock Star” is a story about who does not become famous, just realize his dream is not the way he imagined it. We have seen it all before (in the best films), but this human story really captures the world of rock and roll with a rudely honest and insightful advantage. He collects recommendations because of his visualization of the atmosphere. The screenplay of Crazy / Beautiful director John Stockwell depicts a hardcore universe with memorable images — she doesn’t explain what she’s talking about, she shows us. <br /> <br /> “Rock Star” Mark Wahlberg, originally called “The Metal God”, is cast as Chris “Izzy” Cole, a Pittsburgh stationery seller who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers, an incendiary vocalist of heavy metal rock -groups Steel Dragon. Although Chris is already singing for his own rock band called “Bloody Pollution,” instead of writing his own songs, he insists on playing only Steel Dragon songs, and just the way they play them. His band becomes irritated by Chris's obsession and gives him a shoe. <br /> <br /> This devastates Chris, as well as his supporting parents and faithful girlfriend, Emily (Jennifer Aniston from Friends of TV). Then he gets a phone call. This is the Steel Dragon group. They have seen the recordings of Chris and want him to replace the recently dismissed vocalist. In an instant, Chris bursts into the giddy world of sudden glory - from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, this is not as useful as he expected. <br /> <br /> The true story inspired the Rock Star concept. Ohio supply seller, Tim "Ripper" Owens, did replace Rob Halford, Judas Priest vocalist, after singing for the tribute band. The rest of the film is probably fiction, although much of what is happening should reflect the experience of many other groups. The film describes in detail the various tests of a rock star. He explores aspects of touring, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, relationship struggles, sexual freedom, dishonesty, and producers' extreme measures to please fans and maintain high popularity. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the films of Mark Wahlberg, and this is the first thing that deserves my love. Wahlberg, a former singer / model, made films such as Fear, Boogie Nights, Three Kings and most recently Tim Planet’s remake Planet of the Apes. I start to admire the young actor more and more. Although he did not play in many successful films, he ventured and fulfilled many roles. "Rock Star" - his best film to date. I can not remember the many actors who could convincingly portray the struggle and aspirations of Chris Cole. Wahlberg really makes a rock star rock music. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston also highlights the screen. She creates a chemical relationship with Chris that causes audience participation. Tragic what happens to their relationship. We really care about these characters. <br /> <br /> During the cinema and concert scenes, director Stephen Herek (who also filmed “The Holy Man” and the live version of “101 Dalmatians”) creates an exciting atmosphere. He captures scenes with intense urgency and raw, unmistakable energy. Musical numbers give the film the best, most exciting scenes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Herek cannot support energy and interest in everything. At three-quarters, he loses the spark, because the film becomes boring and unpleasant. I understand where the story should go in order to portray the negative side of fame, but this film loses everything that it had before. In Almost Famous, a much better movie about rock and roll, there is a certain interest and life in even the saddest scenes. It seems that the filmmakers are losing their passion. <br /> <br /> The message comes too late and suddenly in history. The film turns into a tale of morality, which wants to give us juicy places. The filmmakers could also stop everything, appear on the screen and say: “Now the audience, the moral of the story?” We understand the topic, but it is too instant. Chris's personal discovery should be gradual. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all this is happening in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, hardly enough to completely destroy the whole eighty-five minutes is a good enough feature. Rock Star is not a good movie. See “Almost a Celebrity” if you want a great movie about rock and roll, but for Mark, Mark is a turning point in his career. <br /> <br />
