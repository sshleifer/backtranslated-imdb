The emperor and the assassin (with English subtitles) at 161 minutes are long, but the time is filled with a story that hardly fits into it. Palace scenes of golden hues and dusty yellow panoramas of Chinese landscapes foreshadow the true history of the uniting Chinese king around 300 BC. A complex plot with many turns played out with an excellent image of the actors. King Qinâ€™s simple desire to unite the Empire for his ordinary people is fulfilled, but not without betrayal, conspiracies and counter conspiracies and, oh, yes, tel. Many tel. This epic story of China is a great way for Westerners to see a little-known Asian history. The legacy of the emperor Qin includes thousands of life-sized terracotta figures, which are still excavated today. As a historical character, this film makes it clear that Emperor Qing should be viewed alongside George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar to name some of the greatest conquerors / statesmen in the world. I highly recommend seeing the Emperor and the Assassin, especially on the big screen.
