This was the third time I tried to watch this movie. The previous two times I found the beginning so disgustingly sweet and “black” that I just stopped watching. However, now that I'm a little older and more obsessive, I forced myself to watch the whole movie, and I was very surprised to see that I really liked it. So, I’m watching a movie about as I’m looking at swimming in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees (that's about 21-22 degrees Celsius for all those who love metrics). Of course, at first the water is terribly cold and shocking, but if you force yourself to stay in the water, you will get used to it - so resist this desire to jump out right now !! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a lengthy exchange between Flynn and his daughter, performed by spoiled Patty Brady. Someone may find there very nice and lovely conversations, and it may seem to others that they are difficult to perceive, since these moments are damn nice! In a sense, it was Flynn’s amazing game, because it’s hard to imagine him in real life when he has children or he plays at home, especially because he wanted to be faithful to one woman in this film - now IT’s DO !! NEVER TALK about the divorced couple Flynn and Parker and their mutual desire to remarry. Since they both love each other as well as their depraved child, it seems that it is predetermined that they will tie the bonds again. However, some serious problems stand in their way: Lucille Watson (who plays her usual, hardy and controlling mother-in-law), Flynn's girlfriend (after all, he is Errol Flynn, and he is divorced, so you should expect him to have a girlfriend SOMEWHERE) and marine (performed by Forrest Tucker). <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, all this will work towards the end, and everyone will live happily ever after. However, despite the fact that it is formal and predictable, the film is a winner because it’s so fun to watch. Flynn, despite his reputation as an action adventure hero, is very good at the comedy novel, and watching him is a lot of fun. In addition, the film has the script Cuddles Sakall forever chewing - it's just damn nice and sweet that it's perfect in this type of film. And, despite the sweetness, the film is pretty well written. The bottom line is that the movie is “Funny.” <br /> <br /> I therefore recommend that you watch this movie and force yourself not to experience the disgusting sweet aspects of the movie. Once you get this done, the rest of the movie is a picture that is worth your time.
