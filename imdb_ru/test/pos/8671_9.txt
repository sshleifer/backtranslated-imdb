Andreas arrives in a strange, inhuman place where everything seems perfect. He was given a good job, everyone is kind to him and to everyone, and he really doesnâ€™t worry too much, even finding a beautiful girl. But in this nameless city, Andreas soon discovers that the ideal world, like advertising, is not really paradise. Indeed one of the best films I have seen this year. An attractive plot is perfectly supported by a sensible direction in which each individual component (cold, unsaturated photo; cold, symmetrical design; unemotional action; slow, strictly controlled camera movements) helps to create a unique strange atmosphere that keeps the audience to the end. A sarcastic, ironic, bitter comedy that made me laugh and think how only the best films can. Nothing new, probably, in the analysis of the modern civilization of the dehumanizer, but really clever work with wonderful amazing ideas that are unlikely to be forgotten, from whom it was lucky to see it. Just a beautiful scene on the subway.
