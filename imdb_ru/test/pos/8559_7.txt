H.O.T.S. not for those who want hardcore porn. Instead, this film is the forerunner of many cult classic college / fraternity films from the 1980s, such as Revenge of the Northerners and Porky, and a post-cursor to the world famous animal house. A good time if you dig a lot of big boobs like Playboy from the 70s and 80s and a funny comedy scene - but nothing special if you want to use it as shock material ... <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. This is an "unauthorized" club of sexual outcasts, fighting with popular and fashionable girls, pi. It has a joke, Aunt Jemima’s housekeeper, and even an overheated robot that makes it relatively amusing to see if boobs are your “thing” ... <br /> <br /> Well ... I like boobs as much (or perhaps more ...), like the next guy - but, despite all the scruffy cries I saw, I couldn't help but wish for some hard scenes to make this scene really worthwhile. I knew that this would not happen, but I still want H.O.T.S. had a little more sex and a little less cheese. Not as remarkable as NERDS, PORKY'S or ANIMAL HOUSE, but fans of these types of films are worth seeing ... 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS .. and I forgot - it has an excellent shower Danny Bonaduce, probably in a better role in his career outside of his "reality show" ...
