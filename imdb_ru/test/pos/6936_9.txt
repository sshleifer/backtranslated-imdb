Well, I received the DVD last week, and I was finally able to publish my reviews, but I certainly enjoyed this sequel. <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the Undead. OK. There is a quick clip in this movie, it has really good blood effects, as well as a really well-made atmosphere and style. In fact, I would say that this may be one of the most stylish DV films I bought. Most of the time, I’m pretty mad at DV movies for being boring and looking like TV shows. Even a film like Bone Disease that I like has an incredible length. Not this movie. It never stops long enough for you to catch your breath. Although I would not say that I liked it more than in the first film, I would say that “Sheets”, of course, have technically improved over the two years between the films. It has better blood, inevitable scenes of feeding zombies, scumbag heroes, and several returning actors (although their roles are different), mainly Jerry Angell as a pretty good psychopath with a mullet killer from hell. The shots are more ambitious this time than the script, because you can say that Sheets is trying to do more than he did in the first film. Some of them work, and some do not, but I must say that, at least, he did not just try to make an enlarged version of the first film. This time there was no mention of a chemical spill station, only Satanism and the occult, which brings undead back to life. Therefore, I am grateful to Mr. Sheets for trying to do something else with this. I give this movie two damn thumbs up!
