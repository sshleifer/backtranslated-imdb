This is a very, very strange film ... so strange that it is best to watch it yourself. The film begins with the fact that the exhausted professor talks about his class, because students have the courage not to be as incredibly brilliant as he! You can very quickly say that this person is a complete cynic - he finds value practically in that he adheres to his inner sense of self-worth. In addition, he looks tired and bored of the monotony of life. <br /> <br /> Later in the film, he goes to bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head. Oddly enough, it was only halfway through the film, and what followed was a very strange story about the last seconds of his life. At this point, the film becomes exciting, because the style of the story is similar to one of the novels of this professor of literature, which is written with the mind and says what we want so that we can all say them. <br /> <br /> Watch this strange film - it is surprisingly irresistible and not like everything I've ever seen.
