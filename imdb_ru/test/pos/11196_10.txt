This is one of the best films of all time, and everyone should be aware of this film. I am a Turkish boy and very fond of cinema. and nowadays our film industry is gaining momentum. And UZAK is the best Turkish film of the last ten years. And maybe one of the best movies of all time. Directed by Nuri Bilge Cheilan - it's just awesome. He is a director of minimalism and talks about everyday family events, dreams, expectations, and life. Talks about you, talks about me, talks about us. I promise that in this film you will find a piece of your body. director he is waiting to understand. I promise you will like this movie, please watch it.
