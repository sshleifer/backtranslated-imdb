A very good film about anti-Semitism at the end of the Second World War. The scene that really speaks loudly about the ignorance of these people is a meeting in the church when the priest speaks against "international counterfeiters and communists." It sounds surprising, like the speeches that Adolf Hitler used to kill his peopleâ€™s throats, but none of those present at the meeting seemed to make such a comparison.
