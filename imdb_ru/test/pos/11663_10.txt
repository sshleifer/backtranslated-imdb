it was very sensitive, very deep. This is my favorite movie when you can't watch a movie deeper than this incredible movie. Susan Sarandon played her role as an actress of a mature mind, and she realized her role. She deserves a reward. She convinced me that I was a nun. The music was very impressive and sensitive. I really liked this deep masterpiece.
