This is one of the best films I have seen in recent years. I took me to a new time and place. As if I was with Ray through his many trials and triumphs. Jamie Foxx turned into Ray. During the film, he was Ray. In addition, Kerry Washington, Sharon Robinson and Regina King were great. The film was well played and directed, the music was fantastic. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie four (4) times with different people, and the last time was just as enjoyable as the first time. I will buy a DVD as soon as it is released. This is a film that can be watched over and over again over the years. <br /> <br /> Thanks for the great experience.
