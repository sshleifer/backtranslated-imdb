Most of Chaplin’s most famous films are his full-length films. And, I suppose, most people at best saw only a few of his videos from his previous films, in which he starred in dozens and dozens of comedic shorts. This is truly a shame, as some great shorts are largely awaiting discovery in the world in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> If someone watches this movie, he has a great chance to see some of Chaplin’s best shorts. because Chaplin himself chose these three shorts and tied them together with a small amount of narration to make this 1959 feature film. This is great for several reasons. First, in the earliest films of Chaplin of 1914-1915, his character “The Vagabond” is still in the earliest incarnations or is completely absent. In addition, even when he was there, he was often mean-spirited and selfish - something very alien from Little Tramp, whom we loved. Secondly, because the selected shorts were in excellent condition, if you watch this movie, you do not need to worry about watching a spiky movie with spaces and lousy music that does not fit the action (common problem). /> <br /> So, to have a great look at Chaplin's shorts in all their glory, give this film a chance. This is sure to provide you a great laugh.
