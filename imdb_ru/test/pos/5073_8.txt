The cast draws a crowd in the theater, despite the sinister title. Jake Gyllenhaal persuaded Conan O'Brien to promote the film and explained that the “performance” is a euphemism for torture. Since September 11, “emergency extradition” has allowed the government intelligence service to unconditionally pull people out and use any means necessary to share information. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaal plays a rookie of CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (note irony)) who is torn due to his appointment, which makes him a simple observer of unorthodox interrogation procedures in an underground detention facility outside of the United States. <br /> <br /> Omar Metvalli plays the terrorist suspect Anwar El Ibrahimi, an Egyptian citizen and husband carrying a green card, the American Isabella Fields El Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon). Isabella and her son are waiting for Anwar to return from a scientific conference, when he suddenly disappears from the plane’s passenger manifest. She seeks help from her college friend, who works in the government, and finds out that behind all this is the head of intelligence Corrin Whitman (Meryl Streep). <br /> <br /> The director of the film is Hollywood rookie Gavin Hood (who is going to make X-Men Origins: Wolverine), and this begs the question of whether such an “extraordinary performance” takes place in real life. The film was released locally after the explosion of Gloriette (bombing / accident?), And the key scene in the film is when the bomb explodes in a public square, so it must have caused a chill to every viewer. The vision of an exploding table with a single red-yellow sign Aajala (Ayala?) In the upper right of the screen, as well as the effect of silence and slow-moving images reinforced the effect of real scene coincidence. <br /> <br /> Lessons can be learned from this film, and it all comes down to personal decisions that we make daily. We all have choices that we can make at will, and we often don’t always (don’t want) to see how they affect others who may be unfortunate victims of circumstances. What is a “great blessing” should not be a forced choice that our leaders should make if each of us has already correctly decided on the source. This is a utopia worth building.
