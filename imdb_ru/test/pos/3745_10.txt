Before I talk about the end of this film, I will talk about the plot. Some dude named Gerald breaks the engagement with Kitty and escapes to Craven Castle in Scotland. In a few months, Kitty and her aunt go to Scottland. Arriving at Craven Castle, Kitty discovers that Gerald is old and more angry. Gerald has certain rules for the castle (the rules have been the same for 200 years). Gerald does not want them to stay, but Kitty insists on staying defensive. One night, her aunt caught a glimpse of a monster running down the corridor. She is so frightened that she loses consciousness, and (another excuse) they have to stay longer. Kitty becomes more worried about Gerald after she tries to enter the maze, but Gerald catches her and even more angry with her. Then Kitty sends reinforcements, she calls their doctor, who is actually their friend and his wide. Then, so that things don't look suspicious, they invite a couple of other friends (who actually do nothing). Blah, blah, blah Kitty and her aunt find themselves in a maze, where the tensest story is. They are somehow separated and trying to find each other. But aunt stumbles upon a creature ... this is the moment we all waited for, what kind of creature is hidden in the shadows? ... this is a giant frog !!! OMG, what's better than that! Seeing my aunt, the frog literally goes crazy and runs away, oh, I mean jumping up the stairs to the top of the castle. Then the frog jumps out of the open window. Then we take a picture from the ground and see a frog with bile to us (oh yeah, this film was in 3D). But you want to know what's funny, the frog that falls out of the window is actually a toy, because it's 1/10 the size of a frog before it jumps. Then it turns out that it is the fault of all evolutions, blah, blah and Kitty and Gerald are getting married. Then the last snapshot of this masterpiece is the grave of a frog in a maze, the only place where he was really happy;).
