In this film, one of the best club scenes, a very good soundtrack (if you like techno / trance music). <br /> <br /> Some situations (when the protagonist, for example, Karl begins to take drugs), are a little untrue. , but the plot is interesting, but all the characters are a bit superficial ... <br /> <br /> I wouldn’t advise you to watch this movie if you don’t like techno music <br /> <br /> For the plot / acting one this film is 4/10, with really cool special effects, club scenes and a soundtrack 7/10, but if you want to go to the movies, just listen to nice tracks and a little club feeling, this is 10/10. <br /> <br /> special effects are sometimes hidden, sometimes clearly visible. (i.e. fast moving clouds / sun / moon, background with morphine, morphs) <br /> <br /> I, for example, really liked it, it’s a pity that there was no dance floor in the cinema;)
