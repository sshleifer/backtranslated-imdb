The first of the Italian robberies of the French soft porn blockbuster (although it may be interesting to note that the country has actually received the first form download with Cesar Canevari in 1968 I.O., Emmanuel starring Erica Blanc) is very different calico than the mucous sequels provided by the deceased , doubtfully the great Joe D'Amato. In its spirit, it is much closer to the film “Just Jaeckin” of 1973, which is now very outdated. It deals with the relationship between a man and a woman in different ways, such hot topics as loyalty and jealousy are put in a luxurious exotic setting. Unlike D'Amato, director Albert Thomas (aka Adalberto Albertini, who also made it difficult to find YELLOW EMANUEL, is actually the sexy version of MADAME BUTTERFLY!) Doesn’t represent predatory drug lords, directors of smelling films or rampaging cannibals, creating for us, apparently less sensational, but much more erotic viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Photojournalist May Jordan, also known as Emanuel (lovely born in Java, Laura Gemser in her first leading role, playing the role of Thai masseuse in EMMANUELLE) 2 and “unspoiled native” in the part of Justin, which rarely can be seen in the prestige collection, flies to Nairobi, where she takes shots accompanying the article by the famous British writer Anna, played by the Teutonic herself Karin Schubert with a tight haircut. some used to. Anne shares an “open relationship” (remember when it was done) with her Italian husband, Gianni (Angelo Infanti), which means that both are largely jumping with a throb. Contrary to her subsequent reputation, Emanuel looks clearly restrained compared to her heavy breathing masters, seductively smoldering in Gianni as a prelude, until she gets an exquisitely painful return. Okay, she will finally fill this recklessness when a whole men's hockey team plays on the train. I am not kidding. <br /> <br /> The production of this classic sex game is quite impressive, especially great cinematography. And Niko Fidenko’s musical theme is an unconditional favorite of anyone who is interested not only in a fleeting interest in the genre, but also in a fun pop song Eurotrash (try to understand these completely meaningless lyrics and enjoy family evening!) type of performance - from slow and sexy disco to trendy disco. <br /> <br /> Although this is completely Lau Gemzer show. Announced simply as “Emanuel” (like the other actress in the elusive “Emanuel Nera 2” by the same director), she lights the screen from beginning to end. Not yet subjected to endless scenarios of rape (as she would be when D'Amato takes possession), she seems much more relaxed than in later films, even smiling from time to time, which is a rare case when anyone who has seen some work lady sure knows. Immaculate Eurasian, not because the name suggests black beauty (she hails from Dutch India, now Indonesia, and in fact is quite close in appearance to the supposed author of the novel Emmanuel Arsan), she projects a slightly passive, even submissive sensuality, which somehow she breaks off in a way from the "debauchery" that her morally corrupted cohorts indulge in. Unlike the French film, Cheapskate's moral lesson is reduced to a minimum, almost like a background, close to the end of the film, when Emanuel tells Gianni that he has not lost her as he has ever been obsessed with for the beginning. I swear, you could hear viewers of the Just Jaeckin version moaning every time an extremely annoying Mario Allen Cooney appeared on the screen, because it meant that we were too much time libertine midfielder, philosophizing as an alibi to get divine Sylvia Christel (now living in the capital of Belgium, Brussels, by the way ...) to undress, the real reasons why theaters were packed for years in a row. Gemzer’s later husband, Gabriele Tinti (now deceased, she remarried), shows off as a constantly drunk “Scottish” (yes?) Writer who at some point briefly imposes Emanuel among African ruins, but no real sexual scenes though.
