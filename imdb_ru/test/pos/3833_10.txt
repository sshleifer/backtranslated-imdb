Despite all the hype about the episode "PROBLEM WITH TRIBLES", "Balance TERROR" may simply be the best episode of the series. And, although I have always loved the PART OF ACTION, because itâ€™s so fun, I really need to give my vote for this Romulan episode as the best one. <br /> <br /> The film is quite interesting. It really looks like a film about a submarine from World War II, as it jumps back and forth between a disguised Romulan ship and the Enterprise, trying to destroy the Romulans before they go back. through the neutral zone after the raid on Federation outposts. In many ways, the show is very similar to the film ENEMY BELOW, where the American captain (Robert Mitchum) and the German captain (Kurt Jurgens) are shown in counterpoint, as they both try to outwit the other - and in the process develop reluctant respect for their enemy. <br /> <br /> Interestingly enough, only a short episode of the beginning of the episode takes place on the planet - and this is surprising, because the episode on board the ship could easily have been static and boring. But because the letter was so fantastic, and the main characters were written and acted so well (Shatner and Mark Leonard as the leader of the Romulans). Strangely enough, for the unshakable Trekkers, they recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played the father of Spock. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is just a great and extremely interesting episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
