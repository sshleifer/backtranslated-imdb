“Evil Ed” is a Swedish film about a man named Ed (of course), and his downfall turned into complete madness after editing the horror film series “B”, known as “Free Limbs”. Ed becomes so insane that he thinks he sees demons and monsters, but in reality these are people he knows, and people close to him, such as his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I first saw this film in 1998 and was confused by what I saw. To this day, this film, I think one of the darkest comedies. Since the movie is almost funny with its bloody scenes, there are still a few creepy moments. <br /> <br /> This is a cool movie, but don't expect anything surprising. It's just a fun movie that is nice to show some friends for a laugh. 8/10 stars
