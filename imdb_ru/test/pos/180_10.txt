Here is a film about adventure, determination, heroism and courage. In addition, it was installed in the late 1800s, which makes it even more interesting. This is a wonderful adventurous storyline, and Alyssa Milano superbly plays a useful, confident, not vain Fizzi ... an excellent role model. This is one of my favorite movies. This is a movie that you need to watch again and again, and it will no doubt inspire you and enrich your life. Not only is the storyline excellent, but the film also has incredible landscapes and music and is wonderfully directed. This film is as good as gold!
