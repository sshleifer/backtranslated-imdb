I heard about John Garfield, but did not know him. I like this movie. I have never heard of it. I just took it by chance. John Garfield - a boxer in the film. He was in real life, so he knew his role. He was a fugitive throughout the film. Someone else killed a man. He character was accused. He made friends with a family that has questions and is not quite sure what to do with it. All kinds of minor plots. My favorite was the scary bathing scene in the water tower, where the water was deep and one Dead End Kid couldn't swim, and none of them could get the out.John symbol saves the day. Dead End Kids were great both his friends and followers. One of them until the very end. Ann Sheridan played the daughter of the family and the possible love interest of John. It was believable, but, in my opinion, not attractive - the only weak link in the film.
