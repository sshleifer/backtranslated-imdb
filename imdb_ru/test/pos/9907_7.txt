Sometimes the movie is so bad that it's kind of good. This film was made in Germany and dubbed in English, so you have to go through it. In addition, acting was unnatural and forced, in addition to what the real rats did, which IMO did an excellent job with. Binds to a rat debater. Anyway, the mayor of the city decided to cut costs, and local garbage collectors went on strike as a result, leaving large piles of garbage everywhere. This storyline was used previously, not to mention what happened in real life (unfortunately, too often), and the audience does not expect any surprises. But it normal. We know what will happen and when, and sometimes the audience needs a film that does not need a lot of brain cells. We have our hero, down to the chiseled face and body, half-hero (heroes) and, of course, our heroine, who turns out to be a doctor, but only still trains, although she discovers what happens when so many people fall ill and die not just a rat bite. Of course, the villain must die (well, all the villains, referring to the rats), and the final scene is one of those that reminds viewers that the sequel is in the works. This is one of those films that you just sit and enjoy what it is and what it is not.
