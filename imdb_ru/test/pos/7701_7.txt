The man and his wife do not get along because of the jealousy of his wife and problems with alcohol. When the wife disappears, her sister begins an energetic search with the participation of the local police, the state government and the television crime. What she finds out is stunning for the whole community. Good drama with lots of great performances; based on a true story.
