This is a multifaceted, insightful and bold story about people in the life of a schizophrenic patient, their (and our) perceptions and realities. Although the main theme revolves around a delusional young woman, the story delights wonderfully with physics, medicine, religion, and even politics, because it challenges our perception of what is true and what is real. Konkona Sensharma perfectly conveys that the world in which Mitya lives is just as real for her as it is for us. In this world, she is logical, and her thoughts are internally consistent, and not the kind of nonsense that seems to us in our world. <br /> <br /> Here are some outstanding scenes that are worth watching while watching a movie (don't worry, these are not spoilers). I really liked how Aparna Sen wove these comments into the story. <br /> <br /> - References to quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity mingled with the fact that the healer (Oja in Hindi) performs his religious rituals in which he believes. banish the "ghosts" sitting in Mitya's brain. <br /> <br /> - The doctor prescribes shock treatment as a solution that is believed to work. <br /> <br /> - Window of perception. - Scene about book review Anu. <br /> <br /> - A hint of illusion in a conversation about a director looking for "maya." <br /> <br /> - George Bush’s newsfeed telling the world that he “has no doubt” that there is WMD in Iraq (now there’s not much about Bush’s perception, which I suspect , they knew the truth, as the credulous public perceives WMD in Iraq.) <br /> <br /> - One of the best scenes in the film is where Miti says to Anu "Charu sent this man to beat me" and Anu rejects its like a matter of course. Concona did a fantastic job, revealing a strange mixture of confused thoughts in a schizophrenic brain when her world and the real world collide. <br /> <br /> Aparna Sen was brave, but not brave enough to pose one big question: Is almost all of humanity delusional believing in God? She could insert several scenes about “normal”, “healthy” people praying and sacrificing a creature that no one has ever seen or heard in human history (the ritual / exorcism scene does not go far enough). That would be the main question: what is normal? Who is the truth, a believer or an atheist? <br /> <br /> IMHO, this film is a much more complex study of the schizophrenic mind than "Beautiful Mind." He looks at the minds of not only the sick, but also a healthy person, and he does this from different points of view and illuminates our understanding of our own mind and our world. If the first one got 4 Oscars, it deserves more - at least one per story, script, direction, Concon and Shaban Azmi. Watching this movie was really fun, and I'm glad I bought a DVD for my collection. <br /> <br /> This is a really very well told story.
