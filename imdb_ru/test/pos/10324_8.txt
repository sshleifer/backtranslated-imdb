Clyde Brookman borrows the premise of this short plot from Buster Keaton's “Seven Chances”, recently dimmed as “The Bachelor.” In the original, Buster has 24 hours to get married, to inherit a large amount of money. In this version, the music teacher, Professor Schempe, has only 7 hours (after all, this is short!). It’s one of Stooges ’best shorts thanks to its storyline and wonderful procedures (including the phone booth scene with Mo and Shemp, reminiscent of La Quarters Laurel and Hardy and the famous Marx Brothers cabin scene at Night At The Opera routine.) I'm not a big Stooges fan, but any comedy student should point out that this is one of the best of them since the early 30s.
