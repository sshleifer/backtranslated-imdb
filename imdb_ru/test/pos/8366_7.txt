Shuai is a sturdy and awkward young Beijinger with a punk haircut who makes a living selling cheap books from a tent in the covered market. He seems to have nothing to do with the agile, middle-aged potential intellectual, Zhang, and yet the two of them will end up in a restaurant discussing the pros and cons of the murder (perhaps the Chinese name is better translated as “Talk It Over”). If, because of this, it sounds like a pedestrian, do not mislead him: this film is richly inventive in its plot, and mostly rushes at breakneck speed (although the tempo really comes to a very bad end). <br /> <br /> If you know only worthy of Zhang Yimou's worthy historical dramas, such as Raise the Red Lantern and the Shanghai Triad, or his later martial arts epic The Hero and the House of Flying Daggers, you will be amazed ; in fact, whichever of his other films you see, you will be surprised, pleasantly surprised - this is undoubtedly his most original, most bizarre, most experimental work. It was filmed for several weeks with a minimum budget, almost entirely on the spot in Beijing (and using many of the usual Beijinger in smaller supporting roles - even the director was a passing cameo), and mostly with a hand held camera in the sharp, hyperkinetic style that is millions of miles away from the elegant formalism of his most famous films. <br /> <br /> OK, I live in Beijing, so I find additional delight in all the bizarre little details of everyday life that I begin to learn and enjoy (even though it was shot in 97, and here everything is changing so quickly), but I really think that anyone can appreciate this film. I have seen this, like many other Chinese “comedies,” in a movie club that shows off the latest Chinese subtitled films for almost exclusively foreign audiences; and this is the only one that I can remember when the public laughed out loud. To some non-Chinese viewers, this may seem too strange, sometimes a little inconvenient, because it involves some violence and, after opening in the form of a fresh, unusual romantic comedy, turns into something darker in the second half. This, however, is very, very funny. <br /> <br /> He is also superbly acted on by two main characters, especially longtime collaborator Zhang Yimou Jiang Wen, who is probably the main movie star of mainland China and has a thoughtful opinion. The presence on the screen resembles a young Depardieu or De Niro. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie - to prove that the Chinese have a sense of humor that CAN translate to other cultures, to prove that Zhang Yimou is much, much more than a pony with one trick ... and for a good time.
