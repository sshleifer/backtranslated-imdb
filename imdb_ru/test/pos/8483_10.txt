Jamie Foxx did an incredible job playing Ray Charles. I liked this film, because very often there were scenes of memories, and then the current film. When Ray Charles was small, he went blind, and his mother did not give birth to him. She was a strong woman who did not treat him differently because he was blind. She forced him to do everything on their own, and this really pushed him to become a great musician in later life. His mother also sent him to school. Then, when Ray Charles became a man, he could stand up for himself and take care of himself, but there was a fall in drugs, sex and betrayal. When something discourages me, I can remember this film, and it will inspire me.
