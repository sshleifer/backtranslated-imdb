This first Disney animated film without the active participation of Disney itself, this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (this, I suppose, is the only Disney animated film from the 1940s that is NOT based on an earlier book or other work, but it is rather an original story). As others have noted, the plot is a cross between the novel “The Lady and the Tramp” and the story of the abduction / return home in 101 Dalmatians. <br /> <br /> But in order to overcome this drawback, the filmmakers have successfully used many of the best features of most Disney animation films from the previous 10-15 years: Phil Harris (from The Jungle Book) voiced one of the main characters, follows his duet with Louis Primo in the previous film with another here with Scatman Crothers, the qualitative appearance of this film is actually transferred from the "Dalmatians" (apparently with some good bows to French impressionism), and the villain here (the butler) also strongly resembles chests in this film. (This is probably one of Disney's most memorable villains.) The main story is about cats and the continuing difficulties of a butler with two village hounds dogs (with the great voice acting of Pat Buttram and George "Huber" Lindsay "). Various animal characters are similarly familiar to those I saw “Rogue” and “Dalmatian.” The owner of the cat, although it has a striking visual resemblance to an evil stepmother in Sleeping Beauty, does not have any unpleasant features of this character and does not look very warm and generous. <br /> <br / > The true power of phil Imagine voice: after we first turned to the most familiar actors from The Jungle Book, this tactic was continued here with Disney veterans Harris and Sterling Holloway from The Jungle Book and Eva Gabor (who would play a very similar character in a later the film “Rescuers”), as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp. Here everything is great, especially Harris and Gabor are starring. <br /> <br /> Small children may be upset by several short episodes (escaping from the track of a high-speed train, almost drowning one of the children), but they are not presented in a particularly frightening or grim way and end very quickly. In general, there are very few such frightening scenes that are found in many other Disney classics. <br /> <br /> One small oddity is that some of the visual aspects of the 60s culture are depicted among jazz cats, presumably in 1910. Paris; One can not wonder why this story was not clearly stated in the present, except that Paris has greatly changed its appearance over the past time. It would really make more sense. <br /> <br /> Songs, although pleasant, and sometimes very pleasant, are not particularly memorable. Nevertheless, the total energy used here, the excellent voice and excellent animation - all this helps to overcome the relatively few and minor flaws. Far from the greatness of the classic "10", such as Pinocchio or Aladdin, and not quite up to "9", which could be given to Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, these are probably quite minor 8 out of 10; maybe 7.
