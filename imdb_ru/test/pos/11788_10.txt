Aah, yes, the training was great. Not only did many women come in shape, but many teenage boys also received excellent training. I'm not saying that the show was in any way suitable for family viewing, but if you watch other works from the producer of the show, you will find more adult themes in his works that are also excellent. Many viewers were looking forward to the show, and men and women all received good information and a wonderful release from training. The girls were beautiful, and Beautiful, a classic show and should succeed in syndication. The show must go on, as there are never enough options to watch when it comes to health and beauty.
