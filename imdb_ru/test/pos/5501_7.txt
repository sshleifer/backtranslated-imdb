Written by the brilliant television screenwriters Monkees Gerald Gardner and Di Caruso, the film “Which Way to the Front” was the last film from “Jerry Lewis” to “Hard Working” almost a decade later. Jerry's comedy has obviously acquired a taste, and admittedly he can sometimes be his own worst enemy when he directs as a producer / director - but even in his darkest films there are always moments of brilliance. <br /> <br /> WHICH WAY manages to be funny, interesting and, yes, quite funny. This is something unlike any of the typical Lewis films. The pace is very optimistic, and there are many excellent supporting players - a kind of Jerry Hogans Heroes. It all looks like an unsold television pilot, and you either love it or hate --- but I hope you laugh
