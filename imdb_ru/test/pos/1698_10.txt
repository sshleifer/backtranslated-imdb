Today is the full moon? OH! It doesnâ€™t matter that they can change whenever they want, because this drug! What was I thinking, if today is the full moon ?! Geez <br /> <br /> I really like this film, which has romance, suspense, horrors and hot things;) I like the first half of the film when a guy saves a girl from suicide by jumping from a bungee and catches her cool. Customize this movie in the city of love, which is Paris in France. The scenes in the cemetery are good, it gives you a chill, not knowing what will happen there or who is behind the walls. The scenes that make you jump out of your seat are really cool. Even they got me on these scenes. His friend, who died and the girl he killed in the cemetery, but still shows himself to be the leading character (sorry, I forgot his name), was really funny. The actors did a good job, plus a makeup team. Part of it, when they all have parties in an abandoned church, I cannot believe that people would do that, because, although it is an abandoned church, it is still God's house. I bought this film a long time ago, and I do not regret buying it. I am a horror movie lover. I give this film 5 stars out of 6. For people who are open and love these kind of films, try, you might like it.
