I thought it was a beautiful film - very brave. Such beautiful images - and I liked the use of broken glasses with applause. Also, the way the best friend repeated the phrase about “... and she is a year older than me ...” showed that their friendship was kindled and grew, but maybe there was some kind of competition left ... I liked the shots, in which the hands feel the fabric. The dance concert was beautiful. The beginning seemed slow, though ... it took some time to feel the characters - the husband could be more offensive - he just seemed absent, so when other characters were talking about him - this was not very appropriate. The case by the way. the best friend and husband seemed random ... the doctors' meeting seemed to hint that there was not much time left (to live ...), so when infidelity was revealed, I did not feel so much sympathy for the character — more like a relief! the end was so great - the lines by the way. she and her husband, and the scene where she stopped, is gorgeous!
