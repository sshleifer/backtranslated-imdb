Anyone who has ever doubted Ingrid Bergman’s ability to play comedy should look only at St. Mary’s Bell. So, she is a nun with tuberculosis, who is probably in love with Fr. O'Malley, (think what Luis Bunuel could do about it), but she also showed a surprisingly tricky sense of fun that made you hope that the directors would shoot it more often in comedies. In the film Cactus Flower, she is a nurse of a starched dentist (Walter Mattau is a dentist), in love with her boss, but keeping him on buttons. When she is forced to play the role of his "wife" to deceive his mistress, (do not ask), she lets go, and the buttons burst. And she joyfully contemplate. <br /> <br /> The film itself is heavier than usual on the Broadway hit screen (you can see that these are three acts). This is a French farce (originally it was taken from the play “Fleur de Cactas” by Pierre Barile and Jean-Pierre Grady), and it falls into all the right places. Matthau uses her gorgeous squat expression for a wonderful effect, and the charming blonde rookie she was then named Goldie Hawn almost steals the film as a dizzy lover who decides to give up her meal ticket because she wishes "Even if the" wife "has the ball. Hawn made such an impression on her that what she stole was an Oscar award for best supporting actress.
