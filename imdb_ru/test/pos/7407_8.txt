If you're a little interested in the interstate war, this movie is worth a look. This is a great historical story. No breaking sabers, no cavalry attacks, no slaughter - just a story about a sad group of Union soldiers stumbling on the Confederate woman’s farm and her son and picking up as much as their captain’s conscience allows. This value moves up and down as events unfold, affecting his sense of humanity in conflict with his sense of duty to his people and his work. Ultimately, he reaches a compromise that any of us will be hard to put on top of. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the historical attitude towards the war in Kentucky, a slave-owning state that tried to maintain neutrality, but ultimately decided to remain in the Union under mysterious political circumstances related to the detention of some lawmakers. Approximately half of the Kentucky soldiers fought for each side, but there was never a special relationship to what it was like to live there at that time. This film makes a great contribution simply to the "appearance" of time and place.
