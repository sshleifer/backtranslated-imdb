This is a great and in many ways impressive film. I saw it on TV, like a little boy, with my throat almost stifled with tears, and again today on the superbly restored Criterion DVD. <br /> <br /> “Cranes” is the essence of War Weepie. Imagine Cherbourg umbrellas without music and color or Waterloo Bridge without class consciousness. <br /> <br /> Tatyana Samoilova, a mixture of Vivien Leigh and Björk, is very impressive, like a pretty girl whose fiancé enters and cleans, don’t write and don’t come back. <br /> <br /> Groom Boris dies ahead, and his death scene is indescribably romantic. Very brave, because so close to "over the top." But this scene will stay with you. <br /> <br /> Although the Soviets were so defined in World War II, the film is rather vague and more powerful for it. The pre-war and post-war scenes have a very sensation of 1957. There is no attempt to detail the period. The entire film is becoming more and more stylized, right up to the Siberian scenes that resemble modern opera productions (this is a compliment). The final catharsis scene reached the last drop - there again, comparable to Cherbourg. Production seems like a big budget (those scenes of the stairs must have cost quite a penny). <br /> <br /> Go for it. Do not wait for the bitter socialist pill (although it is, of course, very sad). Flying cranes - an impressive piece of world cinema, quite advanced, considering where and when it was made.
