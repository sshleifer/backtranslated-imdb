Hello! I went to this film without any expectations, although I knew that Maniratnam would have given a great movie! I was stunned !! The background is the struggle between the Tamils ​​who settled in Sri Lanka and the government. The story of how a young girl Amudha, who lives with her adoptive parents in Chennai, India, goes to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The culmination of the film are the performances of each actor and actress and, of course, cinematography, editing and all other technical details. Full point for cast and film crew. I have to mention cinema because it brings out the war in such a way that you feel there. Excellent work! Although the episodes of the war reminded me of Saving Private Ryan, such work was never undertaken on the Indian screen. Overall, the film is great! And hats off to Mr. Maniratnam. <br /> <br /> Mani Ratnam once again proved that he is a director who can lift Indian cinema to great heights! I would love to watch this movie again and again. Great movie and a must see.
