Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's best films. He turns into a wonderful performance as the title character. This is a novel against the background of a worn ragged island. The character of John Herth gives his daughter, who played beautifully Penelope Cruz, some honest love advice. This film is not to blame for the fact that it is completely predictable. This film also allows Cruz to become a strong woman who knows her mind and heart. When a movie goes beyond the introductory part, this movie will force you to focus on it. And again Nicolas Cage did not disappoint.
