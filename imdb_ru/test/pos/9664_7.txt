This is not a bad movie, but the action and the script can be better. I like this movie because I have a life that is pretty much like the one in the movie. It is difficult for the lost generation to live life in Romania, and 90 percent of us choose something else, and this includes communicating with people with “bad habits” if you understand me, but this is related to the territory. This film represents me, and I like it. I have a rage in me that I talk to people, I live in a tangled society, and I cannot fit in, and I don’t want to, and this is also a movie story, if I like you, you can understand a true movie, if not, You will find it easy and cheap.
