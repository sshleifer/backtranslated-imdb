I'm a fan of 80s B films, in which the hero is a little bad guy, a strong man who finds love - and this film delivers! how Sharkey will not be killed (and he does not tolerate beating! Really depicted, I believe). However, he does, and this is not through some excessive Die Hard stunt. The team “past him”, with which he works, unites, hence the name. His team - all the characters - people on the sidelines at work, because they do not quite match. These images are funny and responsive - they have a real feeling for them. They are against the ice killer, with a good own team. The result was a great film noir.
