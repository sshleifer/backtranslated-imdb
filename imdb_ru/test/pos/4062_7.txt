Like many of today's films are to blame, the plot is not quite stellar, the film does not touch anyone, and, of course, it does not deserve any reward (perhaps with the exception of blockbusters) ... but again, who really cares. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team up to create a very funny, sometimes funny movie that I really liked. Rousseau and Shatner also played their small roles well. Dude, I hope that in the future my wife will grow old just like Miss Rene. <br /> <br /> In the future, this "buddy" police film causes a loud laugh for a reasonable amount of time. The film is pleasant enough to avoid waiting for the output of the video / DVD and instead go and watch it. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is in his usual form and it is a pleasure to watch him. De Niro fits perfectly into this role. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie, and I think that any real fan of movies who needs a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy Showtime. <Br /> <br /> Best performance: Murphy. Fun. Enough said. Directing Jobs: Nice. The wonderful action movies that used Murphy and De Niro together as a charm, Rousseau is fed up with good support work. <br /> <br /> My rating is 7 out of 10. This is not going to move you or anything else ... but This is a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> This is Showtime ... was a great success.
