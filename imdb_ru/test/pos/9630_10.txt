I really liked the Patriot. This film was less violent and based on a real life threat that could inevitably destroy our civilization. One line in the Wesley McLaren film (Seagal) seemed very true to our society: “Western medicine practices the prolongation of the disease, and I deal with its treatment.” <br /> br />
