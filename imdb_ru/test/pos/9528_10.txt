I try to shoot this film every time it is shown on TV, which, fortunately, is quite common. But I keep forgetting to shoot a video. In fact, I practically know the script by heart, but this does not prevent me from crying well, in fact it probably adds to it when I cry, knowing what will happen next. This is such a beautiful film - well made, well shot, good photo. I like it. One of my top ten movies.
