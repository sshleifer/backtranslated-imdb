Every Saturday morning at 11 am I watched Superstars. All the biggest events happened on this show at the time. The Challenge, which was broadcast on Sunday mornings, was also decent, but it all happened on this show. The wrestlers gave all their interviews with Mean Gene on the platform next to a lively crowd, or they themselves spoke with the screen against the background of the background that promoted them. Matches were usually squash, but sometimes in the main tournament you could see two players in the middle of the field. There were also interview shows that usually led to violence, thus creating enmity. These segments varied from the Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, Brother Love Show, funeral home and hairdresser. I donâ€™t remember any names passing from hand to hand on this show. This usually happened with pay-per-view and the main event of Saturday nights.
