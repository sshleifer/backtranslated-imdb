I cry in many films. Call me sentimental. Call me one of those viewers who always like to see a happy ending. This film, although it has a sad end, was great! Of all the actors with whom I would like to have dinner, it was Sidney Poitier. His acting, along with John Cassavetiz and Jack Warden (of 12 celebrities of Angry Men), is stellar. His character, who is friends with a man on the run (Cassavetis) and helps him in every possible way, is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is another one of those forgotten noir created at the end of the noir era. It is well done, has excellent cast, extremely talented acting and excellent cinematography. This is a movie that is worth watching again and again. I highly recommend it! This is just another truly remarkable film made by Mr. Poitiers, which is to be sold on DVD. Despite the fact that I cried, glory to such great art!
