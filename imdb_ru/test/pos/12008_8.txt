What can I say about this film, besides the story, one of the most exciting films in history ... and based on a true story! Being old enough to remember the Berlin Wall when it was still used to contain the country, this film gives you a grim impression of the grim imprisonment of East Berliners and their desperate attempts to escape, regardless of cost. The film tells about the lives of two families who decided to escape using a self-made balloon. Constantly fearing arrest by the authorities, under the scrutiny of neighbors, they have to calculate a plan for reaching the other side of the wall. The tense and exciting story of courage and determination, which truly pays homage to all those who succeeded and failed the treacherous journey to West Berlin and freedom.
