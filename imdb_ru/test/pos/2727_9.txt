Mrs. Aparna Sen, the creator of the “Mr. and Mrs. Ayer” film, makes a film about the struggle of a young girl in order to cope with her exhausting condition. <br /> <br /> Mitya (Concon Sen) has been talking to her since childhood, and she shows signs of delusion, no one knows why. However, the inactive tendency gets out of control when an appointment to work brings her to neighboring Bihar, where she is raped by some political thugs. The resulting injury also leads to episodes of manic-depressive psychosis in addition to its schizophrenia. Over the years, she gets out of control, gradually getting worse and sinking deeper into her personal “world”. <br /> <br /> The juxtaposition of the “unresolved” (divorced) elder sister and the way her imperious manners make the already bad situation worse indicates that the fine line exists between the abnormal and * seemingly normal *. Ms. Sen also remarkably commented on the social exclusion of such people. Social rehabilitation is standard therapy along with all deadly drugs. But what about the poor and disadvantaged, who are always left to fend for themselves, and they usually end up on the sidelines? <br /> <br /> The romance between Dr. Kunal and Anu was unnecessary. In addition, the scene in the cafeteria where Dr. Kunal explains to Anu how real their world is to them was superfluous. Anu should already know all this. The dialogue in English is sometimes a bit awkward, although the action compensates for this. Konkona and Shabana prove that their reputation is worth it. Vahida, Rahul and Shefali play their limited roles very well. <br /> <br /> An extensive study seems to have been conducted about this disease, and it is very obvious. But it is not clear whether MDP can coexist with schizophrenia in the same patient, side by side. Also at the beginning, Dr. Kunal recommends ECT (shock therapy), while at the same time rejecting the fact that it does not work for schizophrenics, only for extreme MDP with suicidal tendencies and other forms of bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> The ending of a remarkable story suggests an unknown decision (perhaps not a decision). The film could end on a more pleasant note, since all over the world, the mentally ill can and do behave in a balanced and fruitful way, if not very well, live under good medical care. <br /> <br /> However, this is an excellent film, created with extreme sensitivity to the subject. Hats off to Miss Sen! No one in India could do it better.
