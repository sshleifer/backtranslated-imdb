This is a film about passion. The passion he portrays is largely misdirected even toward the lead person. But therein lies the incredible power of this film: it shows us that what we believe may be contaminated by nonsense and may even lead us to destructive actions - for ourselves or others. In addition, those who try to avoid gaining passion (see how the addict visits the studio) also risk self-destruction. <br /> <br /> The world should hear the message of this film more often.
