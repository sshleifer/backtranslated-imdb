Well, I am afraid that my review of this special offer will not listen to many other observations than others before me, but I literally just watched him - while participating in the PBS program - and, frankly, I am too excited to to say nothing. To truly appreciate the mystery of Barbra Streisand, you must look back before watching movies. Before the Broadway phenomenon of the mid-60s. When television was still young media, there was a very visible form of entertainment on the air, which today is just a memory: musical diversity. Some musical shows were weekly series, but others were single, one-time events, usually showing the particular talent of an individual artist. This is where we get the raw, uncommon first looks at Streisand. She was already a guest performer on other variety shows, including Harry Moore, Ed Sullivan, and made a major coup in a one-time tandem with a woman who would give her a pop relay: Judy Garland. In 1966, COLOR ME BARBRA presented Barbra Streisand in color (hence the name), but almost completely copied the format of its first special offer a year earlier. In 3 different acts we get the abstract Streisand (in a non-working art museum that looks and sometimes turns into a work of art), the comic Streisand working with an already adored audience in a studio circus (inhabited by many furry and fluffy animals) and, most pleasantly singing Streisand in a mini-concert format ... well, to be honest, just doing it. <br /> <br /> It surprises me that she still made her debut in the movie “Funny Girl”, and also became a songwriter, director and political activist. Here she was barely 24 years old, she does unusual things, because, as she says in her own intro to the camera, “we didn’t know that we couldn’t, and we did.” The scene from the art museum was filmed in Philadelphia for one weekend immediately after the museum closed to the public on Saturday evening, and apparently made only ONE color camera. Nevertheless, there are many cuts, disappearances and tracking shots, which leads to one rather impressive peak moment - the modern, slightly spiced up hipster, “Gotta Move”. Lost among modern essays, bongos begin in a jazz club, when Streisand appears in a psychedelic dress and a brilliant make-up, making a memorable staccato-melody with an almost androgynous sex appeal. Only in the third act, believe it or not, this moment is combined with another feat: in concert sequence, in a white dress and pearl earrings, Streisand utters a torch “Any place I hang my hat at home,” tearing the last notes and revealing one of those climate belts that makes you scream like a little girl, even if you're 44 years old ... and a guy. Just a good old great TV. Check it out.
