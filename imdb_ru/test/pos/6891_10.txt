Despite having been on the air for 6 years, the Promised Land was one of those shows that appear once or twice a generation. Good cast, supporting cast (including Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis) and the crew. The plot is believable when McRainey gathers his family and simply says “to hell with it all” after having suffered so much frustration and incidents since his return from Vietnam many years ago. I think that many veterans of the Vietnam era, including myself, could indeed be related to the McRaney thinking process, when he finally decided on his course of action. Many of us did the same in real life, returning from that war and finding that America is not the place we left behind. The show tells not only about the values, but also about what happened in the lives of veterans. Only in these two respects, I think this is one of the sharpest TV shows of our time. Why this program worked only 3 years, I do not understand.
