Meg Tilly, well-groomed, well-mannered, should spend the night in a creepy mausoleum as a dedication to a high school club. The problem is that a powerful psychic named Raimmar was just buried there that day, but he is not completely dead, and he needs the vitality of people for his abilities. <br /> <br /> An incomprehensible horror film offers a lot of thrills and cold, an attractive and likeable cast, as well as the most excellent special effects. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> One Dark Night has an R rating for violent and adult topics.
