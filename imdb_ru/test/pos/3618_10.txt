Being a cephalonian by origin, I was pleasantly surprised when I watched the movie. I heard a true story from my relatives, who still live in Kefalonia, but when watching a movie and reading a book, fragmentary pieces of history were filled. It's all true, Italians will sing, oppression and earthquakes that so often rock the island. The earthquake of 1953 killed my great-grandfather, and the book and film with great compassion reflect the feeling of the era. If you haven’t seen the movie go, watch it and read a book, it’s not just a love story, and yes, there were many Italians who were in love with women of Cephallonia; image history.
