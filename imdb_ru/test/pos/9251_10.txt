Although there were some uneven spots and some plot lines that didn’t quite fit the character, it was Classic H: LOTS. The characters, with the exception of Mike Jardello (Giancarlo Esposito), were faithful in formation, and the scenes of the reunification of Pembleton (Andre Brauger) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) were as deep and good as ever to decorate a small screen. /> <br /> “Murder: the film,” known as “Eternal Life,” is a fan-made film, but it stands on its own, like any two-hour episode of the series. Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job of disrupting the ending of 7 seasons and all the main actors of the “best damn show on television” together for the series finale, which NBC never bothered to give. There was no happy ending to the true form of "murder", such is life. This is what has always distinguished this show from the senseless cops left on television. Kudos to writers and actors for creating something throughout the entire series and in the film that challenged TV viewers and producers. <br /> <br /> ** I call myself a “maniac killer”, if for no other reason than to keep my colleagues in a cooperative mood. **
