This film is likely to be too sentimental for many viewers, especially for the modern audience. However, I liked this film mainly due to the practical charm of William Holden, one of my favorite stars, and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are several truly touching scenes between the couple, and the talent of these two actors is saved by the fact that in smaller hands there could be banal lines. Hong Kong's cinematography filming period is another highlight of this film. In general, the romantic drama is better than the average 7/10.
