When I watched this film, I was amazed at how media perception can shape people's opinion about celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very insecure young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard soar into the charts with wonderful songs. As with all modern celebrities, they were often criticized for their music, as well as for their appearance, styles, etc. This had a huge impact on Karen, who raged against her food and sharply lost weight, which eventually led to her death. This film felt it was not what I would have thought. But, starting to look at it, I got hooked. Just like the story of Tina Turner, this film enlightens you and allows you to look into the lives of young performers. The action was excellent, and even almost 20 years after it was done, the direction and dialogue is still interesting. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone who has not watched it. It is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged.
