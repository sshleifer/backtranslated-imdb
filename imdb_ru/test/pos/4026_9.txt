Valeria, an elegant and cute young lady, lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Although she may have a lover for one night or if someone lives with her, there is no difference in the fact that she is completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take action to approach this particular man, Massimo, and at the same time, the fear that allows her to answer his questions only with “yes”, “no” or “I don’t know”, Method emphasize the loneliness of the character is great. An example would be the distance when Massimo and Valeria take coffee in the same room, separated by thin partitions and not seeing each other. I could mention a few episodes, but it's better to watch a movie. It is impressive that the director does not control any detail. Although all actions are performed in slow movements, no screams, no special effects are needed, but only a great game and a touching well-written story. I like it.
