From the age of 30 to 51, when he died of a brain tumor, Zachary Scott made 70 films. He was presented in 1944 in the film “The Mask of Dimitrios” by Jean Negulesko, where he played Dimitrios. The following 1945, he shot three films, one of which. He is best remembered by filmmakers in the role of Jean Renoir's star "Southerner," one of the films of 1945, where he played a sympathetic role. Nevertheless, he often played creepy characters, and in this film he is a murderer of women sociopaths for money. So what's going on here? He lives in a house with three women, so be careful! Faye Emerson, who also appeared in Dimitrios, plays the eldest of two daughters in the house. She falls in love with Scott, and they secretly get engaged. Then her younger sister, the “cute child” (played by Mona Freeman, who looks and looks like Bonita Granville), returns from a boarding school and accidentally talks to Scott that she inherited a large amount, so Scott turns on her , with all the boisterous jealousy simmering in the household that it was to cause. Things get tense and then they get tighter. In the meantime, murder plans are advancing in the head of the prudent Scott. But it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions. He is also wanted as a result of his last murder, with which the film was opened, so that we know his background. James Wong Howe introduces spectacular noir cinematography to this story, directed by Frenchman Robert Flory, who moved to Hollywood some time ago. The film is an effective puzzle of a psychopath in a house that can cause some wear and tear on the edges of some seats, for those with such a slope.
