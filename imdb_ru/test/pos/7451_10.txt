Now, after watching "The Coming Children" twice, the storyline is not as superficial as most have criticized it, in my opinion. If you haven’t played FFVII or disliked it for any reason, this film is most likely not for you. Being familiar with the original story is a prerequisite for a complete understanding of AC, otherwise you will simply see the greatest animation of computer graphics in your life. <br /> <br /> Without spoiling the storyline, I have to admit that after viewing the AC, we collect the pieces with my friends, drawing on our knowledge of FFVII. Seeing him a second time, we were able to pay more attention to the story, and most of the questions that we could have were answered. Some were not. AC is clearly for FFVII players / fans and honestly does not try to be someone else. It has almost no realism outside the world of FFVII, which serves a purpose. The music is mainly recreated on the FFVII themes with a heavier touch (TBM team according to the final credits) and works well on the eye without exceptions. I found the music enhances the visual firework experience in all situations. <br /> <br /> We all know that you can’t put FFVII in 1.5 hours, and remember that the storyline actually offered me more than I expected. There are two problems in FFVII: AC, and both stories were very smoothly wrapped between the action sequences. And trust me when I say that it is a lot. Act. <br /> <br /> I changed my voice from 9 to 10 after watching it a second time, because I missed a few explanatory sequences that I couldn’t collect for the first time, which gave some answers. As a warning, it will be easy to ignore the story and concentrate on the graph, but try not to judge Adevent Children because of this. If you do not let the story in, it is not surprising that it seems careless. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to praise the graphics, because I believe that we all know that they are awesome, which can be an understatement. Especially characters speak with facial expressions much more than ever before. I hope you pay attention to the storyline, because it really makes sense and works well with everything. Get ready for the trip of your life, there are no breaks.
