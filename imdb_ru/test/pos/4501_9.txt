I read the book before watching the film, and it left me emotionally drained, but I felt that he really brought me to Afghanistan, a culture that I know very little about. I had high hopes for this film, and he did not disappoint. I watched it with someone who did not read the book, and he also enjoyed it. They had to cut some things in the film, but it was a well-played and well-made film. It makes you think about the film long after it ends. You feel for the characters and their troubles. I highly recommend this film to those who love emotionally dramatic drama and want to get acquainted with Afghan culture. There are some disturbing scenes that are not suitable for children. This is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life in a restrictive regime.
