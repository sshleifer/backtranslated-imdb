Well, on the day when Rob Schneider plunges into the black hole of the infamous bad films, filming a completely unwanted film “Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo” (hmmm ... no film) called Roadtrip, which was followed by Eurotrip? And now there is Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, followed by the continuation of Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo ....... I smell a pattern. Maybe Spiderman is coming soon: European networks are hotter ..... or not. I'm writing about this very slanderous (at the time of release) film. I have to admit, I was one of those villains. I picked up a nose for this, even when Chris Farley put cocaine in his nose, and the cast of SNL fought for one of the worst seasons in their history in 94-95, despite his affection for Norm Macdonald. Films like Happy Gilmore, Tommy Boy and Black Sheep came out a couple of years after this period, and we realized that the Spade-Farley-Schneider-Sandler caliber of films has a dark future. However, I watched this film the other day, ten years later and eight years after Chris's death, and could not help but laugh. Yes, it is not particularly difficult. Farley does what Farley does (not unlike Manny, who is Manny), but his motivational speaker, “Van Down By the River,” in which he laments that although he may “not have enough washing”, “not wear well-fitting clothes ”or“ use deodorant more than “Twice a week” - it looks good as a forever modest character who understands that he is not the smartest, not the most beautiful and can lose a few pounds. However, he tries his best to do what he should. And David Spade is simply throwing off the stupefied remarks, as he did for the “Hollywood Minute of Spade,” and, in effect, undermines Farley’s self-esteem. There really is not much to say than that. I like one scene when Farley catches Spade slapping his monkey and then making a couple of jokes about it. I can't remember who the first one is, but the second, they are lying on their beds in the hotel, and Farley says to Spade: “Do you like baseball?” Spade mumbles something unheard of in response, and Farley says, “New York Yankees?” Farley does his awkward, painfully sensitive, stupid boy anyway. If you like, you like. I could not stop laughing.
