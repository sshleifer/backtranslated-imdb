This comedy. The dialogue is quick and very witty. Eleanor Parker at her physical peak. Flynn, since only Flynn can be a "charming fraud" ... although now he is no longer in his prime. Most of the scenes between principals are short, so the film moves well. If you have not seen this movie, please take a look. You will be surprised by the time of the Flynn comedy. The scenes between him, Tucker, Parker and Hugs Sakala are funny. Just based on the outfits put on by Most Attractive Parker, this movie is worth seeing. The romance of this 40s film will not be lost to those who are so inclined to watch films from Hollywood's golden past. I bet that Never Say Goodbye will not disappoint.
