Good movie, acting was awesome, especially from Eric Ebuyne (Lumumba), and very well directed. <br /> <br /> It also shows how Lumumba found himself surrounded by Belgians, the United States and the United Nations and how they called him a “communist” to scare people, as they did to all honest real African leaders like Nkrumah, Kenyatta, Nyerere and many others. This shows how Western countries preach democracy, while they have something else on their minds. This is a story of injustice, struggle and cruelty. <br /> <br /> This shows how Lumumba could not control his people, yes, they were his people, but before we put the blame on him, he got enough if someone from the people he appointed in your government like mobutu? Or his colleagues had other thoughts to learn, go and watch a movie! Of course, Mobutu continued to plunder the country for the next 35 years, before he was overthrown and fled the country. The billionaire died. <br /> <br /> Some flaws: too few explanations for how this person (Lumumba) stood up in the first place. In addition, there should have been more explanation about the country, Congo Kinshasa (after independence), now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as Zaire, when it was ruled by Mobutu. There should have been an explanation of why he (Lumumba) could not hold the second part in Africa. And also what happened with Tshombe and Katanga. Just think, if you want to watch a film that Tshombe controlled in the Katanga region, which (if I'm not mistaken) is the world's number one copper producer. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good film that is worth seeing, you will learn something new about Africa, its leaders and people, and you will probably open your eyes to why this continent is inundated with wars.
