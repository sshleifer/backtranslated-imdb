This film, adapted from the play of Sam Shepard, contains many game elements, such as relatively fixed furnishings (a roadside motel from the 50s in the south-west) and extensive intriguing dialogues. The woman "May" is pursued by the man "Eddie" (played by Sam Shepard). She tries to hide from him in a deaf motel, but he finds her. The film explores the history of their relationship, mainly from their childhood, which led them to this point. It is very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and to understand that their dysfunctional current relationships are the result of past events beyond their control. We mainly observe how they fight, do makeup, fight, do makeup and so on. One image I remember is how Eddie pulls Mee over his shoulder, kicking and screaming, dragging her where she doesn't want to go. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is also an ideal spiritual country with vocals by the less well-known artist Sandy Rogers. She has the voice of this strange doll, which is almost a yodel in some places of the album! This is a film that will remain in some part of your brain / soul. In other words, go take a look!
