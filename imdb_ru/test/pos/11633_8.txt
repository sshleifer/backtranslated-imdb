I don't understand why everyone hates Barney. If you hate the show so much then DON'T LOOK! It is stupid how everyone changes their son "I love you" to "I hate you." If you don't like it, fine. Anyway, this is your opinion. But it makes no sense to humiliate the show, when it is not so bad. Well, it's trite, and yes, it has its drawbacks, but this is a show for children. Children do not want to be sad and unhappy, they want to be happy. And Barney is helping this. And even in the series there are moments of sadness, anger, etc. And yes, Barney uses magic. But the children see Barney as a figment of the imagination. Children need a place to escape to express themselves. The world is a miserable and difficult place. We all need a place to express ourselves and be happier. Barney does it with us. This show is great. I watched Barney when I was younger. Yes, some people think it is stupid. But I watched it and I am the best in its class. This will not necessarily make you smarter, but it is not the main thing. I believe that Barney’s goal is to provide a place where children can be children, and the spirit of childhood can be expressed. Where the imagination lives. So many teenagers are not imagining now and are afraid to express themselves. Barney helps encourage this. Barney helped me not to be afraid and show myself the way I am. Now I'm in my second year in high school, an AP student with 4.0, a drama student with a love of theater and art and a new cousin who loves Barney. I watch it with him, enjoy it and sing with him. Yes, it's trite and stupid, and anything, but it's great for kids. Who wants to be an adult who doesn't have time for fun? I am a child in the shower, and I love Barney. This is great for kids and those who are deep down. <br /> <br /> This is a great show for kids and toddlers. So stop hating. Say you don't like it, but stop it with “Stupid Shows in All History” or “Barney with a Bull” or something else. Keep it. Take a pill for cold or something else. Here's something: I never liked Sesame Street. But you don’t see what I’m saying: “Grover is a bull,” “The cookie monster must die,” or something like that. I hate all BULLSS ** T people talk about books or movies like Barney or Twilight. If you hate it, well, whatever. Nobody cares. Do not talk about it with hatred, because you can hurt someone.
