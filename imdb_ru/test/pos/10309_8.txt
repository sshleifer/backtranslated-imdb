I saw Bandit Queen in 2005, more than ten years after it was done against the background of widespread contradictions in India. The language, rough treatment, and natural play (of relatively unknown actors of the time) may have been even more shocking to the Indian population, more familiar with fantasy cinema, at that time. The film, the cast and Shekhar Kapur deserve credit for their breakthrough efforts. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very different from the typical drama about revenge, filmed in various forms in India. In fact, there were several fictional descriptions of this particular story. The reason for this is that it must be a first-person account of someone who actually went through all this, and much more, that does not find a place on the screen and survived to tell a story. Survived long enough to see her story, at least in the film. Phulan Devi lived shortly after his release from prison in 1994. <br /> <br /> The film is evaluated for several reasons. Cinematography is great. The music is suitable. The cast, many of which have become more familiar names, is very good. But the scenario is ambiguous. Everything moves too fast and at times. This is understandable, because there are too many threads that need to be tied together to make it all cohesive. Or maybe I felt it, because I read the book by Mala Sen, which is more detailed and better, although obviously not as shocking as the visual, the story of the sufferings of Folan Devi and which supposedly is one of the main sources for the film . <br /> <br /> There are some factual ambiguities. According to Phulan Devi, she was not present when the Behmai massacre occurred, and, despite the fact that she claimed that she dictates the account of Phulan herself, she, as shown, participates and actually initiates the massacre. Then the last scene in which Phulan surrenders shows that she touches the feet of the Chief Minister, and in fact she surrendered to the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Only symbolic meaning, but it shows that Phulan did not want to show slavery to a living, ordinary person. It would be nice to show the head minister some resemblance to Arjun Singh, whom many remember at the time when he was the head of Madhya Pradesh. <br /> <br /> But in this very well-made film there are small gaps, a rare gem coming out of the main Indian film industry, made by a man who until then was best known for the Masala movie in the late 80s - Mr. India
