When you watch the best films of Mexico, you will most likely find that the photo was taken by Gabriel Figueroa. He is recognized in the world as one of the best that ever existed. His masterful control over the cameras gave an additional contribution to the films in which he participated. If we add to his participation, we add the direction of Luis Bunuel, you will never find such a pair of aces anywhere else in the world. This story, Nazarin, was written by Spainâ€™s greatest writer, besides Miguel de Cervantes (Don Quixote de la Mancha). The story itself is magnificent: the priest Nazarin, who lives by conviction, tries to live a very Christian life, but, as always, there are people who do not accept this. He wanders in many places, preaching his Christianity, but in most cases he finds people who do not accept him. But besides a great story, it's always interesting to try to interpret the mysterious messages that Bunuel sends to us throughout the whole picture, in scenes that make you tremble.
