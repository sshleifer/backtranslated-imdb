I never forgot this movie. All these years remained in my life. I searched this movie on many sites and in stores. If someone reads this and receives a copy, I will pay you for the copy or please let me know where I can find it. This is a film that should be known as a classic novel, as well as my other favorite film, Somewhere in Time. It was really brilliant. If the right actors remake this film and give him the patience they need to be the Right actor, this could be a block destruction. A love story is as strong as it should be around for all who love to see. I remember how sad I was at the finals, and it really came as a shock. With all my heart I believe that Johnny really loved a woman, and she was his. It was a terrific movie, and it is a shame that we cannot buy it. Please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - I want to thank the wonderful woman who responded to my message almost a year later. She had a copy of the film, and she was so kind to send it to me. She is a big fan of this movie, just like me. With her help, three happy ladies received these DVDs. ‚Äù She is waiting for the book on which it is based. I check it at my local library called The Mrs. Maitlands Affair Margaret Lynn. I am sure it is also great. Many thanks to Julie for her kindness and friendship. I am always your friend / Sharon
