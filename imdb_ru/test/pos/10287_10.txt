starting with a plot similar to “Vertigo” or “Obsession” by Brian DePalma, right up to Peter Chase's score, reminiscent of the sounds of Bernard Herrmann, this little gem seems to be the spectacle of a few. The wonderful game of Roman Beringer and Vincent Cassel in Bohemian Paris, depicted by the famous Thierry Arbogast. Little cult! The only pity is that the DVD has only French and English versions. Directed by a controversial artist like Gilles Mimouni, this could be considered a small tribute to the masterpieces of Cinema. This is a French film, and, like all of them, not for all, we could say that the movie d'essai. Even if it is not so advertised, it can be remembered for several reasons.
