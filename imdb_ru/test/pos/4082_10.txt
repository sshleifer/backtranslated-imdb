I taped Morrison Kills on Lifetime Movie and watched Morrison Kills on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie and Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett played well Luke and Walker Morrison. I'm glad Walker made his brother Luke confess to the murder of his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching true stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie and Courttv. Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. Next time, the Morrison killings will be on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv. I'm going to watch Morrison Murders again because my favorite actor is John Corbbett in Morrison Murders. I give The Morrison Murders ten, because it's a good Walker film that tries to find out who killed his parents and his brother Bobby, and at the end Walker discovers that it was his brother Luke who killed his parents and his brother Bobby.
