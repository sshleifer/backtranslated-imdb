I have to say it was let down. In general, it's nice to see how Aparna Sen dealt with the problem of schizophrenia, I do not really understand this and got everything that was depicted in “Beautiful mind”, and here is also his interesting image. <br /> <br /> But what disappointed me is artificial dialogue and excessive use of English. It is true that a new class is being formed in India that speaks English even at home, but I am sure that it is not as formal as in the film. Moreover, Vahida Rehmaan did not seem very comfortable to speak English. Dialogue Charu in the tone of Bihari was apparently much more realistic and easily digestible. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this is the abstract flavor that she tried to impart to the film. I generally like open-ended movies, but there were a lot of loose ends. His cut pieces are joined together to create a film. There also seemed to be no central theme of the film. Schizopheria, of course, was the main feature, but the mixed sister-sister, mother-daughter, adding the doctor-Azmi relationship, not using the brother, Bose-wife Bose relationship ... all this was not required and making the audience lose track trying to portray. <br /> <br /> In general, watches are for people who love extraordinary films that should be avoided by those who just watch movies as an entertainment tool.
