Even people who do not like the film, as a rule, because they find a tangled end, should appreciate the strong play of Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello, who played two young heroes in this film. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION: In the literal sense of the level, the ending does not make sense. People who think that the ending has some meaning at other levels are divided between those who 1) think that the younger brother was killed by his stepfather or at the time when Mike (the older boy) was absent, talking to a neighbor gang, or a place flew away in his van to avoid the situation through death, and those 2) who think that the younger brother is imaginary, and his departure into the van, turned into an aircraft, signals his overcoming an insulting situation. <br /> <br /> I support 2). This makes a lot of sense in terms of how many children handle abusive situations. A child victim often divides his psyche and projects an offended person onto something else; scarecrow, even an imaginary friend. Thus, it becomes much clearer that the younger boy is always scolded over the boy, not Mike. In fact, it is unlikely that one of the two brothers will be insulted, even though it happens. In addition, this is Bobby, the younger brother, who is also encouraging, who insists that they can overcome the situation. In addition, the death of a real brother or sister as a result of ill-treatment would be too shocked for an adult with such in his history to turn into an optimistic end of fantasy, like this one.
