Did I catch this film about the most unlikely success? , from the lower league, football team. The plot is tight and plays some great subtle twists. Intersection with frames and comments from the 70s. I was puzzled by his incredible fun. <br /> <br /> A great cast includes the awesome Tim Healy as a madman (drunk) manager who clumsily clings to everything that makes his team win ...? I continue to recall such fragments as the stolen secret file that Don Revie (Super Leeds United and England’s manager, loved by fans who are hated by everyone else) is stored in Bostock United (unscrupulous people), which is report on their opposition, Bostock United In this FA Cup final, simply says “W-te”. <br /> <br /> A lot of other men's jokes long before the fantastic length in the movie “Mike Bassett - Football Manager” with Ricky Tomlinson in the lead role. <br /> <br /> Over there with Goong Ho, the English beating the Germans, in football. Well, morally. Despite the fact that the account is written differently, “Escape to victory” (I'm still happy when England scores) <br /> <br /> And the joyless eternal routine of following the really bad team in Michel Palins “Golden The Gordon "from the Ripping Yarns series (along with Terry Jones) team was called Bostonworth United, in case you're interested. <br /> <br /> I looked high and low for a copy of the Bostock Cup biography, even Nick Hancock. Do not list it (probably, someone - not Mr. Hancox - is an error) <br /> <br /> Play it again or sell me a copy - PLEASE ....
