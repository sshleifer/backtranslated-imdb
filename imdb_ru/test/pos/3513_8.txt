I’ve been waiting for almost 25 years to see this hard-to-find awful thriller, and I finally did it, since this is the right reincarnation on DVD. Of course, this did not have the same effect on me as if I had seen him in the 80s, but director Lieberman (his film “Squirm” is excellent) makes good use of Oregon’s excellent location and takes the time to develop characters, not just send them in a creative way. The high note, the whistling music of Brad Fidel is really creepy and adds to the desert process, making it a great pleasure for fans of the genre. Be sure to see if you like undervalued horror movies. To describe this, there would be a reasonable Friday the 13th seasoned with tasty slices of Liberation. In addition, there are some really cool and original moments, such as my favorite, when a couple swims in the lake, and the guy disappears under water to play a trick on his girlfriend - just when you think that this is a common fright, she suddenly looks ashore and ... I, frankly, can not spoil it - you just have to watch it myself. In addition, the ending is just one of those that you just have to see to believe ?? it came from nowhere, and it is strange and wild! The DVD includes a comment from Lieberman.
