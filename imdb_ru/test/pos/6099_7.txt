“Run and Run” is an amazing story, in which the main role is always played by the wonderful Margaret Colin as a social lady who “has everything” until she hits the child with her car and leaves the stage. Hence the name. The tragedy is that she goes to call for help and returns, but she is frightened by evil passersby who think that the attacker has left the scene. This was done in those days when not everyone had a mobile phone, or there would be no history. <br /> <br /> Colin’s guilt and suffering are palpable and make her behave so strangely that the detective is on her right. long away. Her lie deeper and deeper plunges her into the pit of self-hatred, causing it to aggravate the bad situation. <br /> <br /> This is a very provocative story, and no one can help but feel this feminine pain, wanting everywhere to just get in order. <br /> <br /> Like a television film, thanks to Colin and a strong script, this television film is well above average.
