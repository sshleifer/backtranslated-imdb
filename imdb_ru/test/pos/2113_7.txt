We all liked the movie. This is a very charming family film with many funny cameos. It was fun to see Austin, Charlie Robison, Joe Eli and Robert Earl Keane in the film, as well as famous actors Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis. Emma Roberts is especially cute in the film, but all the kids are good. The West Texas landscape is gorgeous, as is the soundtrack, full of Texas artists. The last half seemed a bit far-fetched to me, but my son was interested in this film, which is not so often with him. Something in the storyline was fun for the kids. Having shown calves in my childhood, I really liked the final. This is definitely not how it really works if you do not have chicks.
