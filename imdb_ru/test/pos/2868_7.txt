This is one of the best horror movies I have seen lately. Creepy abandoned house, interesting characters, blood and intricate plot. Who can ask for anything else in a horror movie? For the most part, this is quite predictable, but, again, most of the horrors that you can figure out during the first 10 minutes, so I will not deny it. Music, angles and more are excellent. The sets are well made and very convincing. However, there were almost no plots, as there are too many alternative plots in the horror film, which in any case select only what is needed from the horror ... Be scared. If I compared it to any other film, I would say that it reminded me of a remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Definitely a horror movie lover should see.
