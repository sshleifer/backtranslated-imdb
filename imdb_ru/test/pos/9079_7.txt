Someone I know said that there was a movie called "Flatliners" that was probably on my street. I was told about this film after viewing the final point 2 and viewing additional information about the close range. <br /> <br /> I bought a flat-plate DVD at a modest price of 5 pounds. Got home and looked it. And I could not help but smile and feel good, wondering how this film was not in my life before. The film is about a group of medical students trying to see what it looks like after an almost deadly experience. But then sins return to reality and can cause them physical harm. <br /> <br /> Acting on Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland is great, as you would expect from a couple. And Joel Schmacher made this wonderful film, as with the lost boys. <br /> <br /> This is a sharp and stylish thriller that film fans will surely like.
