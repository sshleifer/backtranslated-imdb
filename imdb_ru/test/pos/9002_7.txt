Now, before people start to figure out this movie (those who play rugby anyway), this is a movie! Hollywood was given entertainment to entertain people, and therefore those who play rugby (including me), naturally, will punch holes in the choreography of the game in the film. Overall, this is a worthy film that draws attention to the morals and ideas of the game of rugby. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a real team, a real trainer and his work helping children to get their bearings. Direction to be the best people in the future, and also based on real people who played for the highland team. This is just a typical sports movie with a character that is misled and ultimately gets back on track through rugby. As a rule, it is a good film that is pleasant, but has disadvantages in terms of the image of the game. however, as I said, this is a film under Hollywood treatment.
