I think Vanessa Marcil is the best actor in the cast. She makes Sam one of the best characters in the series. James Kann is also pretty good. I like it when he worries about Delinda. One of my favorite scenes when Ed and Delinda beat up some guy. That was funny. Nikki Cox is also good, she has excellent chemistry with Josh Duhamel. Lara Flynn Boyle was great in her role as a guest. I wish they didn't kill her. The show has a great cast without bad actors, which you donâ€™t often see on TV. I still think Vanessa Marcil is the best. She was supposed to get an Emmy in my opinion. It's a shame, the show was canceled
