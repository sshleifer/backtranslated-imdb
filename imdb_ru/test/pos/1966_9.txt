Edge Rivers is not a pleasant movie to watch, but it's incredible. Having seen it many years ago, I really think it will still be a shock if it is republished or redone or something like that. Perhaps no film ever filmed the essence of a young suburban inertia like this terrifying, frightening film. Given that this is based on a true story, it is even more disturbing. Very well played and just INXUALLY to watch many times, but also a little-known masterpiece and a really important film. Must be sure to watch the show across the country in all universities. Fantasy.
