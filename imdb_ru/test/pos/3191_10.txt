I can't believe it ... after all these years finally found it ... it should have been called the "Great Challenger" at the production stage. At that time I lived in Oz, and my friend looked after one of the places at home through shooting ... It was I who showed these guys how to speak Scottish, and after all this time, I understand only now that one of them was Russell Crowe. !!! It took me all these years to track it down, and I wasnâ€™t even sure if it would ever be able to be on the screen when I left Oz the next month after the party. At the time, Russell Crowe was not the sought-after actor he is now, and I had no idea that it was him until I saw the previous comment, and then I remembered the days during the filming ... amazing ... Truly pleased with myself now! !!
