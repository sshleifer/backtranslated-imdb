If you're a fan of Turkish and Middle Eastern music, you're in luck. This film is a documentary about contemporary music in Istanbul, from traditional to modern. It is very good. You could not have done better if you went to Istanbul on your own. We get an interview with Orhan Gensbey, concert clips with modern music icons, a road show with a gypsy (gypsy) audience, Turkish hip-hop (surprisingly very, very good) and much more. Some of the best vocalists I've ever heard. Kurdish woman singing in a hammam (steam bath) that will tear your heart out. A lot of social and political background. If this is your thing, you will have a great time. I could hardly sit quietly in the theater. <br /> <br /> CD Soundtrack is now available on Amazon. Pricey.
