I have to say that some of the other reviews of this film that I read show a very poor understanding of this or the original television series from which it originated. Dad's army was a comedy, so she had a sense of humor, and therefore she had to bring a smile to the face of a terrible situation. However, there were a lot of serious messages in the series, such as the episode "Firm" about fanaticism and ignorance, which were attributed to conscientious objector. The film was true to the series and was just like an extended episode. So Iâ€™m afraid that the reviewer who claimed that Columbia improved the mood was completely wrong, and let's face it - the BBC comedy shows of this period beat everything that came out of America, with a lowered hand. Also, propaganda comments were also far from the truth. The guards were people who were considered unfit for front-line service and who still wanted to serve. They were very brave people who knew that they were sentenced to death as soon as they signed, as Hitler announced that anyone who did this would be executed if and when Britain was captured. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to set the record right, because it is always useful to speak and comment on what was noticed, and not to think about how you are moving, I find.
