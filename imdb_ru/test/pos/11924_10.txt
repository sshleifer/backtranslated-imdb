I really liked this film since I saw it in the theater in 1991. I was 12 then, and Wil Wheaton was my favorite actor and teenager. I am now 23 years old and I still love this film. The most pleasant thing about this is that to whom I meet, I like it too, because this is a complete movie about macho! This is done with enough action and mayhem to keep people with the shortest attention spans glued to the screen. I just want it to be available on DVD!
