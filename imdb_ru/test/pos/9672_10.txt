Family Guy should be my favorite cartoon of all time. This is definitely the funniest TV show ever made, and better than The Simpsons. I have never laughed so hard at a television show in my life. plot, characters and themes that are discussed in the series. Very few topics that were not covered in the "Family Guy". <br /> <br /> I have seen almost all the episodes of The Family Guy that have ever been created, I must say that the show was better in the first two seasons. My favorite characters are Peter, because he is very funny and the best character in the series. My second favorite character is Stewie, because he is the funniest villain who is filmed on television. If you love Family Guiy, you should check out American Dad because he is very similar and created by Seth MacFarlane. I hope this show never ends, because itâ€™s a comic genius! 10/10
