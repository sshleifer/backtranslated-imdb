It just shows how wrong you are. I did not expect this film to be liked. I was disappointed with both “Kill Bill” movies (although I preferred the second one) and “Death Proof” (although it was better in the shorter version of “Double counting”). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction, and I think Jackie Brown is Tarantino’s most mature play — technically the best — including the last great performance by Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me that everything is in order with his films (I did not hate them), he walked on water in reference, reverent, self-confident juveniles. <br /> <br /> Then I read the script last year. for Inglorious bastards - and I hated it! Of course, it was some typical QT bloom and the opening scene was undoubtedly powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on the page it was more juvenile trash, largely destroyed by the bounty of the uninteresting bastards from the title. It made me seriously think about not seeing the movie. Trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed my mind when I had the opportunity to watch a film with Tarantino, whose questions and answers followed in London. I thought that it would be worth enduring to hear it in Q & A, as I know from the interview, how interesting it can be personally. <br /> <br /> So little I was prepared for the full abundance of fun and brilliance of inglorious bastards. <br /> Easy, Mr. Tarantino’s best work since Jackie Brown’s time is a triumph. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are links, but they do not interfere with history, they are not the driving force. Yes, Eli Roth does tricks, but he works fine, doing almost nothing, but he looks aggressive and does not do anything that could damage the film, as I was afraid. While I admired Mr. Tarantino for using stunner Zoya Bell in “Proof of Death” to increase the excitement of the main stunt scene, her lack of any acting skills in a key role was a problem for the film. The same can be said about Tarantino's own performances in several films, especially in the Robert Rodriguez film From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote. <br /> <br /> What really does this job is how big it is. Spaghetti-western atmosphere for most of the style, dialogue and performances is simply gorgeous, not too delving into the quality of the Kill Bill cartoon. The violence is so great. Courage is so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers, I was disturbed by the moment of Hitler and Pitt's performance, but in the context of the film they are funny. Pitt is really great here, just the way he should be. He is the raging samurai Mifune in Yojimbo, he is Robard Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, with a lively mood of James Coburn and, of course, a suitable advantage of Lee Marvin. <br /> <br /> Christoph Waltz (whom I hadn’t known before) and Melanie Laurent (which I first noticed in French’s brilliant British short film by Shawn Ellis) are sensational, and I expect to see that both will use much more the future. Tarantino obviously did not lose an eye because of the casting, which seemed to have left him in Proof of Death. Waltz is equally great in its performance. Scary, but theatrical. This is the Foundation from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent - respectively Cardinal innocence, but tough, a fighter. They both fascinate here. <br /> <br /> The fact that every member of the cast gets pleasure from what he does, not indulging in the fact that he is just having fun and trying to laugh, is very helpful. Laughter - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers is close to giving a hint and pushing him too far, but his scene is ruled quite simply - with the help of the fantastic Michael Fassbender, who seems to have pulled right out of the uniform of the Great Escape Attenborough. <br /> <br /> All the actors shine, and Tarantino adds wonderful blossoms, but those that work with history. Introduction of Schweiger by Ugo Stiglitz - Riot. After a sensational slow opening and a magnificent introduction to these crazy bastards, the pace never stops, and more than two and a half hours flies by. <br /> <br /> It also looks beautiful, marking it as a return to a real film making, not just self-indulgence The musical choice, as always, is inspired by Morricone. <br /> <br /> The film is brash and funny. After the summer, when almost every film disappointed me, it was a huge surprise that the real funny and fascinating, as well as a fascinating and impressive film should be just that, when I would never have believed it from the script. Welcome back to QT.
