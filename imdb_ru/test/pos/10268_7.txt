From today's point of view, it is rather ridiculous to evaluate this film 18 (or X in the USA). The film has a sexy, but sublime erotic story, but the pictures are rather innocent. Throughout the film, you feel and see the spirit of fashion from the late 60s and early 70s, dialogues and typical experimental cinematography and lighting. And this is the part that makes it worthy of attention.
