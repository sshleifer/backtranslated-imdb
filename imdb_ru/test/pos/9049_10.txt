If a joke offends no one, it is not funny. <br /> <br /> Inca cartoons are offensive, no doubt. Just like rap. Overcome it. I suspect that any sensible Negro will find the Inca cartoons ridiculous, and that the people insulted by them are white people who still think that blacks need their patronizing protection from racist humor. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the Inca's cartoons are funny. It saddens me that it’s not because someone is really offended, but because someone can simply be offended, I can’t buy Inca or African Queen cartoons or Song of the South on DVDs.
