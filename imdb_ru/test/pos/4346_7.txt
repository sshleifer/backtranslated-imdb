It seems that most critics rejected this film, like many other Charles Bronson cars, as another patchwork of mindless violence. And although a lot of confusion, DEATH WISH 3 is not so difficult, especially for fans of the series and its stars. <br /> <br /> This time, the aging Charlie Paul Kearsey is released. from the police chief who was desperately trying to remove the uneven part of New York. The lucky thriller moves vigilantly in the heart of the bandit territory, where he again becomes the sole army in the city war of good and evil. Bronson, at least the "older" version, is really at its best. <br /> <br /> I’m not saying that DEATH IN DESIRE 3 is a classic. In fact, for a discerning eye, it has many drawbacks. Characters are usually made of cardboard. Violence is paramount. A man in his 60 years ahead and surpassed dozens of young punks. But in the traditions of the original DEATH WISH and later films, such as “FALLING DOWN” with Michael Douglas, he has a certain crowd charm. Who does not want the bandits to receive their due? There are also some wonderful cheese moments that are so often seen in films of the 1980s. For example, when a tenant of his apartment building sees how Kearsey sets up a trap target, vigilant frivolously says that he “thinns the flock”. Only the Bronson line can truly work. <br /> <br /> So you see that the key to enjoying DEATH WISH 3 is to accept it for what it is. This is not Spielberg or art. So throw popcorn in the microwave and enjoy it.
