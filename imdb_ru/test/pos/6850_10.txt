Carla Gugino literally melts the screen in this criminal caper. Her sex appeal, wealth and sexy southern accent make this film more attractive. But the film has so many “other” things that make it almost modern classics. Speech by Simon Baker on the one hand. Truly a great actor. Til Schweiger is so well played that makes you wonder why he is not a huge star "crossover". Gil Bellows finishes this command and literally steals this show. Other splits of Gugino are easily the best performance in the film. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are so gorgeous ... I can't even describe it. Great chemistry. <br /> <br /> The music is so eclectic that it is a character in itself. It's surprising to see. <br /> <br /> People can say that this is Tarantino's influence ... I disagree. This is clearly unique and clever in itself. Sebastian Gutierrez is great at directing this tightly woven film and underestimates the many scenes that make me wander. The end is completely sinister, and you will never see it coming. In general, a wonderful film, which for me is the very definition of what a good film should be.
