I watch a lot of movies. Many movies. Getting a degree in cinema makes you watch 2-3 films a day for many years. Everything becomes very tedious. Mostly because I feel I've seen it all. So rarely am I surprised at something, basically I hope to see something as good as I expect. <br /> <br /> The death bed is so different from everything I've ever experienced, I really had to stop the DVD to rant about its genius. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the play is psychotic. It is structured in such a way that makes the viewer remain outside the frame. It does not look like something like Halloween with all its quick editing and POV frames; Death bed actually seems dreamy. The most pretentious way I can express it: this is Samuel Beckett, making a haunted movie. I mean, this is a manic depressive bed that eats people! And fried chicken! In the middle of nowhere! And there are arm bones! I can barely express my feelings about this film. And yes, if you love this, then you will open the taunts. But after a while, everything becomes real. It's hard to be a movie fan and stay engaged all the time. I can honestly say that this is a completely unique movie up and down. From what it is, how to assemble it. We need such films, films that take us out of complacency. Consider it as an existential camp. it's funny and silly, but at the same time brilliant and strange. Worst horrible villain of all time? Maybe, but at least it's not a masked guy.
