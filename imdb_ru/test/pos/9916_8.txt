I rate OPERA as one of the best Argento films. Holes and inconsistencies? Of course, but I don't think they influence this film as much as many other reviewers. Many of the elements that are in many of Argento’s films are partly “behind the wall”, but this is part of the draw of his films ... <br /> <br /> Short story: the psyche pursues a new leading opera lady. Typical Argentine twists and turns occur, leading to a worthy climax rebound. Not the best Argento, but I still get him out from time to time. Definitely worth seeing if you like his other stuff - just don’t confuse it with the terrible remake of The Phantom of the Opera that Argento made, this one is really terrible ... 8/10
