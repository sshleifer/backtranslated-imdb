At first glance, this mini ... I was a little disappointed that Tommy Lee Jones and Angelica Houston did not return to the cast. Both John Voight and Barbara Hershey have done commendable work, replacing very important characters to continue the saga about this legendary Epic Western. <br /> <br /> Cherokee Jack Jackson (Heisbert) played a great bad guy, and Louis Gossett Jr., as always, was right in shaping with his excellent acting skills. <br /> <br /> A drama that seemed believable in many scenes, including one of the best, where the valiant gunfight ended in the death of Ranger Walker, and I felt that I was actually in the film. Returning to the Lonely Pigeon was practically the quality of the first series for me. The following 2 sequels with James Garner, since Call just couldn't do it for me. And that Lorena marries a Pi Eye? How the hell did that get into them? It was a complete mismatch of the characters. The first 2 episodes made up an epic story, and the next 2 were by no means the same quality. <br /> <br /> Now, if the first 2 can be remastered in Dolby Digital and anamorphic presentations, movies can be where they should have been, like in modern films.
