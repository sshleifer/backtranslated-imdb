I wanted to see it, since my French teacher recommended it to me more than forty years ago. Perhaps the long wait was worth it, as the recovery of the DVD Criterion Collection is impressive. <br /> <br /> In general terms, this film follows an outdated scenario: a quartet of men diligently conceives a complex bank robbery. , a robbery occurs, a small, seemingly insignificant event leads to the final death of all. Despite the fact that the shots from the robbery are stunning, this happens quite early and, ultimately, is not the basis of the film. This film separates itself from the typical robbery of the film, giving us an understanding of the characters' personalities and their motivations - his plays are as important as the drama and thriller. Relationships play a big role, and kidnapping is imposed on them, with the result that we get two films for the price of one. <br /> <br /> John Servays plays the role of the man Tony Le Stefanua (always called “Stefanua”) with such world fatigue that he could just get out of Camus' novel. Tony has only recently been released from prison and resists re-entering criminal life, until he experiences an extremely unpleasant interaction with his former lover (who has met with another man), where as a punishment he physically beats her with a belt. Fortunately, this scene happens outside. camera, but you are unlikely to forget about it. After this sobering event, since it seems that there is little hope of reviving this relationship, Tony meets with two of his old accomplices in the crime, Joe and Mario, and decides to join them in one last major theft. They enlist the services of Cesar, the Italian safe cracker - performed by director Dassin himself - and we are going to the robbery. <br /> <br /> The robbery passes without a hitch. But Caesar’s penchant for disentanglement is a personality trait that turns out to be fatal to all concerned. However, we can understand his appeal to a nightclub singer he fell in love with, because there is a brilliant scene where she performs the sexually and cinematically inspired act of a nightclub - this should be one of the most memorable scenes from any noir film. br /> <br /> It was previously established that Tony has a close relationship with Joe and his family; in fact, son Joe calls him uncle. I think partly, to help Joe's family, Tony agrees to the robbery. The final scenes where Tony saves the life of the kidnapped son Joe partially redeem him for more violent and immoral acts. But only partially.
