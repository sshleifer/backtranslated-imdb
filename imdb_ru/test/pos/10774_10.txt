This movie is just awesome. He manages to be provocative, funny, tragic and cinematic, but at the same time claustrophobic. <br /> <br /> Although the memories are not needed, the film retains an extraordinary, sharp grip, and all the performances are excellent, in particular Alec Baldwin and the fascinating Eric Bogosyan as the film's anti-hero Barry Champlain.
