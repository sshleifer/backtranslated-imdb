I was surprised and touched by this emotional film that really touched me. I was embarrassed, sad and happy at the same time. I think too few people will pay attention to this film. But I hope that at least a few will see it and get something from it. The story of two friends associated with their physical disabilities, who (as a team) defeat the health insurance system and fight for their rights. This film shows a side that some of us will never understand, not too exaggerated, but emotionally presented. We hope that this film will help us better understand some of their desires and understand how important it is to have a friend in the world, especially when you almost can not express this fact.
