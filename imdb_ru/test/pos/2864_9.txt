Well, I've tagged this spoiler, so don't be discouraged when I wrap it. Now I entered the film, expecting to see a very predictable film. And I was right, since almost every horror movie I’ve ever seen was predictable, but not as bad as most. What helped is the story; I did not expect what would happen to “WHY” Kane’s madness. But it was and, although a bit foggy, you still understood and understood insanity. Now, of course, if you like something that will scare you for the coming nights, this is not the movie you are looking for. But if you're a fan of Saw or some other films that claim their fame for their sadistic content, then this is a movie to watch. Now, where I am really adding a spoiler for a second warning. I give this movie 9, perhaps because I'm a WWE fan and a Kane fan, but who doesn't like the movie a little better when the people we love are shot. However, this film could score 10 points if I were. ,, (spoiler) ----> At the end of the film, when Kane died on the asphalt. While the dog was writing to his eyes, it was “CUTE”, it could be classic if Kane / Undertaker quickly sat down and turned his head. Ideal 10 would be awarded if this happened. It was a great opportunity, but either WWE did not think about it, or the future continuation would begin with the very sequence I mentioned. It's all. (9)
