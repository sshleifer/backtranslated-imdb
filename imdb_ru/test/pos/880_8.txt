Jewel Thief - Bollywood crime thriller, and why not be? The director of the film is Vijay Anand’s biggest crime thriller in Indian cinema (Johnny Mera Naam and Tisri Manzil.) I could watch this film for any of the following reasons (in order of importance): <br /> <br /> 1 The direction of Vijay Anand 2 Music by R. D. Berman 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Lyrics of Majrooh Sultanpuri <br /> <br /> Even if the movie "Jewel Thief" is not a Bond movie, he probably has tied children . Helen, Tanuja and the mysterious Vyagantimala (and some cameos). But our Vinay (Dev Anand) sauce is not Bond at all. He gets out of control most of the story and goes where the story leads him almost always as confused as we are. He even flirts with Anjou (Tanuja), trying to hit her romantic nerves, just so that he can get a job at her father's store. <br /> <br /> Dev Anand can play a double role - well, I don’t want to spoil your film, otherwise I would tell you. That's what most of the mystery is about. Dev Anand works in a jewelry store, and when he has to be at work, a robbery occurs, although he is not there, or at least he has the perfect alibi. I wonder who did this, this is Dev Anand as "Vijay", the man he calls himself, or this is "Amar", which we have not yet seen, but many people claim that he is like him. “Shalu” (Vijayantimala) comes, who even declares that he is her fiancé, in a tense situation Dev Anand has to prove that he is Vinay, and not Amar. While everyone is wondering whether Dev Anand is Vinay or Amar, he is asked to remove his socks. Amar, we are told, has 6 digits on one leg. While we are holding our breath we are witnessing the events that are about to unfold, Dev Anand even finds time for jokes. <br /> <br /> Real brothers, director Vijay Anand and actor Dev Anand, have a lot of films between them, but this is not the best of them, but definitely the best in the crime thriller. <br /> <br /> There are times when Hitchcock is north of northwest, but the films are very different. Except for the confusion about who is who, the treacherous female leader and a lot of travel there is not much in common. Dev Anand may well be Amar in addition to being Vijay. People have seen him, they identify him wherever he goes. There are too many such people to be frauds. Finally, Vinay believes that it is better to be Amar to find out what truth is, and this is a sad mistake. He is too deep into it, only to be rescued from the turns of Cinema. <br /> <br /> When I watched a movie as a child, I was definitely not surprised, the final confused me completely. Even now there are details about the ending that I don’t like, but I still recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Even as a child I liked the songs that this film has to offer. "Yeh Dil ..." is a definite song of idlers in the voice of Kishore Kumar. I could hear "Rulake gaya ..." all day. The same goes for Aasmaan ke neeche, which is set “under the skies” of Gangtok (at least, the plot line suggests this). “Raat akeli hai” is one of the sexiest Hindi songs featuring Tanuji as a seductress. "Mary Taraf Deho" - Helen's cabaret, and we "look at her." "Hoton, pe ..." - now, maybe there is some better thriller song than this one. As the song progresses, we strain more than ever, and the words “hidden in the lips of Shalu” add to this.
