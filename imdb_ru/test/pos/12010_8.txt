When I watched this movie, I was surprised how much he “captured” me. No, the actors did not behave like typical Hollywood actors, but this is also not always bad, as this film proves. Totally different from the Disney standard, it's a refreshing twist, though! They also give you an idea of ​​what it was like without being “educational.” A film that everyone should see and enjoy. Many people like to argue about the "accuracy" in any film of this type, but just to get the main idea there is something to offer. Soft grip; East and West Germany, if you look at any map, have West Germany on the left and East on the right. From time to time the film slightly throws you back, because about half of the scenes have West Germany on the right side of the screen, and others on the left. Even during the same events, they move back and forth. Perhaps just a little more consistency would avoid this easy distraction. Go look!
