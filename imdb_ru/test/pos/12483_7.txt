This film with such love made you want to be part of it forever. The films are direct, but not without malicious intent, the products are transparent, and there are almost no villains. Even the "cabaret" is so naive that it makes you dream with nostalgia compared to what is available on TV. Bli√®re is fine, if a bit one-sided. Louis Zhuv is perfect, you just can't have better copper. He has the best line: "My dad cleaned the dirt of others, and I do the same." Suzy Delaire is unbearable, but I think that in part these are the songs, the wardrobe and the hair. Simone Renant, on the contrary, makes an excellent femme fatale, although she is silent a little. I did not realize that she could be a lesbian, as IMDb users correctly suggested and others.
