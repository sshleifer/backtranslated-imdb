Stan Laurel, as noted, first made a real name for himself, appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s. He certainly demonstrates himself as a great comic actor and performer here in “Mud and Sand” (Rudolph Valtino's parody of “Blood and Sand”), but I think that such a film really does not work because Laurel was a great satirist, but because it allows viewers to jump into a comedy that is already familiar with the situation and the scenes. Laurel can then let go with his inspirational jokes without the need to create a context or do without it. I watched it the day after watching the movie “Blood and Sand”; this certainly improved the experience, allowing you to find out what and where is being parodied. <br /> <br /> The scene where the character Laurel (rhubarb Vaseline, if you believe title cards, or Vaselino's rhubarb, if you believe what his name says on the blackboard) plays his mother out of money using the trick “two for you ”,“ two for me ”is ridiculous in itself, because it’s a great idea, but it’s very funny if the viewer is aware of how he draws air from Valentino’s extravagant and melodramatic promises to give his mother any luxury she wants. <br /> <br /> This is the best solo work of Stan Laurel I've ever seen. It's just fun - especially if you had a chance to see the source material.
