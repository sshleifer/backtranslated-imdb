Attracting 2.6 million viewers, one has to wonder what everyoneâ€™s opinion is about the storyline / plot. <br /> <br /> Reading a dilapidated life, I believed that it would be your last thriller about how a single mother is persecuted and, finally, confronts the pursuer. Unfortunately, I was wrong. While the main story is interesting enough - a single mother runs off the road one night and then is pursued by the same guy, but the reason for the persecution leaves nothing but a really bad taste in her mouth. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton plays the victim, and she does it well. Whether it was all these years at Melrose Place or not, in this film she succeeds, playing a mother who will do everything to protect her son from harm, and she also looks good these days. <br /> <br /> Leighton is really the only good thing about this movie. I think that many people identify themselves with the main character, having learned why the persecutor pursues, it will be just one kind of film.
