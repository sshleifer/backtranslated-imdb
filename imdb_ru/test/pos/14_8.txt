I attended the preview of this film, not knowing what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than unforgettable acts & movies. Although the basic “common” storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher demonstrated powerful performances, playing very well with each other. The human weaknesses and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; The scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the most memorable emotional moment of the film. The “concrete” storyline was an education in itself, depicting a personal sacrifice and demanding physical training that rescuers of the elite coast guard must undergo in preparing their only work and responsibility ... to save lives at sea. The special effects of the scenes of salvation were extremely realistic and "stunning" ... I have not seen such evil seas since the "Perfect Storm". One of the main roles, Clancy Brown (“Carnival” by HBO - glad to see him again) was played by the Captain of the Coast Guard in Kodiak, based on Alaska, in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the necessary and necessary ice water in his veins. The film is wonderful and, finally, gives a long-awaited endurance and respect for the coast guard; audience applauded at the end.
