This elegant little film demonstrates the solid virtues of time, place and type of masculine power, which we no longer have or even do not. Holy - paladin with the best motives, not to mention flawless vocabulary and diction. No need to increase the volume or read the dialogue. George Sanders is so charming and, yes, restrained that all this talent, intelligence, physical presence and, above all, manliness, seem, well, almost normal. Some normal! George Clooney cannot begin to master the scene, as Mr. Sanders does (and does without robbery of Mr. Clooney). He could play slyuntyad (witness "Ghost", Mrs. Muir and Rebecca), but when he was good, he was excellent. Truly, a man for all the reasons and seasons.
