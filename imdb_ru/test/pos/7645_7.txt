This is a quirky film about robberies and robberies, which at first seems predictable, and then continues to surprise to the last scene. The main character is a fraudster who goes to work at a small carnival, where he is paid to kill the dancer's wife who lives with the dancer, Divan, and eventually falls in love with her. She is tempting, cunning and deadly, and she disappears again and reappears like a magician's trick. Other details of the film include her double-faced husband / employer (played by the talented Armand Assante), several nasty Dominicans and, most importantly, a plot, a suitcase full of money. Just like in the old "shell game" in which you need to guess under which pea you will guess who has money, and, like the hunter victims who run such games, you will probably guess wrong, Dagma Domino, like the beautiful Divan, is a talented performer and vigilant, whether she dances with a huge snake around her shoulders or works on all the unhappy men in her orbit. Norman Reedus is good as a young conman who is bewildered by the elusive beauty that he was paid for the murder. Do not count him, however, because he turns out to be smarter than anyone has ever believed in him. This weird movie is worth seeing.
