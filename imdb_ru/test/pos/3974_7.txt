(Synopsis) Bartleby "B" high school graduate Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college for training. He was able to speak and get out of every problem he faced, but he could not charm him by passing the college admissions office at eight colleges. His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby was not accepted to college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several Bartleby's friends are in the same position: they are rejected by all the colleges to which they applied. To satisfy his parents, Bartleby offers to create his own college with an Internet site. They turn an abandoned psychiatric center into the Southern Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However, the site says that we accept someone. On the first day of school, they suddenly had a large number of accepted students, who were also rejected by all colleges. With a million dollars in tuition, Bartleby has to turn his fake college into an active one. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as dean of the college. The fun begins when they develop their own training programs, set their own rules and hold parties all night. <br /> <br /> (My comment) The prerequisite for creating a college without faculty is a little outside the wall. Since it was a fake college, Bartleby really didn't need staff. The film reminded me of the classic film “Animal House”, the college atmosphere, fraternity, many jokes and pretty young women. These new college freshmen had a different idea of ​​what college experience is. The film is not only a lot of humor, but also a good message for life. People need to achieve their dreams and create a passion for what they want to do in life, and not agree to what other people want them to do. The ending was a bit unreal, but it's just a movie. The film was made for a young audience to have some fun. (Universal Pictures, runtime 1:32, PG-13 rating) (7/10)
