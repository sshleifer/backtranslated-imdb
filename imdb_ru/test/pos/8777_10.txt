Hitchcock once gave an interview in which he said that he likes to film scenarios in which an ordinary person went about his business, accidentally hitting a terrible chain of events from which they cannot get out until the sneaky conspiracy behind their problems begins. solved. Thus, viewers can feel more sympathy for the hero. We, of course, do in this beautiful film. Barry Kane is only trying to help his brother, showing kindness and care, for example, helping Fry to pick up letters that he threw at the factory. Barry even returns a lost $ 100 bill to Frya later ... it was GREAT money in 1943 !! It is the Christian good deeds of Barry that put him in trouble, and soon he is mistakenly accused of sabotage and murder, and most likely he will be hanged if he cannot clean himself. Like the plot "39 steps in the plot", the hero travels over rough terrain, where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by the Nazi cells, a villain whom no one could believe that he was a secretive Nazi, and beautiful blonde Patricia Martin, who suspects and hates, and then falls in love with Barry Kane. Hitch's signature touches are also here. Patricia is a billboard model whose various roadside advertisements help Barry when he goes with the bad guys, from Las Vegas to New York. We meet with a truck driver, who acts in a comedy with one person: "Someone convinced my wife that eating three times a day is stylish." Field workers at the fascist spy ring grumble about being "forgotten" or ignoring "costumes", as if they were working for some legitimate business. takes it off really with good guys and accidentally kills the mesmerizing patron of the film. Awful for a dead old man, but funny! Hitch loved to use famous monuments in his films, and this is the best example with the Statue of Liberty as a background and an ironic icon! This works even better than the Mt Rushmore scene in NBNW.
