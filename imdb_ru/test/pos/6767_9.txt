Ok, so I usually don't run out and shoot foreign films ... especially foreign dark comedies. I think that on the one hand I can count the number of films that I found really funny from beginning to end. This movie will be added to the short list. Even dark comedies straight from Hollywood sometimes turn me off, because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor. But this time my eyes filled with tears. My sides hurt. I have not laughed so long for a long time. This film was recommended by my mother, and I don’t think I’d even dream of watching it if she wasn’t thrilled. Do not be afraid to read during the film - you miss a fun, well-played film.
