This film will surely not go well with some, because most of the horror is mental. But this one has something for almost everyone, including a couple of really cool kidnapping scenes with aliens. The film widely uses the mythology of alien abduction, and at the same time it demonstrates a little more information about some aspects of the abduction myths than one would expect from a movie. Gillian McWirter is superb in what should have been a grueling performance.
