This film is without a doubt a vivid example of British humor that the Germans cannot understand. The one-liners flare up in the film, generating one of the greatest series of films in British cinema history (the holy Tritans). The history of bureaucratic incompetence in the background of post-war trials allows Frank Launder to direct the maximum of talent from all the actors. This is probably the only film in which Margaret Rutherford meets her match for Alastair Sim for a convincing characterization (although she still wins). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis both deserve mention in the Daytona masterpiece of English etiquette and tight upper lip under pressure. <br /> <br /> No fan of Rutherford / Sim / Grenfell would have been without it in his collection. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83 minutes.
