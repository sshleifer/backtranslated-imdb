Anyone who says that Lucio Fulci is not one of the most important names in spray history is probably crazy. Italian director - a legend among fans of terrible horror, and his work surpasses the barriers of the genre (who can forget his western, criminal or fantastic movies) This is probably his terrible film, and, unfortunately, one of the last. The horror director (Fulci, like himself) begins to hallucinate about horrific murders. At this time, the doctor begins a long chain of serial crimes. With such a plot, the film was supposed to be filled with something. And there are rotting corpses, broken or melted heads, slaughters, beheadings, chainsaw dismemberment and many others. Bored sometimes, the film is saved by excessive violence, which will definitely delight the bloody drug addicts.
