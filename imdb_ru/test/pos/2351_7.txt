“Hollywood Cavalcade” is a slightly fascinating film of 1939, in which two main characters from Fox of the 20th Century, Don Amech and Alice Fei, were shot, and in which there are a couple of jokes. <br /> <br /> The film tells about Max Sennett’s type Michael Connors (Amech), who leads Hollywood actress Molly Adair (Fei) and shoots her in a big silent comedy, which ultimately leads her to more dramatic roles . He becomes extremely successful with her as with his star. Obsessed with his job, he is absolutely shocked when she and her lead man (Alan Curtis) run away and get married. He is so shocked that he throws her. She and her husband are leaving and continue to become more and more popular, while Connors Studio is starting to lose money at an alarming rate. Before you know it, he is through. Molly wants to help and asks Connors to shoot her next film. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of Keystone Cop videos, which is pretty funny, and a fantastic farce from Buster Keaton, which is great. The film also has a scene from "Jazz Singer", when the speakers take the stage. Of course, the joke is related to Rin Tin-Tin, for whom Zanuk wrote. In one scene, Coach Rinney introduces him as a potential contract player for Connors Studios. Connors throws them both out of his office. A few scenes later, Rin-Tin-Tin is shown to be box office No. 1. The role of the famous German Shepherd in this film is played by Rin Ting-Ting Jr., dad, who died in Jean Harlow’s arms in 1932, hesitating for one month 14th anniversary. Fortune smiled at him even at the end. <br /> <br /> Alice Fay is very beautiful and does an excellent job with her work, as does Amech, who turns into an energetic performance. J. Edward Bromberg and Stuart Erwin have very good support. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is not quite sure what it is - history, comedy, romance or drama. Nevertheless, the "Hollywood cavalcade" is still quite watchable.
