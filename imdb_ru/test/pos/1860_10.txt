I believe that the reason that this film did not receive the recognition it deserves is that many misconceptions about Darwin, for and against. I would say that this is a real man without infertility. He is what he is. Although the film is just a snapshot of a person, the storytelling technique has extended his life far beyond the years covered in the film. This is a deep film, a reflection on modern life and how we think, and can provoke the study of a person whose thoughts (and others who used it) certainly influenced our lives. There are films in which the historical context is so great that the main task of the actors is to stay away. The story carried the day, and the actors did their job. Good job for them, I say.
