This is one of the paradoxes of wartime Basil Rathbone’s anti-Nazi war films about Sherlock Holmes (Voice of Terror, SH in Washington and this one) that, although the plot and setting is mostly terrible, it’s so good at them. Despite a bizarre, wind-blown hairstyle designed to make him look younger, he pierces every scene with so many bites and attacks that you hardly notice how flimsy the stories are. Here he also has an excellent acting relationship with Lionel Atville, who makes the monstrously disgusting Professor Moriarty - a heavy cockroach with a lid and pleasant hints of sadism and debauchery (perhaps this is not a game, children). At the climax, disguised as a lab coat to drain Rathbone's blood “drop by drop”, he is as sinister as Sinfeld Newman’s sworn enemy. The film itself is an ancient fare of a children's matinee, but it benefits from the director Roy William Neil’s attention to the production and atmosphere. It also looks quite sharp in recovering UCLA to DVD - don't even think about buying any other edition, they are all faded, changeable prints of public domain.
