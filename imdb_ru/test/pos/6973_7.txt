** SPOILERS ** A simple film about ordinary people whose problems are too complicated for them. <br /> <br /> Natalie aka Sarah Ravenna, Shirley Knight, overwhelmed by family life and the fact that she is now pregnant is straw, which breaks the camel's back. Leaving her home in Long Island, New York, Natalie has no idea where she goes, but hopes to find peace and tranquility somewhere in the heart of America. It is on Pennsylvania Highway that Natalie picks up Kilgannon’s hitchhiker Jimmy “The Killer”, James Cann, who seems just as lost and confused as she is. As Natalie, who at the time called herself Sarah, soon learns that Jimmy had a serious concussion, playing football in his team of collages, and turned into such a simple person who is so passive that allows everyone, including later in the movie . Natalie, step over him. <br /> <br /> At first, sympathetic Natalie is very annoyed because of Jimmy's self-pity for not interceding for herself and allowing herself to be used as a rug for everyone with whom he comes into contact with the movie. Not knowing what to do with Jimmy Natalie's child-like child, he finally gets a job in the distant state of Nebraska as a cleaner at a pet store in the Reptile Jungle owned by Mr. Alfred Tom Tom Aldreg. Being a kind and simple-minded man, he Jimmy releases all animals from his cages, which leads to chaos in the pet store and dismisses him from his boss, Mr. Alfred. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Natalie, who thought she was finally done with Jimmy, returns to the Reptile Jungle when she is given a penalty for speeding from Gordon's road police officer, Robert Duvall. It seems that Mr. Alfred is also the acting district judge and is the person to whom Natalie must pay a fine for travel. While all this is happening, Gordon, a policeman, is very fond of Natalie and wants to get her in a bag, in his trailer, at the earliest opportunity. Gordon, a widower with an uncontrollable 12-year-old daughter Rosalie Marva Simmet, needs a mature woman, with lots of love, to make him forget many social and psychological problems, and Natalie is exactly the medicine that the doctor prescribed! <Br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** A wild and shocking finale with Gordon completely going insane and trying to rape Natalie, who abandoned her drunken achievements, which is why Jimmy finally got out of her miserable daze and came to her rescue. There can be no happy ending when Natalie saved from the fact that Gordon was raped and raped, but Jimmy, who jumped up to Gordon like a ping-pong ball, died as a result of all his good and noble efforts. <br /> <br /> Jimmy was the most tragic and responsive person in the entire film. All Jimmy wanted was a friend with whom he could talk and spend time, and all he got was a damnable end of stick. To everyone, even to one person who at first treated him with kindness and understanding, Natalie Ravenna! In the end, Jimmy, despite the fact that he was treated like mud, despite his willingness not to offend even those who bypassed him, turned out to be the nicest, kindest and at the same time heroic person in the entire film.
