I was at friends' home for Thanksgiving and watched a DVD with the Eddie Monroe movie. I have been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years (I loved the McMullen Brothers) and was impressed with how good this film is. A friend of mine who works at Magno Sound told us that this film was shot at Super 16. The photo was so good that it looked like it was 35 mm. Besides, the music combined with the guidance of Fred Carpenter by art. The storyline was original and led to the finale, which surprised us all, watching ... very cool. The acting of the whole cast was good, especially the actor who played, Uncle Benny. He was awesome. This film was a pleasant holiday gift, and I was glad to be one of the first to watch a movie that many will see in the future.
