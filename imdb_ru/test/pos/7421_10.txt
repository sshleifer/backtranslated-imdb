When the long Happy Ever After came to an end, his characters, Terry and June Fletcher, were restored for a longer and more popular sequel, Terry and June, although their names were changed from Fletcher to Medford. <br /> <br /> Terry got a new job, and as a result, he and June move to Purley, where they end up with all sorts of scratches - unwanted guests come to visit at an awkward moment, the boss invites himself to dinner, and Terry tries to try his hand on DIY , but cocks it every time. One IMDb user called this show “not smart” and “never well written.” Fair enough, it was not smart, but it was all meaning. As for “never written well” - some episodes were rather poor-quality, I admit, but in general I found that it was very well written, very funny and very well played. <br /> <br /> It was a warmhearted farce, no different from the later BBC comedy series “Maintaining Appearance”. Eight different authors contributed to nine episodes, giving the show many opportunities. Terry Scott was a comic genius, as he gave a good account of himself in such productions as Hugh and I, Go on and, of course, here! June Whitfield was also a legend of comedy in itself. <br /> <br /> I like some modern shows such as “Still Game”, “The Catherine Tate Show”, “Legit” and “Empty”. I even liked “alternative comedy” - “Naked video”, “Young” and “Gifts for comics”, but I am more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy such as this one. The humor you don't need to think about is great when you feel depressed and want to get up. For the record, “Terry & June” was great stuff. Of particular note is a memorable melody that caught the mood of the show very well!
