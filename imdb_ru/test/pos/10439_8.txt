I don't think I will include any spoilers, but if I do, I can cover my ass. The “Last American Virgin” came at a time when such teenage achievements / sexual pranks were enthusiastic. Films like Prepies (1984), Hot Times (1974) and popular Porky's (1981) brought a lot of money. However, it is “The Last American Virgin” that actually has a more serious storyline among nudity and sexual situations. This is often a story told about three high school students who want to lose their virginity. To go to the wrong places (prostitutes), to dangerous (an elderly woman with a jealous guy) and to comfortable (to lure her school colleagues). There are a lot of funny moments in the film, and although the actors have not shot a single movie star, it's worth remembering the fantastic soundtrack of the 80s, which includes: Devo, The Cars, Journey and others. By today's standards, standards are unjustified and could get an NC-17 rating, but this is a well-told story that sometimes personal fixation can bring only pain, whereas love can be right in front of us. This is a small piece of the Americas of the 80s, which is worth having in its collection of films.
