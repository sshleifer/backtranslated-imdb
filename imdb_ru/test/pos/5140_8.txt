I took a group of young people of the same age as the main characters, and we all liked it. I agree with another post, Wilson's boyfriend turned the ungrateful script into a wonderful minor character. It's good to have a movie for a certain demographic age (too old for PG, too young for R). It also shows how they think and maneuver in high school. You should have loved how well Jimmy Buffet did as a great teacher. He did not let us sleep adults. The level of interrogation of children was maintained at a reasonable level. Their motives were specific and not similar to some of A.D. rebel. The setting and the music were beautiful. In general, if you like the holes, it really looks like.
