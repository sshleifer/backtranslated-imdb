Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson were great in this movie / musical. Ms. Andrewsâ€™s introductory song "Whistling Away the Dark" will always be in the back of my mind. The plot line during the First World War is great and tense. If you are a romantic, you will love this movie. This is a film that I always enjoy seeing again and again.
