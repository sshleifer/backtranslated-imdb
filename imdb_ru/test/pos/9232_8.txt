Someone once determined that such a definition of INTELLECTUAL as: “A person who can listen to the“ William Tell Overture ”without thinking about the LONE Ranger!” In this we wholeheartedly agree! Of course, it would be difficult to do this, and Leopold Stokowski, Arturo Toscanini or Leonard Bernstein would be almost impossible to do. <br /> <br /> And this is no shame. Radio series and television series, along with some movie series, feature films, syndicated newspaper comics and comics, have contributed to making “The Man in the Mask of the Plains and His Faithful Indian Companion Tonto” a deeply seeded element of our collective psyche and our literary folklore. <br /> <br /> As is the case with most legends, it all started gradually, first with a series of radio shows written for local use in Detroit over WXYZ radio. The creator was one George W. Trendl, and the main author of the series was Mr. Trendl's brother-in-law, Fran Stryker. It was 1933, when the ranger first traveled to the “plains of the early west of the United States!” The Lone Ranger, Tonto and Radio Series successfully led the Americans of the Depression era in the middle and late 30s until World War II. But the Post-War Era found a country at the height of the Supernova Explosion of Inventions and Technologies. A new communication medium was ready, but it could not work until Victory Day and Victory Day were achieved. Once this is achieved, the world and America will be ready for peace and prosperity. New technology, of course, was TELEVISION! And we probably need something else besides "Roller Derby" and "Wrestling From Marigold Arena" to fill the broadcast hours. And although at first, when there was something on the television station, besides the portrait of this leader of the Mohicans (Test sample, Schultz!), Very soon and with a hasty network, they began to use their existing natural resources, their existing programs! Almost everyone will be ready to adapt to the TV screen. <br /> <br /> So the guys from Lone Ranger, Incorporated were very interested when producers Jack Chertok, Harry Pope, Sherman Harris and Jack Vrather approached them with an agreement to put Masked Man and Tonto on television waves and also on the radio. <br /> <br /> Immediately they went to work and gave us the first season, which used a significant backing magazine Radio. Dramas, all potentially adaptable to television dramas. They shot Clayton Moore, a great supporting actor in many feature films, with a decade of experience. He also worked on the series at Thrill Factory from Republic Pictures, which would have been an invaluable experience in the Lone Ranger. Being his “loyal Indian partner” and partner in providing justice in different parts of the Frontier, we have achieved absolute perfection in the role of actor, supportive character, Jay Silverhills. ** We have to mention that this gap happened around the 53rd when Clayton Moore went and was replaced by John Hart. After a season or so, Mr. Moore came back again, he was missing so much! Now back to our story! The first years of filming gave the episodes their own look and sound. They used the off-screen narrator well, which gave this show a sense of authenticity and individuality, distinguished by a TV series of its kind. All the actors involved were veterans of films of a later era of silence until the 1930s and 1940s. Many of them were simply “Cowboy Movie” players. A good example of this is the casting of Glenn Strange (bartender Sam from "GUNSMOKE") in the role of the evil, murderous gang leader Buch Kavandish. And it was the Cavendish gangs of the Texas Rangers that resulted in John Reid (considered dead along with other Texas Rangers) being killed as a "lone ranger". <br /> <br /> In addition to the old timers in the cast, you will find many new and new talents (then) in the cast. We see people like Phyllis Coates, Dwayne Hickman, Denver Pyle and others on the set from week to week. All this, along with always a call for fair play, justice and peace in the Western world. <br /> <br /> The past few seasons have brought some big changes. First was the use of Color Shooting. It did not matter, because the color TV was still far away for our home. The second was a new set of music themes and queues. (Except for the Rossini finale from “U NO Wutt!”) New music has never been a big problem for us, as we preferred the material from the “old radio”. <br /> <br /> In this series and two feature films During this period, Lone Ranger (Warner Brothers, 1956) and Lone Ranger and Lost City of Gold (United Artists, 1958), this character was invariably and indelibly impressed by our personality as a people, we Americans!
