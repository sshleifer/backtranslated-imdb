Fantastically written, acted and produced! I liked to see this brilliant, talented cast - each one - gives such a great performance. This film has thoroughly warmed my heart lobes! Great storytelling! <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for the Black History month. Full of accurate portrayals of recent history and very real characters who endured incredible pain - with dignity and faith in a better future. It is so easy to see how all these diverse adults have influenced this child and contributed to a fruitful imagination that ultimately feeds his adult life talent. Next time you're in the company of a listening and watching child, remember; show or he may be a writer in the process!
