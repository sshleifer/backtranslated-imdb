The stupid saying, “You can't touch it,” certainly applies here. With the release of all the horror films and sci-fi clones, as well as all the worst remakes, it’s hard to find something worthy of 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics, which scared me to death when I was a teenager. <br /> <br /> A thing, without the slightest doubt in my mind, is the most terrible, the most disgusting, poignant sci-fi classic of horrors that John Carpenter ever made or any other director (sorry, even you, Mr. Spielberg) . What really gives him strength, however, is not blood (this means that it is mucus and blood, and God knows what other liquids are), but rather a feeling of fear, isolation and distrust that it causes to the characters and the viewer. <Br /> <br /> You cannot be more distant than Antarctica, and in this howling, freezing white setting, history happens. Several Americans, researchers and military, are stationed there. One day they see a Siberian Husky dog ​​running for dear life from the gunmen of Norwegians. Before they learn about it, the American outpost fights with a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature that it wants. It can turn into disgusting bloody mucous forms before it ends, but as soon as it ends, if you do not see it in the process, you will not be able to distinguish it from people or other normal animals of Earth. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, Kate David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Mazur, Donald Moffat, TK Carter, Thomas Waits and Charles Hallahan are just some of the great actors. This film is the reason why horror can be a great genre. It really still scares me. Alien blood, “jumping out” of a petri dish, when it is touched by a hot wire, makes me jump !!! <br /> <br /> Yet the worst of them.
