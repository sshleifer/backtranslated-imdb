Oh my God!!! Have you ever thought they would make a movie about it? Well, I knew they would, but I didn't know when !! and now finally here! when I received it yesterday by mail, I put it in my (evil) stereo system that plays DVDs, and immediately my huuuuuuuuuuu smirk appeared on my face when a cloud appeared (looks good ... great !!) followed by all the other Fascinating characters from the final fantasy game! including TIFA and AIRIS, my favorites .... (they are also pretty) graphics drove me off track !!!! they were really amazing. so real down to the last hair !!! The storyline is fine, a bit confusing, especially since my version of the film was in Japanese, but, of course, being a fan of fantasy for a long time, I did not mind, I just read the subtitles !!! all the characters speak as they do in the game, and Renault and Grub are still funny. dragon scene is also angry. just looks so good !!! anyway .... the graphics were awesome .... the storyline is fantastic .... and the main idea is even to have a ff7 movie ....... genius !!!
