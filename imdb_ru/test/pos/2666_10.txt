Instead of writing a paragraph, I will give four compelling reasons why 2001 is the greatest cinematic experience of all time: 1) This is a visual odyssey that can only be told on the big screen. The special effects that conquered Kubrick with his only Oscar are the most amazing effects up to the age of the Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to give an accurate (or, at least, the most accurate) description of space travel today. The silence that fills space scenes not only serves its purpose as an exact science, but also adds the mood of the film (to be discussed later with HAL). The fact that Kubrick filmed moon scenes before landing Apollo is a fearless, but feasible move. Many said that after the release of the original it was a favorite film about the "journey". I can not remember any other film in which there are such amazing visual effects for its time and even of all times (excuse the fans of the phantom threat!) 2) Kubrick’s directorial style is amazing. As in all his films, Kubrick loves to use his camera as a means to study the psychology of his characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other great people, such as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches as the story unfolds. Persons are a key element of the Kubrick movie. As in classic films such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the faces of the characters to give the viewer a psychological point of view. Even he uses extreme close-ups of HAL's flaming red “eyes” to show the coldness and determination of the computer-based villain. I could continue, but in the end Kubrick in his style. 3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in cinema history. I fully agree with the opinion of the late Gene Siskl on HAL 9000. Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and darkness of the space itself, a feeling of isolation is created. Dave and his crew are isolated between Earth and Jupiter, and they have nowhere to run. Combine this mood with the cold, calculating actions of HAL 9000, and you will get the most terrible villain of all. I still, although I have seen this film several times, feel that my chest is tightening in a certain scene. 4) The controversial end of 2001 always distracts people from this film. Instead of trying to express my opinion on what it means and what my idea is for the value of 2001 as a whole, I would like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to keep the film open. Kubrick said he intends to make 2001 open for discussion. He left his value in the hands of the viewer. Respecting the public, Kubrick allowed his film to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful discussion about the past, present and future of man. The charm of 2001 is that the ending does not have to mean anything deep, it may just be a plot explanation, and the whole film can be viewed as an exciting journey into space. No other film, with the exception of the great citizen Kane, leaves himself open for discussion, as in 2001. This is a truly surreal journey, in which not only the eye, but also the mind. Instead of waiting for the long line for the Phantom Menace, hire a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.
