On more than one level, I can relate to what is happening in this film, very personally. And all I can say about this is that it’s true that Dexter’s mom tells Erica at the end of the story: he really “cured” her son, removing his sad feelings and his loneliness. <br /> <br /> This film emphasizes a philosophy with which I can fully agree. We all die sooner or later. After all, this is not the amount of time we live, but the fun / good times / happiness we have during this time. It is not quantity, but quality that matters. <br /> <br /> I believe that all the other words used here will not allow you to watch this movie anymore, if you have not already done so. I really would like it to be released on DVD. Definitely it would be added to my “classics of all times” right now!
