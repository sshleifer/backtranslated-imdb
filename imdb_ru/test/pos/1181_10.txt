Films do not always involve deep, provocative thoughts. Sometimes they are simply meant to escape from reality. Out To Sea is perfect for everyone. <br /> <br /> The frivolous romantic comedy “Golden Years”, “Out of the Sea” may not have a big budget, you can easily determine when they performed in front of a green screen, but this is still a movie worth watching. Sweet movie to give a break. <br /> <br /> This is just good, light fun. This should not be a deep film. This is something worth seeing. If for nothing else, you should see this because of Brent Spiner's humorous and intense Oye Como Va performance. Gil is a character you love to hate, and Mr. Spiner shoots a perfect evil comic film to two of his favorite comic films.
