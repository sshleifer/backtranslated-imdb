Every Sunday is a short story for eleven minutes, which tells about the talents of two young contractual juvenile players who will become notable players in the future. It is interesting and interesting to see the contrasting styles of Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin when they perform at the Sunday concert for Uncle Deanna. <br /> <br /> Of course, no one knew how big both these young ladies would be. I always wondered why Mayer left Garland and allowed Durbin to go to Universal. LB. He always had a pretense of culture, and this guy had Jeanette MacDonald in his studio, and later he hired such beautiful soprano voices like Jane Powell, Ann Blythe, Dorette Morrow, etc. this is a high price. Dinna, Abbott and Costello, as well as several gothic horror monsters have preserved universal paintings. She was smart enough to reach the top and make her hold on. <br /> <br /> So, in the days of their salads, Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland.
