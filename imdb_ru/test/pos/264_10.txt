I rented it to my local because it was the only new British film available this week. I never heard of the director and his other films (thanks to IMDB). At about the same time, someone shot a good young British comedy that wasnâ€™t filmed by Hugh Grant or forty-something. History is a story about morality, but it is never preached, it gives pleasure to young and fresh actors. Cameo Luke Goss was surprisingly very good, but then he surprised me with his excellent performance in The Blade. I really liked the color gradation, especially in nightclubs. Here is great music and a truly original voice. Nine out of ten and worth the rent.
