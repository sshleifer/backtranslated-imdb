If you value your freedom! <br /> <br /> For the first time, I became seriously interested in the defeat of The Branch Davidian after reading an article in the British magazine The Fortean Times. Wanting to learn more, I rented this documentary and, having watched it, was stunned by what I saw. This film has aroused my interest in this topic, and since then I have read several books on this topic. This film is a must-see for people who know only the facts that are reported in the so-called “mainstream” media. The blatant lies, double conversations and contradictory statements of officials and politicians shown in this film will make you think twice about calling people who question the government’s actions in this fiasco, “crazy”, “crazy” and “fraudsters”. <br /> <br /> What’s scary is that I know some people who consider themselves “intellectuals” with open views and freedom-loving “liberals” who are still convinced that the government did the right thing in Waco, and refuse to watch this film or read any of the books on the subject. They continue to insist that it is not worth their time, because all his propaganda is love of arms, hatred of Clinton, a religious fanatic, right-wing anarchists. One publication from an organization consisting of many so-called “great minds” who claim to be dedicated to promoting “reason”, “common sense” and “rationalism” condemned the film, claiming that it would poison people's minds, and strongly recommended that film. They even hinted that Davidians were expecting this. I will not name him, as I am a coward. If you are one of those who read this (of course, you probably will not read it anyway), I can only say that it is a shame that you will not open your mind.
