The end of time is probably as close to the perfect movie as you can see outside of Hong Kong. All the elements click: a terrific script (French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courto), who even manage to destroy the odd cliché, the reliably imaginative Johnny To guide, and Andy Lau and Lau Ching Van's superb central performances, the latter demonstrating great comic time to achieve amazing effect, not crossing the parody line (especially in his irritated reaction to his boss’s terrible negotiating skills). The supporting cast is also good, with Yo Yo Mung making a strong impression in a tiny role, and even often the historical Waze Lee (looking great and very apt, like the bald Andy Lau) gives him a good effect. Better not to know too much about the plot beyond the basic setup ?? just a few weeks of life Lau is involved in a criminal game with Wang's policeman with no obvious motive ?? and just sit back and enjoy the ride: it is definitely worth the fare. He also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent films and played in just three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of filmmaking I've ever seen). There is also a good account of Raymond Wong. The most fun game of cat and mouse in the movies for years.
