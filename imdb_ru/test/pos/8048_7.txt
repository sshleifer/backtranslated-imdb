Epic early film, director D.V. Griffith. May Marsh, her younger sister, and their dogs are orphaned - they must live with their uncle. On board their coach is a young couple, Lilian Gish and Robert Harron, celebrating the birth of their first child. The trainer arrives at Elderbush Gluch. Uncle Marsha tells her that she cannot keep dogs, and they are thrown out. There are Indians (Native Americans) nearby; and Indians love to eat dog meat (no kidding?). These Indians are hungry! Lionel Barrymore is sympathetic to Miss Marsh, wanting to help her find the escaped dogs. When rescuing puppies they shoot an Indian, which leads to the confrontation "Cowboys against the Indians." <br /> <br /> This “Saga of the American West” is certainly an important film; however, Griffith's trusty performers begin to replay their hands, and the story is too contrived. Many of the Griffiths elements are in place - some are good and some are bad. The Battle of Elderbush Gluche foreshadows a later epic, The Birth of a Nation. <br /> <br /> ******* The Battle of the Elderbusch Gorge (03.28.14) D.V. Griffith ~ May Marsh, Robert Harron, Lillian Gish
