You need to be careful who to talk about watching 12-hour movies. It can be easy for people to assume that this is some kind of regular phenomenon - in fact, even in the world of arthouse cinemas, such gigantic running times are extremely rare for obvious reasons. This is the only thing that unites Hollywood and art cinema: the generally accepted duration is 90-120 minutes, with a smaller number of films that are decided to come closer, but rarely exceed the three-hour mark. <br /> <br /> For this reason, a movie like “Out 1” (playing time: 729 minutes) is a challenge even for the most avid movie fan, and he explains why he was shown only a few times and remains extremely difficult. to find. <br /> <br /> Originally coined as a television series by independent director Jacques Rivette Nouvelle Vahe, he aroused little interest from the French networks, and instead he had to make a short theatrical production (Peter Watkins was forced to do the same with his brilliant pseudo-documentary film about the nuclear war "War Game", although it was more connected with state censorship than problems with time). Shown a couple of times in 1971, Out 1 reappeared in several Rivett retrospectives over the past two decades, and many who have seen it, including respected American critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, have recognized him as one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> Is this true? Well, yes, if you like Rivett. One is a big “if,” since Jacques Rivette was never a commercially successful director. Only two of his films were hits (Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991), both are great), and many of them are still difficult to find on DVD (Exit 1 has only recently become available on the Internet after a rare The video has been uploaded.) Nevertheless, he is highly respected in the cinematographic community, and for good reason, his playful surrealistic tales, sense of rhythm, and the use of improvisation distinguish him as one of the most unique and satisfying cinematographers. <br /> <br /> Out 1 deals with a theme that is repeated throughout Rivette’s work: the nature of the action, especially in the context of theater and improvisation. His passion for acting makes Rivette films a much more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries, because the improvisational aspects allow actors to play a much more active role in determining how the film gets together. Output 1 is roughly divided into four main narratives, gradually intertwining and blurring as the film develops: two consisting of active groups, each of which tries to invent Amoeel’s postmodern theatrical versions of the plays; two other separate petty thieves (performed by the icons of Nouvel Wagen, Jean-Pierre Leodault and Juliette Berto) use eccentric methods of making money; and a comprehensive conspiracy, including a mysterious conspiracy inspired by Balzac, centered around an organization known as "thirteen." <br /> <br /> As with any Rivette movie with a “conspiracy” story, riddles and secret organizations are little more than red herring. As characters slowly explore and unfold, and their plans and interpersonal connections fall apart, the film becomes more and more symbolic after the madness after 1968 and the decline of the ideals of that era. For a film made in 1971, these were surprisingly predictable topics; another French director from Jean Yustache will equally satisfactorily address this topic in his 1973 masterpiece “Mother and Whore” But this is not the limit of Out 1. <br /> <br /> Consisting of eight episodes of about 90 minutes each ( At the beginning of each episode there is a brief, abstract black-and-white still montage of the events of the previous chapter), “Exit 1” is no less noticeable than any high-quality series, and it may even be better perceived one episode at a time. This is not to say that this does not remain difficult, even when viewed in segments. Like most Rivette films, he uses the first few hours to simply install characters before proceeding with the plot, in some ways, and some of these early scenes (especially sequences depicting "very distracted" actors' exercises) seem infinitely long . These scenes are important, however, not only as a study of improvisational acting, which plays a literal and metaphorical role in the film, but also as a way to adapt the viewer to the somewhat slow pace of the film. Paradoxically, but long shots make long films much more tolerant for the audience, and this understanding of rhythm led Rivette along with more modern directors, such as Michael Haneke and Bela Tarr, to create films with shorter commercial time, which less, retain the ability to leave the audience delighted. <br /> <br /> In the film, which largely talks about acting, the acting is fantastic. Many famous faces of the Nouvelle Vague appear, including the aforementioned Léaud and Berto, outstanding Michel Lonsdale and Rivette regular Bulle Ogier. Even another legendary director Eric Rohmer has a great cameo in the role of Professor Balzac, who appears on a key scene. People and architecture of Paris c. However, 1971 seems to play an equally important role — cityscapes, crowd scenes and interested viewers freeze Out 1, a document about a place in a historic place. <br /> <br /> A little more than 720 minutes later, the film ends on an incredibly short, mysterious note; nevertheless, the tedious journey the viewer has made is so full of possibilities, entanglement and spontaneity, that one can forgive the desire to start everything from the very beginning or to see the next twelve hours in the life of these characters. For those who have watched a lot of movies and thinks that they have seen everything that an art form can offer, Out 1 is a reminder that cinema can have many more things that diverge in much more directions than existing ones agreement. For filmmakers, film critics and artists of all disciplines, this is something that should be protected.
