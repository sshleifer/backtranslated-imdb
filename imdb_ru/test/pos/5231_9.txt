The details in “The Great Trail” were so incredible that I felt that the film was made at the time when it represents. I have never seen vans that would be so real! They were large, loaded with accessories, and even felt as if they were filled with details under canvas covers that were never visible. Every speck of dust, every scratch, every shard was there. Modern computer technology will never be able to recreate the scenes of numerous cars when they move on the ground or in a circle to fight off the Indians. All cars were real, individual vehicles, each of which had its own team of horses or oxen. <br /> <br /> The clothes of the actors could not be more genuine. With the exception of John Wayne’s buckskin robes and the beautiful Margarita Churchill dress, the clothes looked very plain, torn or dirty in authentic form. Many actors and actresses were born before electricity and plumbing became common, and they must have felt comfortable with the environment. All Indians were real Indians, not white extras, painted in tan. <br /> <br /> Women of the old West had to be strong, because there was a lot of work. In each scene showing the work done by people from the car, women portray firewood, transport logs, etc. This realism was so natural that it was not perceived as a statement about the role of women of the day, and not a fact of survival. <br /> <br /> The plot of revenge and romance is played out well. Nothing is exaggerated or exaggerated. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, something was lost in Hollywood. No matter how much I like the fake landscapes and the controlled atmosphere of old films, “Big Footprint” manages to feel real above all. The more I see big budget films of the era of silence, the more I like them. I can recall several films of the 1930s, in which I saw the same magnificence as the best of the 1920s. If during the time of the cars the home movies were made, “Big Footprint” is what they would look like.
