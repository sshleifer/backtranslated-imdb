**A warning! Spoilers ahead with a small plot! ** <br /> <br /> “Italian Work” is not the best film you’ll see throughout the year, or perhaps even this summer. But it costs two hours, because he colors the lines, knowing their boundaries and not trying to surpass them. <br /> <br /> The film is the work of the actors. In a film about a team of thieves, people should have a good relationship with each other. Without this cohesive feeling, viewers do not believe in characters collectively or individually, and the film will never have a chance. But from the first scenes in which people joke and rummage around each other, penetrating the Venetian Palace, the right chemistry is evident. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are not new; This is your main gang of criminals, in which about half a dozen players, each of whom has a specific and defining skill. But each actor brings his goods on the table for his part. Weak acting and humor by Mark Wahlberg blend well with his mastermind role. Edward Norton provides an attitude and twists his mustache well in his dark role. Donald Sutherland is the father of the team figure, and he looks like part of a suave and old-fashioned thief who is still mentally unbalanced. Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def do nothing but the abilities of their character, but each of them nails these pieces. Statham as a well-coordinated driver; Green, like a techie with a chip on the shoulder; and def like a demolition man. Charlize Theron slips well into the part that does not require too much from her. Her first asked to go fast and look good. What it does None of the characters is so deep or three-dimensional, but in this familiar form of film two dimensions are all that is required. <br /> <br /> As the name implies, the film has a European sound, in the spirit of the “Bourne Identity”, in part because it was filmed in Venice along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. In addition, European talent contributes to rhythmic, cheerful music, which adds to the optimistic nature of the film and complements the understanding of the actors. The look of the movie is also perfect. Bright colors in all regions improve mood and add mood. Minis not only provide a funny variation of the car chase, but also work as a necessary plot device. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less straightforward. There are a few surprises, but they are more of a variety of quick and smooth turns, in contrast to the curved stud with lowered lips. Even with this, the film is accelerating. When the first act lays the foundation, everything progresses continuously. Fortunately, in the novel there are no breaks in the film, something that the film wisely avoided. There are no breaks for "real life". History has a purpose and passes this course without distractions. The lack of depth of character prevents “Italian work” from being more than a good movie about popcorn, but with all the complex details of planning a robbery, such excesses would reduce the pace and quality of the film. <br /> <br /> There are a number of implausible things that I thought about both during and after viewing. But the film is so pleasant that I did not like it, and I do not care. In the real world, most of the film probably could not have ended so cleanly. But “Italian work” does not occur in the real world. It happens in a stylish and carefree underworld that attracts insurgents in all of us. <br /> <br /> “Italian work” is a film in the full sense of the word. He does not claim to be an Oscar and does not contain a deep moral message. It provides pure entertainment from escaping and does it quite well. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: perhaps the best popcorn movie of the whole year. 7 out of 10.
