I saw this excellent documentary at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. He is extremely entertaining and very well thought out, drawing you into the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most ignored musical talents of the 1960s and 70s. While I was familiar with his more famous compositions (“One is the lonely number”, “Without you”), I learned about the brilliant letter and beautiful singing of this person. If you love music, you will find a lot to draw you into his world, which, unfortunately, is out of control, as his success has increased, and his past has haunted him. Sadly, he was nonetheless completely devoted to his family, and you will be so glad that you met this person. In fact, the profile is told in the personal words of Nilsson and his friends and colleagues (the virtual “Who's who of Rock”) who loved and respected him. Do not miss it!
