<----- Minor spoilers! -----> <br /> <br /> A woman becomes pregnant, but not from her husband. She develops “something” within herself, or at least her husband thinks so. They have many difficult times, while she is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The husband contacts the UFO professor, and with his help they are trying to figure out what is wrong with her. <br /> <br /> <----- Minor spoilers! ----> <br /> <br /> The story could have been a little better, or at least become less predictable, but the film is catchy, and my sister and I got the whole movie hooked without any problems. Acting is very good, and shooting is much better than usual if you compare it with your regular b-alien movie. The effects are good and something happens every second of the movie. The characters are really cute, and besides the stupid nurses on stage, they are all very convincing in their roles. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie, and I can recommend it if you like aliens / monster kidnapping movies! <br /> <br /> 7/10 - The story might have been a little less predictable.
