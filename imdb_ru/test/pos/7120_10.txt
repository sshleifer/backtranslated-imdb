There are several films that tell about things that I would understand myself, this one. <br /> <br /> After several years of fantasy role-playing, we broke up, and I wonâ€™t leave without feeling ashamed of what became: an idiot. <br /> <br /> You see, these things are truly canonical, it happens to everyone. <br /> <br /> At first you honestly create a character, and he dies after the first attack. <br /> <br /> Then you help a little with the constitution, and although you do, why not help with strength, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity? This, in turn, upsets the master of the game, who does not know how to deal with this invincible gang. And after a while it also bothers the players, so they begin to create more and more exotic combinations of race and profession, no matter how funny it is. <br /> <br /> I created a warrior monk Druidine, yes, not so far from the movie. <br /> <br /> And this is not all that can be said about the destructiveness inherent in the dynamics of this devilish game (think about the hunt for experience points), but just watch the movie, it shows all this - and, of course, its nonsense most basic prerequisites. <br /> <br /> For this, in turn, there is no better profession than the bard. I do not quite understand why, in the first place, the bard became a character, because the blacksmith did not. But as soon as he became one, he had to be displayed in the process of the game, that is, to make him fatal, at least in an indirect way. The banter over it never ends and rightly so ends. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not exactly a professional production, but I have not seen the best satire for ages.
