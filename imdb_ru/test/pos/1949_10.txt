I did not expect much from this film, it was just one of those films that I thought I would just watch, because it was on TV. I certainly underestimated this film. <br /> <br /> This is a guy who kills his girlfriend and brags to his friends. I was very pleased with the acting, they had good characters. It was a particularly wonderful scene when Feck (Dennis Hopper) and John (Daniel Roebuck) were talking to each other about why John killed Jamie. It's a shame to hear him explain that he wanted to feel control and here's why. But Fek loved the girl he killed. Feck felt remorse, but John did not feel anything, damn it, he was proud of what he had done. It really makes you think about people. Keanu Reeves did an excellent job as Matt, and Aiona Sky was good. It is strange to see her as a farewell in “Say something” and her as Clarissa. Every actor did an excellent job of acting. It was very nice for a change. It was a great movie, and I would definitely say I recommend it.
