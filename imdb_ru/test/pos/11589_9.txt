In Spain, a former sailor Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem) has suffered paralysis for twenty-eight years and is fighting in court for his right to engage in euthanasia through an association that protects freedom of choice and is headed by his friend Jena (Clara Segura), Ramona is introduced to a lawyer who defends his case, Julia (Belen Rueda), who has a degenerative, fatal disease; and meets Rosa (Lola Duenas), a lonely worker who is insulted by men. Their relationships change the behavior and attitudes of Rosa and Julia. <br /> <br /> Chilean Alejandro Amenabar, in my opinion, one of the best modern directors. His filmography, released in Brazil, consists of excellent and original films: "Abre Los Ojos", "Tesis", "The Others" and "Mar Adentro". Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain today. Their association gave rise to this sensitive drama on a very polemical topic â€” the right to perform euthanasia. This drama is never banal or depressive, as the script uses humor as a discharge valve in the most dramatic situations. The performances are excellent, the characters occupy and defend different positions in relation to this unpleasant topic. Dialogues and lines are very solid and smart. In the IMDb storyline, I noted that this film is based on the real story of Ramon Sampedro. Unfortunately, neither the film nor the DVD provide this important information. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Mar Adentro" ("Sea inside")
