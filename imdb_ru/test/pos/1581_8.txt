I know that “The Courage of Beauty” and “The Courage of the Virgin” are crappy films, and many people hate them, but I'm going to put myself on the bus here and say that I like them, especially “The Courage of Beauty” (or "). ). I watched it last night with several people behind the court, and I was surprised how well it went. <br /> <br /> Entrails is a type of crazy movie that you really just won’t find too much. most outside of Asia (especially Japan in this case). This is mainly rape / revenge with a reincarnated monster instead of silly shotgun kills, a motorboat loop or even a severed dad with a chainsaw ... That's just silly. Would you rather see a hermaphrodite monster with a funny little snake monster for a winker? <br /> <br /> FIRST FACTOR. sex monsters you like if you like Korman’s nuggets, such as Humanoids From The Deep. I don’t know, maybe this is a stretch, but I personally didn’t think that “The Inside of a Beautiful Woman” let me down as an avid fan of Asian libertines and strange bi-photos. <br /> <br /> Yes, I sometimes know some of My recommendations are not always tea for everyone (even for those of you who love the same garbage as I), but I support this. 8/10.
