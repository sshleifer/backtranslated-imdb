This is commented only because Serge Prokofiev (1891-1953) may not know at first how powerful the score is and how majestic these texts actually are. If you read the texts of Alexander Nevsky op.78, there is nothing here that in this song he is less than a witness of one of the most beautiful and touching scores in all musical literature. This film, with its accompanying score, holds a special place in the world, and this can be as true on the Internet as elsewhere. The composerâ€™s own web site, which is protected by his property, provides extra care, given that this score really deserves it. This is as deep for me as it is complete with such courage that you want to be who they called Velikiy Novgorod. This is a song about Alexander Nevsky. Yes, it happened on the Neva River - on the Neva River, on wide waters. There we killed the peak of our enemies - there was a choice of fighters, an army of Swedes. Oh, how we fought, how we defeated them! Oh! Smashed their ship From war to kindling! In this struggle, our blood was freely shed for our great land, our native Russian land. Hey! Where the spread-out screen was like an open street, through their rows, an alley where spears ran! We mowed the invasion of the Swedes, like a feather grass grown on desert land. We will never cede our native Russian land. Those who go to Russia will be put to death! Rise against the enemies, Russian land, rise, rise in your arms, great Novgorod! (Call for hands go further) Arise, you, the Russian people, in a fight fairly, in the battle for death, stand up, people free and brave, protect our beautiful homeland! For the living warriors great respect, the immortal glory of the soldiers killed! For relatives! Home, On the Russian land, rise, people, Russian people! In our great Native Russia there will be no enemies living. Climb to arms, stand up, dear Russia! No enemy should go on the Russian land, no foreign troops will raid Russia, invisible ways to Russia. No enemy will devastate Russian fields. (here, dear reader, we are asked to live forever with the following versions e) under the name "Field of the Dead" - I will pass through a snow-covered field, I will fly over the field of death. I will seek valiant warriors, my engaged ones, my strong young men. wild saber, there lies one, pierced by an arrow. From their wounds, blood fell like rain to our homeland, to our Russian fields. The one who fell to Russia by a noble death will be blessed with my kiss in his dead eyes, and to him the Brave boy who survived, I will be a real wife and a loving friend. I will not be married to a beautiful man, earthly charm and beauty will quickly disappear and die. I will be married to a man who is brave, Let me listen to this, brave warriors! (now to his conclusion with the entry of Nevsky into Pskov) In the great campaign Russia went to war. Russia suppressed hostile troops. In our homeland no enemy will live. to death! Celebrate and Sing, Mother Russia! In our homeland will not live enemies. And they will never see Russian cities and fields, and those who go through Russia will be executed! Great in our Russia, no enemy will live in our native Russia! Celebrate and Sing, Mother Russia! All Russia came with a triumph for the holiday. Celebrate and rejoice, Russian Homeland! - It should be noted that Prokofiev was under quite a bit of pressure from Stalin so that, if you like, to do well. This musical score was indeed very much approved by Stalin. For me, there is an undoubted beauty of how we love this world, and Nevsky tells about the Hero, whose attributes, like God, provide for all participation in this love. Really beautiful and secretive telling of the story of Alexander Nevsky.
