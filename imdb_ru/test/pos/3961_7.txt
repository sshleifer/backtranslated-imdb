This is a film for teenagers, and although you are watching it, expect some senseless things to be added here and there, but overall the film is effective, very effective, it makes you ask questions and makes you think that the story is rather contrived, but believable and makes you feel good about the sequences, this is not like his usual path. characters are pretty well defined and persuasive. Justin Long stands out among all the others and watches his speech, in the end he will convince anyone of this speech that he is simply magnificent in this speech. he needs to take on more serious roles, he is worth more than just films for teens. capture this movie and free yourself
