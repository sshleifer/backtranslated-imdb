I just saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival. The impressive cast of the director Neil Slavin includes William Macy (seen in Opponent at last year’s TIFF), Meatloaf (AKA Meat Loaf Aday, AKA Michael Aday), David Paymer and Laura Dern (also starring in Novokain, also this year Festival). <br /> <br /> Based on Arthur Miller’s novel of the same name, Focus follows a Christian but “Jew-like” Lawrence Newman (Macy), fighting hatred and anti-Semitism in his area. Between the Jewish owner of a shop on the street (Paymer) and his anti-Semite neighbor with cards (Meatloaf), Newman faces difficulties in resolving the internal conflict and the conflict around him. The blame for what you know is right, but does nothing, struggles with the desire to merge and maintain peace with its neighbors. Things get harder when he meets and marries Gertrude (Sod), which everyone considers to be a Jew. Gertrude teaches her husband a few things about how to judge books by cover. <br /> <br /> In the end, will Newman support the Jew or will he run away? Check it out to find out. <br /> <br /> The game was incredible. The letter was incredible. The cinematography was excellent. The sound was well made. From a technical point of view, the film was disturbing. Chilling. Emotionally intense. I found myself raising my knees a couple of times to the position of the fetus. I admire everyone who worked on this. I have not seen such a good movie for a long time. It touched me. Wow.
