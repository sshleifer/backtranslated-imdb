Well, I just disagree with past comments that have criticized this show. It seems to me that this show is amazing. (I mean, when Jasmine Weber was still on, and France was still alive, so he was addicted!) And I was surprised to learn that it was classified as soap, because it just does not look the same as soap in America Soaps here are just awful! At the very least, GZSZ films featuring real music and more believable storylines. In addition, the actions on GZSZ, for the most part, are quite plausible, especially with Josephine Schmidt and Felix Yasherov. (In addition, soap actors are among the most difficult workers in the business because they have the most complex work schedules). If his rating is so high, then he is doing something right; Soap in America is shown in the daytime and has historically always had the lowest ratings. Give GZSZ a chance! Believe me, this is good!
