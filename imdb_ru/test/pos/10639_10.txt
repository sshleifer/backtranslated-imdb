Some users do not understand which of the armed people descends the steps in the sequence of the “Odessa Ladder”. These people are not Cossacks, but regular army troops. <br /> <br /> Cossacks arrive at the scene a little later, and they are people on horseback who beat the sabers into the crowd. <br /> <br /> For experts on Russian history: correct me if I am mistaken. <br /> <br /> But there are several lines in the film that apparently no one commented on. After the capture of Potemkin, someone from the crowd on the shore says: “Kill the Jews!” This is only a couple of seconds on the screen, but it is there. <br /> <br /> How cruelly characteristic of history, not only in Russia, but in many other countries, immediately, thoughtlessly and instinctively, blame the Jews for any domestic problems! <br /> <br /> Other parts of the film may not be historical facts, but the protest against the Jews is too real. Comments, anyone? <br /> <br /> Also, why can't English speakers learn how to pronounce a name like “Potemkin” instead of “Potemkin”? In Russian, it is necessary to distinguish between two possible pronunciations of the word "e": "or" or "yo". Sometimes two points are used to distinguish between these two pronunciations, but usually you just need to remember the difference.
