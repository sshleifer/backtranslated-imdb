One of the many assumptions about Y2K was that the world would end at midnight on December 31, 1999. In the Book of Life, writer / director Hal Hartley examines the possible consequences of the new millennium Armageddon, starting with Jesus’s return to Earth on New Year's Eve, No. 99. This story explores the task of the Son of God, who must open in the Book of Life (now it is contained in a Mac laptop), in which there are also the names of one hundred and forty-four thousand good souls who will be spared on the last day. Jesus (Martin Donovan), along with Magdalena (PJ Harvey), arrives in New York to prepare for the fulfillment of the will of his Father, but he begins second thoughts; should he judge the living and the dead? Do they deserve what should happen to them? This is a bowl that he would prefer not to embrace at this particular moment, which inspires Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan), who fears that the fruits of all his hard work can be washed away at midnight, as he can only continue to work while there are people who cling to their miserable hopes and dreams. Artistically painted, a concept film, Hartley presents the story in an intelligent, thought-provoking manner, taking great care when working with a delicate subject to make it harmless to even the most ardent fundamentalist. The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is intriguing and stimulating, as well as the influence of their presence on those whom they encounter during their bodily stay in the city. This is an exciting meditation on the spiritual side of the fragile human existence and contemplation of what was predicted in the Revelations of John in the Apocalypse, the last Book of the New Testament. And there is logic in Hartley’s approach to the Second Coming; he maintains the aesthetics of the modern environment, using modified film speeds that visually give the film an ethereal quality. Christ imperceptibly wears a suit and tie, merging effectively with the population, while Satan’s clothing is a bit more casual, his appearance is somewhat untidy; he has a bruise over his left eye. Donovan is well played like Jesus, which gives a benevolent force and a sense of restraint in his character, which is very effective. This is, of course, a unique depiction of the Savior, and perhaps the best since the days of Max von Sidov in The Greatest Story Ever Told. He successfully conveys a sense of inner peace and tranquility, serenity, which is the essence in the heart of the character. And Ryan is fully occupied with his role as the Prince of Darkness; he has a distinct manner of speech and a resonant quality of his voice, which makes him absolutely fascinating to watch. His eyes are darkly perceptive, he uses this trait effectively with secretive looks and charming looks. He is a guy who can sell you something in exchange for your soul before you know what hit you. This is an unforgettable performance that contrasts so well with Donovan's image of Jesus. The supporting squad includes Martin Pfefferkorn (The Martyr), Miho Nikaido (Edi), Dave Symonds (Dave), D.J. Mendel (lawyer), James Urbaniak (true believer), Catherine Hardt (lawyer) and Anna Kohler (hotel employee). In his own unique style with the Book of Life, Hartley developed the perspective of the last days, which will be interesting, interesting and truly unique. He has a way to capture life, since it is not at all in the center, a method that works especially well with such a film. Relatively short for a feature film (63 minutes long), it is nevertheless one of the best in Hartley and more than worth the cost of admission. This is a film that will stay with you and, perhaps, make you think about some things that you may have hidden in your mind for later. And this is part of the appeal of this film; it makes you realize that “later” is likely now. I rate it 9/10.
