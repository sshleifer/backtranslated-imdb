Few people will argue that the main animation director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few who have this ability. <br /> <br /> (No. Too many people are focused on John Lassiter’s “amazing” ability to steal the plots of other films, turn them into beautiful puppet shows, and then they are praised as genius ... but I digress.) <br / > <br /> Miyazaki gives us film by film, which deals with important mature issues (usually environmental), and they have an intelligent script that even the most haggard viewer, who usually despises any animated film, could fully enjoy would give him that opportunity. However, Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these films - children. <br /> <br /> However, I can’t think of another director with this ability. Where else will you have a film where for three years (my nephew Link) will sit motionless throughout the movement, delighted, 7-year-old (my niece Amber), who loves it all on his own (and able to appreciate the "star" power "Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, a 12-year-old (my nephew, Aaron), whose review was "of course, it was good! Everything that Miyazaki-san does is good!" uh, it would be me), as well as a 58-year-old woman (my mom), able to communicate with mom's characters ( I bet that the older charms are too) and the characters' loving child’s wits. <br /> <br /> And this is what I respect Miyazaki-san most of all. He seems to be talking quite differently to his audience than an ordinary director. At first glance, “Ponyo” can be viewed as a simple story about a little girl-fish that knows the human world and wants to join him and his girlfriend, whom the little boy calls Tak ske (something like “Little Mermaid”) but here is a completely different level. True to their form, Miyazaki fills her film with extremely strong female characters. Mother Pono, mother Sousuke, elderly ladies in a nursing home are real heroes with their own mind and extremely strong will. <br /> <br /> But the girl who takes the cake is Pono herself. As soon as she decides that she likes the human world, she simply uses her will to achieve her dreams. Her father tries to keep her innocent and keep her a magical fish, but young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes a man by her own determination. <br /> <br /> Once she became a man, she teams up with her friend Sousuke, whom she loves very much (although perhaps not as much as ham). Sousuke is asked to be a man in the house (at the age of five) when his mother Lisa decides to help people in the rest home where she works during the typhoon that Ponio unintentionally caused in her desire to become human. Frankie Jonas (yes. He is related to the Jonas brothers. Can we just go through this, please?), Perhaps the best performance in the film, like young Sousuke (which is good, since he has the most lines). His character is also decisive, but also very respectful and friendly - traits that you can hardly find in the children's character on THIS side of the Pacific. <br /> <br /> In the end, Ponio's father, Fujimoto, has to cope with his daughter’s decision and so that his wife does not want her to be a man. He hopes that Ponyo and Sousuke "will remember him with love." And again, Miyazaki refuses to allow the character to become the stereotypical "bad guy." Although Miyazaki (for some reason) received some criticism for it, it is, frankly, what makes his films magical and at the same time attractive. No one in real life is completely "bad man." All people of different shades of gray. And this is exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. <br /> <br /> And then there is the animation itself. At a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the abundant number of shots with the effects in this film, especially with water, Miyazaki decided to include NO CGI in general. Of course, the drawn animation was digitally painted, but each film in it was drawn by hand, and I, for one, was extremely grateful for that. The character's animation was extremely smooth, and even it seemed that some lip synchronization was taking place (rather unusual for an anime film). The backgrounds seemed to be drawn in colored pencil and had their own influence on the audience. This is how the animation looks - and how it should look. <br /> <br /> In the end, I found Ponyo very enjoyable. Of course, not the best Miyazaki (in my opinion, this honor still belongs to Kiki's Delivery Service), but still a 10-star funny movie for the WHOLE family.
