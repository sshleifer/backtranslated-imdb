In the comedy film there is a thread that all the great comics just fall behind the law or go to jail. Think of the conman of this fraudster, W.C.Fields on the OLD FASHION WAY, or the Marx Brothers in NIGHT ON OPERA, or Chaplin in the PRINCIPAL Mei West in SHE DULY WRONGLY. Bypassing the law is inevitable, and when they are on the side of the law, the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and comic. Recall Lloyd in his first radio "WELCOME DANGER," trying to "help" the San Francisco police department at the height of the criminal wave and forcing police sergeant Edgar Kennedy to want to kill him. Think of Laurel and Hardy as ill-fated cops in the MIDNIGHT PATROL. I believe that this type of hostility is so patented in the comedy of all these giants (and their peers) that even a fake name for the film deals with it. Think of Jerry Seinfeld in one of the episodes of his series about creating the short film Three Puppets, SAPPY PAPPIES, in which boys end up killing them in an electric chair for murder. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton often uses the forces of law and order to be his opponents in his comedies. Look at the STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., Where he is trying to get his father out of the Calabus. But in fact, he had more conflicts with the police in his shorts. In prison, 13 he was dragged back to prison when he was mistaken for a convict escaped. In COPS (the perfect name - if you see it, you will understand) the police of a big city are constantly looking for Keaton, mistaken for a terrorist). And in “Goat” he cannot bypass the police for most of the film. <br /> <br /> Keaton is a vagabond who is just looking for food. But he was completely unlucky. When he sees a stranger throwing a happy horseshoe over his shoulder (which Keaton had previously ignored), and then he finds a full purse of money, Keaton tries to do the same and hits the cop on the head. The policeman pursues, and Keaton (as lucky as he would) encounters another cop, tries to behave normally, but eventually throws the other cop onto the path of the first one. Soon he was being pursued by three policemen. Shaking them briefly, he goes to the window in the local prison where the local killer "Dead Shot Dan" (Malcolm St. Clair *) is being photographed. Passing through the barred windows, Keaton is stupid enough to stop and look straight inside. Despair notices this and the ducks when the picture is taken. When Dead Shot escapes from the police, this is Keaton’s face on all the wanted posters. <br /> <br /> (* St. Clair will eventually become a successful director of comedies with silent and early sound, although in his later biography there is a limit of 20th Century Fox, where his work with Laurel & Hardy was less than nominal. br /> <br /> Keaton runs on a train to another city (disconnecting the cars in which his pursuers were located from the locomotive and tender). This is a movie (by the way) in which there are two famous jokes of Keaton. His arrival at the locomotive is made in the remote frame, closer and closer, and suddenly the audience sees Keaton sitting on a catcher for cows. <br / > <br /> The second known sequence comes later (and, perhaps, somewhat influenced Chaplin at the beginning of CITY. Keaton accidentally knocked out a man who argued too vigorously with a beautiful woman with a dog (Virginia Fox). When he sees that the poster he calls him a killer, he thinks he killed this man. In this city, he is being followed by a suspicious police chief (Joe Roberts), and for a moment he loses Roberts in the park. The statue "Man of War" is being built, and the sculptor represents the clay model of a horse). Keaton sits on a clay model, trying to preserve his dignity when the horse's clay paws begin to crumble under his weight. <br /> <br /> Keaton manages to meet the pretty Mrs. Fox, who invites him home for dinner. Only he does not understand that her father is Roberts. The last five minutes of the film are about Keaton escaping and avoiding Roberts while he and Fox left together. <br /> <br /> This is a funny comedy and a great example of Keaton's work at its best.
