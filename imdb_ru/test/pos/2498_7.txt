A love letter is one of my favorite books, so naturally I was skeptical about becoming a film, but I liked it. I found myself smiling across the entire movie. I admit that this is not a great movie, but definitely a pleasant hour and a half. I thought that Capshaw and Scott were beautiful, like Helen and Johnny. Just as I depicted them. And the city, and landscapes were just right. I recommend this movie, but don't expect too much, just enjoy it.
