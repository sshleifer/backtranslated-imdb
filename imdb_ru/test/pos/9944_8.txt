I noticed that many people take the opera on assignment for the way Betty responds to the killings. I think they base these complaints on how they think that a “normal” person will react. The fact is that Betty is not a “normal” person due to traumatic events in her childhood. She has problems before the film even begins ... and by the end of the Opera ... in my opinion ... she was completely upset. <br /> <br /> ------- -------------- SPOILERS -------------------- --------------- ---- You must bear in mind that when she was a very young child, she witnessed how her mother's lover committed at least one cruel murder when her mother-sadomasochist came out watching it. <br /> <br /> She was raised by a woman who achieves sexual liberation, bound, watching as the girls are beaten, cut and stifled to death. It does not make for a healthy home life. I think it is fairly easy to conclude that her mother would use all sorts of emotional manipulations and negative reinforcement to ensure that her daughter never teases her. It is also likely that in her impressionable age, Betty might have been deeply embarrassed by what she saw. This is what adults are doing, and so on. <br /> <br /> Betty obviously looks at her mother ... I mean ... she became an opera singer, as she did. If mom likes it, it can't be bad, can it ... mom can't be bad, can it? She could not tell the police about her mom or about this mysterious hooded guy she associates with mom. <br /> <br /> Betty has many deep emotional problems. For years, her mind tried to block memories of what she saw, how her mother did ... but she always surfaced, manifested in the form of horrible nightmares, pulsating migraine skull, dependence on relaxation techniques, and sexual frigidity . She associates the brutal violence / bloody death with sex on a subconscious level. There is an internal struggle between the part of Betty, who confused the murder / sex, and part of it, which believes that all this is wrong. <br /> <br /> After she saw her boyfriend killed by a man in the hood ... she calls the police, but does not want to call her name. The part of her that thinks the murder is wrong forces her to make a call, but the part that is dual will not allow her to admit her involvement. The ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go all the way. So she leaves the phone in the rain ... and when the director picks her up, she behaves surprisingly calm, not as upset as one would think that the "normal" person would be ... because the part of her that was Blocking Things since childhood have tried their best to block the horror of what she has just witnessed. <br /> <br /> The situation in her life contributes to a deadlock in the mind of Betty. Her singing career is beginning to bear fruit ... she will become a great opera singer, like her mother. But is she going to become like her mother in all respects? In dark ways? Or can she make her own way? Add this to the reappearance of the man in the hood who kills everyone around him. <br /> <br /> Only when a person in the hood kills Darya Nicolodi’s character, Betty does take an active part in defeating the killer. Here is someone who loves Betty, who sincerely supported her in her new career, and in fact is the mother figure in Betty's life now, since her mother died. Imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mother, and then see how the woman who is closest to your mother would get a shot in the eyeball. <br /> <br /> I could go on ... but I will not. The main point of what I say is that Betty’s character is much more complicated than most reviewers here are willing to admit. <br /> <br /> Opera is one of the best in Argento ... and not only for visuals (although they are really great), and not only for inventive killings (although they exist). There is depth ... and attention must be paid.
