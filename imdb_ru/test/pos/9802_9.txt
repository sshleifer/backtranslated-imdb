My view of the final. Bobby died at the hands of his stepfather. Mike struggled to pull out Bobby. Only a child would have thought that it would be possible to build a car capable of flying. Bobby died ... Mike survived as a child, creating an alternative ending in his mind ... about how Bobby left ... Mike created the plane that Bobby left. Children who are subjected to sexual and violent violence often create completely different worlds in their minds to survive. <br /> <br /> It was also great to see my old residential area. We called it San Jose Boulevard, and I lived right where they rented these houses. It was so strange to see that they rented in the houses ... and not in the studios ... It was my kitchen, bedroom and living room. And these hills ... we use them to hike in childhood ... looking at our little valley ... seeing glimpses of the bay. For me it was a real nostalgic trip.
