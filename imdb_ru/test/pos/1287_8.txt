I just finished watching “Follow” and thought it was great. I rated it as 8 out of 10. I plan to watch it again with the director’s comments, and then again in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I rented this film because I was interested in Christopher Nolan’s more recent film Memento The following has some similarities; this film was probably a Memento project. Even the music in some parts is very similar. <br /> <br /> Shooting a movie in black and white creates a mysterious feeling. History and dialogue are really good. Speech actors believable. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan made this film with a very low budget. I look forward to his next release, Insomnia, a big budget film with my favorite actor, Al Pacino.
