Since the war for the Soviet Union did not go well, Stalin took volunteers from prisons and used them as shock troops. This is the story of one such battalion. There are petty fraudsters, political prisoners, soldiers who were expelled from other divisions, the white-haired veterans of the White Army and some dangerous criminals. <br /> <br /> They are thrown into battle poorly equipped, not trained and face the threat of the NKVD, if they show signs of cowardice or failure. <br /> <br /> The special effects are rudimentary, and many minor characters are one-dimensional, but the general story is very human and exciting. <br /> <br /> I did not see the version with subtitles or duplication. To view the show, the free use of the pause button and explanations from native Russian speakers was required.
