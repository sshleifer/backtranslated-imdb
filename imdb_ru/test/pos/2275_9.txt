I entered the cinema, not expecting to see the film "Everything is lit." I came out with a joy that I barely felt in American films. Directorial debut of actor Leiva Schreiber. The film tells about a man traveling through the past, accompanied by an eccentric group, which includes a punk-English-speaking shell dancing from Ukraine, his grandfather, who considers him blind, and a crazy dog. The first half of the film is funny and clever with an unusually European flavor in the use of small but wonderful characters, and the second half of the film plunges into a dark history of discoveries and the Holocaust. This little film evokes so many emotions and colors, with such a wonderful conclusion, and this is more than just a story of enlightenment, but also relationships and connections. The action is incredibly powerful, the story is mysterious and interesting, as well as the artistic appeal of cinematography, for which it is worth dying. With some brilliant and absolutely touching scenes “Everything is lit”, I managed to win my heart.
