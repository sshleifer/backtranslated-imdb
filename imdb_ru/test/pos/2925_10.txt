One of the most enjoyable aspects of watching a movie is getting lost in the movie. So that he will completely wash you, so that you absorb it the way it is, and thus experience it to the full. Every time I see it, “Egyptian” is such a film. Over the years, this is a picture that critics loved to hate. Many threw darts into his vulnerable spots. But perhaps this is due to the very tone that the film carries, and not from its most obvious characteristics. It is simultaneously forbidden, remotely, possibly dangerous; beware of what is inside! The ghostly chords of the music, visible above the 20th Fox logo, reveal to us the names of otherworldly turquoise letters. <br /> <br /> Strange! Archaeological! Decadent! It is as if we are descending into some kind of repository of antiquity, in which there may be great treasures mixed with uncertain dangers. (It can be assumed that Darryl Zanuk commands: “Make it ancient!”). Then a dark, dramatic story unfolds, all in the same tone as in the beginning. <br /> <br /> From the Hollywood Egyptian trilogy of the 50s “The Ten Commandments” portrayed the severity of civilization, the phenomenal “Land of the Pharaohs” with its nuts and bolts, while “Egyptian” shows it all, from glamor to tragedy so we wondered. <br /> No need to talk much about the players here, but I think that over time Bella Darvi is redeemed. What a perfect face for the role, right from the picture of the Symbolists. If her actions do not suit some, it can be argued that in her role as a "courtesan" she is clearly better in bed than jerking with some poor helpless admirer. I think that Courtes captured the perversity of her sadomasochistic relationship with the character of Edmund Purdom with aplomb, censorship was what she was at that time. Sir Peter Ustinov, in his memoirs, was very kind to the "Egyptian", writing that it was "as lost in a huge set for Aida." His pronunciation of the word "beer" I took myself since (one of the historically accurate references of the film: beer invented by the Egyptian!) Henry Daniel, aegads, what a wonderful performance. Gene Tierney, what a treasure on the screen. Bless DFZ for giving her this “late” role. Come on guys, don't be so strict with Victor Metri! He is the son of cheesemaker! Who grew up to be Pharaoh! Sounds like a special American opportunity. One of the best moments: John Carradine's existential observation in the sands of time. And Purdom's statement about staying beyond the sunset of the world. If this is not an epic “A” degree, then what is it? <br /> <br /> Of course, along with everything else, the music is great. It is often noted that Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann created one of the most convincing scores on the screen, perfectly harmonious, but each theme is well developed, with its own life. Newman, whom DFZ insisted on being, called on Herrman, whom he could trust unconditionally to take on half the burden. <br /> <br /> Benny, not the easiest guy to work with, obviously, dear Newman, enough to really deliver inspirational music. They alternated replicas, a brilliant approach. There are no spoilers about who did what here, but Benny gives him an advantage, mysterious, amazing sounds. Alfred brings an abundance, longing, sharpness. Both are completely epic. Even if you look at a compressed television font, the effect of seeing the names of two composers alongside the main titles, which could be conveniently placed by an ultra-wide anamorphic screen, tingles the spine. <br /> <br /> Leon Shamroy, dean of CinemaScope, does not let us down here. Ominous green and capricious shadows (probably distortions in all the terrible television prints I have seen over the years) are perfectly accompanied by a multidimensional scenario (from the great Philip Dunn and the veterinarian Casey Robinson, whom Curtis must have brought with him to 20). It is noteworthy that Shamra, who was the same cinema institute in Fox as Newman did music, shot Cleopatra a few years later, but on brighter and clearer images of Todd AO of the 60s. These old guys from the studio are really my heroes. <br /> <br /> Who wants to worry about all the flaws and possibilities of criticism in such a picture? I would prefer to fully succumb to his charms and plunge into his sea of ​​generosity, to appear after the inspiring climax of “The End”, refreshed, moved and longing for more. <br /> <br /> And yes, we must turn to 20th-Fox for the release of a DVD worthy of the DFZ heritage.
