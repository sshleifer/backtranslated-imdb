This one is a terribly underrated gem with amazing performances and a fantastic ending! All the characters are great and the story was awesome, plus I thought the final was really awesome! The plot was great and I never got bored, plus, while the child actors were bad, they made me flinch! It happened on the space channel some time ago, so I decided to check it out and tape it, I read some good reviews from other horror fans, I have to say I agree with them, itâ€™s very creepy and hard, plus Stroter Martin was fantastic in his role of worshiping Satan. He has tons of creepy atmosphere, and it makes you guess, plus all the characters were very cute, and you really start to root for Ben and his family! There are many disturbing moments in it, and the film really shocked me from time to time, plus it is very well done with a small budget! This is one terrible undervalued gem, with stunning performances and a fantastic ending! I highly recommend it! The direction is very good! Bernard McIviti does an excellent job with this job, perfectly removes the camera, creates an eerie atmosphere and keeps the film at a very fast pace! There is some blood and blood. We get a cut leg, a lot of bloody corpses, a bloody slit throat, cutting and dicing, decapitation and piercing. Acting great! Strother Martin is just fantastic! since the worshiper of Satan, he is very creepy, very convincing, rather frightening, was extremely intense, seemed to enjoy and just did a fantastic job as a whole! ". Charles Bateman is great as Dad, he was very caring, very cute and gave a good show! I really liked him. L.Q. Jones is awesome, since the Sheriff, he was funny, besides everything else, he looked very young, had a cool personality, and on the whole just worked great! Ahna Capri is good as a friend and did what she had to do very well. Charles Robinson, as the Priest, outplayed to the extreme and never convinced me! And his laugh was especially bad. Jerry Reishle is really decent, like a daughter, she was a bit cute, and she was nervous a couple of times, I really liked her. Alvi Moore was stupid, but very cute as Toby, I dug him up! The rest of the actors do good. Overall I highly recommend it! *** 1/2 of 5
