It's 100% better than the third movie, and it's a damn good time. This John Hughes film meets Devil Rejects. I really liked this film, and it really stands out as the savior of the series. I thought that Jennifer Tilly played Tiffany very well, and Brad Dourif, in Chucky's shoes, makes this film shine again. In fact, they are the only good parts of the film. I was pretty bored with the scenes of Katherine Heigl and Nick Stable. It is as if they were thrown there as a supporter and someone to save the day. But Chucky and Tiffany were great to watch, and I really liked the black humor. I thought it made the film stand out more. If you want a damn good time, be sure to check it out. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
