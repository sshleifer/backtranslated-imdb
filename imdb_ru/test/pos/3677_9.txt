Below I will quote the words of my favorite writer Paulo Coelho as a commentary on this film. <br /> <br /> “When you really want something, the whole universe conspires to help you achieve it.” <br /> It is too easy to forget who we really are and what we want to do in of life. Because there are always too many comments and tips around us to talk about security. I almost forgot what passion is. Despite the fact that the adventure will take me out of the security zone, I sincerely believe that fear is the price I have to pay for the upcoming new journey in life. <br /> <br /> Thank you for inspiring me with this beautiful story. It is a blessing for me to understand what unconditional love is. This is the most secret love from the light of the soul.
