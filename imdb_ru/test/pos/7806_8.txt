This is a parody, this is a clever comedy, it has a bit of pathos and choreography (and do not forget that it is intentional), good humble songs, good performances of the whole cast, brilliant works by Amir, Salman and Pares and the whole script is so rare in Indian cinema, as in comedy (see David Dhavan, Harmesh Malhotra, etc.). The story consists of two wastelands, whose only goal is to become rich and famous by any means. They come across one such way when they find out that a rich NRI is coming to India to get married. The rest of the story tells about one person and how these riots try to compete with each other. The entire cast is perfectly played out right from Deven Verma to Vidge Hot. The songs are properly placed and fun. The surprise package is Salman, who acts with perfect timing, and it was this act that gave him the style of comedy. <br /> <br /> This whole sneaky movie, which you should not ignore, if you like to watch Indian movies.
