“What Alice Found” is the greatest film that no one has ever heard of! I underestimated it when I heard about it, and I thought it would be all sex, no conspiracy and just very stupid, but actually, it was really good. It is said that all indie films suck, but this “Napoleon Dynamite” does not suck. I asked my girlfriend, who saw it before her, and she said that Alice has all these three ways, and you see all this nudity, but no, I don’t remember either the three ways or the small nudity. The film had a meaning, and he taught me never to trust hitchhikers. I liked that in the end they got Alice a little dolphin. After all, on the road to Flordia. I fully propose to watch this movie.
