I just saw it on SIFF and I really liked it. There were parts where I laughed so hard that I could not catch my breath. The screenplay and director Glenn McQuade are fantastic. I can't wait to see more from this talented young man. Performances make a movie. Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are just as amazing as the grave-digger Willie and his apprentice Arthur. Ron Perlman turns into a fantastic performance (as usual), like a non-sympathetic prison priest. Bonus: Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor! As always, he perfectly combines threat and humor. <br /> <br /> This is a horror comedy style that hasn't really happened since Vincent Price starred in “Horror Comedy”, “The Crow” and “Theater”. Blood ". The movie is really scary in places, then it will suddenly return to a fun mode, keeping you completely unbalanced. Some parts are scary and funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> I can only afford to watch three films on SIFF this year, but even if the other two are terrible, "I sell the dead" was worth it. The price of all three. I will look for other films from Larry Fessenden's "Glass Eye Pix." He gives the horror genre an absolutely necessary blow to the ass.
