I saw this movie on television as Screamers, and I liked it. I heard an interesting story about this movie. When Roger Corman released it for filming in the summer of 1981, his trailer division sent out a preview trailer, which was not really the footage for the film. Allegedly, these were shots of a naked woman pursued by a monster in the laboratory. During the opening of the movie at the races angry customers complained that they had not seen the movie for which they paid. The owners of the theater called Korman and said that their clients feel deprived. Thus, Korman had to make copies of the footage and send a positive film to cinema owners, so that they merge into the film themselves. Since the footage has never been part of the negative of the film, it has not appeared in any video, on DVD or on television. Has anyone seen this video? Has anyone seen this movie in a car in the summer of 1981 remember this?
