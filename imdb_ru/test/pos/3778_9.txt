This film was one of three that were later combined by Chapin into a collection released for cinemas in the late 1950s called The Chaplin Review. <br /> <br /> In a sense, it was a strange film, because later in life Chaplin was anti-war, and his films emphasized the world and fraternity. This film, by contrast, is a propaganda comedy designed to support the efforts of the United States in the First World War. It is strange to see Charlie in the role of "super soldier", who alone captures 13 Germans, accidentally and coolly shoots several shooters in a few seconds as a shooter, and then goes behind enemy lines trying to capture the Kaiser himself! Truly, it was the main care for Little Tramp, although at the same time he was very exciting and funny. The film is exceptionally good, well shot, and I am sure that I did a lot to support our troops at home (too bad that it was such a meaningless and costly war).
