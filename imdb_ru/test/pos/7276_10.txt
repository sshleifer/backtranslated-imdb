If you like subtle psychological drama / thriller, this is the movie for you. Those who want to see the usual erotic thriller “Sex and the crime”, certainly will not understand this film, as, obviously, Colin Firth, when he called it “garbage”. But Jennifer Rubin is a real movie star. She is such a brilliant and beautiful actress! Along with the turn of the plot, which is becoming more and more psychological and makes you think about yourself, great direction, photography and especially music make this film a masterpiece. Also, the small details are very good, especially Belinda Weymouth is amazing in her small stage. I hope that he will be released on DVD soon, and the soundtrack album will become a dream!
