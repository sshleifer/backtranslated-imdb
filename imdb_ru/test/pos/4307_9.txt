Did you like The Dead Man Doesn’t Wear a Plaid? What about Top Secret and A Chorus Line? Well, Müllers Büro is a fantastic melange of all three, which may seem incredible. Very funny movie "tongue in the cheek" with great songs and great dancing. This film should have a strange sense of humor, but it’s worth seeing. I voted for it nine, If the end was a little more logical, he would get ten. That's how good that movie is.
