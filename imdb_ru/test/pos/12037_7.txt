The January television channel Turner Classic spent January filming one of my favorite actors, Robert Montgomery. His films are mostly rarely watched these days, with the exception of those that were not typical for most of his career - this means that the roles that often appear on television have THEY BE RENEWABLE, THE LADY IN LAKE, BRIDE, BRIDE, NIGHT MUST SAXON CHARMING, RIDING ON PINK HORSES, RAGE IN RAVEN, EARL OF CHICAGO (in short, the films in which he fought to get the roles because they were not the usual comic in which he usually appeared). The irony is that nowadays, when people think about Montgomery's career, these are films that were mostly made after 1937, those that broke the original image that MGM and Louis B. Meyer promoted. It is a pity that Montgomery was a talented comedian and saved a lot of films from the routine. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is one such film. Made in 1936 with PICADILLY JIM and TROUBLE FOR TWO, it was a momentous year of good performances by Montgomery, which helped him convince MGM to play Danny at NIGHT MUST FALL the following year. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is located in Labrador, and Montgomery is the operator of a weather station named Dascom Dinsmore. He lived there for five years and most of the time was not in company with a woman (except for the Inuit women). He has a kind of girlfriend named Clara (Winifred Shotter), whom he sort of suggested, but two years have passed since he found out about her, so he thinks she is disappointed in him. <br /> <br /> Dinsmore's world shakes when Sir James Felton and Irene Campton (Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy) appear. They flew to Toronto for a business meeting that Felton should have addressed. Felton is engaged to Campton, but Dinsmore finds her charming ... and gradually she finds him just as attractive. Of course, pompous, important and hopelessly inept Felton is not a competitor (it is a measure of Owen’s actions that makes the character entertained, even if it’s hard to believe that such a tit is the Canadian industry captain). /> <br /> There is something surreal in this film - perhaps because of the original play. Although the Labrador landscape looks rather fake, it serves its purpose for a comedy (see the sequence of polar bears). But the top of surrealism is a dinner that Dinsmore serves to his guests, a dinner from Pemmic steaks, which Owen eats with real pleasure. Owen (a petty nobleman, like a baronet) is dressed in ordinary clothes - a winter suit for climate). But Montgomery is dressed in a suit of evening dress (as if attending a ball at the embassy). Loy, seeing how he dresses up, also puts on a dress. They are serviced by Dinsmore's servant - Inuit Kimo’s assistant (Otto Yamaoka), who is also dressed in an evening dress suit - it turns out that it is Owen! Owen, who had previously insisted that Dinsmore wear his clothes more suitable for his place, is the only person who is not properly dressed for this dinner !! Montgomery was MGM's most elegant actor in a tuxedo or evening dress (Franchot Tone was his closest rival). The cinema is challenged if Montgomery or Fred Aster were a more elegant figure in such costumes. Hard to solve. <br /> <br /> In the comedy or drama the course of love does not go smoothly. Clara appears (we are talking too early at the beginning of the film when we see her on an ice ship). Is Dinsmore breaking up with Clara? Will Irene break with Felton? The film is funny, and Loy and Montgomery make a good pair. They appeared together in one other film, and both were in separate scenes a second before this film. But that would be their last movie together. <br /> <br /> Another interesting point is that at the beginning of the film, when the captions are shown, you see the illustrations of men and women in comic situations. They are based on the artwork of John Held, Jr., the great cartoonist / illustrator of the 1920s and 1930s, who was the record holder for the flopper and the Jazz Age. This is an unusual choice - because it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot of the film or the Labrador.
