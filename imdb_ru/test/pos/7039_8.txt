I liked this show. I usually left the pub ten minutes before closing time and ran along the road to catch it. I remember Daniel Peacockâ€™s sketch of Gandhi on newsstands as a masterpiece. Scenography and lighting were not from this world, creating an atmosphere in which you felt that you really live. V is unusual for comedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I met only one person (besides another reviewer here) who knew that this program exists. In fact, I have to thank IMDb for coming to the world and proving to me that I really did not represent the entire series in a drunken haze that I was seriously beginning to believe!
