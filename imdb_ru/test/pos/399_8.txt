Usually, Anthony Mann made westerns with the “big guys” - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda. List of cowboy stars. But in this B + film, he did something noticeably different to others and achieved great success with what turned out to be a truly unique Western. The protagonist, played by Victor Mature, is a hunter / mountain man, and they usually romanticize in the films - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson, this kind of thing where the hero is not really a typical mountain man, but a pure cut heroic figure that hangs out with real mountain men. Not here. This time, the true mountain man - the vulgar, rough, animalistic - is the central figure, and this is something to see, giving the mature man one of his best subsequent roles. True acting chops are provided by Robert Preston, excellent in the role of Caster Cavalry type commander, and James Whitmore, Spencer Tracy for the poor man, another one of those old timers who feel trapped between even more hostile Indians on one side and the counter force of civilization with other. Even more impressive is the very young Anne Bancroft as an officer's wife, who initially repels herself from the terrible nature of Matry, and then discovers that her own civilization escapes, when she begins to realize, to her own shock, that she is attracted to him. Rarely, if ever a remote frontier fort was so accurately implemented on the screen, without romantic charm, that John Ford gave such a place in his master Fort Apache. Sequences of battles are large-scale and especially cruel, and especially impressive, if you have seen them in widescreen format. A good show and an underrated film, all around.
