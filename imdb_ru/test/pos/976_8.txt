I can't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2 / 10? This is really great, very funny. I highly recommend this film to all of you, adults, teenagers and especially children! <br /> <br /> The story of a 14-year-old child who always lies at home and at school. Once he had a homework - to write a story of 1000 words. But he did not do that, so the teacher told him to write it and gave it to her after 3 hours, otherwise he would have to go to the Summer School. Yes, he wrote it at 2:45. “Big fat liar”, I think it was a story about yourself. On the way to school, he shot down a limousine of a famous Hollywood producer and gave him a lift. But the kid forgot the story in the limo. He told his parents and teacher, but, of course, they did not believe him. And the producer of the film, he took the story of the child as his new film “Big Fat Liar”. When the child saw the trailer for the film, he told his parents that he wrote it, but they did not believe it. So, he and his friend had to go to L.A to prove one thing: the truth is never overestimated. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this wonderful movie, you will not be disappointed. Do not believe the rate of 5.2 / 10, it should be 9/10! Believe me! <br /> <br /> P / S: Sorry, my English is not good enough to make a better comment!
