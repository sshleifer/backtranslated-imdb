Much time has passed since the last time someone made such a film. The so-called film B Maybe it was not a very good film, but it is interesting to watch it, a classic of Bruce Campbell, it has its good, funny, disgusting and even artistic roles. <br /> <br /> ****** Spoiler ahead ******* <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---- --------------------------------- ------------- -------------- ------------- <br /> <br /> The part where his wife as a dummy-avenger robot is going to die I don't know about you, but it made me feel so strange, so sad and disgusting in a good way. I compare this scene with the scene from Fly 2, where his dog dies like a monster. Makes you think of God. <br /> <br /> ---------------- ------------------- ------- ------------------- ------------------------ ------ - ------------------------- <br /> <br /> ******** no more Spoilers ****** *** <br /> <br /> If you are a Bruce Campbell fan, you will definitely want this film to be in your collection. If you are usually interested in cinema, you may want. Just think that the purpose of the film is to make you smile, make yourself angry (although don't worry, not so bad) and make you have a good time with your friends. Attention, I told my friends, it is not possible for the future girl.
