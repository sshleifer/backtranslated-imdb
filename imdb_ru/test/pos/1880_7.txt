(Some spoilers) It took Bruce Campbell about 19 years to finally present his masterpiece “The Man with the Screaming Brain” on the screen. But Campbell had to change his story, because of financial problems, he passed in Sofia, and not in Bulgaria, where he initially wanted to be filmed in Los Angeles, California. <br /> <br /> In the film, Beers Campbell plays the USA. Pharmaceutical tycoon Willian Cole, who travels with his rotten rotten wife Jackie Antoinette Byron to the former Communist Republic of Bulgaria. It is there that William wants to help finance the almost non-existent public transport system in Bulgaria. <br /> <br /> Poor William was not lucky to get involved with Tatoi Tamara Gorska and her ex-boyfriend Yegor Valdimir Kolev. Former taxi driver KGB. Two of them, William and Yegor, will unwittingly tear their brains inside William's skull due to Tatoy's jealousy and revenge. <br /> <br /> After the murder of Tatoy and William, and Egor, their bodies will be delivered to the mad scientist Dr. Ivan Ivanovich, Stacey Keach, from his faithful assistant Paul, Ted Raimi, for experiments with the brain. Dr. Ivanov has this theory that two heads are better than one. And now, thanks to the material available to him by William & Yegor, Dr. Ivanov will finally prove it. Doctor Ivanov, unfortunately, learns that when two heads or brains merge, their brain waves will overlap each other and force them not only to malfunction, but also to turn against each other! <br /> <br /> William, with the right lobe of Egor, merged with his damaged brain, is trying to find Tatuyu and make her pay for the damage caused to her and Yegor. Egor, for his part, stuck in the head of William, who loves and does not love, both in food and in drinks, is completely opposite to his own. This causes great tension and hostility between the two brains, who are fighting for control over William's body! <br /> <br /> Things get worse when Jackie learns that Tatoy killed her husband William when confronted with her in a dangerous situation. and the high criminal department Bravoda is called Gypsy City and ends up killing themselves. Returning to Dr. Ivanov as his assistant, Pavel, he decided that there was no body to put Jackie’s brain inside the experimental robot that Paul was working on. The operation is a great success, but the only drawback is that Jackie, with her brain inside the robot, has to recharge her brain every few hours! Or, like a real brain that lacks oxygen, it will die with the batteries of the robot. <br /> <br /> The combination of bolted balls in the style of the 30s and a horror film with William and Yegor turn the Bulgarian city of Bravoda upside down. in an attempt to find Tatuyu and make her pay with her life for the sad state of existence in which she introduced them both. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER WARNING *** This is Dr. Ivanov, who actually saves the day by discovering how not to let the two brains fight and, thus, cooperate with each other! He did this instead of combining brains. Dr. Ivanov maintains their independence by introducing a neutralizing cell wall between two non-performing balls of gray matter.
