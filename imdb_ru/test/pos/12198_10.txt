The surface is one of the greatest tv. I saw the series. The game is gorgeous, and the storyline is fascinating. Each episode left me with difficulty waiting to watch the next one. I especially thought that Carter Jenkins, who played Miles Bennett, did an excellent job ... he is a very talented actor, and I look forward to seeing more of his work. <br /> <br /> I canâ€™t believe that Surface made only one season ... the audience let me down again. It's hard to understand that such great shows will be canceled, while shit reality shows continue year after year. The one who made the decision to cancel this show really threw the ball on it.
