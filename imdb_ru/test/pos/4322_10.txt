This episode is still the best of the series. The story has been told perfectly. I especially liked how the authors made it an episode of Desmond; it was his best performance to date, and he definitely deserved Amy for his performance. <br /> <br /> In this episode we received answers to some of our questions, but since the show is called Lost, we know that there will be more questions. brought up too. First they answered: Walt finally reunites with his father Michael, secondly, Michael's betrayal is subjected to Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley, and because of this betrayal, Kate, Jack and Sawyer are captured by Others. It was a great way to complete the show. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the island, we see how Locke is experiencing mental illness with a button. This leads to another answer to the question of how the plane really fell. However, there are some unanswered questions: first, what happened to Locke, Eco and Desmond, when Desmond turned the security key, and what was the agreement with the Arctic scientists looking for electromagnetic annamoly. I think we will find out next season, no matter how beautiful the best show on TV ends.
