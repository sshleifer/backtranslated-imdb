The film has begun, the wheels are spinning, your car has entered the race against Fox ... You're back, you can't come forward, you know, "if I leave, I'll take you with me ..." You crash into cars parked on the side of the road roads, you turn to hit Fox, but your goal is bad ... Hit, you went up in the background Volkswagen and crashed that you landed in a pond. Your car lights up. You could quit if you like, but the shame of losing took you ... BAM! Your car explodes, everyone looks at her in despair, some cry ... The sound of a siren tells you that the cops are coming. Everyone sits in their cars and bolts, leaving you on fire. The burned remains of the car frame are sitting there, chasing the audience ... You're dead. <br /> <br /> This is one of the scenes; in fact, this is the first scene in the film. There are many more like this. When you enter Fox's booth in his powerful V8 Ford, Terri Serio in his crazy GTHO and many others in this blast from the past ... JOHNSON CLARKS masterpiece, "WORKING ON EMPTY" "at any cost-"
