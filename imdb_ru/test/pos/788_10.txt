This is a wonderful short comedy - one of the best in Keaton. Because of a long series of stupid mistakes, Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer. And, as a result, most of the film consists of the fact that he runs from the police and one detective in particular. Although in general I am NOT a fan of films with lots of chase scenes, this film is the absolute best in terms of sports and acrobatic abilities. I saw some who had wild stunts, but none where the star was so flexible and able to move with amazing grace. In particular, there is a scene where he runs across the table, jumps onto a person’s shoulders and dives through the transom as flexibly as possible for a person. In addition, many of these jokes are funny and well calculated, for example, how he really comes to the conclusion that he really killed someone. By the way, this film is VERY similar to COPS, also from Keaton, but quite original and has enough energy to make them both worth seeing. <br /> <br /> This film is Keaton’s brilliant and only short film that I can imagine from what I probably liked even more, was PLAYHOUSE - where Buster plays all the roles in the theater.
