Nice to see that I'm not the only person who remembers this wonderful movie. I have very fond memories of this film - it seems to vaguely remember when I was about 8 years old, and I watched children's TV shows after school (someone from Broom Cupboard?). It was the first and last film that scared me - and the images of a boy surrounded by mist on a hill will remain with me forever! Like most films of this era, he has a happy ending - aimed at children, but with a certain ability to attract the attention of adults. Beautiful Cornish landscapes really make the film feel isolated - and the “ghostly” scenes are simple, but very, very effective! I would like to try to find this movie again - see if it still hit home!
