How many movies can you remember when you see such a movie? I cannot count them, but it seems that the filmmakers tried to give me a hint. I was so often reminded of other films, it became a big distraction. One of the borrowed memorable lines came from the 2003 film “The Day After Tomorrow”. One line alone is not so bad, but this film borrows from so many films that it becomes a bad risk. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie! Despite its shortcomings, it is enough to make it interesting and, perhaps, make it smart. Borrowing so much from other films, it never goes overboard. In fact, you will probably find yourself smashing manholes and riding a storm. What for? ... Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I have never been a fan of Kutcher, and I almost became disillusioned with him in the Guardian, but he surfaced in a good way. Costner keeps the film smoothly with Costner's best abilities. I don't think Mrs. Robinson had anything to do with his success. <br /> <br /> Supporting staff played their part well everywhere. I had no problems with any of them in the end. But some of these characters were used too often. <br /> <br /> From now on, I can only find fault in order to save you from wear. Enjoy movies, parts that work, work well enough to keep your head above water. Just do not expect a smooth ride. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, but almost 6.
