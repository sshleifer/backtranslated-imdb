I was very sorry that this film wasn’t even popular in Hong Kong. However, for all Chow fans, this will be a masterpiece that should not be overlooked. This “Mo Lei Tou” (comedic style based on an unrealistic and ridiculous plot, first proposed by Chou) is at its peak. The plot is absolutely absolutely 1000 times funnier than any movie you can imagine. The dialogue is awesome. Not a single part of the movie will be cool for you to stop laughing. <br /> <br /> The plot looks simple, but insane, so that you start laughing. This begins with Chow, in which the junior judge (of course, corrupt), who is in prison, plays the main role, when he helps an innocent married woman he loves at first sight to free her from the murder charge of this plot by an evil minister, whose son actually was a real convict. Chow will escape from prison and run away as a refugee. He intends to go to the capital to see the emperor and report on the conviction. On the way, he manages to pick up 2 beautiful women, one from the circus, the other - a prostitute, at the same time mastering the highest ability to quarrel and talk badly with skinny mother-san (who, it turns out, is his future in law) reopen the case through the black mail of the Emperor, whom he met in a brothel. The emperor made him the highest level judge to judge the evil minister. He manages to create several brilliant but funny stories to make the convict commit a crime, execute him, and put the evil minister in jail. <br /> <br /> The plots are really funny and ridiculously brilliant. Also, do not forget about the grandiose dialogue, which includes some brilliant quarrel between Chow and Mama-san, a quarrel between thick Mama-san and thin Mama-san to inspire Cho to learn the skills of the quarrel later, and a quarrel between Cho and the angry eunuch Lee near the ending. In addition, some scenes are also great. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that in order to really understand the film and correctly capture 100% of all elements, it will be necessary to master it. Cantonese is really good. What could be the reason that the film “Chow at an early age” received a moderate response only from the Asian world. However, when the film "Chow" began to spread its influence around the world, fans like me discovered that his film was no longer as funny as it was in the old days.
