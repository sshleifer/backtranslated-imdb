The book “Children of the Railway” is a children's book, published in 1906 by Edith Nesbit, an early British socialist, who very firmly held the importance of family values ​​for the upbringing of children, and the story she told was supposedly intended for modernity. It is somewhat surprising, but it seems that it retains a significant attraction for today's children in a hundred years. <br /> <br /> The film-adaptation of the Edwardian classic children's story, in which the leading roles are played by children, does not sound very exciting. most movie lovers these days. But the really great performance was Jenny Agutter, who (at the beginning of her long and distinguished acting career) played the role of Roberta’s oldest girl (Bobby), combined with the wonderful work of writer and director Lionel Jeffreys and outstanding photography Arthur Ibbetson made this film by not to be missed, and which most of its viewers find very memorable. It is noteworthy that this book, shot in 1905, was shot five times in the period from 1951 to 2000 (four of them are BBC for British television), and all of these versions are not only admirable, but also highly valued (as confirmed by user comments in this database), although it may seem almost incredible for the history of the nostalgic period, intended primarily for children. Since I have not seen four television versions of the BBC, these comments relate exclusively to the 1970 version of the film, created for cinema shows. Unlike most films about children's books, "Railway Children" may appeal more to adults than children. The structure of family life over the last century has changed so much that many children may feel completely lost due to the way it is depicted in the film, while many older people may find that it has significant nostalgic appeal. Perhaps compensating for this, the children shown in the film are full of life and vitality, while the adult characters, although well-rounded, tend to be “stuffed”. This is a mature story, which tells about love, support and encouragement, it is not only timeless, but also able to please all ages. This can be fairly described as sentimental and more than a little idealized, but it is never in any way gloomy, and this rarely justified adjective “uplifting” suits it like a glove. <br /> <br /> Spoiler ahead. <Br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that the Edwardian family from the upper middle class celebrates Christmas in a comfortable and quite spacious London house when two unexpected visitors call and take their father with them (who is the senior government official). Mother is forced to move to a very small cottage next to the railway in a remote part of Yorkshire, and the children gradually build a new life, mainly connected with the railway and several trains that pass. This life turns out to be quite intense, and the eldest daughter, Bobby, is growing rapidly as she takes on more responsibilities from her mother. At some point, she prevents a train accident when her sharp eyes discover that a landslide created a natural hazard. Father's stories are never paid much attention, but they never forget him, and it gradually becomes apparent that he is imprisoned and suspected of treason. Finally, these suspicions cleared up (we were not told how or why), and he suddenly appeared at a local station to reunite with his family. <br /> <br /> For many years this film was not available in any home video format in North America, but Anchor Bay created a DVD three years ago, so they clearly realized that this rather simple film had not yet lost its attractiveness. For those who do not yet have one, I would strongly recommend to hurry to buy a copy of this DVD while it is still available - you are unlikely to be disappointed if you don’t become completely cynical, or your minimum requirements for the film include a bucket of blood and / or intense sex scenes.
