This black and white film hit the Spartan cinema of my Frisian village about 18 months after its release. In those days, most of our full-length comedy ticket hails from Denmark (Nils Poppe, anyone?), So this film struck like a thunderbolt — it made me cry from helpless joy, ROTFL, as we have just put it. Well, so some of the spectacles were actually reworked by the vaudeville 'schtick', but how did this "barefoot boy with copper cheeks" find out about it at that time? In any case, in my favorite scenes there was a unique type of crazy clown Jerry, for example, this boxing match in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> After seeing Sailor Caution again fifty years later, I was still shouting loudly what was going on. Of course, without the nostalgia component, it would probably be just another comedy in which you could find something in between. But then, another film that once made me remove the stitches even more helplessly — Spike Jones's Firefighter, Save My Baby picnic, now seems outdated and unjustified, with the exception of some too short bits of orchestra and Doodles Weaver scenes. It must be some special ingredient that makes Martin & Lewis product stay fresh longer. For me, this is at least eight out of ten.
