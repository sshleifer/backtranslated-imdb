I used to watch it when I was very young, then I watched my videos. Now I watch a DVD, I love it. Ray Winston - "Dude", the rest of the cast is good, and even with the change of Robin Hood, everything works. Great stories, twists and turns, and how they were filmed - to the inexperienced eye (not my training) may be misinterpreted as provocative, but this adds to the take-over of the audience. With the green hillsides and the contrast of the lush, sunny, lighted forest with dark corridors and dungeons of the castles - it's great. Personally, the final interpretation of the legend of Robin Hood. I can't stress how much I think you should watch it, if you have a chance, then you should watch it.
