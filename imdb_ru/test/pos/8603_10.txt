Black Rain is an excellent film, but donâ€™t miss out on the DVD, which is currently priced at $ 300 apiece. I have a DVD, and it's terrible. A very tiny non-amorphous image that needs to be enlarged to permit killing resolution. Acceptable sound. This is a primitive DVD that absolutely * must be re-released. <br /> <br /> By the way, I also have a laser disc and VHS Black Rain. VHS - a huge step up from DVD! And the laser disc has the best picture of all these subtitles in black, clear, large picture, simple but very good soundtrack. Buy VHS and avoid the ridiculous prices that these scammers demand!
