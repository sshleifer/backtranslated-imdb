An excellent film about the victory over all the speakers who are trying to kill your spirit, achieving the impossible. I will not talk about it, except to say that I liked to reflect on this film when I come across something particularly frightening, and to realize that if Lindberg can do what he did, I can certainly cope with the task set for me, Of course, the film "I feel good." <br /> <br /> Take a look. You will not be disappointed.
