I saw this movie as a child and fell in love with it. It has a sweet sensitive story. Something that children can appreciate. I loved as much as a child, I had to find it for my daughter. This is definitely a movie that I would watch with children. It reminds me of many stories about Disney nature, such as Dragon Pete and Mary Poppins. And because of the live action and from the cartoon, but because of its background. It is also a good story to show the children that if they tell the truth, they can be trusted and adults will listen to them. I think all children should see it and enjoy it. This is such a gap from the cruel bad taste films that many children are watching these days. He has all the charming qualities that are not in many modern films.
