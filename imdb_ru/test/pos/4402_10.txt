Without being a fan of the Coen brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see the skepticism that I took in the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something else. This time it was those low (due to a temporary lack of a better word), the coenes were doing "their job" on one of the greatest works in the history of literature. Who would have thought Homer had that in mind? I donâ€™t know where this film fits in Hollywood history books, but it will be in mine and in many other DVD or VHS libraries. This is one of those movies that you can watch again and again. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and interesting, with a pair of Gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson and the brief but cheerful Holly Hunter. Born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, I would like more people to make fun of us. They even use a soundtrack suitable for the rural south. You are NOT doing anything better this weekend, watch this movie! <br /> <br />
