What to say about a movie like Rock Star? A lot really! This is a type of film that is almost made for critics. This is also a film that I, being a fan of BASIC Hard Rock, actually loved and did not love, and at the same time was very conscious of its many shortcomings and the fact that the film, while decent efforts in some ways, missed the chance which was to go into greatness and become a classic rock cinema. Oh, well .... <br /> <br /> I liked this film - and I will watch it again and again - but I know that it is based solely on my personal tastes - Rock Star is a film that will please everyone who has experienced elements of rock or hard rock style and wants to go on the road to nostalgia. It was a great time for metal heads. And it's nice to have a film that effectively reflects what (long forgotten by many non-rock fans) is effective, as I think Rock Star has already done. This is one of the strengths of the film, concert footage. Do you feel there with them, and how can any hard rock lover not like this? As for setting the atmosphere, Rock Star gets 10 out of 10. He also gets 10 out of 10 for pure entertainment. If you want the film to just allow yourself to leave and freely merge into beautiful memories of the past good times, then this film is for you. This is also the reason why I liked this movie so much. <br /> <br /> But this is not a very good movie. I understand this, and if my professional work consisted of a professional review of films, I probably would have had to do a bit of hard work. The problem with the Rock Star is character development. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with character development is that it’s not there. No one. There are certain scenes in the film - few and far apart, but they are - which REALLY relate to greatness: WARNING SHORT SPOILERS SCENE: 3 examples - 1) when Izzy debuts on stage (including the fall he takes) <br /> < br /> 2) First party "after the show" with Emily (Anniston and Izzy.) <br /> <br /> 3) Roll back a bit - at the beginning, when the original lead singer is accidentally fired (fired) - A whole tone "as usual "Sets the foundation for what is to come." It is played very effectively. <br /> <br /> But the problem is that nothing comes. In this film, there is almost no character development, the people's characters are simply affected, but never fully explored. I don’t think it’s the fault of the actors / actresses, especially Anniston, who does her best, they’re just not allowed to work hard. Simply, the script was weak and did not have the ability to go beyond the “formulaic” sensation to the depths of this film. The rock star was sometimes so embellished (including near the end) that it was almost ridiculous. And, nevertheless, these scenes that I mentioned were WONDERFUL and very believable, unfortunately, there was not much else in the film. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer mentioned the lack of preparation for the end, and I agree, but in fact the lack of build-up about NOTHING. WHY Izzy leaves at the end? Because he misses his girlfriend, and the band doesn't allow him to write songs? He checks the limits of believability. And to be honest, the end was just banal. There was no point in it, and there was no reality in it. <br /> <br /> Watching this, it’s like watching a movie in which the filmmakers said: “Well, it happens here, and then it happens, and then this and so on. D. And so on. ". and so on. In the end, this is no longer a film about a boy whose dream has come true, this is just another deeply formulated love story. And you wonder why so many details are not taken into account ... <br /> <br /> I hope it’s not that difficult for Rock Star because I really loved it, but not for the right reasons. I would love this wonderful movie about the ups and downs of rock glory. Instead, I loved him throughout the 80s, clothes, hair, light, life ... Although many liked it, I suspect that most of them are people who lived as a rock fan, like me or someone playing . I would like the film to cross, and I was just respected for the fact that it is a good, well-told film, and not as a cliché. I think one of the problems was the length. I myself hate long films, but it was a film that really had to be longer, if the film was really done, the duration is not even felt - the story is too long to be as short as it was - this is one of the reasons why there seems to be no particular development of either the story or the people depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> So in the end, this is a movie you can pretty much get into. - but not a great movie. Watch it for fun. See it for fun. See how you can return to that great, great space in time, when metal was not just a part of life, it was life - and for those who were not a rock fan - look to get a little look at life, which meant so far far means so much to many of us.
