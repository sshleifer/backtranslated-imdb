This film, to which I continue to return for various reasons. As evidence of the suffering of an ordinary soldier on the Eastern Front in World War II, it is powerful. There are several very powerful scenes in the film that help capture the horror of war, such as a tank battle. In addition, from what I see, the experiences recorded in the film as a whole are “correct” - if you read A. Beevor’s book “Stalingrad”, you will understand what I mean. The film is also successful in the sense that it does not allow the character or plot to dominate him - this is just a story about survival, which tries to portray the battle mainly from the point of view of an ordinary (German) soldier. I read somewhere that the original script should be relaxed, which does not surprise me at all - if they tried to really show what the battle looked like, it would be almost impossible to do, I am sure. However, there are some points that are difficult to watch - this was done before Private Ryan, but it may be even harder to hit in some places. Only one word of caution - do not buy the duplicated "English" version, it is rather terrible and spoils the film - try to get a copy in the original (German) version with English subtitles, it is much more powerful. In this case, you may have to buy a DVD with a film for region 1, just like me.
