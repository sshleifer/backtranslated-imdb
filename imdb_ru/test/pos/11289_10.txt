The existentialist experiment of E. Elias Merhyge in long trials is certainly a damn boring watch. It’s like the fact that Alexander de Large was forced to look at “A Clockwork Orange”. But, despite how far this film is truly unavailable for viewing, this is a success. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this movie and have not seen the movie yet, then it’s already too late. For me, at least, the gain (after 3 separate views with a long break between minds) you see a list of characters * after * a story telling. That's when a simple message came home. But I wonder if Merheyd could tell a 5-minute story in about 30, not 78. <br /> <br /> However, seeing how on the front page of this film on the main page of this film, the cat had already left out of control, and you will surely appreciate this film only if you appreciate the creation of existentialist films of the early 20th century. Even then you can vomit. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but I recommend Merhige for creating a work of art, even if it cannot be seen)
