“Children of Wax”, also shown as “Killing grounds,” is an interesting mix of genres. Someone might think that the purity of the genre can only be good, but eclectic symbioses are very interesting to me. His story also has a mixture of thriller and popular action, as well as a combination of a historical masterpiece and an ethnic appeal for tolerance. This film was created with the star presence of my favorite actor, the perfect Armand Assante, but is it also marked by a falling shooting star ?? Hal Ozan. We recently saw him on an HBO series called Sex. "Children of wax" is entertainment for the audience, but at the same time they have an eternal moral of ethnic tolerance. This is a wise way to teach welfare. A discussion about the current troubles of our day can be held with attractive means in this very positive side of the film Children of Wax.
