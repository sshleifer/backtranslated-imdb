It is a pity that Asterix and his friend Obelix do not receive the worldwide recognition that other comic book heroes receive. <br /> <br /> This is another funny Asterix cartoon, full of fun. The animation is great, and the voice characteristics are good, even if the sync is a bit broken. The music and the score fit well into the plot, and the insertion of some modern musical numbers is a pleasant touch. <br /> <br /> The playing time seems short, and although itâ€™s not the best story about Asterix or the most advanced cartoon, it's good purely fun. Modern Disney-style animation captures children, Asterix fans and newbies ... Enjoy the adventures of Gaul!
