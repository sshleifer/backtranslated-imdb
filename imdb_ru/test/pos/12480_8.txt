Henri-Georges Kloso's film is a quiet example of French cinema transition. The film between the realism of post-war cinema and the full magic and symbolism of the new vague. With some commercials of American classic films (but not imitating them), the director tells us a story about love, crime and the importance of points of view. We can also find great actors (Susie Delaire is flawless). <br /> <br /> I wonder how we can find aspects of this film at the moment. The legacy of the Quai des Orfèvres is palpable in the tradition of Woody Allen. Immerse yourself in a criminal situation in a picturesque setting. The naive end is also typical of the good movies of Steven Spielberg. And finally, I would like to point out the feeling of deja vu during a photo shoot between Jenny Lamour (Susie Delaire) and Dora Monier (Simone Renan), in which the first admits that she thinks her husband is unfaithful and it’s with the woman who takes her pictures This scene takes place between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in the film “Closer” (Mike Nichols, 2004).
