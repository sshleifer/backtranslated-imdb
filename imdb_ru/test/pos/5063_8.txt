A taut, topical political thriller, directly aimed at the controversial US extradition policy, Orwell-ian's other horrible phrase (collateral damage, anyone?) For illegal questioning, even torture of those suspected of terrorism, bypassing the lawsuit. The inhuman interrogation is monitored by the Egyptian police chief, who himself is the target of a fundamentalist suicide - plotting with a bomb, thus intertwining the two main plot lines of the film. Both work very well, the graphic design of the bomber and frightening in its realism, with its denouement, shown in a stylish memory like Tarantino, and scenes of torture of an innocent person, also unshakably depicted in all their bloody details. The films describe how to use torture as a trustworthy means of intelligence, collecting them in a war against terrorists and against useless faceless bureaucracy (here the personified suitable Meryl Streep of cold weapons, like the CIA boss, who accidentally gives an order) for execution) which can destroy innocent lives. Never mind the Kafka fiction, remember the recent murder of an innocent Brazilian in London in 2005, when the head of the metropolitan police was still working and no one was tried for the murder of a poor man. The acting game is great in all respects - the two key roles of an innocent man and a terrorist bomber are realistically and revealingly performed by unfamiliar actors Omar Metvally and Moa Huas. In the same way, Igal Naor as a frightening police chief and Zineb Uhach as their idealistic love daughter confirm their performances, their ignorance (at least, me), which increases the credibility of their characters. Of the larger names present in Hollywood, Gyllenhaal grows with subsequent films in which he plays the initially detached, but later conscience - an afflicted and agonizing government man, who ultimately does the right thing. Witherspoon plays the role of his distraught wife mostly in the same way, but, nevertheless, this is plausible, while David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin convincingly show self-serving senators and their lackeys who will go so far to help you, while their career prospects will not be jeopardized. There are several plot weaknesses; there is a slight dramatic need to create an “expectation”, an ambient El Ibrahimi escape, and the character of the Streep is perhaps too obvious as a frightening man / woman. Worst of all is the senseless inclusion of girlfriend Gyllenhaul on the spot, around just for decoration and a brief gratuitous love scene. In general, a fascinating thought - causing cinematic experience.
