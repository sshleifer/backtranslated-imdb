Three Puppets has always been one of the many actors I loved. I love almost all the shorts they made. I love all six puppets (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are funny, and many other great actors and actresses have also been shot, many of whom were in many shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges - one of the greatest actors of all time and the funniest comedy team of all time! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is nothing more than Brideless Groom! This short film features Dee Green, the beautiful Christine McIntyre, Doris Hawke, Elin Lockwood, Johnny Kasser, Nancy Saunders and Emile Sitka. Green and McIntyre provide great performances here! There are so many fun parts. This is a very funny short. There is one more similar shortstop called Three Stooges called Husbands Beware, and I recommend both!
