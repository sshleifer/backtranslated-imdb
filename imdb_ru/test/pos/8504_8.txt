The famous French detective Henri Cassin takes his first vacation in the last 11 years in Saint-Margot, where he meets Nanette, the daughter of the owners of this resting place. Despite the fact that Nanette was promised a childhood sweetheart Leona, Henri and Nanette fall in love and decide to marry, despite the fact that Nanette's father objects because of the age of Henri. On their wedding day, Leon returns, and Nanette runs after him. Nothing is heard of the two, until both are found dead, and Henri swears that he will not rest until he finds the murderer. The only key that Henri must work with is the footprint found by Leon, but he also receives written warnings that others will die soon. Soon Nanette's mother was found dead, and Henri has no idea about the identity of the murderer. Believing himself to be a loser, he returns to Paris, and then realizes (and is afraid) that only one person can be the killer, although none of his colleagues can believe his explanations. Unusual murder mystery, which in fact does not follow the formula in another genre of Colombia or other B-studios. In this, of course, the merit of director Lewis, who still manages to turn this film into a nuristic film, despite the production of the film, as well as thanks to good shooting and lighting. Jerry shows very good results, probably in his only margin, while the rest of the actors are able to carry their performance. Rating, 8.
