After a recent meeting with Cry Cry, the same director, I decided to find it, and I'm glad I did it!? This is an unusually good movie. Much better than it looks, considering the ingredients. How many times have we suffered from embarrassment when someone played the middle-class dad, mixing it with flower children, aaaa! And yet here, thanks to the ideal scenario, it is made believable. Not perfect, not good or bad, but believable. Peter Boyle, as a working class, a hippie and not a single hater, and Dennis Patrick, as an obstinate costume, play their roles immaculately, and I do not remember that these two classes ever come together without sentimental things. Susan Sarandon is effective as a hippie, but she has nothing to do in her first film. It really must be a movie that captures, as it happens in that very short period in the Western and, in particular, in the US time, when the counterculture was about to open up.
