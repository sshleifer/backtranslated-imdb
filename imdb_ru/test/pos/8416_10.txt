It was very nice to watch this beautiful film. The director focused on the main subject, without going into side scenes (the family of the doctor or the history of other hospital patients) that are so typical of Bollywood assembly lines. He left the story easy to understand and made sure that all the actors are true to the characters they are supposed to portray. The grandfatherâ€™s simple techniques in the clinic, the cold and unemotional behavior of the surgeon, the zeal of the social worker gave the film a sense of authenticity. I am also glad that the director did not give in to the temptation to add songs or special effects and reduce it to the level of Anand or Safar. A couple of scenes near the end of the film, for example, a boy visiting other blind children and the workplace of a blind worker, as well as the final scene where the boy claps from the sound of birds splashing and chirping, will probably cloud your eyes. /> <br /> Many Bollywood players do not realize that members of the Oscar committee value the simplicity of the subject, as well as the authenticity and brevity of the film more than brilliance and glamor. Shwaas is by far the best nomination than Lagaan, who dealt with an item that has already been beaten to death. No MPAA member wants to suffer from 4 hours of jazz drama and a lot of songs and dances. <br /> <br /> I look forward to new films from director Sandip Sawant in the future.
