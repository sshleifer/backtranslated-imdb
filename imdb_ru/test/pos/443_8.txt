I watched this film three times at different ages and always enjoyed it a lot. This Can-Can - a real explosion of joy of life, like the musical Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, but in French. And Jean Renoir gloriously pays tribute to his time, his friends, lovers, music and dance. At the same time, it is a chronicle of show business of that time, full of love and French mood. This is too obvious a tribute to impressionism (this picture will appeal to people who love impressionists). This is especially a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and, of course, Jean Renoir's father, Pierre-Auguste. You will find a trustworthy and magnificent coloring of some works by Renoir. Great casting, scenery, sound effects and music. Even this tells us about the creation of the Parisian Moulin Rouge, obviously, this is a fantastic story (and, by the way, not very original, as it falls into a very well-known moral that the show must go on). But the production of Jean Renoir is great. <br /> <br />
