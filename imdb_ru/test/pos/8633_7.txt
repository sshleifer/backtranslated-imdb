Reading so much negative press about this film over the years, I always avoided it, but the appearance of a cheap public DVD made me finally watch it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was transferred from a bad copy. Modern prequel, filmed on tinted material, fuzzy and contrasting. Persons are sometimes difficult to make out. Having said that, the actual story is interesting, and Lou looks like an experienced actor, more than in many movies for boys. <br /> <br /> As soon as the film switches to the story of Jack, the film switches to “color” and I use this term loosely. Most shades of orange or brown. Greens look especially bad. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Ford as Polly, the giant's maid, was a big plus for me since I enjoyed her early appearance of Andy Hardy. <br /> <br /> With so many negative comments related to the actual print quality, I'm still happy to give this movie 7. It made me laugh a lot, and this is more than most of the comedies that I watched. decades can handle. <br /> <br /> One to see if you have a chance.
