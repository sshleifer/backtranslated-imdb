What movie! I have always liked the Asian style of shooting, and this film does not disappoint at all! Photography is breathtaking, ranging from amazing landscapes to whirlpools of flowers. The main actor is really realistic in the artist's view (whose pictures are amazing.) The ending is also very well chosen, very poetic. The only comment is that they should show more deeply the connection between his inspiration and the abuse of alcohol and women. But overall this is a great movie!
