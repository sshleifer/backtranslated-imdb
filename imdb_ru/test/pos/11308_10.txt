This parody is cleverly done: from songs (“Express yourself”, “Express yourself”, “Prayer is now a party in my pants, and Vogue is now vague”) to fake interviews of the actors of the series - this movie is cheerful. Remember, Madonna said she did not know about the rainy season in Asia? In this, she does not know about the season of volcanoes. This is a gem. They got a lot of money for this deception, and it pays off. Highly recommended !!!
