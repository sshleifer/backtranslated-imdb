Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde. <br /> <br /> Michael McGuire was the father. <br /> <br /> Tim Tomerson was a plastic surgeon. <br /> <br /> Have you ever seen this movie? ? I doubt it! <br /> <br /> Blankfield was quite popular at the time when he played tablets for Fridays on Fridays. Thierson was funny in everything he does, from movies to TV shows and comedies. If I ever find this movie on DVD, I will definitely buy it. I recorded this film on HBO in the distant 82nd year and almost completely exhausted the tape. One of the funniest topics in Jekyll & Hyde history. <br /> <br /> Of course. with all the references to cocaine in this film, it will be considered too politically incorrect today, like Cheech and Chong. It is a pity because it is ridiculous, ridiculous, ridiculous!
