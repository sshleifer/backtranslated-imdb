I have to admit that I am biased towards my voting on this film, but I have good reasons, as I know some of the true stories that were viewed here in Hollywood. Edna Ferber's novel, on which it is based, refers to an era when real names cannot be used. In a sense, this film is all smoke and mirrors. Although it was released in 1946, it was shot shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman - the best in this film, like a brunette. <br /> <br /> She plays a beautiful woman who is trying to sell her beauty in order to get a rich husband. Today it is a gold digger, but in this social epoch she is desirable - that woman who makes all men want her, and all the old mocking societies talk about her and avoid her, wanting them to be her. Ingrid is at his best and plays this role well. <br /> <br /> In the New Orleans section of this film, there is some sympathy for the Ingrids character when she manages to get a decent late tomb for her shocked mother as part of the settlement by her relatives to force her to leave New Orleans. The mocking family of her relatives is so shocked that they will do almost everything she asks to make her leave the city. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper is good at this movie, although he seems to have aged a bit to play the dashing Texas bachelor / gambler. He is doing well, given the flaw that seemed to him older than he was due to the fact that he smoked in real life. Flora Robison as Ingrid Maid was nominated for an Oscar as a supporting actress in this film. Jerry Austin in the role of Cupid looked at his role differently, but this is the only comic relief in the film, and he does it well. <br /> <br /> When the film moves to Saratoga, it shows exactly how important Saratoga was. in that era. I like the sequence when Bergman goes to Source Saratog to get some “sulfuric” water, which everyone then thought was so healthy. When she drinks a little, she forces herself not to make a face and comments on how good it is and that she should have more. <br /> <br /> The real story is a battle on the railroad that really happened on the railroad in Tunnel, New York, is the actual trunk of Saratoga, from which the name of the film originates. This battle actually took place in 1869 between agents Andrew Karnagi and J. P. Morgan. The line was the economic key to the country in 1869, connecting the coal country and the east coast. The links to it throughout the film are very real. There is even some dialogue describing Karnagi as a “Scot”, although this link is vague and unfamiliar to those who do not know the history of the battle. <br /> <br /> The railway line and the tunnel in Tunnel, New York (Zip Code 13848) still exist, although the film was shot in California. This tunnel is about 1 mile long. Today it is still part of the key freight line, years after that. I grew up there. Gary Cooper's line in the film, when he travels by train to the tunnel, is true, it is still a “mighty beautiful country”.
