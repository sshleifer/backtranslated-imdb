“Human Trafficking” is undoubtedly the most original and convincing film that I have seen for a long time. He fixes 2 days from the life of a group of young people who are bored with their daily existence and work at a dead end, as well as the ecstasy at the weekend delighted. This is funny and very sharp, and sometimes very sad. In the same genre as Trainspotting, it has a great soundtrack and features hot young rising British stars. The film was made with a minimum budget, and I look forward to the future proposals of the screenwriter / director Justin Kerrigan, when his major talents discover.
