.... but at the same time part of you thinks: "Am I ready for what I am going to see?" <br /> <br /> In the end, you are happy that you have seen it. I was at least. Jackass Number Two has two laughs and two times more action. Some tricks will keep you breathless. Besides Little Miss Sunshine, I think it was the best movie I saw this summer. Maybe even this year. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is returned, except for a few such as Chris Raab and Rake Yon. I do not think that any of the actors had a boring moment. Each trick was either funny or dangerous, or a combination of both; stupid. The start was just as fun as the first, and the ending was interesting; the cast is performing the musical number. <br /> <br /> Jackass Number Two is the perfect movie to watch with friends. Stay during the credits, there are some pretty funny moments. One is about Luke Wilson.
