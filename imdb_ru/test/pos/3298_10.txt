I had the pleasure to see this film at the Big Bear Film Festival, where he won the audience award. And I must say that it was well deserved, because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The script is well written and retains escalation. It also has a big wait flow going through it. You do not know what will happen next, because the main character is trying to understand that his new neighbor may not be the most ideal person to live in front of him. Jokes are quick and unexpected. The plot makes us guess. The dialogue seems very real. I thought the direction was first-class, and director Travis Davis shows a lot of potential to make it big in the world of studio comedies. Considerable praise, given that he is also the lead actor of the film, so he had to fulfill a triple duty on this, writing, directing and acting in the lead role. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie in iTunes, you should download it. It makes you laugh a few times. And that's more than most shorts offer these days.
