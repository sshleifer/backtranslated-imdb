The Undertaker sits in his cell awaiting execution; he is visited by a monk who wishes to write down his last words for posterity and as a warning to others about the terrible life he leads. At first reluctantly, but with a language weakened by drinking, the young grave robber soon tells his story full of the dead, the undead and things that come across at night. <br /> <br /> The New York horror film (shot partly on Staten Island, in which, without a doubt, Andy Milligan's spirit awoke) is one of the best horror comedies that has appeared lately. This is often a very funny movie that spins its story in every way. The cast is the first course. Dominic Monaghan plays Arthur Blake, the grave robber telling his story. Ron Perlman - Duffy's father, a monk accepting a statement and perhaps too passionate about the story. Both men clearly have a great old time, and it shows. The rest of the cast is equally good. Jeff Grace's music is great. The effects are perfect for this kind of nasty nonsense. The film is very funny. If there are any problems with the film, perhaps he throws his network a little wider, so the result is too much. I don't want to give too much, but I don't think we needed an alien body in the mix. However, it is a lot of fun, and I’m sure that I’ll come back to the IFC in cinemas where I’ve seen it for the first time, and later I’m sure I’ll pick up the DVD. <Br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
