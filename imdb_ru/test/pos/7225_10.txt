I am L-O-V-E this film ... everyone and their dentist's grandmother's dentist lawyer must have it! his witty, devilish, exciting, comedic and full of tasty, action-filled goodness! In this film, these amazing people in Trome offer you a completely new look at the history of Romeo and Juliet in ways you never thought possible! it has all the ideas of instant classics - car accidents, delightfully obscene sex scenes, warring families, street fights, terrific music, severed heads, and mothead lemmas tell the storyline! and this is just a taste of what it has to offer! Every person with whom I watched this movie now has its own copy or dream ... A +++++ and ++
