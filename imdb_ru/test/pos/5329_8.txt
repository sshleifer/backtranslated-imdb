Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) committed an incredible crime by stabbing the backward younger brother of his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone). No one, first and foremost Leland himself, can explain why he did what he did, whether he was intentional or spontaneous, perfect because of hatred or love. <br /> <br /> At the Leland Detention Center, she meets Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle), a former author of the novel, who sees Leland’s second opportunity. But Pearl also wants to understand Leland’s motivation and takes him under his guardianship as a confidant in prison. <br /> <br /> A film jumps from the past to the present several times, often allowing the past to act as a context. currently and vice versa. Writer / director Matthew Ryan Hodge shows how Leland’s crime and related events affect people in his life, from Becky to her family, mother Leland (Lena Olin) and a distant father (Kevin Spacey) to Allen (Chris Kline)) a young man who remains with the Becky family after the death of his own mother <br /> <br /> The main asset in the film is Gosling, who will play well for a 15-year-old pseudo-psychopath. As Bartleby Writer, Leland Gosling simply exists; he shows little emotion during the film, but instead his expressions refute the ocean of guilt, sadness, love and rage. <br /> <br /> Each of the main actors offered, perhaps, their best work to date, except for Spacey (who is not entirely new). Special praise is given to Malone and Klein, two young performers who are better known for their carefree comedy than for the heavy drama of this film. <br /> <br /> Another huge advantage from the point of view of the plot is that none of the characters is flawless; None of the heroes will save the day. It's just not a black and white movie.
