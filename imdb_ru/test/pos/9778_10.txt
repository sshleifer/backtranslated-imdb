This should be one of the best manufactures in Australia. I totally disagree with the comments made by RamiNour101. <br /> <br /> This series shows the depth of the Australian friendship and the length they went to help each other. The fifth episode of Eddie's Birthday is a great example of this, and it truly reflects the Australian spirit. <br /> <br /> The music used throughout the series only emphasized the situation that men faced, their homesickness and their loved ones. Numerous fun performances of “The Road to Gundagai” reflect the spirit of the people and the fact that they never forgot the house, and that little things like singing a song brought them home for a short time. <br /> <br /> With regard to comments on racism towards the Japanese, the only thing to say is that you cannot change what happened. The Japanese treated the Australians very badly in Changi, and it would be very deceptive to present them as otherwise. The commentary on the exact scenario is also false. These six stories that are told in the series are made up of the real experience of P.O. <br /> <br /> Actors were great; The best, in my opinion, is Matthew Newton. His performance as David in the first episode was painful. From being a city boy, to being another nameless face to his captors. We see how much he has changed in the first episode due to his brutal attack in the jungle, and in further episodes we can see how this one event changed him, he is better aware of what is really happening and is always from the first to help other members of The Secret Nine. <br /> <br /> Stephen Curry also deserves a mention. His performance on Eddie's Birthday is amazing, ranging from the group's lark and ending with illness, weakness and inability to take care of himself. The manifestations of camaraderie in this episode touch you on an emotional level and make you proud that you are Australian. <br /> <br /> I study World War II at the university level and consider this series, if not physically truthful, then spiritually truthful, it reflects the true spirit of who he was, being an Australian soldier. <br /> <br /> Well done to John Doyle for capturing the spirit of Changi.
