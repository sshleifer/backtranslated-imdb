The actor, directed by Leev Schreiber (“The Sum of All Fears”), removes the above screen version of the novel “Everything Is Illuminated” by author Jonathan Safran Foer. This story of the journey and self-knowledge is underlined by the strong performances of the ensemble and the sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who saw his grandfather, Safran, die. Jonathan has a special habit of taking small objects and small memorabilia of life and sealing them in plastic bags with a zipper to hang on the wall. Safran gives Jonathan an old photograph in which young Safran is standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago. Thus, Jonathan goes on a long journey to find this mysterious woman in Ukraine, not knowing if she is still alive. He enlists the help of a daring young guide named Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) to take him to his goal. At first, the trip ends up in dead ends and false traces, but when the group approaches its goal, people end up in the ruins of a dark chapter in the story with memories of the war and past ghosts of a nonexistent city. There they find their own respective destinies and forever change what they learn. <br /> <br /> This film feels like it was shot by someone who knew how to get the most out of their actors. Sometimes the film is spoken in Russian and looks like a foreign film. The name itself is a game about self-knowledge. This is the thoughtful path of one man to his past, and his past, ironically, includes his companions; Jonathan's compulsive journey becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather. This is a story about a long relationship and wine, which must be borne for life. By the end of the film, all these characters experienced life-changing events that would forever intertwine their lives. This proves that memories can be strong in traumatizing, as well as in cleansing the soul. It is also about your heritage and how others see the event or person in the past. Alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light. Even our perception of these people will change by the end of the film, which is a tribute to a well-told story. <br /> <br /> The story is deceptively simple. It functions as a film about a trip (for example, “Straight Story”) combined with an interesting mysterious story. It really includes so many layers of emotions and plots that vary from the past to the present. The finale is a bit surreal with a sense of deja vu. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood (Sin City, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) has chosen a wide range of roles since his appearance in The Lord of the Ring Trilogy. Here he copes with the fact that, in essence, is a minimalist role that little can be shown by Yevgeny Khuts and Boris Leskin live better than Alex and his grandfather, respectively. Even a grandfather's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. (that's right) is funny as a furious faithful companion. <br /> <br /> Paul Cantelon's spare music is a sullen compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film. Editing is effective because images from the past and present are connected and moved effortlessly. Matthew Libatika’s cinematography (Gothic, Requiem for a Dream) looks rather harsh and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its aftermath. <br /> <br /> The coincidences that arise in the second half of the film are forever a drama, but they are too random. We never fully understand the whole story of grandfather Alex and his motives. Similarly, Jonathan’s empty looks and lack of visible substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a bizarre person. From time to time, the film seems a bit depressed and depressing, as more horrible revelations are set. But this is a small criticism of a good, introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of memories and intricacy. That Schreiber not only directed, but also adapted the script to this worthy part of the story, is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future.
