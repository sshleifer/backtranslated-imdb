I saw this film when it was broadcast on Lifetime back in 2004. I have never seen him since, but I often thought about it. It made such an impression on me that I was looking for it lately. I finally found it and realized that it was made only for television. The film is great - filled with great writing and acting. William Petersen is perfect, as always. This film left me in a daze and in tears. This is a wonderful story of faith, love and compassion. Anyone know how I can get a copy of this movie for my house? Is this possible with tv movies ?? I would really like to see it again. This should be in my collection!
