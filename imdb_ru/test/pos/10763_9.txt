I really enjoyed cruel people. I discovered the movie by chance, looking through my on-demand movie lists, trying to find something interesting to watch. The film is mainly about classes in America, and it quickly grabs your attention. The characters are intelligent and articulated, and the story does not follow the usual Hollywood rules. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is Finn, a premature but disadvantaged 15-year-old who spends the summer in the Osborn family. Donald Sutherland plays Patriarch Ogden Osborne, the seventh richest man in America. Diane Lane plays the mother of Finn, a friend of Ogden, who is also a regular cocaine consumer and whore. The Osborns own a large estate and seem to live by their own rules. At first they seem charming and sophisticated, but the super-rich are different. They used to go their own way. The film is pleasant, mainly because it has a clear intellectual dialogue, excellent action and a story that takes unexpected turns. This is also an R-rated film, so itâ€™s not very useful. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Anton Yelchin is believable and responsive in the role of Finn. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. Chris Evans is impressive as Osborn's treacherous grandson. Kristen Stewart is good as a beautiful granddaughter. High-quality film.
