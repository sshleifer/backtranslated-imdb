OK. So it can be done! We have a perfect vampire movie here. Gothic, beautiful. With all the ingredients. Realistic vampire. Beautiful story Please note - I am from Transylvania and I assure you, this film respects the knowledge of vampires! It's like a fairy tale that I heard in childhood. For Transylvanian this is quite ... believable. You should see this if you are interested in real vampires, as they were depicted in medieval chronicles, and not as they do in recent Hollywood films (as far as I can guess, the problem of Hollywood is that they mix vampires with an incubus - that is quite funny to me. Vampires are never attractive and attractive, they can only cause horror and disgust. Incubus, called "Night Pilot" in my country, is the only wonderful demon that kills its victims by loving them. Komenda is for every person there is a Gothic See also sequels, all of 4 very well and, of course, do not miss the shadows DArk Something like -!!! This Nosferatu in Venice with Klaus Kinski I recommend it..
