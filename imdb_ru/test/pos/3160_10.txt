The whole shorthand in order to supposedly be more aware at this strange time, is that you are “Blue.” Blue state mentality. This should take us off the hook for what happened / happened in the last few years in our country (USA). It doesn’t remove anyone, but it makes us feel better, as if we don’t get any benefit from living here and getting all the good things a US citizen gets just being a US citizen. <br /> <br /> But I'm so tired of that. It does not benefit. I have not taken much action lately, and I wonder how many people. Maybe I just quit because my work was “outsourced” last month, and now I’m looking for work in a shrinking area of ​​technical support, where most of the jobs quickly go to India and other places abroad. I think that soon it will not pay off to be a citizen here with damaged infrastructure and a shrinking labor market and an obsession with war. Nowadays, it seems that anyone who speaks is questioned and asked about "patriotism." Anyway, back to this review: The Movie USA is an obscure DVD that makes me realize that some people have taken some action, whether through politics, protest, art or the media. The director is obviously passionate, knowledgeable, ready to go beyond the norm, frustrated, unique, insightful, and so on. <br /> <br /> I looked through the entire site related to the DVD and got lost in all articles, essays, etc. which are. This is also on the DVD, there are links to different times, views and historical moments. Sometimes someone does something there.
