In addition to a small budget, it seems that there are never more than 50 Germans in the same scene at the same time, plus the same two half tracks, this film is the absolute top class. All right. This is the essence, I think, from form to horror and disappointment. All gray as field gray uniforms. Gray people with life drained of them. Forget that the US made Goong Ho rubbish like Blackhawk and Private Ryan. This is one of the best war movies. Only the Iron Cross beats it for stress and history. Please, can we have the correct Un-dubbed German with English subtitles in the UK? Without the need to pay ridiculous import charges from Europe. Most other DVDs are multilingual. Why not this one?
