for a film like this little hidden gem that comes out in the 80s, itâ€™s amazing how little people know about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth seeing. it has everything you need for a horror movie. especially good old chills. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this film about 15 years ago, but I could not remember its name, so several years ago I came to IMDb and asked for help in finding the name. in the end I got the name of the title and bought the movie. I still love him as much as all those years ago. <br /> <br /> Buy this movie !!
