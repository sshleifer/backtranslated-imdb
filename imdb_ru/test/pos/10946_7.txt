In this film, as my Chinese girl told me, two famous Hong Kong pop stars. Although this can make a film just a marketing ploy, I think that acting is acceptable, and they are both cute. <br /> <br /> In general, the story is rather scarce. However, vampiric traits and weaknesses are used with humor, and created several uniquely entertaining pieces. The quarrel between the two girls made me laugh, and it gave a wonderful balance along with the well-executed scenes of action films to create an entertainment film.
