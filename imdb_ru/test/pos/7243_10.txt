I totally agree with another poster. NEMESIS is one of Christie's best adaptations with a superb plot and cast. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Liz Fraser acts as the mother of a murder victim is a study of acting at the highest level. This underestimated woman was popular in British films of the 1960s, which never received a mainstream break in American films. Look at her as a friend of Julie Andrews in 1964. AMERICANIZATION OF EMILY. <br /> <br /> All the characters of this chance have a chance to express themselves as unmatched Miss Hickson, who has never been nominated for an Emmy for her work Marple. Shame on them! And dig up lesbian CID agents! :)
