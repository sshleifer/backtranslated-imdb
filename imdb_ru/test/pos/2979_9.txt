A great movie! The soundtrack is awesome! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his time even in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a great job in producing and directing this movie! The film was a romantic and breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complemented the film by T. Rex Morris, who did a great job with the tenor saxophone in the song “Honey Roll” and the poem “I meant my work today” by Richard Le Gallien, it was incredible! Glory to everyone who is connected with this fantastic film! Not surprisingly, many of the people involved in this film have become the best in their field.
