I love this movie, one of my favorites of all time. Anne Blythe as Sally O'Moyne is sweet and carefree. She believes that the prayer to St. Anne will solve all problems with her and her friends. The subplot of the mean bad man to get her father's property is funny and smart. Her brothers are those brothers whom any girl would like to have. Also, look for “Aunt Bee” as her mother, a strong Irish woman who will not leave her home, where she brought her family. They don't make them like that anymore, that's for sure.
