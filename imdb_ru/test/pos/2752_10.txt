I saw Riverdance - The New Show and loved it from the very first moment! This is an energetic tribute to Irish dance, filled with brilliant dances, music and choreography! Presenters, Jean Butler and Colin Dunn, fascinated me with their exquisite dance! May they always shine and continue to dance. Their chemistry on stage was amazing, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. Looks like they were made to dance with each other! This show is my favorite and probably will always be. Long live Riverdance!
