Talk Radio is my favorite film by Oliver Stone, although he has shot many great films, including Salvador, JFK, Natural Born Killers and Platoon. But I like the proximity of Talk Radio, the cinematic expansion of Eric Bogosyanâ€™s creepy stage play based on real-life talk show host in Dallas. Working with an experienced cinematographer, Robert Richardson, Stone turns what could be a very tough task into a visually exciting ideological battle, which presents the radio station as an arena of war. Bogosyan is devastated by being tormented by the mockery of abuse of Barry Champlain, and conveys the contradictory, destructive nature of his character with conviction and a generous dose of self-hatred. Alec Baldwin, like his boss-alpha male, is strikingly remarkable as a man who is driven crazy by a guy whose enormity he helped grow. Ellen Green is fantastic, like the lovely ex-wife of Barry, who eventually becomes another target of his evil personal vitriol. Stone and Bogosian fill each frame with interest and each line of dialogue with sweet poison and cutting ambiguity. John S. McGinley, as the long-suffering screening / technical producer Barry Stu, turns into a fun, harsh performance, like the great Michael Wincott. The film is a flawless, underrated masterpiece of excellent writing, amazing acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. Stuart Copeland's score is brilliant too.
