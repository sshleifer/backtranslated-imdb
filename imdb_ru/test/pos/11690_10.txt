At first, I must admit that I had some doubts about the director. He made several films (together with Yarkovsky) about the recent history of the “Czechs = East” or, more precisely, about families (individuals), how they lived through some historical moments. But it was always like sweet and sour food. This film was completely different. It was pure, it shows the bones of life, it shows the changes of human nature. This film is a great work of art (history, acting, photography, music), but it shows you the life around you in a much brighter light that we don’t want to see. By the way, I saw it on a DVD (with English subtitles), but I'm afraid that in the USA I will not be able to get it.
