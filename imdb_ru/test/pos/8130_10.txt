The biggest tragedy around this amazing film is the lack of distribution in the USA. I was lucky to see this film at the Boston International Women's Film Festival, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a chance to see it. Stunning performances, thoughtful script and excellent guidance from the talented and funny Rosa Troche - all this makes this film a winner!
