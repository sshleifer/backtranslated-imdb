Continuing his return, John Travolta played a slightly perverted angel in the movie "Michael." He may be the messenger of God, but he is not the most pleasant guy, as journalists Andy MacDowell and William Hurt found out. When I first saw this film, it was before I started watching “Everything in the Family”, so I didn’t recognize Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now, when I recognize her in this way, I try to imagine how Archie snaps at her for covering an angel (whom he is likely to rank as black, Jews, etc.). <br /> <br /> I know this doesn’t quite relate to the film. But I just like to tie things up this way. In any case, this is a rather interesting film. Also starring Bob Hoskins, Teri Garr and Richard Schiff. <br /> <br /> What did John and Paul say ...
