I just watched this movie on the premiere night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I loved (disliked) "Mork & Mindy" as a child, mainly due to the energetic performance of Robin William. This film made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin, of course, was. Which brings me to this film. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised, not expecting anything but paint on the chronological retelling of the issue (which in a sense was the case). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin’s journey from a struggling street jester to a national television star, and how such a dramatic difference affected him and his long-suffering wife. And I take off my hat to star Chris Diamantopoulos when he portrayed Mr. Williams with honesty, sensitivity and heart; not just a sweet impression, even though it was dead. (On an unrelated note, I noticed that Robin’s struggle was somewhat similar to Andy Kaufman, who was underestimated by network television and kept creatively, but this is Taxi behind the scenes of the biography.) <br /> <In general, it was very pleasant a film in which I felt I had learned a little more about the man behind Orkan. The acting was flawless - never melodramatic, as I suspected, - and the story developed well. The performances that were especially good were those who played Harry Marshall and John Belushi (the stage in which Belushi giggles Robin was a scream!). Not a very good masterpiece (I would like to know a little more about Pam Dober), but definitely watchable, especially for those fans of Robin Williams and "Mork & Mindy". Nano, nano!
