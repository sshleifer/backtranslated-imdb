Michael Kehoe made a real feat, especially considering that this is just his second start as a screenwriter, producer and director. Usually, the "newcomers" do not have enough vision and direction when they lead large-scale production, but Dominion proves that Mr. Kehoe is going to Hollywood! Against the backdrop of beautiful landscapes, the Dominion boasts experienced actors (especially Thomarson and James), who convey Kehoeâ€™s vast vision with exceptional clarity. Few films can mix the slasher / horror genre with a genuine sense of action / adventure, but Dominion has achieved this completely. This film is certainly considered one of the top-notch films in both of these categories. If you are looking for a dynamic action with immense anticipation, look no further. I look forward to future Kehoe projects with great enthusiasm. Well done !!!
