I saw what I consider to be the best Australian film of the year, John Hewitt's The Acolytes. <br /> <br /> “Acolytes” is a stylish thriller with a killer premise. Get it, two intimidated and molested teenagers discover a local serial killer in their suburbs And then start blackmailing him to kill the bully who molested them. Hewitt chose top-class actors, including great newcomers Sebastian Gregory, Josua Payne and Hannah Mangan Lawrence, to play teenagers. Add to that three, yes, these are just three great psychos! Led by Joel Edgerton in an outstanding serial killer performance, Belinda McClory, his irresponsible spouse and Michael Dorman as a teenager, raping a bully, with tattoos with a swastika. As soon as you add these teens and these threatening adults, everything will break out of hell ?? Hewitt created the balls for the wall-based serial thriller, which is pretty darn original and completed. You can see the influence of Larry Clarke and David Lynch's Twin Peaks, but Hewitt does it all with his own, in the suburb of Cled, always ringing void drones. The script of Shane Armstrong, Shayne Krouz and Hewitt is very complex. <br /> <br /> If the film is sold correctly, it can become a hit among teenagers. The next wolf scream? It may well be. It makes all the right moves. Teens real ala Larry Clark. They do not suck and they do not have a program on the PC, they are not sociable, beautiful and fashionable. The killers are dark with a real threat. Joel Edgerton steals his scenes in the role of gently brought up by local Ted Bundy, who wears a butterfly on his 4WD spare ale. John Fowles Collector. Petite-headed rapist Dorman is pouring out a threat that stands on top of Suburban mayhem, and gives a creepy thug that you can't wait to buy a farm. <br /> <br /> The film is fast, tough and cruel. Moreover, he demonstrates the confidence and directorial skills of Hewitt, who, undoubtedly, will win him in the nomination IF or AFI, if not a reward! His nuanced and poetic mise en scene, great sound design, excellent cinematography and dense structure make him one of the best Oz directorial features I've seen this year. <br /> <br /> The film shocks you, thinking and hesitantly. This is really a great edition to return to the genre that is happening in Australian cinema at the moment. This will certainly arouse the interest of Hollywood. Oh, and did I mention that it got into Toronto? What other Oz feature films can say so much? The world must prepare for a new author, John Hewitt.
