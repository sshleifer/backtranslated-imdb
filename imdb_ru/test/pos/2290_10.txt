Redo Oscar since 1992, and this film can be nominated or even won. He was so good at capturing his era and the double cultures that belong to the American and Japanese time capsules. If you wanted to know what was here or there, this film will show you. As an American, you will feel as if you are on a long vacation in Japan, and by the end of the film you will become a devoted Dragon fan when you embrace Japanese traditions and culture in their baseball game. just as we did with our culture in our own game. <br /> <br /> Jack Elliot (Tom Selleck) is a fallen aging Detroit tiger that sells Dragons, perennial medalists, and second in the Yomuri Giants dynasty, Japan’s response to the Yankees. Giants are admired for their success, but this success also forces everyone to surpass them, which rarely happens. The Dragons manager recruited Jack as the final piece of the puzzle that won the pennant, and we were left with what could have been Goong Ho on the baseball field, but instead there was a lot more. <br /> <br /> Casting was outstanding: Selleck proved that with a good script and character that suits him, he can carry the film just as he did his television show, and the Japanese cast was equally good, until Mr. Takagi from Die Hard as the conscious owner of the image. Other actors, including those who show a love interest (also the daughter of a manager), are strong and independent, but at the same time a supporter of Japanese traditions, in addition to what was imposed on her. She is a suitable and supportive girl for Jack. Even her father never tells her not to see him, almost sympathizing with Jack because he suffers from her, and it is a little easier that he, at least, knows the person she chose to love. <br /> <br /> The baseball scene is great, greatly supported by the pre-death Denis Heisbert as another American ex-patriat and Jack's western mentor. There are the usual “fish out of water” elements, and you almost feel that you stumble along with Jack to fit into a country that does not speak our language and does not practice our ways, but copies everything we do including our national pastime. One of the funniest scenes occurs when Jack, clutching a magazine, informs his manager that he learned about the tradition in Japan, where you can get drunk and chastise your boss, that it cannot be used against you, and use this right in a very joking way. the end is neatly connected, but not too neat, and nothing ends unrealistically. <br /> <br /> Calling it a comedy is wrong: it is pure comedy drama or even drama with a good mood. The plot is too deep to reject it in the way that critics had as an actor from his league trying to make a light film. The situations were funny, but in their place, against the background of a much more serious, deep and precisely detailed background, which leads to one of the best films I've ever seen. Baseball cinema competes with the film “For the love of the game” for realism. <br /> <br /> Some people say that a film is about baseball or Japan, but most of all it seems about work and how people come to work from completely different countries, with different plans and somehow put off their differences for the benefit of the company or team. <br /> <br /> A really great film that never had to apologize for itself, as it was in cinemas.
