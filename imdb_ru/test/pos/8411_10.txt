I have always loved Gone with the Wind and have seen it many times. However, its ending left me not only "hanging", but also depressed, with a hopeless feeling. Finally, in Scarlett, Ripley led us to a very plausible and satisfactory end (“beginning”) of the original story. <br /> <br /> It follows from this that someone of Scarlett’s obvious intelligence (as originally written) eventually grows. Although, like most people, I fell in love with Scarlett at GWTW, I was tired of her persistent tasteless infantilism to the degree of irritation, and I was disappointed that Mitchell did not show Scarlett using this obvious mind to even try to grow emotionally, Fortunately, someone finally did. (In the end, isn't this aching immaturity, which contradicted her beauty and intellect, the very reason Rhett finally abandoned her?) I think Ripley did a great job describing this belated process, and Wally “Kilmer did an excellent job of depicting him.” Joanne W.K. possesses all the fire, abundance and clever sparkle, as Vivian Lee, and she, of course, at least, if not more, beautiful. <br /> <br /> There was, is and always will be only one Clark Gable. However, if I had to choose an actor from a thousand that I encountered to portray him in my biography, it would definitely be Timothy Dalton. Dalton has the same elegant charm as Gable, which is very important for the Rett character. I can not imagine anyone who could come close. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Joan Wally-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were superbly played, and the only actors who could play Scarlett and Rett. I think that both their performances were fair not only for the deceased actors, but also in the spirit of their characters. <br /> <br /> I liked the whole cast. Julie Harris was her usual delightful presence, and Jean Smart was a delightful blow! Even the character Ashley was pleasantly played by Stephen Collins, and the development of his relationship with Scarlett was absolutely believable. <br /> <br /> The story got a little confusing in Ireland, but in the end, life is the same, and I still find it interesting. <br /> <br /> In general, I fully enjoyed the fruits of Ripley's imagination. I wish I had written this! <br /> <br />
