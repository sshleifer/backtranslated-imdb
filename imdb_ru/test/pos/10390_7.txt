Despite the fact that the story is light, the film flows so beautifully and visually, it is so quiet and poetic that you can almost see the whole movie in it. <br /> <br /> The film consists of four interconnected stories about various aspects of attraction. between a man and / or a woman and as it is often unearthly. Their true desire, it seems, is always something that they cannot hold onto; it will flow out like a handful of sand. <br /> <br /> I thought that the most intriguing story was the last one, where a woman was more inaccessible, the more a man wants her. This corresponds to her deep love for a god who is infinitely inaccessible, but never approaches her heart. <br /> <br /> Very good movie. 7/10
