If you had a mother who described you like this, you might just want to get rid of her. This is how Danny DeVito relates to Ann Ramsey, just how to put a plan into action. <br /> <br /> And the lesson of his creative writing, which is taught by Professor Billy Crystal, suggests an idea. This is the screening of Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film Strangers on the Train, which gives DeVito the idea of ​​switching to murder with Crystal, who hates his wife Kate Mulgrew, who not only deceives him because of the idea about the book he wanted to write, but Except In addition, he continues to play with Tony Ciccone. <br /> <br /> “Throw Mom out of the train” is played out as “Strangers on the train,” since DeVito seems to have completed his murder scheme. But Cristal has a bit of a problem with even dropping Ramsey with Danny. This woman may need to kill, but she will take on a lot. <br /> <br /> The Academy’s only recognition that Throw Mom Out of the Train received was an Academy Award nomination for Anne Ramsey for Best Supporting Actress. Ramsey lost to Olympia Dukakis because of Munstrak, but the film turned out to be a better time for her. Ramsey already had throat cancer, which would eventually kill her next year, but look at the list of credits that she managed to save even after “Drop Mommy from the Train,” she worked to the end. <br /> <br /> I saw interviews with both stars of Throw Momma From The Train, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, and both happily admitted that Anna Ramsey’s performance as the mother from Hell made the film successful and stole it from under them . Their recognition of Ramsey’s talent and work is the best tribute possible. <br /> <br /> If Marion Lorne in “Strangers on the Train” were like Ann Ann Ramsey here, Farley Granger would gladly join Robert Walker to get rid of her. Throw Momma From A Train is one of the best black comedies you can't miss.
