Superb and charming. Justin Henry is handsome as the blissful and naughty Howard Kaylan, lead singer in the top ten best hits, The Turtles. Real magic is a title sequence with a worthy prize for Royal Watkins Academy. A performance that completely captures the mystical and yet mundane Jimi Hendrix. Few films, incredibly, can find the essence of a special moment in life and time. I would like to see it available in any outlet of home video, without any hassle. Uh ... what's the matter? <br /> <br /> Thanks, Eddie. A worthy addition to the history of the psychedelic sixties. A certain flicker in the eyes of the mind.
