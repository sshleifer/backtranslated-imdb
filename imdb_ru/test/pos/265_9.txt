Vg Brit rom-com, one to see if you can get your hands on a copy. Quirky and often amazing, this is not the best of Brady's films (“Kiss, Kiss, Blast” is by far the funniest), although he has a unique charm. A well-written story unfolds in several dead ends, but mostly on the surface with a new plot. From the very beginning, you know how it will end, but when it comes, it will be honest and very open, a realistic and reliable ending, the end seemed the beginning, pleasant and left me wanting more.
