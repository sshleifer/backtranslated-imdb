John Wayne - one of the few players in the history of cinema, who failed during his first big break, and then achieved success the second time. Of course, everyone knows that the second time was a classic stagecoach with director John Ford. <br /> <br /> But we are here to talk about the Great Trail. Another director of John Ford, Raul Walsh, noticed this tall child on the set of one of Ford’s films and thought that he had potential. He wanted to make him the leader in the big western budget that Fox was going to make. The film, as planned, would be a tribute to the well-known classical silent western film "Covered Wagon." <br /> <br /> While watching the “Big Footprint” I was amazed at how much Wayne's character with Bain Coleman was with Kingo Ringo in the stage. Both characters were pretty young cow heads, but both were also on a revenge mission. And, of course, both films were shot on the spot and show the cost of their production. There is no studio product with a western set. <br /> <br /> I also do not think it was an accident when Wayne got this break at the beginning of the sound era. Raul Walsh, I think, looked around Hollywood and probably did not think that many of the movie cowboys would have the power of sound. This is another thing that Walsh noticed in Wayne. <br /> <br /> Judging by what I read, “Big Footprint” failed because, having spent all this money on making the film in the early wide-format process, one of Fox’s geniuses realized that their theaters were not equipped with wide screen to show it. And when the Great Depression comes, there will be no money to expand these screens in Fox cinemas. Thus, “Big Footprint” received a limited release, even in what we would call a formatted version, and lost a lot of money for Fox films. <br /> <br /> Margaret Churchill is good as the hero of the crinoline, which the duke wins, loses and wins again from Jan Keith. Keith, Charles Stevens, and F. Tyrone Power are a trio of villains that Wayne has to deal with. <br /> <br /> F. Tyrone Power is the father of the famous movie legend Tyrone Power. He was a big strong man with a lot of experience in classic roles on screen and on stage. I would not be surprised if his son, who was then 15 years old, did not hang around the set. <br /> <br /> Look for Ward Bond, although you may have problems finding it under a large, dense bush. beard. <br /> <br /> Watching “Big Footprint”, it is now interesting to ask where John Wayne’s career could go if “Big Footprint” was a big hit.
