<br /> <br /> *************************** SMALL SPOILERS AHEAD ************ ************** <br /> <br /> We Dive at Dawn - a film made in English, starring John Mills. The second time I watched the DVD version was on the big screen of the TV, and I must say that the film is better than I thought when I first saw it on the samll screen. Maybe it helped to view a large screen? <br /> <br /> I still say that the first few parts of the film are muddled, but as soon as the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission, the film is also shot! The search for a German battleship called Brandenburg and the adventures that accompanied him were exciting, and the details shown in the film are interesting! <br /> <br /> I upgrade my rating to 7/10. If you like movies about the Second World War, I think this film will seem interesting to you after the submarine is launched. Some men on the submarine also have a sense of humor!
