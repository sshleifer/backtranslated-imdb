I stopped watching “West Wing” after Aaron Sorkin stopped writing and producing. It is simply not the same. Imagine my excitement when watching a movie he wrote again. It was a long time ago - an American president, a few good people. His script was a wonderful mixture of humor and tragedy. He made a plausible convincing story and at the same time made me cry. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was an incredibly small Texas congressman whose voters only wanted to cut taxes and save their weapons. Not hard work, so he had plenty of time to fool around - and he did it. His office looked like he was in the Playboy mansion. As he reportedly said: "You can teach them to print, but you can't teach them to grow boobs." Despite his sexist attitude, which goes well with a Texas congressman, they were extremely loyal to him, especially his assistant Amy Adams (Junbag and former girlfriend Hutters). <br /> <br /> Now let's add a rich Texan socialite who wants something made in Afghanistan, beautifully played by Julia Roberts; and a CIA agent who has a pain in the ass, superbly done by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you have a movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> Outstanding essays, superb game and story that needs to be told. What else do you want in a movie?
