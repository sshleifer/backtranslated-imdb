Lackawanna Blues is a touching story about a boy who is brought up in the house by some rather unusual people. <br /> <br /> This editing and soundtrack really draws you into the plot and allows you to see the movie as the writer intended. <br /> <br /> The music is really connected with the plot. the story that made the characters come alive. Editing has made the story more progressive and exciting. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by some of the cast, most notably S. Epatha Merkerson. <br /> <br /> I can’t wait to see one person’s show featuring these films by writer Ruben Santiago-Hudson.
