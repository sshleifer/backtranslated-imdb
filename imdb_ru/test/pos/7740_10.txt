I often heard people expressing disappointment that Mazursky's The Tempest has little to do with the original of Shakespeare. In my opinion, this is both true and false, but most of all it is a bad starting point for offering criticism. A work of art should never be criticized for what it is not, and for what it is. The film "The Tempest" is nothing more than a faithful performance of the play, but, in my opinion, he is faithful to the work of Shakespeare in the spirit. Thus, “The Tempest” is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No, not experimentally, as in a hand-held camera and muttering dialogue, but experimentally, as in the study of the convolutions of history without excessively taking into account box-office fees. The storm of Mazursky is epic, sad, realistic, joyful, full of life, but, above all, it is figurative. The image of Cassavetes Phillip / Prospero is in itself a 10/10 rating, and when you add Gena Rowlands, Susan Sarandon, surprisingly deep Molly Ringwald, Raul Julia, dialogues, music and elegantly suggestive small tables scattered throughout the picture ... I think so. One of the best movies of the 80s. Do not miss it.
