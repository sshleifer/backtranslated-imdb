John Leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller. Every time it was on HBO, I had to stop and watch it. John tells the story of how he grew up (probably some facts and fabrications) and adds funny stories in the midst. If you like John's comedy, I would say that this is probably his comedy at its best.
