Although it was a low-budget film and obviously at the last minute, it contains a certain charm that is difficult to determine. I am inclined to believe that this is a screenwriter - Grant Morris (see “The Dead Dog”), who, despite the distorted storyline, contributed a fantastic piece of humor, which is lacking in many modern box office hits. Definitely need to look at the laughter on Sunday afternoon. Speaking like a true lonely girl and very skeptical, this film didn’t particularly inspire me, but it kindled a small fire of hope for a love life. Not my love life, but the personal life of my little crazy neighbor, which allows her hamster to sleep in bed with her. She can find someone.
