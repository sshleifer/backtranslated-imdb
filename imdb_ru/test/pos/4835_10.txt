I watched the premiere of “The Way to Paradise” in the opposite direction and was stunned by this, the dramatic license and all that. I lived in New York (Brooklyn) for several years and remembered. Today, given the links with groups such as Al-Queda, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, I consider this a warning not recognized by our government. For this, I place the blame on our bureaucracy and leaders. 9.11.01 there was a new tactic to decapitate our two branches of the government, and our government has no excuse to prevent this, period. "The path to heaven" was just a dramatic presentation of the preview of the 93rd year, and nobody cared. Now, after almost 3,000 deaths and years later, we are struggling to find an answer that has to be solved for decades.
