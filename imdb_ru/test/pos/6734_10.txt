This film begins with all the glum promises of the great modern noir Western - after an ill-conceived introductory sequence anyway. The landscapes are beautifully deserted, the characters are painfully isolated. While some actors are less believable, the plot ultimately delivers enough tension and twists to make this film worth watching.
