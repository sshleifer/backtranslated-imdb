The third film I watched at the philly festival is an outstanding drama from Japan. After getting out of prison, nine escaped prisoners are planning to find the “key to the universe,” which the tenth prisoner told them about. Along the way, we get to know each of these people quite well. Everyone has their own dreams. For most of the film, this is apparently a comedy, but there is a shift when the film ends in tragedy. All the actors give great performances. I can't say much more without spoiling the film, but suffice it to say that you end up feeling some of these people. At 2 o'clock this movie is a bit long, but nevertheless good. I do not hesitate to recommend it with the warning that he has a little disturbing violence for the gentle. At this time, Tosiaki Toyoda was in the head-man, and I want to look for his previous films and look forward to his future. <br /> <br /> My rating: A
