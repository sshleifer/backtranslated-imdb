This program is a favorite of our family, and we believe that it MUST be released on DVD by the seasons !!! The name "Promised Land" is very appropriate, as this is a positive statement about all the good things that remain in this great country and about the people who live in it! This is a program like God Bless America with inspirational stories, old-fashioned values, practical characters, truthful and encouraging messages, beautiful landscapes, well-written humor and drama. This is a show that the whole family can enjoy and benefit from - without worrying about bad language, “adult” topics, rudeness, violence, etc. each of them again and again when they are finally released on DVD!
