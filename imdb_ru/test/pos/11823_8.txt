This is one of the most touching films I've ever watched. No film has affected me like this. This is a great movie and you should see it yourself. I am usually invulnerable with these stories of sobbing, but this one did it for me. I was in tears at the end. You will crave the friendship that is depicted in this film. If I could give this film a billion stars, I could.
