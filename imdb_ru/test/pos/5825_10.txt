Oz is a television show in which intense non-stop adrenaline. This is a show that is focused not on a large audience, but on a specific one, since its themes are exclusively for adults. Obviously, this did not reach mass success, since it was impossible, but it was very famous among its audience, and many famous actors or guests took off or became part of the show. <br /> <br /> Oz is a series of fictional prison stories based somewhere in the state of New York. There are many different ethnic groups that play roughly the same role in representation. These groups include Muslims, domestic boys, Aryans, bikers, Italians, Latin Americans, Irish, Christians, gays, and others. Some have some form of connection with each other, for example, bikers and Aryans, while Aryans are the enemy of numerous groups such as Muslims and homeboys. <br /> <br /> In the penitentiary of Oswald (his official name) there is a policy according to which not too many members of any one ethnic group are allowed. This is a high-security prison, and a regular prison, where prisoners are sometimes sent to or from a show, is called a “wide population” or “gen pop”. The main character of the show is Augustus Hill, who also tells the story before and after the main segments crossed between documentary and biographical types. Hill is associated with the use of a wheelchair as a consequence of its unknown past. He is in the “other” group, which includes people who do not fit into other prison gangs. <br /> <br /> Of the many groups, the smaller ones are the ones that get the most out of trouble while the larger ones are in conflict with each other. Here are some of the most remarkable characters: 1) Ryan O'Reilly is responsible for his fellow Irishmen and for some reason always voluntarily engages in deadly activities for the weakest link. 2) Miguel Alvarez is an observant Latino who is constantly struggling to cope with his popularity in his own gang and with others. 3) Simon Adebesi is a Nigerian, former leader of the Homeboys gang. He is also very physically quite large and solid. These two reasons make him one of the most powerful prisoners in Oz. 4) Karim Said is a Muslim and black nationalist who is very determined in his views and desires. He fights for the rights of his people on many levels through a show, from his own Muslim group to his wider black group, and even fights for all groups against unfair rules of power. His character is in some way identical to Malcom X, a famous black human rights activist who was also a Muslim. <br /> <br /> In general, for its genre, Oz is perhaps the greatest (a fictional prison show or an ethnicity based show). communication). If it doesn’t sound as if it were your own show, you probably don’t feel it, but if it’s really interesting, then it’s definitely worth a look. The biggest problem with the show is how addictive it is, some may feel wrong when looking at a lot of this stuff. Researchers argue about whether it is harmful or not, but in the end it is simply a reflection of the society of the world in which we live today. This means that he is as an informer and indicator of the world, and not as an aggressor.
