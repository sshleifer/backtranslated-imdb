Obsessed !!!!! I have every Gilmore Girls season, and I think the reason why I love him so much is how clever this script is, and not in a regular comedy show. There is no pause after the joke, he just continues if you missed you. missed it. And this doesn’t look like a soap opera drama, because it doesn’t use dramatic music, and the actors never have these silly, silly, unexpected looks. I think Gilmore Girls is one of the best shows on the TV show of its time. It's funny because they talk so fast that you can't get everything for the first time, it's nice to come back and laugh at other jokes. In addition, they have so many mentions that it is amazing how clever it is. <br /> <br /> And you can relate to characters, including such real ones, and the actors are excellent there - from the witty Lorelai to the hermit Luke and the immature Kirk the show is simply amazing. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time and spend time with his family, this is definitely a show for them. There is only one word that Gilmore Girls can describe .... CLASSIC !!!!!!
