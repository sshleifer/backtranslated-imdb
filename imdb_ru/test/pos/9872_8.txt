This sequel is brilliant and is the latest film that Donald Pleasant (Dr.Loomis) worked on until his death. I liked the new direction that the film took with the story, and not just Michael Myers, who wanted to kill his family. I love this whole series, and besides the first and second films, this is definitely the best.
