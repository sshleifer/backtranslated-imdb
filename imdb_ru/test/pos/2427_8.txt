What I find remarkable in this terrific movie is that Altman, the crazy and wild guy he is, shot the novel COLD DAY IN THE PARK, and Sandy Dennis was originally a man in the book. He was mentally exhausted by a lonely gay who looked out of the window of his apartment when he noticed the top five. It is strange that Altman fans do not know how clever he was to change the sex of the main character; thereby avoiding the homo-erotic bans on gay life in the 60s and actually causing the hideous kind of Dennis madness to work even better in transposition. If you watch the film again, it will become obvious how Altmanâ€™s mind acts slyly ...
