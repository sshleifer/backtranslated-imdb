If you want to see a little horror comedy with creepy sensations, then this is it. If you expect blood and guts to shake, that it will scare your pants off, then this is not for you. <br /> <br /> For the budget on which this film was shot, the music was especially amazing! Despite the fact that the film was shot with a low budget, the music and sound were definitely better than in most films with a huge budget! <br /> <br /> The story was really well done and the director deserves praise. In this film, an almost perfect mixture of comedy and horror! The game is top notch and leaves room to make a sequel, which I definitely pull for! I have no doubt that this film will become a real cult classic. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this film tells the story of the life of a boy who begins his career as a grave robber. In the memoirs it is told about each of the most fantastic events, which the duet of robbers faces. Vampires for zombies and even aliens! Our stars began as simple grave robbers, stealing jewels, but quickly became the abductors of bodies for a mad doctor (Angus Scrima), who needed bodies for his medical practice. When a duet finds a way to force a vampire to send its cruel employer, burglars discover that trafficking in undead corpses is much more profitable than just stealing ordinary corpses. The only problem is that there is another gang called “House of Murphy”, which is fighting for the same dead bodies of the undead, and it is there that both robbing robbers come face to face with terrible consequences. <br /> <br /> One of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies that I have seen for many years, and reminds me of the Sinister Dead. Do not miss it, you will regret it!
