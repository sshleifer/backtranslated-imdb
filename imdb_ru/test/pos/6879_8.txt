The notorious actor of HK CATIII, Anthony Wong, this time (well ... actually not once - he was a policeman in the films "DARKNESS" and several others ...) is not a psychopathic pervert in "Erotic night". Usually recognized for his role as a complete fool in CATIII's "nasty things" like UNTOLD STORY and EBOL SYNDROME - this time Wong is on the receiving side of nastiness ... <br /> <br /> Wong plays the guy who goes to the wizard who promises to give him really good dreams, for the price. True to their word, Wong's dreams are about having crazy sex with donkey hot schoolgirls - but dreams come with a price that is more than money. A sorcerer can manipulate dreams and blackmail Wong out of his money and business with the help of a sexual ghost, kill his family and eventually kill Wong himself ... Wong's brother comes to town to find out what is happening and eventually discovers that the killing his family is an evil sorcerer's case - but, as it turns out, Wong's brother is a pretty crazy sorcerer by himself, and with the help of the sorcerer’s offended wife turns the tables to the sorcerer and his plans. .. <br /> <br /> EROTIC NIGHTMARE is one of the nicest CATIII films I've seen lately. There is no rude and dark feeling of some other CATIII recordings, such as RED TO KILL, UNTOLD STORY or HUMAN PORK CHOP - EROTIC NIGHTMARE, although still sloppy in terms of sex and subject matter, more “funny” than some of the more serious films of the genre. More comparable with ETERNAL EVIL OF ASIA - the more “carefree” recording of CATIII, which offers a lot of naked bodies and a lot of blood, but not too comedy. Definitely worth a look, especially for fans of the genre. 8/10
