Talisman - a masterpiece of Ladislav Starevich. It tells the story of a toy dog ​​that looks for an orange after hearing a mother tell her daughter that she has no money. The dog is chosen with other toys for sale. In the truck, after the others jump off while the car travels, the dog stays and waits until it is picked up from the store before they go on their own. He manages to turn orange after she bites the leg of a woman while she is holding and selling fruit. When he runs, he meets the devil and accepts his offer to stop at a nightclub. There he meets other toys that jumped off the truck. The cat that was next to him in the vehicle is particularly determined to get a doggy orange. I will just stop here to mention that there are other surprisingly strange things happening in the nightclub that you should see for yourself. Suffice it to say that if you love Starevich and are interested in all the animations from the past, I definitely recommend you find this film!
