Very funny look at some current affairs and political events in Australia. The Chaser boys really enjoy the show, and I like the fact that they all have their strengths; some brilliantly (Chas) in making total idiots out of himself, while Julian can produce the whole “I interview a famous politician, and I'm going to suggest that he disguise himself as a pot of jam” of humor. <br /> They have great plots in the show, which captured all sorts of aspects of Australian culture, such as our shows about current events, our advertising programs and TV shows in the early morning. Some materials are a little tired and predictable, but overall they are very fun to look at and leave a smile on their face.
