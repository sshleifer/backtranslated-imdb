This is one of the many technophobic films that grew up like mushrooms in the mid-90s, after the Internet became massive. <br /> <br /> Hollywood films have always been to “decorate” the events depicted in order to make them look better and more attractive. The same thing happens when Hollywood tries to show us some high tech. The result of such attempts varies from very far-fetched and absurd (see Hackers (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), etc.) to quite realistic (see Sneakers (1992)). <br /> <br /> The “network” lies somewhere between these extremes. Pickiness can lead to a rather large number of technical inconsistencies, as well as a large number of cases where actions seem much more “sexy” and graphic than what happens in real life (as it usually happens in movies). br /> <br /> However, simply by skipping them, the viewer will receive a rather solid, fascinating film. Characters and acting are convincing, and the film holds you well in its place until the end. The plot is normal (rather standard, really - based on a good old-fashioned design, but with a high-tech advantage this time) and rather convincing (again, if we ignore technical problems). The development of the plot is a little sluggish, though, and sometimes you can expect some supposedly amazing turns in the plot. <br /> <br /> The bonus here is the cutie Sandra Bullock, who, besides being cute, makes it pretty easy, apparently, also depicts a solid deed. You can truly feel her character - her despair, her emotions. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film is interesting and interesting, assesses it on a scale of 7 out of 10 on my scale. It is worth renting a video library or even watching a movie theater. To buy it or not - you decide.
