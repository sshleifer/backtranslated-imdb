An obsessive love story where the characters were extremely convincing. I think this film emphasizes the talent of professional actors. Especially for Vincent Cassel, who (at the time of the shooting) was not the first character you think about for such a role. And yes, he managed to seduce the beautiful Monica Belluchi outside the film during this creation. I can only say that this film should have been released in the USA, and not to think about how to make a remake. Heâ€™s just so French, almost perverted ... and yet so truthful ... this film should remain untouched ... <br /> <br /> A director who should definitely get more projects, since this type of subject requires the right the amount of ingredients not to fail ..
