I just saw the last episode, number 32 (although it’s written on the site that only 30 episodes were made), and I have to comment on the fact that this series was really very good, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes criminal / police stories. Presumably, all 32 were based on facts with information at the end of each episode of court sentences handed down to perpetrators, sometimes it was a rude, well-acting, believable and, I dare say, entertaining series. The fact that the authorities in Denmark decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable, as they did their job well and, at least in the series, could never “get their man”! This is a definite 10/10 for me.
