This film makes you wonder. It shows how a womanâ€™s weaknesses can lead to nightmares for others. Her physically aggressive behavior is more often seen in men than in women, so I was even more embarrassed to see the behavior of the lead actress. I think that women may think about this behavior, but I do not think they act on it. Dark scenes reinforced the sense of evil that needed to be hidden. I felt relieved when the prisoners escaped. I hoped that the end would bring a satisfactory solution, but this is not so. Maybe it is more realistic. Life seems to be moving in the same direction, instead of creating a new river bed running up the hill.
