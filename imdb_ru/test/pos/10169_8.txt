Alfred Hitchcock shows originality in a remake of his own British film of 1934, The Man Who Knew Too Much. This story of 1956 is much easier than the previous one. Mr. Hitchcock was lucky that he had employees who went with him from one film to another, keeping the standard in their work. Robert Burks did a great job with cinema, and editing George Tomasini shows his talent. Ultimately, Bernard Herrmann performs at the magnificent Royal Albert Hall in London at the climax of the film. <br /> <br /> James Stewart was an actor who worked well with Mr. Hitchcock. In this version, he plays a doctor from Indiana on vacation with his wife and son. When we meet him, they go to Marrakesh on one local bus, and the intrigue begins. His wife is beautiful Doris Day at her best. Before marriage, she was a famous singer, and now she is an ideal wife and mother. The film has a good cast, Brenda DeBenzi, Bernard Miles, Daniel Geleen, Alan Mowbray, among others, do an excellent job of depicting their characters. <br /> <br /> Although this is a “light Hitchcock” I can not reject it as a failure. “The man who knew too much” is a change of pace for Hitchcock fans.
