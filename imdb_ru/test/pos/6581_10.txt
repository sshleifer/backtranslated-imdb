I saw it on a subtitled DVD, which made it a little disappointing due to the length of the film. But I was chained to all of this. The fact that I was fascinated by the characters and always absorbed in the story, despite the subtitles, is a testament to the strength of the film. This is an amazing job. I have it on my list of ten favorite films of all time. It's just the best foreign film I've seen in the last twenty years or so. I would like to know the complete history of this film. It must have taken a very long time and required the use of hundreds of locations. Its use of some hardcore scenes (on TV in a motel room), unfortunately, may make some people not to watch it, but if you donâ€™t mind it, you will be deeply moved by all the stories in this one!
