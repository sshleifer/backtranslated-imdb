I saw this film only once, a few years ago. But I remember that I liked it very much. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ahead ** Old famous opera singer in retirement, and she decides to give all her money to her cats. Her butler hears this and prepares to get rid of the cats so that he can get good luck. He puts knockout drops in their milk. When they wake up, they end up many miles. They should go home before it is too late. With the help of an independent thinking cat and other animal partners, evading the butler and disrupting his plan. <br /> <br /> It could have been better, but it could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10.
