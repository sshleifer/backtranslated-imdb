This film sleeps because Rod Steiger is the only big name in the credits. However, all the supporting actors fit his character well. It was fitting that Rod Steiger once again reminded us of his inventive power as an actor in his latest film. He portrayed in his grandfather impulsiveness, stubbornness and the acceptance of the end of life in a characteristic individual and convincing performance. Since his character was close to death, history brings us closer to the most valuable things that are given to us: the privilege of living, relationships with family members and the sympathy of those who care for us. His search, along with the granddaughter of one of his sons, gave enough time to make me wait, waiting for a climax, such as the meeting of two long-separated elderly lovers who were also on the verge of death in Eternally Young. “I wondered how the meeting would be organized and how strong my emotions would be by the time he and his granddaughter had reached the end of their search. I was glad to know that the story brought more than I expected. A delightfully satisfying climax brought me a lot the values ​​of the precious gifts of life, love, and family that I and we all enjoy today.
