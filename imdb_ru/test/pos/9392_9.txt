George Barry is a genius. “Death bed: the bed that eats” is the prototype for most of the fantastic “snowmobile” and camp surrealism, which is now so chic. Really innovative, individual and simply awesome. Hyper-weird game, subtle nightmare atmosphere. I recommend reading Stephen Trower’s book “The Nightmare USA” (there is a chapter dedicated to Barry and “Death Bed: The Bed That Eats”). Available in FAB Press. On the appropriate note, "Death Bed: A Bed That Eats" and "Behind the Dream Door" make a perfect double counting. In addition, it is trite and tedious - and ultimately stupidly ironic - to criticize a low-budget cult film for being “poorly made” or “technically inept”. The aesthetics of the B-film are part of the charm of these films. No amount of CGI can duplicate the cumulative effect of “Bed of death: the bed that eats” on the viewer with advanced taste.
