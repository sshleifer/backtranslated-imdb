"Throw mom off the train" is a simple dark comedy with lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal plays a frustrated writer on the verge of collapse; Danny DeVito plays a man in one of the lessons of the letter Crystal. Crystal's ex-wife, if I may say so, is simply “hag”, and Crystal hates her. DeVito, feeling it, offers Crystal a deal one night: DeVito will kill Crystal's wife if Crystal kills woman DeVito. Crystal, of course, refuses, but later, deep in his heart, damage causes him to say "yes." And so, along the way, we see what happens when you try to throw someone’s mother out of a moving train. <br /> <br /> This story is an interesting character exploration; a story of evil, greed, revenge, ego, trust, doing what is right, but most of all corruption. We see how the white-collar writer Crystal is constantly under stress because of the events around him, and because of DeVito's constant grumbling, he says yes. But in the depths of his subconscious we know that he wanted to say “yes”, and he is pleased that he said this to DeVito. <br /> <br /> This film is a bit of a dark parody of Hitchcock's immortal film “Strangers on the Train,” and he plays a tribute to the film early on, when there is a theater in which Strangers play on the train. We see as DeVito watches the movie, and a light bulb flashes in his head. He gets an idea. Throw mother out of the train! <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal makes another convincing and strangely comical performance as a writer who is on the verge of collapse. so overwhelmed by all that surrounded him, that his internal emotions were manifested, and he agreed to throw away the ma Mu DeVito from the train. <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito made this film very well. He uses only the right touch of comic darkness to create a world of corruption and disease. Everyone is crazy, but not to the extreme, as in some other dark ones. comedies. In the War of Roses there is only the right touch of darkness. <br /> <br /> This is not only “Throw Mother from the Train”, it is a simple story about corruption and morality, but also an interesting study of character. Definitely worth watching on TV. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
