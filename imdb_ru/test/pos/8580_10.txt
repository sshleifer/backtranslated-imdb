*A warning! Some spoilers! * <br /> <br /> Matt, a rich writer, is actually still a boy in his behavior. He does not care about anything, but about his own needs and cannot take care of the consequences of his actions. As soon as he meets with Them and her connections with her family and communication, he begins to feel that something is missing in his life. <br /> <br /> He begins to realize that in fact he is lonely and stuck in impersonal structures that are simply comfortable, but lack heart and dedication. Nevertheless, he shies away from any duties and does not want to change his life. But can he once again settle in his old life and ignore the bonds that he has already - unconsciously - formed? <br /> <br /> The situation with Them is absolutely opposite. She is drawn into the rules of her Nigerian community, its prejudices and medieval values. Being a single mother, her situation is difficult, and she becomes even worse when she falls in love with Matt, the white devil (as the referendum would say), a man who cannot commit. The women of the community plan to marry her in a referendum in order to deprive her of her only status and give Sammy a “name”. But it will mean that Them will give up independence and self-determination. But is there an alternative for her if she wants Sammy to be accepted and she becomes a respected member of the community? <br /> <br /> This film has it all: a very sensitive and sensual love story (with VERY sexy scenes of Matt and Nimi) and a charming child who is eagerly dating, beautiful landscapes in bright colors. <br /> <br /> Colin Firth (* faint *) and Nia Long show great chemistry. Just fantastic to watch them. And Fissy Roberts in the role of Sammy just to die. You just want to adopt him. I just love the way Sammy and Matthew talk to each other. They are both on the same level in many ways. Especially when Sammy asks Matt about sex. This scene is just amazing! <br /> <br /> Almost nothing to complain about .... wait! It is not true. One thing is not good: this film is not long enough! (Well, and maybe the referendum is too bad and too stupid to be convincing ....) <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, by all means!
