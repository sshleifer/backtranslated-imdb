Warning: if the Cohen brothers or David Lynch determine your taste in the film, ignore this review and move on. <br /> <br /> Yes, I borrowed a “brief summary” from a book about President Ronald Reagan, but among other virtues this film emphasizes the role that the character plays in the lives of noble people. This film is full of honest, decent people, and they have honesty to save. In short, they have a "character." <br /> <br /> A little cavilier: If you don’t know the history of the Second World War, you probably don’t know this, since the arrival of Captain Correlli on the island until the fall of Mussolini, 3 and a half years have passed. The average viewer might think that the novel was a “vortex” variety. This is not true. Romance develops slowly, which gives it both dignity and meaning. The intentional pace of the film can be the way the director. <br /> <br /> In some reviews, the Italian accent of Cage was criticized. The Italian-speaking members of my family assure me that his accent is pretty good. <br /> <br /> The story was on top. Yes, the Germans rebelled against their Italian allies, who for the most part were reluctant allies from the very beginning. If you find this shock, keep in mind that the French Mediterranean fleet was blown up by the British in 1940, immediately after the surrender of France, so that it would not fall into the hands of the Vichy government or, worse, the Nazis. <br /> Image of Italians as an educated and cultural was a compliment of an educated and cultural civilization. <br /> <br /> This film was beautifully photographed and its story was lyrical. The script did not force to think and was not smart, but here there was a situation when confusion and cunning were not needed and would not be appropriate. <br /> <br /> The story is gentle, and the message is inspiring. The characters are honest, bold, serious, responsive and cute. This is a good little movie. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
