I think this is a great classic monster movie for the whole family. Mole, what a car! A tall creature with a beak, flying green lizards, Rantorinkus / Maya, or anyone else, and the ape-man talks telepathically to them. The battle of men in rubber suits fighting for a doll for breakfast. Yummy! Class, what else can I say? How would they make a 2002 remake of this?
