I just discovered this movie and love it. Just the right combination of fast moving stories, interesting characters, funny moments (but not overloaded with silly jokes) and funny performances by Kelsey Grammar, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron Schneider, Rip Thorn and many others. Buckman is especially good, and I really enjoyed watching the guy who played Stepanic. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to me that they used the real submarine “Pampanito” to work on the main scenes and almost imitated it. for their sets. Decorating the scenery is really impressive if you take a digital tour of Pampanito online and then compare it with scenes from the movie. They did a great job on this movie. <br /> <br /> What an easy, entertaining and truly enjoyable movie!
