Crossfire is a fantastic film noir that is both a product of its time and timeless classics. This film achieves this goal by solving problems that were not presented on the screen before its release in 1947, and is a high-quality film that has survived to this day with a good script, great appearance and fantastic performances of its actors. The first American film that raises the issue of anti-Semitism, Crossfire is cemented in a classic position. The situation in America after World War II unfolds after the Jew was found murdered. <br /> <br /> The story is gorgeous, its topic of hatred is wrapped in a grim crime thriller, and along with anti-Semitism, another great dialogue and theme after World War II. Unlike other mysterious thrillers, viewers are warned about who the criminal is, almost immediately. Nevertheless, the story of the film is still fascinating because of the struggle of all the great characters who are experiencing, trying to understand the situation. In addition to the magnificent general history and themes, the whole script is just clever, full of informative messages and razor-sharp exchanges between the characters. <br /> <br /> The film’s fascinating story is wonderfully played out by its superb cast. Robert Young is fantastic, as is Captain Finley, the lead murder investigator. Finley is my favorite character in the film, he's just a cool character — dry as a bone, and sturdy, like two in four, and stops at nothing to bring the killer to justice. Robert Mitchum is also great in the film, very vivid in his quiet character of the army sergeant due to his excellent presence on the screen. Gloria Graham gives an unforgettable performance in her small Oscar-nominated role; George Cooper also works well as a sick and upset Corporal Mitchell; Paul Kelly gives a creepy image of a strange character; and Steve Brody, Sam Leuven, Jacqueline White and William Phipps also give strong support performances. As a result, Robert Ryan became the most discussed performer of the film, playing the role of Montgomery, and was nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The Crossfire has a stunning look. Director Edward Dmitrik does an extraordinary job with the film, and cinematographer J. Roy Hunt masterfully handles his black and white picture. The Crossfire picture is as dark and damp as its themes, covered with a shadow with an almost glossy shade, but also very raw in parts. Ironically, the gorgeous appearance of the film was not the result of hard work or even intention. Dmitry wanted to spend more time and money on the actors, and not on the lighting - that's what he did. Less light, less preparation (about 6 hours a day), and this led to a fantastic looking film. Crossfire is not only a well-made work of cinematic art, but also a great example of a cheap film that turns into a rich classic.
