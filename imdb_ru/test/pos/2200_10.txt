I saw Sweeney Todd on Broadway in 1980. George Hearn starred in it, and most of the other actors who starred in a national travel company that was filmed on television in Los Angeles in 1982 took part. Last night I watched a new DVD release in Los Angeles, although I owned a video tape for many years. Production and performance could hardly have been better, but the age of the original tape showed, because the quality of the sound and video is below modern standards, even on a recently compressed DVD. However, I still give 10 out of 10 because of the greatness of the work and the amazingly wonderful speeches of George Hearn and Angela Lansbury. Even today, my most memorable memory from a live musical theatrical performance should be Hearnâ€™s "These are my friends." "You will drip rubies", brrr.
