I rented Boogie Nights last week, and I can tell you, when I watched the movie, I had a blast. If you think that when you watch a movie, you will get set on porn. I mean yes, if not a porn man who cannot get bored of being her than this is not a movie to see. But the fact is, the whole movie is not exactly about porn. Well, halfway through the film about the porn industry, but the other half is about character development and the bad situations of these characters go through. The actors played perfect roles there, especially Mark Wahlberg, John S. Reilly and William H. Macy. Sex scenes, of course awesome, but mostly focused on the deception of the character in porn movies, while not fighting. Great movie, one of the best! <br /> <br /> Perspective Hedin: 10/10 **** A +
