I first heard about the "Team Magazine" when I was in touch for local science fiction. Craig Bowlsby, Linden Banks, Sophie Banks and Brian Oberwell, came to show a video and give a few panels on the creation of a TV with a limited budget. I have to say that I was very pleased when I finally had the opportunity to watch the show. Comparisons with Red Dwarf are inevitable, since the first seasons of Red Dwarf were also shot with a low budget (although a record must be set in the Commander magazine for the least amount of money spent per minute of airtime), and, therefore, candy "with a good letter and game. Linden Banks, who plays Blater, a senior junior officer, does an especially good job, representing a serious but ignorant person. <br /> <br /> Bowlsby’s original idea was to tell the story in two-minute “inserts” shown in between the other shows during the evening, although for some reason Space didn’t understand how cool this idea would be and therefore all the commercials were rolled up in a one-hour show, which Space usually showed in two half-hour episodes. The current DVD does not include episode 3 (premiered at Cascadia-Con in Seattle in 2005) or episode 4 (viewed on VCON in Vancouver in 2006), but if you communicate with the local fan community, you can catch the news about the show somewhere near you.
