Years before marriage agreements became commonplace, Ernest Lubich made a comedy on the screen on which they are based. Bluebeard's Eighth Wife draws Gary Cooper as a multi-millionaire living on the French Riviera, who has been married seven times and is now marrying Claudette Colbert for number eight. But Cooper is a good sport about it, he always agrees with his ex-wives for $ 50,000 a year in accordance with the agreement they sign up before marrying him. It looks like what we now call a marriage agreement. <br /> <br /> Of course, Claudette wants much more, and it seems to her that Cooper is taking too much of a business approach to marriage. She would like to get a real deal and is ready to do anything to get it. <br /> <br /> Bluebeard’s eighth wife has some really funny moments - Cooper's original meeting with Colbert in the men's store, where Cooper is insisting that he wants only pajamas tops and Colbert is only looking for bottom. And, of course, my favorite is that Colbert is chasing and blackmailing Detective Cooper to spy on her. Herman Bing has the best supporting role in the film, as in the same agitated detective story. <br /> <br /> I often wondered how in those days Hollywood managed to shoot so many people who are not French in such a film. Of course, Cooper is an American, and Colbert from the cast is the only one of French origin. Although David Niven is charming, as always, the fact that he was French is ridiculous, but he is sooooo British. <br /> <br /> However, Bluebeard's “Eighth Wife” is a nice movie and a great example of what was called “Lubich's touch” in the old days.
