The BBC surpassed itself with the boundaries that they crossed with the Tipping Velvet. In the past, they “dared” with the work of Dennis Potter, but this mini-series (as it was shown in the UK) is excellent. The work of Andrew Davis at the highest level - I did not read the novel by Sarah Water, but I can imagine that he did it for real. I comment on being rude - most men watched this - turned out to be the main topic of conversation and sales when it was initially advertised. The fact is that she portrays the lesbian side of society in the 1800s — a time when the majority thought it was the old men and the mercenary boys — well, that was the case — lesbianism occurred mostly behind closed and often respectable doors. > You can also look at Velvet Tips as a “love story” - this is true, as well as “self-knowledge”, through which many gay / bi and straight people go through, commenting on it and repeating it all the time. <Br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen it yet, whether you’ve repeated it on TV or on DVD, you will get it — a treat awaits you — and even its production and filming are perfect. Just try to hide your blush in parts, as I said, “bawdy” is a common thing of the day - and beware of one or two phalluses! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
