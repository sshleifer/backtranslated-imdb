This documentary is not only one of the best documentaries I have seen, but also one of the most touching and quietly beautiful films I have seen in that period. It follows the lives of two Sudanese young people, Peter and Santino, when they are trying to penetrate American culture. At first, Peter and Santino are friends, but gradually they diverge more and more as Peter goes to Kansas City, while Santino remains in Houston (“the land called Houston”). Beauty Santino in his eyes. He takes people on his back, he maintains an apartment full of other Sudanese, pays for an apartment, does everything for other people. He is a silent sufferer. Peter takes care of himself by getting a secondary education, playing basketball and making Christian friends. It seems that the director Megan Milan did not know what she is interested in the beauty of this story. Peter and Santino are awesome characters that touch you. But the real strength in this film lies in his comments on American society. This is not to judge. It shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world, and how difficult it can be for external people. I suggest you find this film and look at America through the lives of these two charming and beautiful people. <br /> <br /> My rating is: 10/10
