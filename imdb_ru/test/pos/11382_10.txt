What movie! This is undoubtedly entertaining the subject (if you are not a bigot) and the mature, funny and complex scenario of Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, Hard Eight). P. T. Anderson will no doubt be near for some time. The evidence is here in this epic and ambitious masterpiece. Each character is skillfully played, touching and fully formed. From Burt Reynolds as Jack Horner (director) to Julianne Moore (his movie star) and Mark Wahlberg (as Dirk Diggler), they are all gorgeous. And the story? BLIMEY! An honest look at business and setbacks and consequences and family. One of the best movies of all time! I give him >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> A +
