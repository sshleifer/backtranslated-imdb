I liked this movie, but again I'm a big fan of Cronenberg. If you have not seen the David Cronenberg film, this is not the best place to start. Scanners, The Fly, Rabid is a place where you can start and then work up to the Videodrome before checking this one out. This is certainly one of his best options, and he brings interactive gaming phenomena a step ahead. <br /> <br /> In this game, players connect the biotech gaming panel through the connector inserted into the spinal cord and enter the game. right through their nervous system. It is very difficult to tell you more without revealing the plot and plot, but suffice it to say that you will not forget this game. He is full of Kronenberg's slimy bodies, dark landscapes with grim forebodings in which great actors live, including Jennifer Jason Lee, Jude Law and Willem Dafo, who take their situation very seriously. These people will do their best to understand the game and then win it. As in his other films, there is no lack of imagination or detail where you fall into place, but, like a car accident, you do not look away. If you liked any of the movies mentioned above, then by all means go out and get this one.
