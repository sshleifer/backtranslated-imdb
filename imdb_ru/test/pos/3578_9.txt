I did not know what to expect. I watched it only on a rainy Sunday afternoon on pay TV. From the very beginning it attracted me. Music, settings and characters were excellent. I have not heard of any of the actors, but they were all outstanding. Great thriller. <br /> <br /> Now that I’ve read the other comments on this movie regarding previous versions and the book, I’ll try to find out more about this great movie.
