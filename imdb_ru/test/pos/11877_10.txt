I am a big fan of Larkinâ€™s works, I believe that he was among the greatest poets of the 20th century. The film itself does justice to the bard Halla. Miraculously portrayed by all the players in their roles. Bonneville does service to sexually repressed Larkin, he avoids impressions and does not become a caricature. The use of his poetry was the highlight of the work itself. Instead of demonstrating the enormous intensity with which Larkin felt, using his words in itself gives a better understanding of the plot and adds a much darker, but overall more exciting atmosphere. Most pleasant.
