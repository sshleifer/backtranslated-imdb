Almost no information about this film or its broadcast. After a long and thorough search, I found that the DVD will be available for 3.99! - Release February 28, 2006. Try Yahoo / DVD and video. To publish this information, I will continue to assert that this is a well-made film with a true and fascinating story about a mysterious carpenter who is building a very unusual staircase in the church. This is a chance to see William L. Peterson in front of S.CI. turned him into a star. The story also features the venerable Barbara Hershey. Does anyone remember when she was Barbara Hershey Chaika? I have to keep writing to get this message. Thanks to previous commentators for taking the time to recommend this somewhat obscure television film, which obviously leaves an indelible impression on many.
