Oliver Stone gets an apple with this film, which is mainly due to Bogosyanâ€™s electrified presence on the screen and a cool, brilliant script. Every moment it crackles with ever-increasing tension, the culmination of which becomes a truly unforgettable film. If ever there were signs of the writer and the director's ability to combine two extremely changeable temperaments into a single union of creativity, then this is it! The result is a powerful achievement that has become more timely now, perhaps because of the disturbing hobby of our culture for celebrities and distorted interpretations of fame. <br /> <br /> The final accusation of the growing morbidity of our society and sickening hunger for the next big thrill. <br /> <br /> The film is not so easy to forget. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the dark side of human nature.
