H.O.T.S. This is proof that the film industry once said “F-OFF” to censorship and made films with what they wanted! In today's world, this film would be too "excessive" and "extreme" to be anywhere other than a velvet curtain. Although BestBuy had several copies on the counter for $ 5.99 (in case someone wants a copy)! The film was great in its own way, because it mixed humor with a T & A movie loaded by Playmates Playboy! Unlike most movies, he had a plot. This, however, is not quite why you would watch H.O.T.S. <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. This is a student film that reminds me of the films “Revenge of the nerds”, in which he takes a group of “ordinary people” and contrasts them with elite rich experimental subjects that most people hate! The only difference is that the “nerds” in this film shoot much better! I noticed that there are some people who would rate this film low, and for me it is ignorant! Obviously, this is not intended to win an Oscar or break down barriers in a film. If you are looking for this, then see what critics choose for you! You have to appreciate the fact that this film actually had a funny plot, a decent game (mostly with regard to the genre) and a lot of girls who undressed! H.O.T.S. This is one of those films that you watch to get away from modern day problems and daily stresses, and instead laugh and have a good time! If you're looking for a fun student film with enough skin to turn a full-size pink Miata, then you really should try H.O.T.S.!
