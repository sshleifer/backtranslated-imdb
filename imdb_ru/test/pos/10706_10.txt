An amazing documentary on how a small group of idealistic young people used music, art and dance to unite and heal the community of Vigario Geral, one of the most violent slum areas in Rio (“favela” means district in Portuguese), offering it to young people - A positive alternative to the deadly gangster world of drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> In their debut in feature films, Zimbalist and Mochary created a terrific film because it works on many different levels. As a social document, it provides the facts we need to know in order to have a context for understanding the meaning of a particular story told here. The plot itself is well designed, with a strong storyline, and, for extra measure, it is permeated with keen anticipation. There is an exciting, charismatic protagonist, Anderson Sa: he is a quick-witted natural leader, an eloquent, courageous, spiritually developed, talented performer, visionary, who walks with his speech. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of music and dance to entertain. Are there talking heads ?? mainly Sa and his closest ally, José the Younger, - but they are presented with creative cinematic brilliance. Editing perfectly combines frames with different themes, only occasionally interspersed with several fact-filled still texts. The pace is lively as music. In 78 minutes much will be achieved. <br /> <br /> Grupo Afro Reggae, a neighborhood social club that Anderson, Junior, and some others founded in 1993, use music and dance as a weapon to fight drug barons. and two-faced police. They teach percussion to any child who wants to go to class, as well as dancing, martial arts, and the public newspaper. The only requirement for children - do not smoke, do not drink, do not take drugs. In motion, a thin, soft spiritual fabric is moving, based on the Hindu god Shiva, the destroyer of old habits. <br /> <br /> Jeff Zimbalist, who was also a leading cinematographer and editor, is a student of contemporary culture and media at Brown University. He has done his work on editing feature films for PBS and others, and he teaches film in the New York Film Academy and elsewhere. Matt Mochari, like a few years ago, Andrew Dzhareki (“Capture Friedman”), recently came to the cinema from the world of business. <br /> <br /> Zimbalist and Mochari together won the award for the best new filmmakers in 2005. TribBeCa Film Festival and Favela Rising were recognized as the best films of the year in awards awarded for 2005 by the International Documentary Association. I could go to the pages about Afro Reggae, Sa, and this film. The best idea is just for you to see it! My rating: 10/10
