Lieutenant Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners from his wreck ship poured ashore on an island belonging to Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). After several random deaths of prisoners, Rackham takes Claude and his two remaining prisoners. Fortunately for everyone, Barbara Bach also happened to be on the island! Unfortunately, there are some crazy fishermen who love to kill people. <br /> <br /> This Italian exploiter seems to have it all - a touch of CREATURE FROM BLACK LAGOON in combination with DR. MOREAU with a dash of Voodoo WHITE ZOMBIE and things of Atlantis. Despite some unusual looking fisherman costumes, the film really benefits from a beautiful photo from the scene and a pleasant turn in the middle. All the actors are good, and Joseph Cotton even pops up like an old biologist. Directed by Sergio Martino copes with this quite well, because within 10 minutes there is some kind of action. This cannot be said of his belated continuation of "Fishermen and their Queen" (1995), which has become one of the most foolish and most unusual sequels since HIGHLANDER II.
