I just watched this early short film about Harold Lloyd, in which his spectacled character appeared on the Kino Video DVD of the Harold Lloyd Collection. In fact, he is a crook with Snoob Pollard as his partner, who was discovered by Bebe Daniels, who herself performs fake sessions. What she discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard are fooling many customers by discarding “lost” fake rings. I’ll stop here and just say that it was quite funny, especially when Harold and Snab enter the place where Bebe works, face some kind of creepy tricks and put on costumes, such as Snab, trying one of the Bebe suits. Not too much farce, but what was there was also quite funny. So, on this note, I recommend Crookes Unfair?
