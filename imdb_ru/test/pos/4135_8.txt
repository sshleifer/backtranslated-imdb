I first saw The Buddy Holly Story when I was about seven years old. I had no idea who Buddy Holly was, and I can't remember what made me sit in front of the TV, tune in to HBO and watch this exciting biopic. What I remember was that it was a (somewhat) true story about someone who actually lived. I remember music, wonderful songs that I still love (I can't believe that Gary Busey sang his own songs and so well - What a stallion!) Then came the end. He died. He's damn dead. I could not believe it. I had no warnings, no prior knowledge, like most of those who come to this film. He taught me a stern lesson about life and how it does not follow the rules that most films teach us. Tonight I watched the movie again and was engaged again ... and a little saddened. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, but I admit a slight bias.
