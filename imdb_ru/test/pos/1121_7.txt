Another one of the endless number of cutter films "Fight to death for kickboxers for the entertainment of rich scum", which was so much in the 90s ... You know, those that were created by taking the words "Death", "Blood" and " Steel ”and the words“ Ring ”,“ Fight ”,“ Match ”and“ Cage ”and putting them in a random number generator! However, “Death Match” is a pretty good record in the “surplus” genre, thanks to the exciting battle scenes and surprisingly good action of the kickboxer actors. <br /> <br /> The story concerns two buddies - former kickboxing world champion John Larson (played by kicker boxing champion Ian Dzheklin, probably previously known for his terrible performance as the main villain in Ring of Fire 2) and Nick Wallace (Nick Hill, the cute guy, probably known for the role of street fighter Sergio in Bloodsport 2), who works on the docks in Los Angeles loading boxes onto ships. One opening of the weapon box and a short fight later, our two heroes are unemployed and support the bar L.A. Reasonable John Larson decides to go north and look for work; stubborn Nick Wallace heard about a guy paying good money for fighters to fight in private kickboxing matches. "Why should everything change?" says John: "If you need me, I'll be there." Predictably enough, but soon Nick went missing, and his good friend fights in the deadly "death ring", trying to find a way to his missing friend. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are no prizes for originality, but, as I said, the strength of this film lies in its action, in its role as real fighters and in the pretty good performances that it manages to get from them. Ian Jacklin especially surprised me. I used to see him as a bad guy in Ring of Fire 2 and in bit parts, such as The Steel Ring, and I was always amazed at how bad actor he was (albeit a good fighter!). But in Death Match, it's pretty good! A decent script and haircut, he proves that he is quite a charismatic presenter! And his friendship with Nick is very well depicted. Jacklin and Hill have good chemistry, and you really believe that these two characters care about each other. It is enough that one of them lost his job, went halfway across the country and risked dying to save the other - I wish I had such a friend! <br /> <br /> It was also nice to see Mathias Hughes as a villainous henchman with a little more depth than we used to see from his many roles as a "villainous henchman." However, don't be fooled into thinking that he is a star just because he is on the cover of the video (it seems his head is stuck on the body of Michael Bernardo from the cover of the Shootfighter) - he is good while he is on the screen, but he is not too much < br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is rather slow when there is no fight, with a lot of unnecessary scenes (what about the senseless gangster story Jimmy Fiorello about his grandfather ??), and the final fight is disappointingly short, but overall I enjoyed by this! Many fights, most of them are good. Isn't that all we need in martial arts? And, of course, the sweet tooth here, in beautiful form, is very sweet Rene Ammann. In general, quite an interesting kickboxing movie.
