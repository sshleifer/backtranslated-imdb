“Nazarin” by Louis Bunuel will always be remembered as a great film, because he is absolutely honest in presenting a comic insult to religion. This is one of those outstanding films that should be shown to all people, especially young children, in order to acquaint them with the concepts of good and evil, sacred and evil. The most difficult question posed by Nazarin concerns the strengths and weaknesses of organized religion. He was resolved by involving numerous ordinary people who are no greater than minor matters in their worldly life, especially sins. Buñuel appreciates, showing us that the various questions related to class differences deserve frank, honest and reliable answers. Nazarin looks trustworthy because it was made in a light, ridiculous way. This is the only reason why it can be said that the story of an ordinary priest seems absolutely true to all viewers. It's amazing how Bunuel approaches to finding the truth. the question of love in his film. This black and white gem was wonderfully filmed by Gabriel Figueroa, one of Luis Bunuel’s favorite cameramen.
