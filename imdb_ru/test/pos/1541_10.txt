Wardrobe Earth. The name itself conjures up thoughts of secrets. And this is really what is at the core of this international film, Amnesty International. Government secrets, personal secrets, are integral parts of this story. <br /> <br /> Of course, the greatest actors seen in too long, both Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe, were phenomenal in their portrayal of the government investigator and Victim, respectively. With two actors in this unusual film of standard length, it immediately becomes clear that both actors were loyal and talented enough to draw the viewer into this tiny bubble of the world and close the door. <br /> <br /> WORD ATTENTION ... <br /> <br /> The description of this film does not mention the fact that it has a story about childhood sexual abuse. Although there are no graphic details of the abuse, some viewers may have difficulty watching it, especially considering the intensity of the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Amnesty. International films, but this film attracted me because the acting was so exceptional, and I can't help but make this film one of my favorites.
