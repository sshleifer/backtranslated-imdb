Very quirky screening of William Shakespeareâ€™s tragic love story. <br /> <br /> The Qu family and the Capulets family hate each other for a long time, which often leads to violence. Hatred has to do with the film company and the fact that everyone is pretty crazy. At the center of all this insanity are Thromeo and Juliet, the most famous literature lovers with stars who fall in love at first sight, and problems arise when they understand whose family the other belongs to. The film follows the main plot of the original play very well, and in key scenes even original or close to original scenes are used. But Trom's notorious quirkiness permeates the entire film from start to finish. This makes the film not for every taste, but, nevertheless, rather resourceful. Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) has a particularly funny death scene. 7/10 <br /> <br /> There are many versions and versions with various edits. Each contains violence, profanity, drug use and sex, all with a great deal of oddity.
