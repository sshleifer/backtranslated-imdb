Yes, this is not a great cinematic achievement, but Toy Soldiers is a fun and exciting movie. The young cast does an excellent job with both the dramatic and comedic aspects of the story, and I especially liked Sean Phelan in the role of Derek / Yogurt I have seen this many times over the years, and probably will see it several more times. Just do not think too much, and you will like it - enjoy!
