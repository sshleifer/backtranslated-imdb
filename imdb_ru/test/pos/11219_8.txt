NORTHFORK is first and foremost a masterpiece of widescreen cinema. By itself, this film is worth the time spent. The harsh, wide open plains and barren lands of eastern Montana are captured in the calm, muted earth tones of autumn or early spring. The giant gray cement Fort Peck Dam is the main character of the film. The film comments on how delicately and not very subtly about a dozen issues of Western Landscape. At times, dialogues may try, but the images and concepts are strong enough to make a film. The 1950s here work so well and so well. I think that the past years will be kind to this film.
