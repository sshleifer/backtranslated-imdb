I expected this movie to be ugly, but I wanted to see it myself, but I was surprised at how good this movie was. I know that longer films often do not sell very well at the box office, but I donâ€™t understand why it was filmed and not allowed to the general public. This kept my interest everywhere, and the scenery and photography were sometimes breathtaking. The plot was good, and the game of morality was good. I liked the realism that was in the spirit of the "Unforgiven." I had to rent this movie to watch, but it was worth it.
