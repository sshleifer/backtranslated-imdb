How many reviews about this movie do I need to write before I get it right? Tom Conway completely inherits the Falcon mantle from his real brother George Sanders with this record. Conway, dressed in beautiful double-breasted single-button costumes in drapery style, and a cruise in luxurious 110% steel cars with huge skirts of wings and suicide doors that fit your armpit. Formula for industrial diamonds from falling into the wrong hands. His “client” is a sweet, virgin Louise Briganza, who has gorgeous hair, but she will allow you to kiss her only for the first two months. Along the way, he encounters a type of colorful array of characters that only B could provide. He bumps into a sinister plate of Doris Blanding, a type of 40's chick that you know is releasing. Her cohort is Benny, played by Steve Brodie, who twenty years later was Presley's punching bag in two films The First King. They both work for Kenneth Sutton, dressed in cold fish and wearing a cap, and are ready to do everything possible to get the formula, going on his yacht to Brazil. This entry still reigns supreme. Forget these 120-minute melodramas, give me a 1-hour film "Falcon" on any given day. I have a wife and two children - who has time for a two-hour movie? Shake some dry martinis and forget about your problems with this wonderful film Falcon. But if you didn't record it from local television in Toronto, as I did 17 years ago, you're out of luck.
