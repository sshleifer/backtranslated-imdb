Most families recognize the similarities between their own family and those created by the brilliant play of Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. Natalie creates an image on the screen that justifies her as one of the best actresses in America and worthy of a nomination for the Golden Globe. The control over her emotions is so tactful that at any moment of the film she can use them and release an unforgettable scene. Susan is also amazing in this film, as she again chose a role that is different from any other and carries her with true professionalism. <br /> <br /> Any Natalie fan would have watched the film on her past successes, but you should also see this for the emotions that were released during the film. This is really a humiliating experience.
