Horus hounds, be careful ... this is not your movie. This little bitter nail has very little blood and guts. This is basically the Open Water version, which is effective and worth it. But what distinguishes it is the fact that we actually like the three leashes (as opposed to “open water”), which end up on the tree when the crocodile turns over its fishing boat and chews the guidebook. We do not want any of them to suffer. SO when they start getting into dangerous situations ... we really don't care. <br /> <br /> Now I like movies with killer animals, but I'm not too impressed with Lake Placid before Primeval (although I'm still looking forward to seeing Rogue and I hope that he is somewhere as good as this one! ) but this little scumbag did the work and did the job well. It is creatively scary, and it only runs into the mill's run, crying fiercely, sobbing and arguing about short pieces of realism, so I was never annoyed. <br /> <br /> I remember reading a true story that inspired this when three guys went fishing and two were on a tree and their friend was killed by a crocodile. But the thing that always influenced me, which was excluded from the film, is that the crocodile did not eat a friend. Not. For hours, he swam around a tree and shook a dead body, still in his mouth with friends in a tree. It seems to remain if you come here, that's what will happen to you.
