GRANNI IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER GENNI is the best movie I've ever seen. The plot was not similar to what they had ever seen or done before these people were truly endowed with talent. No kidding, I love this movie. I need to buy it, but I can not find it anywhere. I dream to go and meet the actors, try Grandma 2.i shot a video from GRANNY on Broadway and left it for a week longer than it should, and asked them if I could buy it from them, they said no big disappointment and even greater disappointment A week after I returned it, I wanted to go and rent it again, but came to find out that the Broadway video was over. If anyone has a movie or he knows where I can buy it, please tell me at iloverot@aol.com
