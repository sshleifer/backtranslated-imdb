I saw the 2-hour version of Choker Bali. I can not say that it is long. The film has a certain natural pace and seems to lag behind at any time. The costume and the scenery are reminiscent of what we saw in old movies. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai did a good job. This is a truly mature role with enough opportunities for action within the story. The script also maintains history very well. Aishwarys acts as an unhappy widow whose husband dies in the first year of marriage. The film tells about the passions and desires of such a character, as well as about the conflict she faces at a time when widows were depressed. <br /> <br /> Rima Sen played her best friend in this movie. -handled. Her innocence and her admiration for Aishwarya’s ability to speak English and act in an educated manner was done very well. These are indeed some of the prevailing attitudes of the time. We see how far we have come from such an era! <br /> <br /> The film tells about the liberation of women as a fine line of history. I have found a development of the story very similar to “Ghar Bahir”, also written by Tagore. This makes some actions in the struggle for independence and opposes the struggle for the independence of India against the quiet struggle for the rights of women. <br /> <br /> A well-made film is definitely worth seeing. Acting Aishwarya: excellence. Rituparna treated the story with great caution. Another classic from Rabindranath Tagore.
