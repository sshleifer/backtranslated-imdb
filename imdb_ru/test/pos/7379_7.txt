It was an interesting study of social sexuality, as well as the "dark interests" of men. <br /> <br /> Although I cannot say that the wife was a strong character - she was the wrong choice from the side, in my opinion - she was a rich child in search of salvation from her drool. In fact, she was a rebel and never matured for her husband, a lawyer (Rickman). Obviously, he married her for the sake of her money and to cover his sexual desires, which is taboo. Rickman played his part in a T-shirt, flirting with a young man and very subtle shades of gaiety. The young man was gay to the hilt! When he did Marilyn's imitation, it should have told his wife everything. He was also very well played. He has a hustler through. <br /> <br /> I was not delighted with the ending, because I knew what would happen next. Overall, though, the game from Rickman was great, Reedus was good, Walker was fine, but I had concerns. For a gay-themed movie, it was average, but at least not blatant. It's worth seeing if you don't have a “Truly Madly Deeply” lying around for rotation.
