When "The Thing" went into theaters everywhere in 1982, she had a cold reception and very poor box office results, which were almost a failure in John Carpenter’s career as a horror director; However, time proved that “The Thing” was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing business results were not a mistake of the film. Currently, “The Thing” by John Carpenter received an assessment that he rightly deserves, and many horror fans view it as a classic of horror, and for good reason, this new version of John W. Campbell’s “Who Goes? "(previously adapted as" Things from another world ") is closer to the original story and retains a pessimistic sense of fear and large doses of uncertainty in a masterfully prepared study on paranoia. <br /> <br /> The plot" The Thing "begins in the winter of 1982 with a research station located in remote areas of Antarctica, when crew members notice a Norwegian helicopter arrive on their way. Two obviously insane helicopter pilots are trying to kill the Husky dog, which makes its way to the American base. As Norwegians are killed by chance, Americans are trying to figure out what made them be insane. Soon they will discover that the Husky dog ​​that the Norwegians were hunting for was not a normal dog, but a creature capable of imitating every living thing, and not only that, but huge hunger. <br /> <br /> Director John Carpenter earned his place in history when, in 1978, he shot a peculiar slasher “Halloween”, where tension and atmosphere were above blood and upheaval. “The Thing” can be seen as an evolution of this style, because even when Carpenter makes extensive use of Rob Bottin’s special effects (which at one time were marked by critics as алки repulsive ’), the film still focuses more on atmosphere and tension. and not in the violent (and very well done) manifestations of blood. The feeling of loneliness, as well as the “bad karma” between the crew members, reinforce the feeling of paranoia, because everyone can become a Thing, even our main character, RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell), ending in a situation where no one can be trusted. <br /> <br /> This plot element was more accurate in relation to the concept of the original novel and was clearly ignored by the previous version (not a bad thing, just a big difference), which gave this version a feeling less like a remake and more like a new concept of the original the novel. Bill Lancaster's screenplay treats characters with a brilliant area, giving us enough to distinguish them, but not too much to fully trust them, making them a significant factor in the horrific fearfulness of the film that continues to run through the entire film. Mystery and suspense on the limit, one can never say who is the Thing and who is normal, increasing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results. <br /> <br /> The cast is very effective, and their actions as a whole are so effective that you can feel bad feelings between their characters as real ones. Carpenter’s permanent collaborator Kurt Russell in the role of McRedy carries the film, and with his eyes we witness the madness and horror that the research station experiences as the situation worsens. Definitely one of his best performances. Wilford Brimley is also terrific, like Dr. Blair, a scientist who goes crazy after revealing the goals of Things. <br /> <br /> “The Thing” is a film so wonderfully created that its flaws, as a rule, go unnoticed, although they exist. The most notorious is Ennio Morricone. This is not really bad, but in some scenes it is simply inappropriate, and this is not one of the best works of the legendary composer. In addition, due to some mistakes with special effects, some scenes were excluded that actually fill small holes in the plot, although there is nothing special or annoying about it. <br /> <br /> Speaking of John Carpenter’s films, most people would almost immediately call “Halloween” their favorite movie, but personally I would choose “The Thing” because I think this is Carpenter’s greatest achievement at the moment, and one of the most interesting and really scary horror movies ever created. I would say that this is one of the best films ever made. 10/10
