Note. Most likely, it should be read only after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> It is very rare to find a documentary or a film about a loser. Deep Water does just that, making it one of the most provocative films in a long time. This does not give us a hero to look at, but rather an antihero who makes us look inward. <br /> <br /> The film is about a group of people who are trying to swim around the world. Alone and without stopping. Only one does this, several dies, one decides not to return home, each of them on a psychological journey, intriguing enough to deserve entire films for himself. And yet the most interesting thing is Donald Crowhurst, more precisely, the way the directors portray him, and our reaction to him as a spectator. <br /> <br /> By any measure, this person should be considered a disgusting character, but why did he so heroically portray? Why do we like him so much? From the very beginning he made all the wrong choices. He risked his family financially in order to get a boat, he left at a more dangerous time, to get more advertising, he ignored all warnings, despite his lack of experience, he preferred to lie, instead of admitting defeat, these elections were a snowball before the inevitable and the last: suicide. All for what? Place in history? Sense of accomplishment? May be. It is important to consider whether this human situation was inevitable. <br /> <br /> Each person should ask himself whether his natural human craving for fame and achievements leads to such recklessness, and I believe that an analysis of your own reaction to Crowhurstâ€™s history will offer at least some answer to this question.
