A good story, well played with unexpected turns of character, for example. Angry gangster killer Brian Brown teaches his son macrame. Despite the fact that it succeeds as a fighter, where you hope that a good guy (Ledger) and his boyfriend succeed, he also has a cheerful ironic black humor, such as bank robbers who become "winners" of the radio competition musician, etc. Worth seeing.
