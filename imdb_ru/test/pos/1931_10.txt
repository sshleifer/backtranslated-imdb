Deep Water explores the pressure and ambitions of an ordinary person in a compelling documentary. Testimony and archive recordings are a fascinating insight into the late 1960s and an innovative world-round yacht race. Personal conflicts of duty to family, self, and reputation are played in one of the most memorable and touching films I've ever seen. I was not familiar with the history of this story, and the drama was successfully and clearly set. The story is mostly respectful to participants with heroes and villains, and not ruthlessly exposed. Most of the interpretation remains open to the viewer, which makes it possible to relate personally to situations and characters. This film is a bittersweet experience with an interesting mix of thoughtful anticipation, joy and drama.
