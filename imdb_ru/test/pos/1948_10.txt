This film is so 1980s, and this is what I like so much in it. He copes with the transfer of sensations of this strange decade. The reality is that Russian nuclear weapons can destroy you at any time. Reagan at the White House told everyone that everything was wonderful, while more and more social programs were declining. Young people dropped out of school, but not in the same way as their parents of the 1960s. The young people still went to school, they just smoked so much dope that their feelings were almost dead. Nothing affected them, not even the death of one of their classmates at the hands of one of their friends. How strange it is to realize that the murder was wrong, but you do not know why. Seeing how the characters deal with the crime is fascinating and tells about a very sick society. Glover is great, Keanu is great, Hopper is incredible. One of the most memorable films I've ever seen.
