The fact that reviewers are extremely negative about the show is in itself an interesting fact. If you don’t like it, don’t watch it. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers claim that you have to be stupid, stupid, or just plain old primitives to enjoy this show. Ay, on the contrary, my friends. I do not claim that all participants are smart. There are smart, and there are stupid. But I would say that they probably have an average IQ higher than the average reviewer on this site. That's right, I said it. Much can be said about the science of seducing girls. Sorry, but please take all the sticks out of your ass and see why you hate these guys to threaten you. <br /> <br /> Those who do not pay attention to the social sciences and, in particular, to the science behind them. Mating will obviously miss the boat completely. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear: clubs are not the only places where you can meet girls. I personally think that worthy women do not even go to clubs, so they will not become victims of men like those we see on the show. But what kind of men are they? In addition to those whose games stink, they are the embodiment of men. These are men who meet women in the most difficult situations. These are men who take responsibility for their own sexuality. These men do not ask their friends not to part with them, and these men do not say "well" to the phrase "let's just make friends." <br /> <br /> Sounds familiar ???? Actually, these are the guys you are afraid of when you take your special long-term girlfriend to the club. We are all like that. These guys know what women like. (again, only those who have a “game”) <br /> <br /> And even those who are bad ... they are worth it! <br /> <br /> If you went to the club and talked to others, then this show should seem interesting to you. <br /> <br /> Listen, I'm at a loss as to why there is so much hatred for this show. My guess is that it exacerbates insecurity in men who feel bad in clubs, or threatens men who consider women as beautiful, unrelated creatures who just want a good guy to attract them. <br /> <br /> I personally love this show. It is pure entertainment and, most importantly, its PRESENT. This is a very insightful look at the latest state of sexual psychology. Sex roles have never been different from the previous ones, and this show gives a very real idea of ​​it. <br /> <br /> I think that in order to remove something positive from this show, you need some kind of intelligence. <br /> <br /> This show appeals to a specific target market, and if you are outside of it, then I think you should not tune in to the show. We could say this about any other shows, right? <br /> <br /> Grow Up <br /> <br /> ApolloHelios
