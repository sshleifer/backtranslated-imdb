Any film that offers Bonnie Hunt, Sarah Silverman and Amy Sedaris in the cast is worth watching, and comic actor Jeff Garlin uses the terrific talent he received for his directorial debut in 2007, a comedy about a sad bag with excess weighing A person who feels out of step with the outside world. Known as manager Larry David Jeff in "Curbing Your Enthusiasm," Garlin plays James, a 39-year-old Chicago actor who still fights, who still lives with his widowed mother. His self-esteem is so low that he cannot meet with women, but this is a comical way in which he views his only status, which puts his dilemma. If the storyline sounds a little familiar, it’s because the film is partly a tribute to Ernest Borgnine’s classic 1955 “Marty” about the lonely Bronx butcher who lives with his annoying mother. In fact, Garlin uses "Marty" as a play, which James desperately wants to play, since he is very sensitive to the character's situation. <br /> <br /> Naturally, the new version of the millennium has a kind of love story, and Silverman plays Beth, a sexually insatiable ice-cream server that plays with him in an underwear shopping store. Their best scene together is in his favorite store, where they improvise different characters in different aisles. Hunt plays a lonely elementary school teacher who shares a passion with James for jazz musician Ben Webster. They meet by chance in a music store, and then again on a career day at her school, where he cheerfully reveals his sexual neuroses in front of a first-graders class, including his best friend's cheeky daughter Luke Penelope (played by Dakota's twin, Ella's sister). In a boarded up cameo, similar to Jerry Blanca, Cedaris plays a school counselor who speaks to James after his inappropriate monologue. David Pasquezi plays Luke, a nursing home manager, and his scenes with Garlin are easy to install, making it easy to believe in their friendship. The film is almost stolen by character actress Mina Kolb, who plays James's pigmented mother with a separation and heart. <br /> <br /> There are also unexpected cameos from idol teenagers Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon (do not ask ??, but the installation is ridiculous), as well as the sharply played bits by director Paul Mazursky (as an angry director of the series with a frank camera, " Smear Job "), Tim Kazurinsky (as the unsuspecting victim of this show) and Dan Castellaneta (as the owner of a convenience store). With his sad bouts of insecurity and self-loathing, Garlin’s comic feelings are reminiscent of Albert Brooks’s feelings, and an easy-going dialogue at its best reminds me of A Contemporary Romance and Protecting My Life. One persistent problem I encountered in the film is the storyboard, as some scenes stretch longer than necessary. The problem becomes more apparent in the first half, when Garlin is trying to set the right pace, and the lack of real conflict increases the sluggishness. Regardless of what he does well, it captures the gnawing sense of despair that one experiences in revelation that life is not what it should be, that the significant other can be inaccessible, and that a stable diet of unhealthy food eaten by A car hood is the only reliable thing when it comes to satisfaction.
