The trailer does not go very close and only scratches the surface of the film, and rightly so, not because he is obliged to keep his real story secret, but because what actually happens will cause completely different lines of interrogation, some of which are disappointed. did not answer in the film, leaving you alone to interpret a series of events. Which, of course, means a lot of discussion material after the show. <br /> <br /> Metaphorically, an insert indicates how we humans tend to subconsciously penetrate situations or things in everyday life, and how our insular thoughts tend to see things from a certain point of view, rarely out of the box. At the end of the speech, one of the characters is said that makes you think about this fact, which governs the basis of the entire film, and even permeates existentialism, where our bodies are just vessels for the soul, and from the cradle to the grave, into which we place ourselves in new boxes. in lifestyle. <br /> <br /> What I didn’t like about the film was how it tried to sound reasonable because of the frequent change of the name of hidden government agencies like the CIA and the NSA, as if there was something clearly hidden in these agencies we should be aware of. They serve only a small purpose, in addition to subjecting every action and every person to a thorough study, so that no one can be trusted, destroying in some sense both the characters and the audience, as we try to keep up with questions of trust to help interpret the narrative . Its installation in 1976 against the backdrop of NASA's manned space missions and in Langley, Va., Also provided an increased sense of alertness that will raise your energy while you are patiently sitting in it. <br /> <br /> Based on the story “Button,” “Button,” written by Richard Matheson and turned into an episode of “The Twilight Zone,” tells the story of the Lewis family, where husband Arthur (James Marsden) works at NASA and develops a prosthetic foot for his wife-teacher Norma (Cameron Diaz). ), and you might think that this is all a happy family with their son Walter (Sam Oz Stone) until one day a mysterious man named Arlington Steward (Frank Langella in the face effect, inspired by two faces) appears, which we supplanted in the debut. , knocks and gives them the "Deal" or "No Deal" button in the box. Press the button and they will get a million dollars (here we are talking about dollars of the 70s), although a stranger will die there. If they do not, the transaction expires. <br /> <br /> The story will dictate that the deal will be concluded, which will of course lead to a mysterious sequence of events that unfold, with even more dubious characters (who are bleeding) appear, some of which inexplicably look like zombies, obviously, all influenced by either employment or arlington steward. Regardless of whether the Steward is Death, a secret government employee, a messenger of God, or a representative of the Aliens after an anal examination, remains unanswered, so that no matter how you look at it, it seems like it delivers something expected, just begging humanity to shake off from himself an innate greed so that his work can be interrupted and return to where he came from. <br /> <br /> If you need to distract a little from the scattered scenes that make up the narrative, the production and artistic direction superbly recreates the look of the 70s when you are trying to solve the mystery of the consequences that flow from an incomplete understanding of the small print. This is a full range of studies of human nature, our greed for immediate satisfaction, manifested in long-term pain, confusion and further choices that we will make based on real victims. Exquisite special effects also come into play, although this simply leaves more room for the film genre. <br /> <br /> So is it a horror, science fiction or mystical thriller? This is actually all in one, along with a philosophical splash. Just do not wait for a direct narrative film with clean and easy answers at the end ?? this is similar to the X-Files episode about steroids.
