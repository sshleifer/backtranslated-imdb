Why does everyone feel they have to constantly shoot this film? This is cute and funny (this is how it should be). In any case, Madonna was not going to show herself an artist Oscar Calliber with this film! She just did what the character demanded and did it well. I loved her in this film; This is my second favorite Madonna movie after Evita. The soundtrack is great too. It is no better or worse than any silly 80s movie. For all critics, just do not take it seriously, and you can have fun watching it. Madonna Goddess !!!
