I like this film, although I don’t like the way they portray the Egyptians, who are themselves Egyptian citizens! that is why he earns eight out of 10. The relationships between Augustine and the leopard are awkward, and, of course, because of the loneliness and long life in this cave, he develops some kind of madness and passion for this leopard. <br /> <br /> A very touching scene when a leopard dies, look at the reaction of Augustine. <br /> <br /> Overall, I find it enjoyable, and I look forward to reading Balzac’s tale.
