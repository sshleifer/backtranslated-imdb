I remember watching this movie when I was very young and have watched TV several times since then. I always liked it. I noticed in a print broadcast on local television that one scene turned the film around. This is where they hide behind a rock (similar to the Vazquez rocks near Los Angeles) while watching the passage of the Indians. If you look closely, you will notice that suddenly all the soldiers become left-handed! This is only a short stretch, and I must admit that it took me years to notice it. <br /> <br /> With regard to history, expeditions were often carried out to rescue white captives from Indians. The direct link for the final battle scene is the battle on Beecher Island. During this action, a group of reconnaissance volunteers equipped with repetitive carbines (Spencer carbines, not hard drives) were surprised by the Indians and retreated to the island and delayed several attacks. In the latest accusation, they killed Roman Nose, one of the most famous Indian leaders. I have no idea if the author of the script meant this, but he is quite suitable. <br /> <br /> There are several Guy Madison films that I hope will someday be released on DVD, and this is one of them.
