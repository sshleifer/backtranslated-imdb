I think this is the first film that made me realize the term "cult film". This is an absolutely bad movie, but I can't do anything, I like this movie. Richard Boone is better, like Joan Van Ark, but if you don’t go to bed late and watch movies that don’t make you think a lot, then this one is for you.
