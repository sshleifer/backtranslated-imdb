I know that you say: “Oh, man, Pinocchio is not scary!” But this film goes beyond much more than a manic pinocchio. Behind, he tells the story of a mother and her daughter, who is strangely tied to her doll Pinnochio, who seems to be talking to her. The only oddity is that no one except her can hear the doll. In the end, it's a shocking revelation that, like me, shocks you. Watch it Try.
