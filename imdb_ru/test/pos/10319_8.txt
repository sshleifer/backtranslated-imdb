For the record, I'm a fan of curly through and through. But I must say that in fact, Shemp is not so bad. Yes, perhaps he lacked the same kind of farce that Curley had, but in his own way he was cheerful. At least he wasn't as bad as Joe Besser. <br /> <br /> In “HOMELESS MAN” Shemp plays music professors (Stooge? A Professor? and Moe and Larry must prepare him to marry a woman by six o'clock in the evening or without money. <br /> <br /> It was one of the first scenes of Stozhay with Shemp before they began to process the material.It is not surprising that Schempe was part of the Stooges before Curly appeared in the photo, so it seemed natural in that. a scene with Mo and Shemp in a phone booth. Essential Stooge is short, to be honest.
