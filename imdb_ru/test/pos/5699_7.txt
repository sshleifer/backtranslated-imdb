This study of a unique decade in American cinema begins with the fall of one diseased empire, which is out of contact, and ends with the unstoppable rise of the other, equally related to the shoots and box office. Meet the new boss, just like the old boss. Or, as Peter Fonda noted in Easy Rider: “We blew it up.” Between them, from Bonnie and Clyde to Star Wars, young Turks (some under Roger Corman’s partisan tutelage) were crawling under the wires, creating some of the greatest works of art of the 20th century.
