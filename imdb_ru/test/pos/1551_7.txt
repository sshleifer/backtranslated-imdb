After a short broadcast, Colombo returned with some new puzzles created for television, which, although not as good as in the original series, are better than the shows that were made in the later 90s. <br /> <br /> “Murder can be dangerous to your health” then used (and I think now, if you think about it) a true crime that shows the situation of murder. The murder was committed by a very successful, selfish host of a true crime show, George Hamilton (in good mix). His smoking nemesis, who lost his job, he, Peter Haskell plays, tries to blackmail Hamilton when he discovers Hamilton made with a minor actress in his salad days. Hamilton uses Haskell cigarettes to deliver a fatal blow through poison, and also gives him an alibi. <br /> <br /> Colombo is invited to find out what happened. You know the rest. Very interesting.
