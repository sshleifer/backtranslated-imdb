I love this film. <br /> <br /> Yes, the protagonist is lying, but that is why he is called the "big fat liar." Despite the fact that this child is running away to Hollywood, it does not give children the idea that they can. In addition, he does it not just for fun or to get away from something, he does it to restore confidence. <br /> <br /> I don’t think it was just one big advertisement for Universal Studios, because I liked how she talked from inside about what it looked like for kids who don’t know how cool the movie . <br /> <br /> He has good music and funny characters. This family / comedy is absolutely fun for both children and parents. It has humor, excitement and real life difficulties, such as lies. <br /> <br /> In the end, “Big Fat Liar” expresses moral: don’t expect a lie to be easy.
