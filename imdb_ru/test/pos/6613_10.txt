This film excited me at 39, just like all the shots and stories about Dogtown that influenced me when I was 13 years old. For all those who criticized the self-promotion of the Z-boys interviewed, they have the last laugh over you. It was their common deal: “We are better than all of you, and this is why .... (insert footage from the smoothest pool you can imagine)” It was a film to tell their story, and it was their story, whether to you or not. It was their opinion of their skating that mattered ..... not yours or mine. I thought that the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as I remembered it in the 70s. The reality is that they REALLY made a revolution in skateboard, were an incentive for extreme sports, and they REALLY introduced a cultural paradigm that has penetrated every corner of America. This film gave a rebirth to the images of Burtleman on the wave, and Alva and Jay Adams tear up the decision, which was the California Dream, the whole culture of young American teens who just wanted to have fun and get joy! When I watched this film, I realized that it was with these images that I lived every day, until I was old enough to move and return to So Kal after my family moved to Nor Kal when I was five years old. Until I could return, my friends and I built and beat the ramp behind the ramp, looked for all possible empty pools and imitated everything that Stechik was talking about these guys. We are all educated, we have a family and a career, but this film reminds me of who I was at this age and why I am still surfing. This is an inspirational film that will appeal to anyone interested in pop culture, extreme sports, 70s, or even just a good documentary film. Whenever this happens via cable, I cannot change the channel. Kudos to Stacy Peralte for creating a beautiful work of art!
