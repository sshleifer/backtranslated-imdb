This small picture failed where a lot of the big picture failed. Since it was a small picture, John Ford was not bothered by the big studio wigs. He was happier with this film than with any other, because he could do it in his own way. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted characters who played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them, such as Ben Johnson, were discovered by Ford and got the opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was a real Oklahoma cowboy who usually performed his own stunts. Over the years, he will receive the coveted Academy Award for his brilliant performance in The Last Picture Show. Ward Bond even outshines Ben Johnson in this film. He is not a master of carts, this role is played by Johnson, but because of this film he was later given the role of master of carriages in the classic television series Car-Train. Ironically, one of the bad guys in “The Master of Carriages”, James Arness, will star in the popular television series “Gunsmoke” in the network of competitors “Wagon Train”. Ward Bond plays a Mormon leader heading west, who often retreats to his sinful days, cursing only the fact that he was called by another Mormon Adam Perkins (Russell Simpson). When an unpleasant situation arises, Elder Wiggs (Ward Bond) shouts, “Hit the horn, sister Ledyard!” Mormon's sister, perfected by Jane Darwell, then blows so loudly and loudly that even the devil must have been shocked by this sound. Darwell and Simpson were known for playing Ma and Pa Joad in Ford’s classic version of John Grainbeck’s novel The Grapes of Wrath. <br /> <br /> Another prominent actor in Ford’s company was Hank Warden, who plays One of Uncle Shyla Clegg, as you know, sneaky, but not too light outlawed sons. In a few years, Warden will become famous thanks to Moses' game in Ford's Quest. Warden lived to 91 years. He still made films after death. <br /> <br /> Trailer Blue trailer master (Ben Johnson) and his partner Sandy (Harry Carey, Jr.) are horse traders who never take their jobs seriously, very fun along the way, especially with the local sheriff. They are confused with the Mormon train heading west. Ford's Favorite Monuments Valley is the setting for most of the film. The main reason for the unification is red-haired Mormon beauty Prudence Perkins (Kathleen O'Malley), who catches Sandy's gaze. On the way, the train brings up a show of the hellish hooligan, which includes Dr. Charlatan (Alan Mowbray) and two polluted angels (Joann Drew and Ruth Clifford). Also on the way is the Clegg family, who is wanted for murder and armed robbery. Ford shows how difficult it was to travel in the west in those days. <br /> <br /> The songs in the film are written by Stan Jones from the legendary Sons of the Pioneers. Jones's writing was almost as good as Bob Nolan, who previously wrote a lot for the band. Jones' most famous song, not included in this film, is the much recorded Ghost Riders In The Sky. The sons of the pioneers perform the background in the Master Cars. This adds to the overall impact of cars rolling to the west. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that the famous Native American leader Jim Thorpe from Oklahoma plays the role of a Navajo leader. This was his last movie appearance. He died shortly after the "Wagon Master" was released.
