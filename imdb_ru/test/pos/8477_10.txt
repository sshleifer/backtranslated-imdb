Brilliant biographical film ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Well, this is definitely one of my favorites. Biographical film. This film was a complete surprise to me. I avoided this film for a very long time. This is because I am not a fan of Jamie Foxx. I'm still not a big fan of his, but I'm sure now he is a fan. <br /> <br /> Well, he deserved every bit of this Oscar. His performance is one of the BEST speeches that I have seen in a long time. He is really sensational! <br /> <br /> Well, the narrative or “Stream of Story” is great for a biopic. I'm a DRAMA fan, so I was not bored at all. <br /> <br /> I was too surprised that I liked the film so much that I did not see any flaws in it. I think there are no flaws in the film. Maybe some errors in some events. But who cares? <br /> <br /> The performance of the woman who plays Ray's Mother was also really GOOD. And what Kerry Washington ?? she has so much potential ... if you give her the right role, she may just be the winner of an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Well, the film “Their Story” was so emotional, so touching ... Did I cry? I was crying very bad ???? <br /> <br /> I don't give a damn if everything was crazy or not, because this film is insane, am I crying ?? And this is a lot for me! <br /> <br /> In general, SUPERB FILM ????. One of the best in this century! <br /> <br /> 10/10
