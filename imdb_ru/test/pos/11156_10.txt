The most typical housewife and beautiful mother, Donna Reed (like Donna Stone), can do it all. Fight in quarrels between children or neighbors, take care of her hard-working pediatrician smoking pipe and you will still have a stack of pancakes, three types of breakfast meat, and a tall glass of milk and OJ ready for children every morning before breakfast. <br /> <br /> Over the past fifty years, we have overlooked the idealistic mother sitting at home, family dinners together at the kitchen table and preparing dinner for a heavy dinner. a working husband when he comes home from work. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the show was not available on DVD - I would have stopped my telegram altogether!
