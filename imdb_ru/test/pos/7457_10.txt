Duckman is a show that went on for the last hour or so before it was time to sleep about ten years ago. It was the opposite of many of the children's animations I was watching at the time; I was still a little addict for Disney and Looney Tunes, and most Saturday morning cartoons were still at their peak since Ninja Turtles and Batman. But around this time I began to realize that the rougher, more mature, surreal, obscene and (although I did not know the term at that time) satirical cartoons were more creative than the ones I used to. In the days of Beavis and Butt-head, Rena and Stimpy, and even The Maxx showed televisions via MTV, the United States released two shows - one was Weird Science and the other was Duckman. I always remembered a few key points from the show, and some lines are very valuable for those who have not completely forgotten it. Fortunately, I recently found a tape with six episodes that I had long recorded on tape, and the jokes were very fresh. And the delivery of jokes - rate of fire most of the time in the best episodes. <br /> <br /> In the audio section, talent selection is paramount for storylines, which usually serve as an excuse for rude, exciting parodies of pop culture, politics, movies and television shows, music, mystery puzzles, and a dysfunctional family unit. Jason Alexander is a great choice for Duckman, and his performance is a comedy film from the 180s since his days in Seinfeld (even if there may be some similar characteristics here and there). In addition, the voices of Gregg Berger as the unmistakably monotonous and imperturbable Kornfed, Dvizila Zappa as the amusingly inept Ajax and Nancy Travis as the sexually hungry, unpleasant daughter-in-law Bernice, all contribute to their full extent. Along with great writing - even when the joke is not infallible, the wit behind it compensates for the animation style, while far from some updated modern computer-enhanced products is inventive and often abstract. It has that homemade, sandy quality that Beavis and Butthead or South Park would later have. And, like these shows, if you are a small child, I mean a little less than when I watched a show, you may not understand most of the jokes (that is, there are enough strippers and references to VD to sometimes fill in two shows) But it is ingenious to catch if it is on TV late at night, and during this period of time it functions quite well. One can only hope for a DVD box set. <br /> <br /> So, to anyone who has hardly or never heard of this program, here’s a general note: think of this show as if Dashil Hammett met Walt Disney and decided to go to the slums of Vegas. with a free mini bar and make collaboration in the spirit of Luis Buñuel and the Simpsons combined. Not to mention the fact that the group did Rugrats. (Strong) a
