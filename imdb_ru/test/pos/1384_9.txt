From time to time you come across a film that takes you by surprise, and this is one of them. On an unexpected scale, it will be interpreted as sharing a jacuzzi with Jessica Alba, while the group consisting of Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Phil Linotte and Keith Moon play music for the night. The reason why this film will surprise you is because with the meager budget they had (£ 8000), and that was done by a group of comrades who just wanted to try it, they created something very elegant and look easy in 100 times more than its budget. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple: a team of mercenaries carrying a dangerous prisoner in space is attacked and forced to crash to the ground on a neighboring desert planet. After some checks, not only the planets do not exist according to star maps, but they are not alone, as it seems, and something very unfriendly begins to collect them one by one. It sounds like a very standard Sci-Fi fee for mixing Alien elements. Predator and Pitch Black, but he takes it all and turns them into something that seems fresh and original. <br /> <br /> Shooting in this place is fantastic, with maximum use of the Balmeddi beach in Aberdeen, and you sincerely feel that you are one foreign world. It would seem that the endless sand dunes and ingenious lighting effects create a sense of gloom, you really think that the crew is stuck in an alien world. In addition, the sequence of actions is excellent, the initial attack on the freighter - a great demonstration of what special effects can be achieved on the budget, and gunfights, as well as a stunning finale - all this demonstrates the ingenuity of the film. <br /> <br /> As for the team of mercenaries, the cast surpasses itself. For the low-budget independent movie, the casting here was done through local media, and they seem to have selected a few possible stars for the future. Local bodybuilder Mike Mitchell, although not a natural actor, plays the role of Arni Esk, the leader of the mercenaries. Of the rest of the cast, there are two outstanding performances Patrick Wright as the second in the team of MacNeil and Scott Ironside as rough and ready engineer Vince. Both have the best lines in the film, and Scott with humor adds a bit of humor to the film. Patrick copes well with his duties, being steep like ice, second in command. <br /> <br /> Directed by Mark Stirton can be proud of what he has achieved, and shows that the Scottish film does not have to be “Kilt and Ceilid” or the Scottish films “Slums and drugs” can be fresh, inventive and most importantly, damn fun. This film is Scottish (from the north-eastern flavor) to the depths of the soul and praise the actors and directors for keeping the accents, which adds to the charm of the play. Although budget constraints from time to time show (the only mistake I could find), which was to be expected. This film, its composition and team deserve all the success that they receive, and then a little more. For example, I wish Mark and his team every success, and their career is a very close look. <br /> <br /> Rating - 9/10 The first Scottish fiction is bold, fresh and inventive, real. triumph. <br /> <br /> Movie reviews, news and opinions are unlike any other, plus bi-weekly shows in the ass. <br /> <br /> www.fightrunner.co.uk <br /> contact@fightrunner.co.uk
