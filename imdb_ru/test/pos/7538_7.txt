For those of you who are not familiar with Alisdair Sims, he, of course, is the final Scrooge from all the films about Christmas Carol. (I? I think I'm REALLY bad .. I really haven't seen the damn thing). I think that those who have seen Carol Rozhdestvensky and are so accustomed to his character can find the “Bells of Saint Trinians” rather amazing. You see, in this movie, Sims plays two roles. Firstly, he plays better, and secondly, he is a playwright as the director of a private school for girls! So, as soon as you understand it through your fat skull, this film will offer many pleasures. The plot focuses on how the school is trying to earn desperately needed money at the races. It’s actually a little more difficult for small children, but I think they’ll be preoccupied with their antics and horses to really notice. Adults can also stumble over all thick accents. But, again, the story is easy enough, the action is crazy and frantic, which can really be seen. PS, all the children look as if they are from school cute Eloise.
