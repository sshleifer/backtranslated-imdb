We have moved far beyond this trial raid into the forbidden zone - drug addiction - in the 1950s. Thus, the film may seem outdated. A man with a golden hand fulfilled his function, moving aside the layer on the back of society, opening his eyes to a southern country boy in 1955, when I first watched this film in a theater. After some serious reflection that I was too young, I was allowed to go. It was powerful and worked then and still maintains some of the sharp, painful moments of the naked soul. As a movie depicting solitude at the heart of the creature, it succeeds. <br /> <br /> Filled with fear, Frank Sinatra in his best role creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathize with the viewer. He conveys his helplessness and inefficiency in a beautifully restrained performance. As the voice of common sense in the dead end of the urban jungle, Kim Novak as Molly is pretty good. She is compassionate and yet stands on solid ground. The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is really good. Darren McGavin plays the slimy character and does it very well. Eleanor Parker is superbly annoying and painfully insecure in her role as pitiful Zosh, the crippled wife of Sinatra. Arnold Stang is another unlikely survivor on the street. Considered pathetic and contemptible, his character Sparrow provides poignant comedic moments. <br /> <br /> Music is almost the star of this film - pensive, frantic, capricious, shrill. The account of Elmer Bernstein perfectly underlines the intensity of Frankie Motch's spiritual weakness and physical need for heroin. Molly's theme is bittersweet and clearly reflects what the film depicts visually. I do not know of another soundtrack that would effectively complement the tension and the defeat of a person as effectively as this one.
