The Curse of the Island of the Apes is a treasure; in my opinion, the series as a whole was the holy grail of adventure games, not to mention LucasArts. <br /> <br /> But if you return to the “Curse”, then at CMI, it’s wonderful that he is not afraid to be himself. He deviates from the first two, but still remains true to the works of Ron Gilbert (if the same could have been said about the fourth installment of the series!). The voice acting is flawless, Dominic Armato is played by our favorite hero Guybrush Threepwood. The animation, although different from the classic pixel characters, is beautifully executed. It really is just great. And the music is fantastic! This is never annoying, and you will never want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> Although I am not a big fan of romance, romantic scenes and themes are not at all repressive. They also have a rare ability to give out sweet, not cheesy. It says a lot about a girl who usually falls asleep while chicks click. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, this is a classic element of humor in MI. CMI is skillful enough to create ruthless lines, absolutely absurd humor and just good fun. Gary Coleman is removed in the role of a young budding entrepreneur, and world events quietly stick out without leaving the limits of the game. <br /> <br /> It is unfair to compare CMI with MI and MI2, because it really is in its own kingdom. Personally, I will never find a favorite between the three, since they are all very different from each other. However, if you want to have a good time with the mind of the classic series, I insist that you try this game. You will NOT be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars, hands down. <br /> <br /> - Emily N.
