This film is not the most terrible of all time, but it is an excellent example of the terrible focus of the eighties - low-budget, without stars, many inventive scenes of death and enough nudity to keep teens in their places. The premise is interesting and fun, and three evil children play their part well. A good starting point for Just Say is Julie Brown, revealing her talents at the beginning of her career. This film will not be seen by many, but for fans of the horrors of the 80s, this is simply necessary.
