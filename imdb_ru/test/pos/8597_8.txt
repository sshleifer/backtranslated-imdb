Why are there so much hate among IMDb reviewers who hate this film? This is not a masterpiece, but after seeing it twice, it looks like an irresistible drama in the world of network television. Robin Stone is the epitome of every Dan Rater, Philip Stone and Bryan, his name is on NBC. The dummy of a person unable to love, who succeeds professionally, but fails in his personal life. I worked for eight (8) years on the network news and the Robin Stone film EXIST! <br /> <br /> For me, this is the cast of Cannon (which can be annoying, but not in this film) to Green (who plays the pathos just right) Wexler (who is considered a young model in love with Prince Charming and reconcile this image with the true ugliness inside). It should also be noted the ending, which, according to some observers IMDb, is an excuse. Is not! Listen to the song “He's Moving On” to find out how Robin Stone’s character travels, and finally he has problems. He understands that the answers do not lie with the life he lived in, and the symbolic departure from those with whom he associated himself, after all, he is perfect.
