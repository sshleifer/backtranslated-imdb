* LITTLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Need any additional evidence that Cai Ming-lian is among the most original and provocative directors working today somewhere? Watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Working with small variations of the theme that goes through most of his work, THE HOLE is a study of alienation and loneliness - in this case between a man and a woman, who are neighbors at the top / bottom. - and how the various structures (real or psychological) of modernity fence people off from each other. Here the woman (the neighbor downstairs) is trying to endure, because her apartment is flooded with a huge drain from above. A plumber tries to identify the source of the problem, and then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor. Already in isolation and despair (both characters are one of the few residents of the housing project who did not run in advance due to a mysterious, almost apocalyptic epidemic). The hole connecting the two apartments, first functions as a regular one, in a long series of humiliations, but soon it begins to acquire the value of almost mythical proportions. <br /> <br /> Tsai's sense of humor and sense of cinematic history are displayed with a little more revelation than usual — because the woman’s random dreams, revolving around her neighbor at the top, are visualized as musical numbers (set to Grace Chang’s music) that explode with screen in short pieces of sensual, surrealistic novel and humor - very much like the BIG screen screen from paradise. And despite all the sharpness and alienation shown here, the stirring of Cai in the late 1990s, which preceded the millennium, is ridiculous, absurd and gives this film a very attractive image. The final scene is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tsai - in a typical manner - overthrows most of the usual expectations or prejudices that Western people bring to Asian cinema with careless, carelessly revealing directness, focusing on absurd tendencies of the human mind and the most absolute of everydayness. There is a complete, careless demystification of almost everything about his characters, bypassing the past with prehistory or most cultural attributes (which reinforces the isolation of characters), making Hole - and his other films - rather disorienting, but also always exciting and insightful.
