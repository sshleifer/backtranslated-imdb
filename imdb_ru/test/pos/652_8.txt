The notorious big budget failure when it is released. This comedy, inspired by Robert Altman, has some amazing moments and sometimes an inspired cast. Although it lasts a long time and completely loses focus, there are enough funny moments that will make the curious spectator watch to the end. If you are a fan of characters and actresses, it will be a pleasure for you; In this film, you will learn so many amazing, little-known performers (you may not know their names, but you know their faces), hell, even a child from Christmas Story appears in a small part. Hire if you have Netflix, if you are reading this, I am sure you will like it.
