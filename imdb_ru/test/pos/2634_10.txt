Chris Penn is jolly like Jeff Spicoli's eternal brother. This film is great because it was much more real and funny than the fast times on Ridgemont High. Casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks for almost all Eddie van Halen, who became the songs on ou812 and illegal carnal knowledge. This film is one of the greatest heroes of the film stoner with Cheech and Chong. Fast times were more depressing than fun. Abortions, friends cheating on friends, jerking off in bathrooms, bad work, and bad schooling. Someone must hate the eighties to love Ridgemont more than wild life. The film even had great cameos, such as the creator of the city limits, Michelle was shocked at the liquor store or Ben Stein in her first role in the store of surplus Sunny.
