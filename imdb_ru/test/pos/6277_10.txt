To be honest, this is probably the best version in my book as the sound version of the Jazz Singer movie. The 1927 version is a really silent movie, despite the fact that it turned into a first walkie-talkie. <br /> <br /> Danny Thomas is a great comedian and he sings very well. He does Jewish things with feeling. Peggy Lee is gorgeous, and any film that she is in is always interesting. Allan Joslin is not very interesting, and we could do without him. One question: how long cantors live in such luxurious homes ???
