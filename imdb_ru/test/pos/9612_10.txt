This film is the best Kung Fu movie of all time. Despite the fact that in the movie "The Crouching Tiger" there are no wire effects and special effects, this film uses ingenuity and creative camera work to create unforgettable fighting moments, and the battle scenes are well choreographed and dense. In this film, there is plenty of action with lots of great battle scenes, but the story is also very good, with lots of twists and turns. The characters are well rounded and have real depth, as the motives of their actions and individuality are revealed in much more detail than most kung-fu movies. There is really great camera work in the film: my favorite shot starts with a close-up on our hero's face, showing his reaction, and then quickly moves away, showing the scene in front of him, which is the reason for his gaze. I originally bought the film to hope to see some great fight scenes, but after several views I found out how amazing the game and the story were. Overall a great movie.
