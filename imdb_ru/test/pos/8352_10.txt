This movie is superb! The angel is beautiful, and Scamp is amazing! His little screams when he is scared, and the funniest moments when: Scamp comes under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp sing "I never had that feeling." I fully recommend this film, it will be released in a special edition on June 20th. On the cover there is garbage on the trash can and Angel under the lid. <br /> <br /> I just can not explain this film more romantic, charming, cheerful and charming. The scenes at the dump are funny, all the dogs at the dump have something special. Too funny, I laughed, the children LOVE it. Buy it when it comes out, it has new features!
