I didn't know much about this movie, but I found out that Kane was a fighter, that I wasn't very pleased, but hey, I liked Slay's Santa Slay, and there was a wrestler in it, so hell. The story begins very strangely and promisingly, but after a while it becomes not much more than your typical teen horror flick, although the settings have helped some. A group of criminal young people were gathered and taken to the old hotel, which used to be a luxurious palace, but now it’s a dump to clean it up to prepare it as a shelter for the homeless. The driver is a man with a prosthesis who is a veteran of the opening scene of this film, where he meets this big madman who just killed his partner and blinded another woman. Teenagers, all being smart punks, all, of course, object to the need to do some real work, but they are part of some kind of unique collaborative work program, yes, of course, this is a great idea. Few people suspect that someone is hiding in the hotel, who, in his own way, will save taxpayers of this state some money. Of course, this is a guy who likes to collect eyeballs, and he collects a whole collection. There will not be a lot of things that horror fans have not seen before, but there are some cruel scenes and enough blood to satisfy the fans. The furnishing of the old hotel is also an ideal place for filming a slasher, and there are small subtests, such as searching for an alleged safe with money and searching for babies, since this joint working group is evenly selected. Most adolescents also kill with dignity, so it works well. Not much, but much better than Silent Hill or “When a Stranger Calls,” and perhaps better than some other crap I wouldn’t bother to see. 7 out of 10.
