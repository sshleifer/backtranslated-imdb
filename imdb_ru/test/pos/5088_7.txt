Continuing an exclusive film program on complex relationships in some European courts, last night Anna Bolein, a film made by the great Teutonic director Herr Ernst Lubic, was shown at the Schloss Theater. The film tells the terrible story of the wife of the Queen of the British King Henry VIII. She was executed by her husband (well, not really, the king ordered the executioners to do their dirty work), not to mention the fact that this marriage became an important political and religious historical event, the English Reformation. <br /> <br /> Stars of the film Dame Henny Porten, the first German superstar in those years, and Herr Emil Jannings, the fattest actor of Germany in that silent era. Both play their characters appropriately; Dame Porten as an innocent aristocrat who is increasingly interested in the power that the court offers to her and Herr Jennings as an unscrupulous, capricious and feminine British monarch, a character very suitable for this German actor who replays accordingly the character himself extravagant and excessively individual. <br /> <br /> In the early period of the film, Herr Lubich was known for his outstanding costume films, colossal productions with large budgets (Anna Bolein cost about 8 million marks, which even for this German earl is a fortune). ) take special care in the magnificent decorations that can be seen during the coronation procession on the stage of Westminster Abbey, where 4,000 additional employees were involved (idle Germans of that time were used, resulting in revolutionary workers making a fuss when President Friedrich Ebert visited the film set during filming time). <br /> <br /> In addition to the performance, one of the most important aspects of this and every Herr Lubitsch movie, even in its epic period, is The Complex Relationship Between the Main Characters. We are experiencing a game with different interests, double meaning and the complex art of flirting, but the fact that with easy handling ends in tragedy at first. The importance of these historical facts is revealed in an effective way, but Lubicz is indeed more interested in the changing relationship between Henry VIII and Anna Bolein. <br /> <br /> And now, if you let me, I must temporarily take my leave, because this German earl must make sure that one of his fat and rich heires does not lose his head because of this Teutonic aristocrat . <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand von Galitsien http: // ferdinandvongalitzien. blogspot.com/
