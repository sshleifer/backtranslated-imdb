For those of you who love regular comedians, you've probably heard about George Carlin. He is truly one of the best comedians alive, so you should know him. <br /> <br /> But he has already died, God rest in peace and peace. Or hell. He did not really believe in religion, so he could choose hell to live forever. Haha, just kidding, don't take it seriously! </ b jokes george carlin. This is not the best ... but it is really funny. <br /> <br /> There are fewer political and religious jokes in it. Just have a good time! <br /> <br /> Editing is very good. This is not a concert, so it should not have a quick frame change ... the slow attenuation of the other frame was well done. Fading is the best option in terms of editing!
