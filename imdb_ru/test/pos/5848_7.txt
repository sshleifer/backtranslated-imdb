Not bad, but it can be much better, and it seems to follow the basic diet for the criminal drama. You have Sandra Bullock as a cop who finds it difficult to work with others, you have her new partner. There is a closed case, but a policeman who is still working on it, and there are so many damn lines in the film that I want to scream. <br /> <br /> However, if you look through the formula elements, there is a good movie hiding under. It is exciting, and the plots worked for me. Well worth the rent, but perhaps not a purchase.
