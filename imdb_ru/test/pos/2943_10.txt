I usually don’t like to watch movies while they’re still in the cinema because of high ticket prices, but I saw the poster “Some things that remain” and I thought: “This young actress looks smart and mysterious, but not an ordinary blonde teenager. BS. " So I decided to take the plunge and watch this movie at the premiere. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you, I was pleasantly surprised. I went to this movie without any expectations. I really didn’t know what it would be about, but the rude emotions and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland made me feel rather satisfied with my decision. Alberta Watson did a fantastic job as a mother suffering from Tamara’s disease, and I should also add that I was very impressed with the comedy styles of Megan Park as Tamara’s girlfriends, Brands. <br /> <br /> The film was wonderfully shot by Gail Harvey, and it was assembled in the spirit of the kitsch of the 50s, in which you feel warm and happy, even if the storyline, as a rule, does not elevate the mood. I also thought that the film was well shot, many beautiful images of the countryside of the 1950s will remain in my memory for long weeks. <br /> <br /> This film as a whole was unusual and wonderful. I discovered that this is unpredictable, and, although the story ends in a somewhat open way, I was still satisfied. If you are looking for a fun, but at the same time powerful story about coming of age, or just want to recall life in the 1950s, I guarantee that this film is for you. Even if you have no expectations, it is likely that you will be most impressed. Give it a chance!
