It's a shame that calls to the house are not known. Maybe this is because middle-aged romantic characters worn in the store and timid, and not in exaggerated teenage stars? May be. If you are over 35, you will probably get this comedy. If you are over 45, you really get this comedy. If you're 25, wait until you get older to see it. <br /> <br /> An incredible combination of Mattau and Jackson works precisely because it is unlikely. There is a wonderful line of Matteu, which sums up what is happening between the two: "I like old women, because you do not need to explain who Ronald Colman is." (If this is not an exact line, it is close ...) <br /> <br /> The premise of a poor-quality hospital run by incompetent people sounds plausible. The art of Karni depicts a senile surgeon completely brilliant. It is impossible not to laugh out loud when it is delivered. The plots, if you can call them that, are also funny, like between Mattau and son Jackson. Everything sounds just in the right tone. <br /> <br /> Okay, Mattau should wear women's clothes that are too complicated and light. But nevertheless - this is Walter Mattau in drag! It's funny!
