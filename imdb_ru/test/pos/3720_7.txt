Belonging to the genre of post-apocalyptic future films, this is a stylistic and very very intimate part. The most prominent element of the film is its silence; no one says. I do not think that Besson, despite the fact that it is evident in most of his later works, meant it as some kind of cool trick. I think what makes him so clever and so effective is the fact that, having no other way to communicate, everyone should read each other on the basis of intuition and transmission of emotions, no matter how insignificant they are. Although I was not glued to the screen, after thinking, I see that this is a very touching and sensitive view of human nature. His vehicle is a stylized sci-fi film. Part of his thinking about the nature of the human world is that each of his people is not necessarily played as a perfect man: a hero, a lone tramp in a deserted new world, is accepted by a senior recluse who refuses to retain his role in the exchange of food between him and the hoarse, cruel character, played by Jean Reno, and therefore Reno tries his best, mainly using brute force, to get what he wants. Thus, the antagonist is right, although not a good person, but the main character and his sympathetic foil are both wrong, although they are both good people. <br /> <br /> This is filmed in clean and clear black and white, edited and captured in a low-key, but at the same time frivolous and small-scale approach, and its actors are very real. How can they not be? They, like their characters, remain with the need to communicate. This is one of the few really good films that Luc Besson has written. His early work is almost always better than the fluff he is now releasing.
