There - initially a lot to his horror ?? Fosca, the grotesquely ugly cousin of his commander, develops an obsessive love for him. He suffers from her passionate and demanding affections of pity and concern for her health (she is seriously ill), but is becoming more and more fascinated by her ?? before the dramatic finale? <br /> <br /> Don't miss this most unusual love story, however perverted it may sound. Valeria d'Obichi, who deservedly won the price for her image of Foschi, is as disturbing as it is touching. Buy a video, read a book, watch a musical!
