Meticulously constructed and beautifully played, “To the ends of the earth” is just an amazing journey from our reality to another era. <br /> <br /> On the basis of the William Golding trilogy, these three 90-minute films tell of the journey to Australia and the experience of the young aristocrat Edmund Talbot (Benedict Cumberbatch) on board an aging military man in the early 19th century when he heads government post Down Under <br /> <br /> Among the crew members and high hopes of immigrants, his excerpt is a tumultuous, mocking captain (Jared Harris), a politically radical philosopher (Sam Neal), a cunning first lieutenant who has broken up (Jamie Syves) and , fleetingly, the first brush of love in the form of a beautiful young woman (Joan Page), whose ship literally floats at night. <br /> <br /> Despite an amazing degree of physical historical accuracy, director David Atwood and screenwriters Tony Besgallop and Lee Jackson deftly look at it for manners and strict etiquette from an earlier time, creating a completely convincing microcosm of the Napoleonic era. <br /> <br /> Ship’s life is one cruel, monotonous round of motion sickness, poverty and danger after another, and Edmund becomes entangled in the love, hopes and misfortunes of his fellow travelers, he experiences the delusional maelstrom of man’s life and adversity noble feelings. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoyed the Master and the Commander: Will the far side of the world or the Patrick O'Brien Series of novels on which it was based, love it ?? for everyone else this is a whole new world that needs to be opened.
