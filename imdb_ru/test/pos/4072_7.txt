This is a funny movie. The Bob and Eddie Shaw show may lead to a sequel, but I doubt it will bring enough money. <br /> <br /> Deniro proves that he can again be a great straight with some fun and spontaneous moments. Eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of animals and rodents CGI. René Rousseau - well, in any case, it’s just fun to watch, and she played her part perfectly. <br /> <br /> Some wild and unusual stunts, especially the scene of a garbage truck. It was worth seeing in the theater. We needed a good laugh, and we got a lot from the film and great results at the end. DO NOT LEAVE credits at the beginning! <br /> <br /> At least 7.
