This concerns an attempt by the local commander of the marines to conceal unacceptable behavior by a major of the marines, as a result of which he was shot by his former girlfriend, captain of the marines The man and the woman were lovers, but the captain tried to break off the relationship when she learned that her boyfriend was married. He continued to pursue her, going so far that once he shot his hand in her direction. Finally, he broke into her house, attacked her with a knife, and was twice shot from her service pistol and killed. The civilian prosecutor decided to kill self-defense, but the Marines decided to accuse the captain of the murder. You see, the major was a decorated hero from Vietnam and an old friend of the colonel’s commander at the naval base. The captain also made some enemies in his command in the motor pool, rejecting some male achievements in a very sad style. <br /> <br /> There is a significant psychological burden motivating and controlling the actions of the main actors in this drama. which a very capable cast transmits well. However, the director and editor seem determined to hide what is happening as much as possible with frustrating memories and changing viewpoints. You are lucky if you know where you are in most cases. Have it with them, though; This is a worthy story, as the military court of the captain unfolds, and it seems that every man’s hand is against her, even her lawyer. <br /> <br /> Sentence? Well, in the end, it's a pretty tense story, so you have to see everything yourself. There is some kind of "pacifist" message in the film, but forget about it. Of course, “war is hell,” but sometimes this cannot be avoided. Then we will need these marines, even if they are not always the best champions of fair play in the country. As Kipling says in his poem “Tommy Atkins”: <br /> <br /> “This is Tommy and Tommy and Tommy are waiting outside. But this is the place for Mr. Atkins when the warship is in process. ”
