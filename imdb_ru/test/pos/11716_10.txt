Mr. Sharkey, you look so ... normal. You will never get a table in this trendy cocktail restaurant / bistro. On the other hand, I eat grapes and pate every day. Do you like my fur coat with all the fine trim? My huge gold rings of gold? Or maybe you like these blondes, as you say ?, Bombs, all of them are qualified in aerobics and naked petanque, who adorn my long burgundy velvety sofa, like so many soft boiled larks, on a plate of foie gras, fried on pan and figs. Do you like? You can not have! Zay all my <br /> <br /> You will never possess "what I possessed." Domino was the best, except Maman. You do not understand the art of making love. Just look at your lower mustache. It is almost ridiculous for me to think about that ridiculous bulge on your stupid face when you sniff Domino's love bump, like a pig looking for truffle in the forest, a forest billowing and swinging in the hot winds of desire! You lost again, Sharkey. <br /> <br /> When I make love to women, you know, Sharkey, you know. Zey learn, zey learn, until zey becomes a teacher. Not nano-math, the art of love. Domino was a seedling that I watered. I watered it very often. Everywhere Sharkey. Her fragrant petals, her proud stalk everywhere. It will fade under your ridiculous hose, like a souffle extracted from the oven five minutes too early. <br /> <br /> I have to go, Sharqi, you tired me so much with your shameful behavior. It is you who will be washed away in the spirit, like a smelly thing. <br /> <br /> Enjoy your chance!
