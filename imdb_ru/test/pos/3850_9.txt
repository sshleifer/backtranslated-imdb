I'm not a big Disney fan, but my 7-year-old son is starting to penetrate them, so we created a fairly large collection, and this is one of my favorites. We first saw it a couple of weeks ago, and since then we should have seen it half a dozen times! Well, as others have noted, not the most complex or inventive of the plots, but there is more to the film. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous characters, Phil Harris steals the show like Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler is not far behind. The music is great - my disabled son always insists that I pick him up and dance with him under the slogan "Everybody wants to be cats," that says it all. And "Thomas O'Malley" is just as pleasant. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why some people in the film have such a depressive person, besides dislike for cats! And yes, he takes a few of his clues from “101 Dalmations” and, perhaps, “The Lady and the Tramp” (I haven't seen this for a long time, so I'm not going to compare them), and although “101 dalmating” is better in a sense, for me, "Aristocats" is much nicer. Is it about these films? <br /> <br /> Aside from Peter Pan (now the movie is 10/10), this is my favorite Disney movie. My 7-year-old son loves it, his angry 41-year-old dad loves it, so you can't ask for much more family film. <br /> <br /> Excellent!
