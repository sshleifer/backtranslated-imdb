Saw this film during the Mod & Rockers festival in August. I was so inspired and touched. Harry had an amazing life and one of the best and distinct voices ever recorded. For those of you who don’t know about Harry Nilsson, do a little research and you’ll see that Harry probably somehow found his way into your life — perhaps it was his special “Dot” of the 70s or Speaking from Midnight Cowboy. For me, it started with “people, let me tell you about my best friend” - the song from “Father Eddie's ear”. After watching this movie, you will truly feel the love and admiration of real friends and peers of Harry. Don't cry for Harry - he had the ball ... <br /> <br /> Brett
