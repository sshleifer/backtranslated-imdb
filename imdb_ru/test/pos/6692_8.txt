K-PAX is exactly what a warming film should be. The story of the mysterious mentally ill Prot, played by Kevin Spacey, and his unbelieving psychiatrist Dr. Powell, played by Jeff Bridges. Both have a very friendly relationship, and as their relationship grows, Dr. Powell cannot help but wonder if there is anything else for his mysterious patient, who insists that he is from another planet called K-PAX. This film is very funny, and Kevin Spacey draws well-placed liners, as if it were his second nature. K-PAX is a smart movie, and I didnâ€™t expect it to go as it did before. In the end, I found myself thinking about the little things in life, about the miracle and magic of everyday life that we so often take for granted. I left the theater with a warm indistinct feeling inside, and for families and couples on a K-PAX date is a great movie that will not disappoint. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in something more than the monotonous editions of glossy, action, bloody festivals.
