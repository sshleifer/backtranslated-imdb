I was not surprised to read the director’s comment that she made this film the antidote to all these “creations” of DVDs, as it certainly amazed me. I confess that I have a penchant for “meta,” but I found this film very accessible and interesting, and not even in a difficult, self-consciously clever image, which is certainly not much of what you expect in a film about filmmaking. He is very “French” in the sense that there are many strange, but sometimes convincing theories about how “it works” (and even sexuality) “works”, but since the director doesn’t quite play himself (he uses an avatar instead) options (I'm sure she constantly contradicts herself). Apparently, Catherine Brailat specializes in films that are difficult to access, but I would definitely say that this film does not fit. I really enjoyed the dialogue, the balance between the cinematic and the natural, the relationship between the director and her assistant and actor, and so on. Highly recommended.
