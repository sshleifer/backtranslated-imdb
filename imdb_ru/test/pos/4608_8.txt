Universal studios. The name evokes many memories of horrific admirers of beautiful frosted paintings ... uh ... landscapes shrouded in mist of rural areas, full moons, howling wolves, taverns, and mobs with torches. However, it is rather strange, looking back at these films, how little the epoch that produced the real classics lasts. In the 30s there were their masterpieces, but mostly they were the works of the same directors, and many of their films today are of historical interest. In the 1940s, more insanely funny morning films were released than in high art, and most fans agree that the classic era of gothic horror films ended in 1945 with the House of Dracula, which came across the comedy Abbott & Costello, and was officially dead by the 50s and the onset of the atomic age. <br /> <br /> It is strange that perhaps one of the best gothic Universal was created in the 50s! This alone makes the film strange, as the costumed dramas were going EVERYWHERE. It may not be comparable to the classics of all times, such as the James Whale and The Wolfman films, but, hell, this brings together all the funny elements of these films into one delightful pleasure! Be prepared for nothing but pure entertainment! As various social mores have changed, the film also condones violence that was not allowed in earlier eras; there is no blood, but we see how the characters shoot and strike with a knife directly in the face, and there is even a burning torch on the face! <br /> <br /> The film may not be a horror film, but it does have an atmosphere, a look and a sense of one! It begins in deep night with howling winds (and wolves), when two men seal the tombs of two, presumably, dead young lovers, BUT WAIT! One of them is not dead, but he cannot move! He is trapped, but speaks silently in his mind, unable to communicate! What is his story? That's how you start a horror movie .... <br /> <br /> English businessman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Green, showing off one of his best performances) goes under the pseudonym of Richard Beckett to investigate the disappearance of his two friends who disappeared in the castle of the one-eyed Austrian Count von Bruno (did Sasha Baron Cohen see this?). It seems, many years ago, von Bruno presented himself as a god to the locals of Africa for stealing ivory, he was exposed by the people of Burton, and the locals disfigured him. Now he is eager for revenge. <br /> <br /> The movie has all the clichés, a trip in the style of Jonathan Harker to the castle, an inn with alert villagers, deadly traps and an awkward servant (Lon Cheney Jr.). .). The scenes from the torture chamber are truly alarming, including a panel in the floor, which activates the dungeon door (which later becomes a brilliant scene for escape), a hunting expedition with the participation of an imported panther (!!! ??) and even an alligator pit! And one more fake death in the style of Romeo and Juliet, which led to the prologue of the film ... <br /> <br /> The plot is cliche, and the worldview is black and white. But it is still incredibly exciting, with director Nathan Juran each scene takes shape in the atmosphere and seems fresh and new. There are also several holes for the plot. Why is Ronald trying to leave the castle so early? And he never solves the secret of what happened to his friends, although it is obvious, but he does not know when he gives up, and before that he seemed so sure. Strange. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great. Despite the high school's rudeness, Richard Green makes Burton one of the cutest main characters I've ever seen in a horror movie. Rita Corday is excellent as the “peasant wife” of the count, who becomes the love interest of Burton, she may have the stereotypical problem of “falling in love with just a glance” of all the heroines of the film of this era, but she portrays a long-suffering woman in a marriage without love with a sadistic monster very convincing , she also demonstrates the suspicions and wits that few heroines of the film make of this era, even seeing Burton's forced attempt to reassure her (and paw on her necklace, although this is just an analysis as an important sign) as an attempt and rape, but it never seems to be opposing in their paranoia, the audience sympathize with her. Even though he cannot make von Bruno seem really foreign and otherworldly (after all, he is a villain in a horror film), Stephen McNally gives a really frightening performance as a sadistic nobleman. When he shows his burned eye and laughs madly, it's really scary. Lon Cheney, Jr. is as great as his dumb protege Gargon. <br /> <br /> But the best performance is undoubtedly Boris Karloff, as the mysterious doctor Dr. Meissen. At first he has little time on the screen, but he steals every scene he is in. This is a terrible, sad, mysterious and, ultimately, heroic performance. When he angrily looks at him, applying leeches to one of Bruno's minions, spies on our hero and speaks in that famous voice “You know that I am unfit”, which only Karloff could do, do you wonder if he is a hero or a villain? always hiding. And although he acts as the main agent of our hero's escape, he still shows human weaknesses, such as greed and fear for his own life, even poisoning a person in cold blood for a burton before he even makes Burton agree. His plan to help our hero and the heroine escape also puts them right in von Bruno’s paws, as he makes a surprisingly sadistic (if not surprisingly erroneous) death for them, which should have inspired such scenes in the TV series Korman. He may not have a lot of screen time, but this is certainly one of the best ideas of Boris. <br /> <br /> Although the final may seem unexpected and uncontrollable, for some of them half the fun comes and there is a lot of excitement. have Return and experience the days when Heroes were heroes, and the Villains were villains. This is not a masterpiece, but it is escapist entertainment at its best.
