It was one of the lines in the trailer about this film, and this time the publicists did not exaggerate. All six players represented here are present on the screen 99% of the time, so they should be good. <br /> <br /> It is always interesting how you can use certain plot plots for any highball comedy before a deadly serious situation. Mary Boland from Ditzy and Charlie Ruggles from the henpecked play their usual characters who plan to drive all the way to California. To share expenses, they advertise someone to share the trip. They get Burns and Allen, as well as a dog monster. The same premise was deadly serious over several generations in California. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you are traveling with Gracie Allen, you know that you are going crazy trying to understand her reasoning of Monty Python. about the whole world. And if this is not enough, you may encounter W.C. Fields, part-time sheriff and billiards full-time living in sin with Alison Skipworth. But then we did not delve into such things. <br /> <br /> This is a classic comedy of the thirties, which should not be missed.
