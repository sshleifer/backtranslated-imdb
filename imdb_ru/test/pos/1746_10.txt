Wow. I saw this film and “Up” on the same day for an hour apart in different cinemas. At first I saw Mr. Bug, and then I was completely disappointed in the subsequent actions of An. What a beautiful and touching movie! Movies of the 1930s and 40s for us nowadays can annoy them with their melodramatic play and dialogue, but as an animation the same melodrama and moaning humor can be wonderful. And the soft “organic” lines of the 30s design. And the music just creates a good, pleasant mood, and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybirds, grasshoppers, bees, snails, stinkers, flies, mosquitoes, bugs, crickets and much more each with its own cute little (but not overbearing) features. The interaction with the human world, from the sworn enemy (cigar smokers, carriers of high heels, innocent kicking children) to kindhearted and unknown destroyers, is realistic and fascinating. You care about mistakes, And Dick and Mary. The main character Hoppiti is not some kind of ideal superman who comes to “put things in order”, but a star optimist who leads everyone along the garden path (literally!), And every time you think it will end well in style of the 1930s, comes another checkpoint ...! I was on the edge of my seat much more than with "Up." I walked out of the cinema, grinning and chuckling: something that hasn't been around for a long time!
