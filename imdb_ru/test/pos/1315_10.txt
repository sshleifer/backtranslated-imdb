This is a film that should be viewed and viewed as a work of art. This is the forgetful work of the love of the Schroders brothers about the life of Yukio Mishima, which is full of truly artistic elements. The film moves from color to black and white, from the past to the present, invented works of him by Mishima. All without being embarrassed in the least. The only thing that struck me was that the entire film, with the exception of the conversational parts of the narrator, was written in Japanese. Still a masterpiece that deserves an audience, but did not find the won. The criterion, if you are reading this, is a film that should be released under your print with as many additions as possible. This Truley film deserves more. 10/10
