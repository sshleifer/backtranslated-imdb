Eliza (Elizabeth Murman) is a country girl who came to the city in search of love. She met a man who told her about an astrologer who would show her the stars. This is a journey of souls ... Eliza is being tested, can she realize her true love when she sees him or not? Tommy (Tommy Lee Jones) - a builder trying to find himself in his native legacy. They show each other different views on things. Eliza is still looking for love, and Tommy is trying to protect the reservation in which his grandmother lives. This is a distorted story about how to go beyond the obvious and find beauty in simple everyday things. The style is artsy and crowded with symbols. The psychedelic style of the camera can scare the average viewer, but deeper messages and interesting shots make this film worth seeing. This is a film that explores the underworld of strange, needy and devastated people. This one is going astray, but definitely worth a look!
