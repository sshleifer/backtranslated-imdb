WTF !! Any of his books / films ends in a happy ending? The notebook was good ... but enough, already with depressing endings. I was told that he writes about real situations that people face in real life. It is clear ... but sometimes it's nice to see people who sacrificed their whole life to get only a mediocre unlucky time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness and are able to survive it to the end of their days, Do we not already know that actually happening in real life? Can we not - for an instant (an hour and a half) live in a film that ends in a happy note - that gives us hope for our own future ??? <br /> <br /> Yes - wow. I know. But actually, I think we should anticipate films that end like this with a warning. "Beware: there is no happy end."
