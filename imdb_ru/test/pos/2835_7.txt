This is a brightly photographed and unusually well-written western from the creator of Raw Leather, Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is his main assistant in this regard. His strong storyline can be told in several sentences. A stubborn cavalry officer, Captain Richard Lance, captures the leader of the Indian enemy after the massacre at the fort. He insists on bringing the man back to court to send him to Tucson; his commander sends another person to try to take a prisoner to court, and the patrol is destroyed. This means that the leader has escaped, and now Lance must lead the second patrol - and he chooses the people the fort can spare the company of problems the most - to protect the advanced fort that was destroyed and save the team from another attack, stopping the passage in this sector. Like Lance, young Gregory Peck is pretty strong. Among the other main roles of this film, which really show life on a cavalry outpost, similar to the army establishment of heterogeneous and quarreling types - military Bond, powerful as a drunken sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brody as troublemakers, Warner Anderson and Lon Cheney the Younger as a psychological troublemaker and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Hayes as associates with Nana Bryant as the wife of a colonel. Even Barbara Payton as a love interest copes with a difficult role; Michael Ansara is a captured military commander, and Jeff Corey plays a fort scout. There are really two wonderful scenes on this very well made western: a long section in the fort before sending the last patrol and a long patrol to the doomed forts. Caller himself. Once in this fort, Peck delivers a great speech in which, at the request of the people he lined up for orders, he tells them why he took them with him. reading them their faults one by one; Then they tell them why, in his opinion, he sent his best friend to die instead of him, to take the Indian instead of going himself - and he proves that they are mistaken in the rest of the film, winning their lonely battle at the expense of intelligence and courage. Franz Waxmanâ€™s music is good, production qualities are admirable; the argument about what happens if Lance leads the war will be true; apart from this intractable error of the central character, this is a great western. it was my favorite for fifty years.
