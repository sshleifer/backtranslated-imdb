I wanted to watch this, to look at the inside of the show. It told more about Robin Williams than about Mork and Mindy. However, thought it was great. We need to see that Robin is always on, no matter what. Diamontopolous's performance was awesome. <br /> <br /> The ideas of the main players seem to me very real. Roebuck, like Harry Marshall, was wonderful. He was so charming that he helped me get through all the energy of Williams. The small behind-the-scenes fragments of his other shows (“Happy Days” and “Laverne and Shirley”) were instructive. I also thought that Harvey Richmond-Peck was also a good stone in the pond. (It's good). <br /> <br /> This movie tells a long story about Hollywood people experiencing the rise and fall of a star. It kept me glued to my television, and I learned to love Robin, damn it, basically everyone seems to be super people I sometimes think is Hollywood Go figure it out. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder why networked people always play for idiots. We never saw the head abc. Just heard him as Charlie from Charlie Angels (I wonder if this is planned?). It seems so sad that the show at number 1 can be so destroyed by their own network. <br /> <br /> I think that this story can be told about the life of any person when he climbs the stairs of any work. Movie and television stars always love or hate so many people that you grew up, you just want to go back to your past, remember your past. I remember watching the show, and always wondered what was going on in their personal lives. <br /> <br /> Mork and Mindy will always be part of me, and I had to see part of them. This may not be all true, it is also not a lie, but in the end, she told me a wonderful sad, happy story.
