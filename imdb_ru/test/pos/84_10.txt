A very good film dedicated to a very important issue. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious congenital defect that can be completely prevented. If more families saw this film, perhaps more children would not have become like Adam. Jimmy Smits plays one of his best roles. This is a great film that takes into account a special family with very important needs. This is not unlike the thousands of families that exist today in the United States. There are children struggling with this all over the world. What really matters here is that all this could have been prevented. More people should watch this movie and take what he says seriously. It is well done, with important messages processed in an elegant way.
