This is a well-designed film with exciting episodes, humor and, most importantly, a love story. Anthony Quinn casts magnificently, and after watching several of his films, this should be categorized as one of his best plays, except Zorba. The film makes you wonder if he shot in Romania, which is obviously not the case. This will certainly deceive even the indigenous Romanians, with their authentic landscape, costume and lifestyle. According to IMDb, he was actually shot in France and Yugoslavia, umm. This story is irresistible, and you want to watch the whole movie to see if you missed something. This prompted me to do research to find out if this is a truth-based film, but, to my disappointment, this novel-based film would seem fantastic. It seems that this is a bit contrived, what really happened, but no one ever knows ... One problem with this film is that it seems there are no actors from Romania and this is a film about a Romanian character. Perhaps at the beginning there were a lot of Romanian fillings, but perhaps not, this is filmed elsewhere. The author of the book was Romanian, at least everything is in order and excellent - in general a masterpiece in cinematography.
