Seeing Gary Busey in a G-rated movie. This was a first and good thing. I don’t know much about the director, but he obviously knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most out of them. Where did Jillian Clare come from? My kids love her! The only thing I remember what Christopher Atkins did was the Blue Lagoon. Disney needs to watch this movie and make it work. Wife thinks he is very cute. I liked what he did with his character. He seemed so real. Most of all we liked the message of this film. Greed sucks and faith, love and family win! This is the first low-budget DVD we bought, which had so many things. Manufacturers made it for the kids, and the kids liked it. They liked the music and all the extras on the DVD. The director probably won't stick with family films, but I hope he does it, because he really knows how to get the most out of children, animals, and stars like Gary Busey. The dog was gorgeous, and seeing how Gary Busey was acting like a dog was even funnier. We did not really like this. It’s hard to find a family movie without all the rude humor, and Quigley was a delightful surprise.
