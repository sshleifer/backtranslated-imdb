2002 Bourne Identity is one of my favorite movies. however, many fans of the book complained that the film had very little to do with the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> A task is a real deal. It is strange that no one in the themes of “Bourne Identity” mentioned this film at all. (Well, I just did.) Besides the great plot, I personally found this film as good as any spy movie I've ever seen, with the possible exception of Bourne> <br /> Self ID. <br /> <br /> All actions are completely realistic. I especially liked the main characters learning mode, which was very inventive. <br /> <br /> Feeling dark and gloomy. There are some unexpected plot twists. The game is great. <br /> <br /> If you like this genre, I can not recommend this film highly enough.
