I have a letter from Miss Knight, who was in college with my older sister. In it, she talks about the difficulties of creating this film. She herself was pregnant - an interesting connection with the plot of the film - and the aspiring director was uncertain, rather green, and had great difficulties with all decisions, logistics, etc. They were in motion all the time, and it was a very difficult shot. <br /> <br /> The film, which debuted with James Caan, remains effective and impressive. This is an excellent demonstration of talent, which Miss Knight has demonstrated her entire career - on television, in movies and on the stage, where she received Tony for "Kennedy Children." <br /> <br /> This film is aged well.
