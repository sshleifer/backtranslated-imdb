... I can not believe that I was immediately hooked on this show, seeing the first scene in which I was deep. <br /> <br /> Anyway, guys, above all, hot, Cappie, Evan, Calvin, Fisher, Cappie, Heath, Cappie, etc. <br /> <br /> Secondly, girls cute, sexy, smart and not afraid to be called bitches. I like it. What at the same time does not make them mean and greedy, just realistic. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the relationship is so wonderful, especially Casey and Cappie. Recently, every show turns away from its original path, and people end up with someone who was not even in the first season. The relationship Cappie and Casey - this is true love, which lasts a long time. They loved each other for many years, and this did not end when the guest star appeared. <br /> <br /> In the modern world, maybe two people love each other for an incredibly long time, but it happens. And people define each other in college, so I knew exactly who I wanted to be in college with. Just like Casey and Cappie. <br /> <br /> I HOPE THAT MORE MORE SEASONS OF THIS SHOW, AND I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE RELATIONS BETWEEN CASEY AND CAPPIE NOW THAT THEY WILL BE TOGETHER TO STOP ON Thanksgiving ... I love this
