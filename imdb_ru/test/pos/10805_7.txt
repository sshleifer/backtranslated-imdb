I was very curious to see this exit of Vaida-Depardieu, plus the period of time is definitely fascinating. As a fan of Weida, I was disappointed, and this can be an understatement. The film never took a cinematic flight - there is no reason for hostility between Danton and Robespierre, etc. <br /> <br /> In fact, the script was weak (adapted from “Danton”) And yet, the direction was masterful .. This is woad, after all! In addition, there were some amazing actors, BUT they never attracted the attention of the audience as they should. Depardieu looks like a quasi-blunt, careless Danton ... not exactly the image we mean. Woijech Pzsoniak, as usual, is incredible, but, again, the script sets limits, even actors with great talent cannot break. Andrzej Severin and Bogoslav Linda appear ... as Bourdon and Saint-Just ... and if you are familiar with Waida, you will recognize them. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was disappointed with this commendable film. Excellent cast, great director, but without a quality foundation. Bad, non-dynamic scenario. We need to enter into the mindset of Danton (Walesa) and Robespierre (General J.) ... what are their motives? Eh ... who knows? One loves women, another powders himself? Riiight. So if you are looking for a great film about the French Revolution, I STRONGLY recommend "La Revolution Francaise" ... it consists of two parts and, oh, so great! Excellent performance, deep script, juicy bits ... definitely a pleasant experience !! Klaus-Maria Brandauer is much better than Danton than Depardieu ... the wonderful Andrzej Severin seems to have taken some notes from Danton and is DIAMOND, like Robespierre. SEE THIS! NOW! As for Wyda fans, you are better off with Iron Man / Marble, Promised Land and the like. Hooray !!
