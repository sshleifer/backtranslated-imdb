Dr. Mulholland's medical history It is well known that what was supposed to be another excursion (after Twin Peaks) to the competing field of the series suddenly ended after the completion of the pilot project. It was too risky and distorted for manufacturers to risk investment. Lynch used all the footage and cut material and began a new shoot to complete a whole new feature film. The result: one of the most impressive cinematic events of this decade, which can be attributed to the best works of David Lynch. His earlier films “Eraserhead”, “Blue Velvet” or “Wild at Heart” were kept annoying in an annoying way that pushed the viewer into the role of voyeurist, but never attracted him to participate in the current story, such as here. /> <br /> “Dr. Mulholland” is a puzzle where the pieces are missing, others were obviously taken from “Eraserhead” and “Lost Highway”, but it never seemed to be a work in progress. On the Internet, I stumbled upon many instructions and essays to explain this film. Now I realize that he loses his magic when you try to decipher it completely. All these detailed explanations of the decision are not only a waste of time, but also a questionable attempt to give an answer when such a thing is not completely required. Imagine such a scenario: a small child cuts through his teddy bear to find out what the secret and features of this bear are. Is it because he wants to destroy his toy? Is the secret in a teddy bear or is it really in the heart of a child? By conveying this “Dr. Mulholland,” this means that innocence is one of the most important conditions to observe and appreciate. <br /> <br /> David Lynch can not only imagine the surface of human life, but also deal with everything under it. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - all that remains unspoken; emotions that are often suppressed. "Dr. Mulholland" has an intensity calling for a throw that completely matters with the substance. Actresses and actors who are willing to faithfully follow the visions of the director. Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux solve their task so impressively that you do not want or can not imagine another cast. Although their action at first seems a bit superimposed, you will soon realize that this stereo-typing is set to manipulate the viewer and confuse him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible. <br /> <br /> When you say that a criterion for a well-made movie is the ability to lose yourself and immerse yourself in what you see on the screen, Lynch managed to make a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that demonstrates the status of David Lynch as one of the most important, creative, and bold directors of modern times. Like any director that goes beyond, he faces criticism and ignorance. This will disappear as soon as you find the individual key to the world of Lynch films. "Dr. Mulholland" is more than just sleeping ?? This is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. And besides, the film pays off by Hollywood in form and content, which was hardly ever decided before.
