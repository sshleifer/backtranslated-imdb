I first saw it a few nights ago on TV. I expected to tune in for only a few minutes, but I was intrigued by the film. In the end, I looked at all this and found it surprisingly convincing. The game by the three American leaders was pretty good, especially Alex Cord. He plays a shooter with a significant degree of vulnerability. Very different from how most of them are depicted in westerns. He got into several situations when he was at the mercy of bounty hunters. The final shootout between the three leading and bad guys was very good, as was the scene where the doctor digs a bullet from Clay McCord. Somewhat awful, but realistic. I have to admit that, despite my initial concerns about watching a “spaghetti western,” I eventually enjoyed this film. I would recommend it to anyone who loves westerns.
