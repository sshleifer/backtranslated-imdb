The combination of narcotic humor of the 70s, along with a parody of medicine and a classic storyline. As I have often said about this click - if you donâ€™t understand - you are so lame ..... Classic lines, such as (paraphrased) I do. Are you a nurse, what can you give me for this? "The nurse replies:" All I have is $ 5 and my wedding ring ... "Excellent sound track. The classic "Haida has nothing to hide." Surprisingly close to the original story - not that the original interfered with the joke ..... I did not meet anyone with an IQ above 115, who did not consider it hysterical. <br /> <br />
