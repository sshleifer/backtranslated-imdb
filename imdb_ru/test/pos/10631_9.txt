As with all Haneke movies, make your own decision - do not be influenced by what you read, and if you are interested in someone using cinema for their own unique purposes, see for yourself. In this film, Isabel Huppert is staggering - in combination with Haneke, these two never make a fist. Haneke reels us on the lure of the golden boy, Benoit Magimel, but this is anti-romance as much as the Fun games were anti-thrillers. You will have to force yourself to watch most of this, and the catharsis is more in the range of prolonged anxiety than any emotional release, but it is incredibly nervous and makes you wonder; Haneke continues to show how desensitized Western civilization. People can raise their noses on it, but it only does what Solonds did in Happiness, a few steps further. Based on reality, much of what Erica (Huppert) does can be seen as an emotional metaphor. I do not recommend it, but I would not dissuade you ... it definitely divides people, but considering that mostly repressions are not surprising.
