This movie is great. The film of the vile 80s slasher about three children born during an eclipse, so they kill everyone they see. The reason they kill is almost meaningless, but only adds charm to this film. And hell, these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. If you've seen the movie, you know who I'm talking about. This baby is vicious! Although the film does not have much blood, it is interesting, and for some reason you care about the characters. It also has some good nudity. He also has a decent acting game, a really decent 80s film slasher, worth seeing if you ever get the chance to see him. You will have nightmares about these damn children, although I guarantee you!
