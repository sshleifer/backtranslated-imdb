Lovingly created and terribly interesting to watch Garfield's sandy, breakthrough performance (representing a new kind of rebellious acting style that will take on Brandos and Clifts and so on after the war), but all this sisterly affection suffocates a little. Priscilla Lane is a bright, attractive performer, but the other sisters are not actually registered (although they can all be tart and witty), and it was just difficult for me to buy any of the other male characters except Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a pleasant enough actor, but he lacks the weight of a movie star to match Garfield's luck, Mickey Borden, and this is a bit confusing to the film. (Imagine Jimmy Stewart or someone else from this role.) In addition, I was not sure that Garfield would make the decisive (at least) final decision that he made. It took the film another half hour to better explain this action; he feels terribly in a hurry and not motivated enough. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is not difficult to understand how anyone who grew up with this picture would remember it with love. This is not a classic, but contains a few classic moments. Two scenes of swinging the gate - pure magic of cinema.
