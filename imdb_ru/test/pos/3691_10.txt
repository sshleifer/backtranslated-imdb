What a shame this film has never been released. (Now he plays by cable.) I tuned in, based on high respect for the stars, and was rewarded when I saw the movie much better than the ones I paid to watch in theaters lately. I like to be surprised. So often, films are sold as “unusual”, but in reality they are all the same old, recycled crap. This movie is really different, with the bonus of a heart message. Jonathan Price sings like an angel. Despite the fact that the plot requires that he sang some of the darkest-sentimental songs ever written, he does them so well that no one objects. Kathy Bates and Rupert Everett are well-played and superb, but a newcomer in the role of daughter-in-law Kathy Bates steals every scene she is in. Give this film a chance.
