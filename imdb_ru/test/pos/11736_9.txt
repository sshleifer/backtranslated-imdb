I have always loved this prickly voiced guy in all these westerns. He was an assistant (Jingles) in the Wild Bill Hickok show back in the fifties. In this, he has the perfect vehicle for his remarkable boasting character. He is harmless, and no one believes him, but he is not agitated and still continues. When you have such a guy, there is no problem, because the details have nothing to argue with. Of course, in this episode, he was taken aboard a spacecraft by a group of aliens who have no sense of humor and believe everything they hear. They do not have the word lies in their dictionaries. It turns out that he is so unbearable that they cannot cope with it; and then, of course, there is a secret weapon. Look at this to look at Andy.
