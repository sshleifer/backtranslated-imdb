He carries the tone of voice that tells the story of a book in the jungles of Vietnam and the wild look of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and into the mystical pain surrounding Colonel Kurtz. (I don’t say Marlon Brando, because after watching the documentary, Hearts of Darkness, I’m skeptical about how much Brando deserves for this quality). The tone of the voice I'm talking about is thoughtful and dramatic, not being overbearing: “Everyone gets what they want. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one. They sent her to room service. ” This is indulgent, without being narrow and alienated. A good example is Hopper's indulgence in aphoristic madness, generously laying down lines written by TS. Eliot and Rudyard Kipling in their stone monologues: “I mean, what is a man of genius? Sometimes he will pass you by without even saying a word, and sometimes he will grab you by the collar and say, “Do you know that“ if ”is the average word in“ life ”- if you can keep your head while everything is you lose yours, "and then" I mean that he is a sage, he is a great man; I had to be a pair of torn claws rushing along the floor of the quiet sea "(the first is Kipling, the second is Eliot.
