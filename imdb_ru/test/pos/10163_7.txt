Hitchcock's remake of his 1934 film about McKenna’s famous marriage history (James Stewart, Doris Day, in the first version of Leslie Banks, Edna Best) along with their 11-year-old son traveling to Morocco during the holidays. On the bus, they know a sympathetic Frenchman (Daniel Geleen, in the old version of Pierre Fresnet). While they are in Marrakesh, they also know a couple (Bernard Miles and Brenda de Banzi) and occur suddenly at the scene of the murder, the dying one whispers a political message. Then the child is kidnapped to ensure their silence, and McKenna is assisted by Morocco by Inspector Buchanan (Ralph Truman). <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film about a family that came across an obscure international conspiracy, and then they were forced to take part in a film in which James Stewart and Doris Day excellently played. This exciting film features tension, intrigue, tension, and interesting drama, well written by John Michael Hayes and Charles Bennett. Pack the usual theme of an insecure mage: innocent people find themselves embroiled in a web intrigue and strange, intelligent villains. Colorful and brilliant cinematographic filming, shot in film studios in Morocco and London by cameraman Robert Burks, but with excessive transparency for scenes in Marrakesh. Generous sets of Henry Banstead, the usual Hitchcock, and worked until his recent death. Of course, the highlights are the events of the famous murder at the Royal Albert Hall in London, when the mocking killer Reggie Nalder tries to execute while the composer Bernard Herrmann leads the orchestra. In addition, at the climax Doris Day sings “Que sera, Que sera”, while her son suffers from risks, the song received an Oscar for Ray Evans, Jay Livingstone. The story has been brutally revised for her double characters, but today is considered a classic film and quite interesting. Rating: Better than average, Hitchcock enthusiast will surely enjoy.
