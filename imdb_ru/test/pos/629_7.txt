I enjoyed playing in this movie. Except for the sister. She reminded me of Janice about her friends. I could never believe that she was anything other than the opposite. <br /> <br /> My main problems in the film were the anti-climatic finale and the scene of execution with my sister and son-in-law. Is the guy falling out of an exploding car? Maybe if his hand was blown away, and he ran to the dumb for help, and she kissed him and took him to the hospital, perhaps then I could go to the final. I think someone should have died on the execution scene. Mostly son-in-law. In any case, he was such a pain in the ass. Or maybe the sister had to accidentally kill the guy who saved the German. I could even buy a son-in-law who killed the hero, and as a result, the two sisters were shot in snuff films. <br /> <br /> Worth looking again, and, as I always say, itâ€™s much easier to be a reviewer, not an author.
