This is an exciting story that borrows elements from the Kennedy assassination and successfully uses them to create a superb western story. <br /> <br /> The film has a good musical score, although the title theme is slightly repeated. bust Giuliano Gemma and the rest of the cast are great. This is more valuable than usual spaghetti westerns that rely more on the story than on the action, and this succeeds because the story is great. This does not mean that there is no action in the film. There is a lot and it is very well processed. This film draws you to itself and holds you to the end. You will always be wondering what is in all these documents after. It also has some sharp comments on American politics. <br /> <br /> This film shows why Valery, in my opinion, is connected in three respects with Sollima and Korbuchchi for second place in the rating of Western directors of spaghetti.
