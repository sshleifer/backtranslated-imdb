Roscoe's “Fat Man” Arbuckle’s comedy was best remembered for the fact that young Buster Keaton debuted in her debut in the cinema, having just parted with the rude actor of his family in Vaudeville. Baster plays a fairly significant role in this film, and in general he is quite funny. The Butcher Boy laughs a lot and is an example of a well-made old-fashioned farce, although it seems to come from the short era of two-drum comedies, when filmmakers still presented themselves in single-drum segments as Sure. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film takes place in a general store where Arbuckle plays the role of a butcher boy. It is an excuse to use the myriad opportunities for fast physical humor that the one-stop shop provides, and Arbuckle really shows himself as an acrobat weighing 300 pounds, demonstrating subtlety, skill and grace in his performance of what may have been an unremarkable routine exercise which raise them to another level. Because of the gag, he accidentally clicks a large butcher knife so that it accurately rotates in the correct position inserted into the cutting board, and I am still stunned that Arbuckle really seems to do this every time. There is also a really good gag that sees him lean on his scales and not understand why his pieces of meat weigh so much. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is a boy who comes to buy molasses and acts deftly in the foot routine to the floor that follows. In addition to the strange and almost alarming half-smile, his peculiar attitude and body language make him immediately recognizable as the Buster we know. He even has in the end his trademarked flat hat - here for the first time destroyed when it is filled, of course, with molasses. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film shifts to a comedy based on the situation, and Arbuckle and his rival Al Saint John dress up in a dress to enter the Fat Girlfriend’s boarding school. Much of the humor also comes from the generally surrealistic and mysteriously laughable gaze of these two strange guys, dressed in dredge and trying to "be girls." Buster is also in this segment, but mostly stands there in a random cutting, helping St. John <br /> <br /> The Butcher’s ending gets a little crazy, but in general and beyond. interest of historical curiosity, this is a well-made comedy that gets just a mad laugh to which it aspires.
