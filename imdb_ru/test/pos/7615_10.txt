I saw it when he first came out and saw it several times since. I have a DVD. This is one of the best works of Drew Barrymore, which is worth seeing more than once. <br /> <br /> Unpopularity in high school was one of those things in the film that I could relate to. I was not as tortured as Josie (in her real school years) or as Aldis, but I was never an idiot. On the prom scene, three popular girls became victims of their own joke, as Josie pushes Aldi (the alleged victim) to my favorite scene, and I clapped my hands when I first saw her. <br /> <br /> I can still watch this movie today. it is excellent.
