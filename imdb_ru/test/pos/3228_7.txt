Gilmore girls about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 years old. Now daughters are 16 years old (in the first season), and they live like sisters. We share everything, we completely trust each other. <br /> <br /> I like The Gilmore Girls, but I donâ€™t know why. A mother named Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and a daughter named Rory (short for Lorelai, played by Alexis Bledel) are very beautiful women, they are both funny and adorable in their own way. There are some funny characters like Luke (Scott Patterson). He and Lorelai love each other, they may even love each other, but none of them really acts on it. They have their little moments. There are other minor characters, most of them very funny, and with their winning touching moments. <br /> <br /> Most of all I like, I think, to see the relationship between a young mother and daughter, who becomes an adult. The dialogue between them is quick, sharp, cheerful, and sometimes touching. They have a great group. Gilmore Girls makes you feel good, so try it.
