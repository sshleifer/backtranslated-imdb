I know that in order to include everything in the book, the film had to last several hours, so I think they did their best to include things that were crucial for the story. I thought that the casting was great, the children who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the guy who played Amira as an adult was great! The scenes between him and Baba were especially touching. I thought the places they used were interesting ... the scenes filmed in Afghanistan were filmed in China, and one scene that took place in Fremont, California (graduation scene) was actually filmed on Treasure Island in San Francisco. I once worked on Kite Runner, and it was that day, the day they were shooting the graduation scene. In the morning we reported on Treasure Island, they checked everyone's wardrobe to make sure it looked like the end of the 80s, and then we took our seats in the audience. They shot the scene again and again, until they were happy with it. It was great to see the actors closer, and also to see the author of the book, who was a history consultant. I thought this book was excellent, and I recommend both the book and the film to everyone. This is a touching story of friendship, love, guilt, and possible atonement. "There is a way to be good again."
