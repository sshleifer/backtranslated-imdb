in this movie there is a great chase scene, if you listen to the soundtrack, when the cars chase each other, it is very similar to the soundtrack from the movie, you will hear a shift at 4 speeds, and they will show the brake pedal in Roy Schneider's car, this is an automatic brake pedal! I think that one of the funniest moments in the film is when the bad guy Richard Lynch looks at the driver of the car in which they are, as if the guy is crazy! ........ the crook who runs the garage is also the guy who in Rocky's first movie, Rocky's boss. good film! also, when the door is torn down, you can see the guy sitting in the car, who just flings the door open, the guy who helps him out of the car looks like Mr. Brady from the Brady group, isn't he?
