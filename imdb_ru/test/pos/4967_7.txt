Its attractiveness lies in the fact that, although there is nothing special about it, it creates an intriguing atmosphere, and because Ida Lupino and Howard Duff (at that time a real man and wife) demonstrate attractive, restrained chemistry. Lupino plays a woman engaged to a house on a huge Californian manor, whose previous caretaker, Jennifer, has disappeared and disappeared. (Shades of Jack Nicholson in Shine, although in this case it is not Lupino who goes crazy or goes crazy). Duff - the guy in the city who manages the finances of the estate and takes Lupino, who decides to play with all his might. She is becoming more and more involved, not to mention obsession, with what happened to her predecessor in an old dark house full of descending stairs and locked cellars. The atmosphere and the romantic game are the best part of the film, as the audience will most likely find a resolution of a little disappointment - there is nothing special about it (except for the small freezons in the tail section waiting for Brian). Movie de Palma). But it is well done, and, again, it remains with you. An additional added attraction: this is the film that introduced the song "Angel Eyes", which will become part of the standard repertoire of Ol 'Blue Eyes.
