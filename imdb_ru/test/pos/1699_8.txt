This film is not as bad as some people say that in fact, in my opinion, it is more pleasant than the original. maybe that's why some people hate it so much because they don't want to admit that this is a good (not great) movie. <br /> <br /> most if not all fx were made by CGI, which I didn’t mind at all, because it was a nice movie. Phil Backman - (Chris) was, in my opinion, the best guy in the movie. Julie Delpy was quite attractive, she brought sexuality to the film. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of tricks in the film that I thought were good. This film is in my collection, but the original is not due to the fact that I do not like it as much as this one. I was not bored when I watched this film, it made me watch, unlike some horror films, which I could mention as, say, “Driller's Killer” and “Suspiria” (Dario Argento film). This is a good film about werewolves, it should be in the collection of people, if they like films about werewolves, maybe I'll ever get the original. I have only one complaint, and this is Phil Backman - (Chris) was supposed to be more in him than he was, but apart from that the film was fine. <br /> <br /> This movie's rating is an 8/10 good werewolf movie is not the worst. <br /> <br />
