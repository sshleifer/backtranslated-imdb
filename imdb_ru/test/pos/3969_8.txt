Adopted 2006 film for teens, which is shot in commercials for Mac and Mac computers. The film about Bartelby .B. He gets a guy who refused all the colleges for which he applied, so he decides to create his own college and invites all other people who have not done so, the problem is that hundreds of people sign up for his school. The film is funny, and I was lucky to buy it for $ 5 on sale, and since then I have always watched it. In general, this film is a must-see for fans of all comedies, as it is funny, witty and just a good movie. I rate this movie very fairly 78%. WE'RE GOING TO ACCEPT THE MAKING OF THE FOLLOWING GUYS, BUT PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT IS NOT A HORSE.
