It was a great movie. Something not only for the Black History month, but also as a reminder of the kindness of people and the statement that it is really necessary for the village to raise a child. The performances of S Eptath were outstanding. Mos Def and his singing off the hook. I had to double double when I saw that Rosie Perez was there. But the cast of actors and actresses made it worthy of attention. All the different stories they had were amazing. And as the nurse protected the younger and literally everyone else who was in her presence. I really can understand that she was a matriarch of that time, and even more so as she was tired of helping everyone. I can not wait for his release on DVD. This would be a welcome addition to any movie library.
