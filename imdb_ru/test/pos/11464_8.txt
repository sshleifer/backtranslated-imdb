Demons' Night is a great movie and a great example of how good a low-budget movie can be. Of course, much of this is quite predictable, but somehow it is still much nicer than the shit that we see these days as “Horror”. I give blood a hard number 9, and the one-line Demons are really funny. I'm still scared "Stop looking at me!" The soundtrack is well done, I was surprised to hear "Stigmata Martyr" from Bauhaus! There are also some great T & A, as well as some great makeup effects. The second film in the series is also pretty good, but avoid the worst third. The Night of the Demons may be outdated, dark and low, but it still has a lot of potential. It is definitely worth renting, at least. Give him a chance tonight, just stay away from any old makeup! (you will understand when you see this!)
