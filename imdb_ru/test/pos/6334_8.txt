This is a good episode, but it's not my favorite. Many people like it, and on a creative level this is great. Most of the episode has no dialogue, which is such a cool idea, and “Silence” copes with silence very well. Plus, this episode introduces Tara, which I really like. But I don’t like Riley, Intimitive, or Maggie Walsh, and they seem to get a lot of screen time in Hush. Besides, I don't think that gentlemen are so scary, and I'm tired of watching the voyage around Sunnydale. I know that I am in the minority, but I tend to rewind "Hush." Of course, there are other episodes that I think are great, so if you are watching a DVD, I recommend watching this episode. This is really a classic. <br /> <br /> “Silence” revolves around the whole city, losing its votes. Demonic guys appeared in the skeleton named Gentlemen arrive to collect seven hearts from human victims, but if they hear a human cry, they die. So they steal the voices of everyone in the city. Buffy and Scooby are trying to figure out what's going on, while Initative is also starting an investigation. Meanwhile, Xander understands how much Anya means to him, and Willow meets the same witch named Tara. Buffy and Riley are finally fighting the gentlemen face to face. They are both stunned by what they find out ... He is a commando, and she is a Killer. In the end, Buffy saves the day, but now she has to deal with her new knowledge of Riley's secret life. <br /> <br /> Indeed, creativity “Hush” cannot be seen in general terms of its plot. This is the overwhelming silence of the episode, which makes it so wonderful. The characters try to communicate differently (boards with boards, pantomime, obscene finger gestures, etc.), and it all works very well. After a while, you forget that there is no dialogue, because they all express their thoughts so well. During the “talking” parts of the episode, there are many references to the importance of truly “hearing” each other. Anya claims that Xander will not talk to her. Giles ignores Spike and Xander’s protests and insists that Spike move to Xander’s apartment. Buffy quickly replaces the word “oil” with “patrols” when she talks to Riley so she doesn't have to explain her vocation. And then, at the end, when Buffy and Riley really learn the truth about each other, they sit there, they have nothing to say. Everything is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good parts in this episode. I like that people constantly forget that they can't talk. Buffy and Xander both try to use the phone. Riley cannot use the elevator's voice recognition feature. People try to scream. This is basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no speech. And I think it's funny that Spike should move in with Xander. (They will also be living in an apartment in the seventh season.) Xander and Spike have a funny fight, which is just fun. I also like the start of the Tara-Willow relationship. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the show, and she and Willow are pretty sweet together. Nice to see that they are just starting. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I do not understand how gentlemen choose their victims. It seems they are just swimming in the dorms and choosing random people. Besides, I don't like Riley. I never liked him, but from the moment “Hush” I’m just waiting for the Angel to return to the city and beat him. Finally, what happens to Olivia after this? It seems that we just met her, she has a relationship with Giles, everything is going well ... and then she suddenly fell. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the episode: "Who are the gentlemen?" lecture for the scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful, and its guards are just funny. He makes several similar cards in the seventh season of the “First Date”. Almost every time Giles starts drawing monsters, it will be fun.
