This film is more interesting for me and my wife than all films about violent thrillers / mysteries / murders that are full of blocks. It's about real people making the best out of their lives. They are just Indians, and the main characters in law enforcement. Realistic play and gorgeous decorations more than compensate for a slightly implausible plot. The soundtrack belongs to BC Smith, who also made the soundtrack for Coyote Waits, which is great. Adam Beach plays a policeman from the tribe who is a little prone to accidents, and Wes Studi is a truly professional detective. Graham Green, Tantoo Cardinal, etc. There are many other good roles, both in the supporting role and in the cameo. We also saw Coyote Waits, another adaptation of Hillermanâ€™s novel, and we also enjoyed it.
