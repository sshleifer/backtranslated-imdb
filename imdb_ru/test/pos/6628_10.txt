Bergman's story about how a hell of war can bring a sensible pair of musicians to barbarism. With a large number of memorable scenes in the film, I found that it is particularly noteworthy that near the end, where Ulman and Von Sidou get in a boat, completely surrounded by the corpses of soldiers swimming in the sea. A fascinating masterpiece!
