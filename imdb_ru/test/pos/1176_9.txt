I was completely surprised at how good this film really is, because when I first saw it, I was only slightly surprised! I must say, however, that I am still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor was not given a big and better role! He was a great talent. <br /> <br /> There is excellent chemistry among all the main actors, and Mattau was never funnier. <br /> <br /> I am very pleased that this picture was made because we see Lemmon and Mattau unite for the last time; in a vehicle that allows you to use their talent. Brent Spiner argues that Star Trek's Next Geeration Data is not the only good character he can play. <br /> <br /> The storyline is really quite simple, but the comedy and characters work very well, and I laughed heartily throughout this movie, and I highly recommend it.
