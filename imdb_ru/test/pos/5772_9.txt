This crazy film competes with Phantom and Mr. Chicken as one of Don Nott's best performances. Notts is an accountant for the municipality of Podunka, which is good for deceiving citizens. They dismiss "three competent accountants and keep stupid" (Nodes, of course, stupid). When his garbage collection cohort accidentally empty the wrong trash can, Notts finds himself in a strange trap set by the city council for him. Funny moments in the film include the restroom scene of Bowling Alley, and the cemetery scene is absolutely funny. Typical Nodes, the nervous act of a nanny is well used, and, as usual, he is surrounded by many crazy characters from the sixties. Actors like Frank Welker and Pitt Herbert add to the chaos. As one would expect, Notts is armed with a large machine, a beautiful girl and has no idea what he is doing. Fun for everyone, especially for lovers of nostalgia, but almost everyone will like it.
