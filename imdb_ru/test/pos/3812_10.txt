Let's start with this: this is not a film intended for a wide audience. Absolutely strange, incomprehensible, completely unpredictable, it simply makes you look at the screen, trying to understand what will happen next. If this in itself does not allow you to agree that this is a great movie, return to your "family" films and forget about MOTORAMA. He has material that can be considered a cult film, it can be classified in the same category as films that won awards at Cannes or other intellectual film festivals, but unfortunately Hollywood is already empty, if forgotten, simply because not commercial. The performance of young Jordan Christopher Michael may not be Oscar material, but he gives the right touch to the story. Even the genre is hard to describe; it's not a comedy in the proper sense, you don't know if you should laugh at the weird situations Gus is involved in. It’s more like an impossible adventure that some children may want to have, but don’t let them watch it either ... it’s not a movie for children. So, if you like Disney movies or you are looking for “Home Alone”, this one is definitely not for you. But if you like to read Edgar Allan Poe or the works of Tim Burton, then you will like the Motorrama. So, jump into your red mustang, get a tattoo with the inscription "Torah" and go on a cruise on the Strange Land with Gus. I would like that ...
