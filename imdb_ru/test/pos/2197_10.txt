I own this video, as well as the live version of the musical with Patti Lupone and George Hearn with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. George Hearn is great in my book, as is Angela Lansbury and the composer Stephen Sondheim. This musical is operative in terms of volume and shows a lot of ingenuity in composition. I certainly hope that this VHS will become available on DVD! Hirn's performance is frighteningly responsive. One annoying performance is a young woman who sings the role of Joanne. I believe that this performance was in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, and not on the Broadway stage, and I am not sure that the minimalist set was used in New York as it was in this production. But I found that the forests that drag across the stage are very effective to “portray” the streets of London. I highly recommend this movie.
