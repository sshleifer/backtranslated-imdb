The stolen cargo of Mexican viagra Vigoroso; a beautiful girl who is trying to restore her life and leave her husband, the boss of the Italian mafia; a young sheriff who falls in love with his old sweetheart. This is the plot of "Shipment", a country comedy located in the small town of Paradise, Arizona. Despite its simple and classic story, the film (directed by Alex Wright) has funny moments: when Elizabeth Berkley (as Candy Porter), looking at Vigoroso’s green pill, says, “What is this? Mint candy? ". Or when a girl enters the sheriff's house and finds him completely naked. Or when the Vigoroso part ends at THIS lake, in the final sequence ... the cast offers some good performances: Matthew Modine as the sheriff of Paradise Valley, who still loves his old girlfriend; and Elizabeth Berkeley, whose character still loves her old boyfriend ... The cast, including Nicholas Turturro, Paul Rodriguez (like Jose Mexican) and J. Michael Gray (what kind of teeth ...) makes the work enjoyable too. Not Oscar stuff, but not so bad. Merry comedy without claims.
