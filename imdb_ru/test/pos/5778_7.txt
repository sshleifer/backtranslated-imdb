Well, the one who likes to travel on the highway at a speed of 120 km / h, there is McDonalds, control the air conditioner twenty-four seven and watch non-stop Fox News, I found this documentary interesting. One thing that I brought up when they talk about North America, I guess this documentary was Fabrique Au Canadie. For a Canadian beating, I'll leave it to Bill O'Reilly. <br /> <br /> The consequences of oil depletion will affect everyone, especially those living in the major countries of Australia, Canada and the United States. I am sure that the “Green World” no longer applauds, which means that there are no more SUVs, not realizing that people living in sub-zero temperatures may die of starvation. <br /> <br /> As a person who has studied economics, I know for sure that we live in a world of limited resources. I will give the documentary details for trying to provide a balanced view on the depletion of oil reserves. However, I am studying a degree in journalism, this documentary is full of loaded messages - Republicans as the instigators of war. What the Democrats did not send troops to Vietnam? <br /> <br /> If you are going to present a documentary about the economy and resources, it is best to leave the political fight aside, because this may lead to the fact that the potential viewer is completely closed. Concentrate on the problem of limited resources. In the end, it is best to open the minds of the mainstream, as this is not a good sermon to a tiny choir. <br /> <br /> I really like watching documentaries such as Fahrenheit 911 and End of the Suburbs, not for their political bias, because they remind us that the world is not so safe. Of course, I like shopping, and consumer junk food, as if tomorrow will not come, but if tomorrow is the end of the world, I would prefer to die rich and consume live sound from it. <br /> <br /> For potential documentary filmmakers, just give people the facts and let viewers form their own opinions. If you try to pack your political views into a balanced documentary, people will smell the rat a mile away.
