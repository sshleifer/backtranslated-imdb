A soft headline masks this rugged carnal example of old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment; this film proves the largely successful assembly of several disparate elements: a historical play, a romantic drama, a crime film, and a political thriller. I wonder if Fox made him the main characters ?? Robert Taylor and Barbara Stenwick were both usually associated with other studios; Their chemical composition on the screen is palpable here and in a couple of years led to marriage. Although Taylor is a bit young, he is a dashing hero (a marine, personally appointed by President McKinley, to uncover the culprits of the organized cleansing of numerous banks); no wonder that as soon as he sought them out (led by sleek Brian Donlevi and bandit Viktor McLaglen), he fell in love with shantuz (of course, Stanvik), who threw her fate in a gang ?? although, in truth, singing is far from the strong point of the actress! In the same way, apart from the need to prove his worth in order to turn them into his own ranks, he must compete with McLaughlan for the attention of Stanvik; By the way, the practical persona from the joker reminded me a lot of Charlie Chase in Sons of the Desert (1933), which was also directed, by the way, by William A. Zeiter. Later, Taylor thinks about getting Stanwick involved in the impending bait, and trying to resign the president by running away with the girl ?? but a jealous opponent violates his plans. The robbery went awry, we find Donlevi dead and two others in prison; Hope Taylor on McKinley's intervention ?? in the meantime, having learned the identity of the elusive and clearly outstanding “inner man” ?? seem overwhelmed when the president ends up killing himself (a big plot twist, although as a result the wait for the eleventh hour seems far-fetched)! To return to mixing movie styles, even if vaudeville episodes are a matter of taste, a romantic triangle slows down the course of events and somewhat scares in the aspect of a thriller, does it really create a beautiful performance ?? with the actors already mentioned, skilfully supported by people like John Carradine (who, for inexplicable reasons, disappears after only one scene!), Douglas Fowley, Sig Roomann and, as two American presidents, Sydney Blackmer (sparkling Theodore Roosevelt) and Frank Conroy (McKinley),
