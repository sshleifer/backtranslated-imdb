Personally, I can only agree with Stefan-12: indulge. It makes no sense to try to "capture" this film. I like movies where nothing (obviously) happens. “Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes” of the Duke has the same nothingness, although this film is less convincing, since the climaxes are more likely at the beginning of the story, so the Duke had to focus on nature against Kinski. Morte a Venezia is completely different, although it has several climaxes, turns, etc. In fact, since Ashenbach’s baggage has been lost, the film almost “rushes” to its grand finale (its last grains begin to pass through the hourglass after a moment of bliss, where he wants to warn the Polish family and stroke Tadzio's hair). <br /> <br /> In this, you can find real clues / symbols (his attempt to leave) behind his luggage from the moment of his arrival, indicating Tadzio at the end, the fact that, in general, the content and form of the film completely coincide) but there is no point in doing this: it will not make the film better or worse, because its strength lies in the deep plot of the plot, which is never made explicit. Tons of history, a decaying Europe, the end of the "romantic era", as we learned it, which turned out to be only its beginning (some emotions and expression are more important than ever). But wait, now I myself begin to develop one small (tiny) drawback of the film: “Let's talk about art” - parts. Now there is one thing to never do. I myself believe that this could be expressed in other ways. In addition, I believe that this will become clear in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not like candid films. I can read books, so I don’t need a storyline that just talks about my rationale. I prefer films that you cannot explain in words, but only in films (“Lost Lynch Highway”, “Weyr Picnic” in “Hanging Rock” and “Rug Man Who Fell to Earth” also belong to this category), at that time and only then does he have a reason to exist as a film, and not just as a book. So what about the Thomas Mann novel? I never read it, but I forget about it! The film gives a different perspective: it says what you can never say in a book. He uses cinema art to make you feel the same as Mann through text and music using text. No less brilliant, but different worlds.
