I like the trendy format that Chris Guest and the team have developed over the years. I actually like this and Waiting for Guffman is better than Spinal Tap, who was first in the group (and made by Rob Reiner, but starred in Gest and several of his regular regulars). This humor is not for everyone. It is rather thin and not too physical, so some people may not have a relationship. However, as a dog lover (and show fan), I loved this film. There are so many funny lines in it! My daughter and I often quote them to each other. I find it striking that these people can add so much fun material to each movie! What a fun bunch they should be. I highly recommend this to people who prefer humor on the cerebral side.
