By the end of his career, Jack Arnold, a very effective director, presented us with such classic features of the 50s as “It came from space”, “The Creature from the Black Lagoon” and “Tarantula”, united with the former football star Headliner of the Blacksplay movie 70s Fred "The Hammer" Williamson made a couple of films in which they shot a sweet, though unremarkable western "Black Bounty Hunter" and this refreshingly fresh, clever and very exciting version of the 70s black movie s. untidy private detective yarn. <br /> <br /> Williamson demonstrates a charming combination of dry, self-deprecating humor and relaxed, calm self-confidence, like Shep Stone, cheap, friendly and forever in the debt of a former Los Angeles police officer became a private investigator. Stone earns so much money that he uses the bar as his office and barely makes ends meet by doing small things with penny-ante that the police don't want to mess with. Knocking on the asphalt for one of these deceptively simple speeches (Stone tries to find an escaped teenage daughter hiding somewhere in Hollywood), Stone finds himself deep in his elbow in a complex, dangerous, seemingly bottomless criminal plot that includes a deceived Jesus freak Religious cult, assorted Fly hippie dopers, dirty porn ring, priceless missing reed gold tips that belonged to the legendary silent movie star, vile underground drug smuggling operation, and constantly growing number of fresh dead bodies. <br /> <br /> Although he lacks the angry, playful, mischievous inventiveness of Robert Altman’s “Long Farewell” or the steady, unremitting pessimism of Arthur Penn’s Dark Eyes, the Black Eye, however , still makes the evaluation very high. successful Hip'n'flip 70s rotation on the 40th secret unknown thrillers. Arnold's able direction keeps the pace going in a good, steady clip, accented by sporadic exciting battle scenes with bare fists Mano-a-Mano and the excellent use of various colorfully seedy locations in Los Angeles (abandoned abandoned amusement park at the end of the film is especially effective), Mark Haggard and Jim Martin contains quite a lot of quite complex and often truly amazing plot twists. And the expected number of bizarre, rude minor characters is an interesting weird bunch, with Rosemary Forsyth especially noticeable twists as an attractive, influential owner of a lesbian modeling agency (Forsyth has the best line of the picture, showing off to Stone when she first meets him, “I am a big woman”) , Theresa Graves from the TV series “Get Christie Love”, known as Stone’s faithful bisexual girlfriend (a random, non-judgmental description of the film for both the unconventional femme fatale and Graves pichnaya gal Friday is one of the strongest assets), and Bret Morrison, who did the voice of "The Shadow" radio stations in the 40s as a smug sleazy porn filmmaker. In general, it is a modest but sure winner.
