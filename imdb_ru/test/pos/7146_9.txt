This film was recommended to me by the same person who blessed me with a copy of The Chronicles of Narnia. Shadowlands is one of the most amazing scripts ever written. It is well executed, acted and directed. The cinematography for my taste is a bit dark, but Iâ€™m sure it was intended. The script is similar to poetry in some parts of the film, and throughout the film I thought about the comments just made on the screen. This is a wonderful part of the movie, and I can only hope that more people will run around it and add reviews. Honest warning, although it was a film of 6 fabrics for me. Very dramatic. Very emotional performances.
