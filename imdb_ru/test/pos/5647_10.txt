Kon Ichikawa survived World War II and saw how this affected his people in Japan. But so did the writer Shohei Ooka, whose book served as an inspiration for Ichikawa’s film Fires on the Plain. This is a film about people in this war, or perhaps more generally in wars in general, that lose their humanity. Soldiers roaming these fields and the jungles of the Philippines in this story are almost completely hopeless, if not already this. This makes the Stone Platoon look like a picnic: at least they had certain things, such as food, after all. <br /> <br /> They have little or no reserves, supplies or ammunition, no backup, no feeling of something to go their own way in this battle, in which they were pushed. They cannot even get proper medical care in the hospital if they can no longer walk or have lost limbs (for example, if you have tuberculosis, you are already on the way). But it is through the prism of one soldier, private Tamura, that we get a complete sense of the futility of the war, both in its dark scenes of non-existence, boredom and decomposition, and in these flashes of intense and brutal violence. <Br /> <br /> In the movie, Tamura just wants to get medical help. This is at the very beginning, and he said to his senior officer - he is already with eyes that look away and an expression drained by years of battle - that he will die if he does not find a hospital. In fact, he does not do this, but eventually he ends up with some soldiers: first with a platoon who seems to unite his actions, but in fact he is being led by hungry cattle who just want a supply of Tamura salt, and then later with two other homeless soldiers who are part of a group that had previously been ambushed when crossing the road at night. <br /> <br /> The story is not entirely straightforward, but it doesn’t need to be. The path of Tamura in Fires on the Plain is told in vignettes, small stories, as when he encounters a deserted enemy village. Two populous people are returning for some supplies, and Tamura sneaks up on them. This is a painful scene, as we have not seen with Tamura so far that he did something right * wrong *, but he does it in this scene, not so much from evil as from fear and despair (it’s also without spoiling , as he will get a nest egg). Small scenes are created so brilliantly and with devastation, as the simple task of finding a pair of shoes that do not seem to exist. Or when Tamura, later in the film, discovers that his teeth are torn apart and fall out due to lack of complete hygiene. So much for food, the way it is. <br /> <br /> It is also worth mentioning that this is an obsessively realized film from Ichikawa, shot in a sharp black-and-white view of the fields and forests, the cinematography fills us all with black and white and hot white. Ichikawa also tries to get everything authentic from her actors, and not just emotionally, but with their exhausted appearance and expression of despair right on them. It’s as if Ichikawa wants all of them to survive in the film, as well as characters who survived in the wild; By wild, by the way, I mean cannibalism. The shock of this is twofold; Firstly, this is how a soldier at the beginning makes a joke about the food of other soldiers to Tamaura, who asks if this is true, and only in response receives the word "do not ask", and the second - with a cannibalism. Himself from a mad starving man on a hill who pulls guts from his knees and directly tells our hero: "You can eat me when I die." <br /> <br /> This makes things especially cruel when it comes to a director filming short action shots. This, I would say, is more brutal than "Private Ryan" in their images of violence in battle, a slaughterhouse that is completely random. The scene I would like to point to, which only contains a shot that is painful to watch, is when at a large angle we see a group of twenty soldiers walking slowly along, a hail of fire appears that kills only four or five, but this happens so fast, and the soldiers just keep going in the same crawling. This is not the only snapshot of a horrible slaughterhouse that is shown - when you need to bloody it, but it splashes around the screen like something completely gloomy - but this completely solves the problem. <br /> <br /> The whole action is staggering (especially Funakoshi, who looks both the most peaceful and most frightened by what he sees in the most subtle images most of the time), all the basic decorations provide something else for a terrible experience. , and it all comes down to the final question of the anti-war film: how or why do people fight in such wars? It's almost too sad to put it in words, and so Ichikawa pushes our noses straight into the dirt, mud and blood and requires us to accept it, so maybe one day it will never happen again. Or you can hope for it, by the end of such a dark and excellent film, like this one.
