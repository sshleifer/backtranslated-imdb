Hong Kong, 1920s. A young man from poor countries dreams of becoming a hero and spends most of his time practicing and studying kung fu and bodybuilding, largely against the wishes of his father. He helps a girl servant escape a ruthless businessman whose assholes pursue him, and terrorizes the uncle’s young man’s noodle restaurant. The uncle turns out to be an old, transformed Triad assassin who now helps a young guy become proficient in the martial arts. This is karate style for kids with “wash wok” instead of “wax, wax”. The kung-fu villain is the son of a ruthless businessman, who has a signature scorpion style that looks cool, although it is rather silly and, of course, completely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But the story that develops over time has an epic feeling, good characterization, excellent kung-fu, and generally very interesting. The young hero is very responsive and provides a good main character to support. Romantic dimension remains undeveloped, which is a bit disappointing. The rest is a great movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 out of 10.
