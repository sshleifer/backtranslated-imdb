Sometimes I am convinced that Mikado is the best opera by Sullivan and Gilbert, but this is only as long as I do not listen to Iolanthe. Be that as it may, Mikado is perhaps the most frequently filmed from Savoy’s operas. (Yes, I put the composer in the first place. No one says that Hammerstein and Rogers, or Hart and Rogers, or Boito and Verdi, or What-His-Face and Strauss. You have not even heard the names of librettists for Offenbach, Suppa or Balf Gilbert was just a big name (and a big ego) at the time, so they put his name in the first place. It's time to put an end to stupid practice. <br /> <br /> In any case, Mikado is the complete S & G Operetta She has some of the most memorable Sullivan numbers, in combination with some of Gilbert’s smartest texts. There is an interesting book and a lively dialogue. She has a remarkable degree of madness. And she leaves the door wide open for frilly and fancy costumes. <br /> This particular production, filmed in a live performance in 1990, turns your imagination to astonishing In the British seaside resort, near the end of the modernity period, it completely rejects the Japanese original. The result is a suit and a gentle blend of white, gray and black, accented with random pieces of red (and less frequent yellow and green). It takes some getting used to, but it is really elegant. Of course, when the choir tells you that they are gentlemen from Japan, you will be right: “Oh, fluff! Bah! ”(Did I just say that?) It's very nice that this is a great production now on DVD. However, one caveat: the footprint seems to be photographed through glass of imperfect clarity, so that the expected sharpness of the image softens and becomes slightly blurred. The trend of overlay images, alas, annoying. Why do people who make really elegant production want to spoil it with such frilly things? But productivity matters the most. We can skip the overture, since, although one of them is complete, Sullivan never wrote it. (True, it may be that he did not write one for Savoy. But the Mikado overture is not even dated by Sullivan’s lifetime and was compiled by observing the methods used in others.) As for the rest of the operetta, this is first class and highly fun. <br /> <br /> Ko-Ko here is the distinguished Eric Idle, who does it deservedly. There is a tradition of attracting a big name to a role. Many years ago in the USA there was a television show in which Ko-Ko played Groucho Marx with mixed results. The work of a slacker is delightfully quaint ... he makes "Taken from City Prison", assisted by a tennis racket. His "I have a small list" is made like a speech to a microphone - of course, it contains regular updated lyrics that are much funnier than ordinary things, and his performance is clearly hysterical. It happens everywhere. <br /> <br /> In this operetta it is important to have a good Katish; it's just not fun if you don't scream in style. This Mikado has amazing Katisha in the movie “Felicity Palmer”, almost as big as idle. She roars with the best of them in the beautiful rich contralto ... wonderful, especially for sopranos. And her costume ... !!! (Not to mention her concert with Franz Liszt, apparently accompanied by.) Nankey-Poo plays Bonaventure Bottone. I have problems with circumvention, it’s not quite a nanny-puishsky puffy shortness, but the voice is undoubtedly a solid, rich addition to the vocal palette. There is a pleasant touch during the Minstrel of Wands, where the choir reacts with disgust at the mention of “his nancy on his knees” - keep in mind Mikado’s flirting decree. Be that as it may, Bottone is an excellent singing actor, and if his appearance does not make Nankey-Pu the most successful person, his performance does. <br /> <br /> Yum Yum (Leslie Garett) and her friends are respectively beautiful and stupid. She and Bottone make beautiful duets. Pisz-Touche (Mark Richardson) plays his personality as a welter and does it very well. Poo Bach (Richard Van Allan) looks great like a stuffed shirt out of the water ... a role that was later played to death in American sitcoms (you know: arrogant butlers who are forced to serve ungrateful children are such things). Mikado (Richard Angas) is damn amazing, with an imperious voice absolutely unlike his ridiculous texts. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend that you take it as your only Mikado. Also get a good traditional production, so you can see that Gilbert intended (more or less) in terms of production. Nevertheless, I will look at this twice, and one traditional look at once. In general, this is an amazing offer, vocal and visual pleasure, with amazing overvoltage. This is a treasure DVD, with dervish-like maids, dancing bell towers and everything else. Follow the corridors with signs.
