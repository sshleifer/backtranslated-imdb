This film goes on cable from time to time, and I never watched it, thinking that it would look like Bruce Willis’s On America, with the usual banal story about American freedom, etc. But this is not so; it was a lot more! <br /> <br /> Of course, Martin Sheen is superb; (I have never seen him in a film that didn’t like, even if the script is bad because he is so talented). Kathy Bates is an overbearing mom and she works great. A real surprise is Emilio Estevez, who has not always starred in the best films, but also made this film. Please do not stereotype it from the movie "Breakfast Club"; he is much better at this, and I would like him to make more non-commercial, atypical Hollywood films. <br /> <br /> The film is realistic, as we see Emilio at home from Vietnam during Thanksgiving. Kimberly Williams is tolerable as a sister, who feels that she is “dishonored and confused” by the returning soldier, her brother; he is quite alienated from his family, and, especially at this time in US history, this story is VERY relevant. <br /> <br /> I learned a lot about post-traumatic stress, and you sincerely empathize with this character; This is not a violent, journalistic image, such as “Platoon,” but rather a study of character, which leaves us even more intrigued and concerned about the consequences of the war, especially considering the young age of soldiers who are victims. With today's violence, a movie rarely makes you sincerely sad and cry; it does it and deserves recognition.
