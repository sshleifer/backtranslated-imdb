The original “The Man Who Knew Too Much” for the first time outside the UK brought recognition to Alfred Hitchcock. Of course, one of the reasons for the recognition was that people were amazed at how Hitchcock, with such a tight budget, compared to luxury Hollywood products, was able to present so much on screen. The original film was shot in the studio. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he chose this film from all his films for rework, now Hitchcock, with an international reputation and a large Hollywood studio (Paramount), decided to see what a Man who knew too much would look like on a generous budget. It is filmed on site in Marrakesh and London and has two major international names for the box office. It was the third of four Hitchcock films about James Stewart and his only collaboration with Doris Day and her only Hitchcock film. <br /> <br /> I really wonder why Hitchcock never used Doris again. At first glance, she fits the image of a fair-haired leading lady that Hitchcock prefers. Perhaps because her useful image on the screen did not match the sophistication that Hitchcock also wanted to see in his blondes. <br /> <br /> Doris starred in one of his best roles in the film The Man Who Knew Too Much. Her best scene is when her husband, a doctor, James Stewart gives her a sedative, and then says that their son was abducted by an English couple who made friends with them in Morocco. Stuart and Day play beautifully with each other in this scene. But Doris is especially so that she registers about four different emotions at the same time. <br /> <br /> Day and Stewart are on vacation with their son Christopher Olsen in Morocco, they meet Frenchman Daniel Geleen and the aforementioned English couple Bernard Miles and Brenda DaBanzi. Gelina is stabbed in the back on the market square in Marrakesh, and he whispers a few dying words about the murder at Albert Hall in London to Stuart. Their child was kidnapped to ensure their silence. <br /> <br /> The only time I can remember a hit song came out of the Hitchcock movie. Doris actually plays a famous singer who left the stage to become a wife and mother. The song was Que Sera Sera, and I remember it well at the age of 9 years. You could not go anywhere without hearing her in 1956, she even competed with the rapidly growing Elvis Presley this year. Que Sera Sera won the Academy Award for Best Song, beating titles such as “True Love from High Society” and the title song “Around the World” in 80 days. This song has become the main theme of Doris Day until the end of her days, and she is still like that if she ever wants to come back. <br /> <br /> In fact, this song fits perfectly into the plot, as Doris sings it at a party at the embassy. at the climax. <br /> <br /> Instead of doing it with mirrors, Hitchcock filmed the scene of the murder in the real Albert Hall and, as another reviewer said, not the director, but the choreographer. At this point, you will hang in their places. <br /> <br /> This is a nice rewrite.
