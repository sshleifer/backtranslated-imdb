I am surprised by the number of negative reviews on this film. If you donâ€™t like this movie for what it is - a silly, excessive story with mobs - then you just read too much in it. This film is a classic story about a mafia wife trying to avoid the "life" and the troubles that follow her. Michelle Pfeiffer is an amazing 80s T-shirt, she is an insecure, uncomfortable mafia wife, while Matthew Modine is an anal, retentive-looking police officer who watches her. The plot is mostly predictable and enjoyable, and Mercedes Ruel steals the show as "Queen of Wives." If you are not looking for something too dynamic and complex, this film is absolutely interesting and iconic classics of the 80s. You will not be able to stop watching if you start.
