Michael Radford did a great job of putting this complex piece on the screen. He played a play with a reputation as anti-Semitism and showed us that Shakespeare knew the humanity of the Jews quite well. Radford said after the show, and I agree that Shylock is his first tragic hero, the first of his heroes, who is destroyed by a motive, obsessive need for revenge. He also quite rightly points out that the person who was an anti-Semite could not write Shylock's speech: “If you hit me, am I not bleeding?” Radford himself is a Jew by origin, and he chose all the good and bad from all the heroes with delicacy and honesty. no character is free from flaws; no character is evil. Radford placed the play in the 16th century, which gives a lush background of Venetian politics and decadence on which to project the words of Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to hear Radford talking about the film, I am very happy. I recommend taking it, as it gives details about life in Venice of the 16th century, which highlight many of his choices and Give considerable additional depth to viewing. I hope that the DVD will be an extensive commentary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons beautifully portrays Antonio, the man who resigns himself to bear the burden of his past wrongdoings. Lynn Collins, a relative of the unknown, gives us absolutely flawless, awesome and detailed work as Portia. Not only is Miss Collins beautiful - she also gives Portia levels of intelligence and humor in front of the trial scene, which I rarely saw in any production of this play. the rest of the cast also does a terrific job, with Chris Marshall playing a noticeable role as Graziano and Allan Korduner playing the role of Tubal playing fine foil for Shylock. Finally, while Al Pacino pulls out his usual strong (and loud) performance, his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he does not speak words, but you can see how all emotions and madness flow into and out of him. when he perceives his fate changes. <br /> <br /> If you like historical films, I can not recommend this movie enough.
