<br /> <br /> When I unexpectedly rented a Thousand Acres, I thought that I was interested in the interesting story of King Lear, and of course Michelle Pfeiffer was in it, so what could have gone wrong? <br /> <br /> However, very quickly I realized that this story was about a thousand other things besides just Acre. I cried and could not stop until the film was over. Thank you Jane, Laura and Jocelyn for bringing us such an amazingly thin and compassionate film! Thanks to the actors for taking part and portraying the characters with such depth and tenderness! <br /> <br /> I recognized the Angry Sister; Runaway sister and sister in Denial. I recognized the Offensive Husband, and why he was right there Father, oh, oh Father ... everyone played great. I also recognized myself, and this film was a revelation, relief, a chance to look at my OWN truth and, finally, to do something about it. I sincerely hope that the Thousand Acres had the same effect on some other people. <br /> <br /> Since I did not understand why the cover said that the film about the sisters fighting for the land — they did not fight each other in general — I watched it a second time. Then I could see that if someone did not live a similar story, he could easily miss the overwhelming flow of fear and fear and the deep connection between the sisters that goes through it all. That is why people in general often overlook the truth about their neighbors, for example. <br /> <br /> But there is another reason why this film is so perfect! <br /> <br /> I don’t give a rat ass (sorry for my French) about the extent to which the story of King Lear follows. All I know is that I can honestly say: this film has changed my life. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, guys, you CAN and REALLY change the situation. <br /> <br />
