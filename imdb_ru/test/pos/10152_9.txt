This film is the one you fall in love with. Alfred Hitchcock must always remain above all the directors of his time. The most influential aspects of his films are simplicity and exciting drama. Another best thing about Hitchcock films is “A definite and exciting end.” <br /> <br /> Anything said about “A Man Who Knew Too Much” is less. Cinematography, acting, dialogue and camera work are great in this film. The song "Que Sera Sera" at the end will remain in our memory for life. The film is so enjoyable from start to finish that we will never know when it will end. Rarely would Hitchcock include humor in his films; in this film there are comic scenes that fit into the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely gorgeous and as good as Vertigo.
