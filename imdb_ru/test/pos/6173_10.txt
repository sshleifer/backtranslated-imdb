A wonderful film, cleverly crafted with attention to the details of the war era, and (given that it was installed during World War II) minimal violence. <br /> <br /> A small cast is experiencing an emotional journey through the occupation of Czechoslovakia, separation from loved ones, as pilots go to England (separation from the spaniel touches hearts), a scene of hot temper, love, friendship and betrayal. The theme of betrayal permeates the entire film: from the betrayal of love to the betrayal of friendship and, finally, the betrayal shown by the communist regime to the former pilots of the Air Force in the post-war period. <br /> <br /> Desperately sad movie, especially since it is so accurate. I would recommend this to everyone.
