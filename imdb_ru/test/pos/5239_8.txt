I really liked this movie. It features John Wayne for the first time in his lead role. Even then, you can say that Wayne is indeed present, although he did not reach the mature icon he knew before the Stagecoach, 9 years later in 1939. . It is about settlers from all over the country, heading for the new west to colonize it. The character of Wayne Brek Coleman joins, but for his personal reasons. Most of the main actors were actors of the scene and had never before been filmed, which makes the film even more amazing. they managed to create believable, distinctive characters, and there is a rather strange mixture. Cimarron would come out a year later, and he had a very similar story, although I didnâ€™t like it as much as this film for me Big track is a strong 8/10.
