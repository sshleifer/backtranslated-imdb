I'm not sure why there are no articles, no posters, or anything about this film, because I just saw it and thought it was AMAZING. I think this is not for everyone, because basically Kafka’s “Test” meets “Beavis and Butt-head”, which is a rather difficult combination to swallow. However, I thought it was great. If you are going to see him because you want the continuation of Office Space, you will probably be disappointed. But if you want to see one of the most cruel, sour and cheerful and honest views on where our society is moving, you will find a treat. I just saw the premiere of 8 pm in Los Angeles, and there were only 12 people in the theater, which means that the film is likely to disappear in a week. This is really a shame, because, in its own way, idiocracy is one of the best satires that has appeared in a long time. But again, it basically makes fun of people who make up about 99% of movie viewers, so I’m not surprised that the studio panicked and tried to quit it.
