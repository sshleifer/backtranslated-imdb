Even though all cinema deals with the trauma of the Vietnam War (“Jacob's Ladder”, “The Deer Hunter”, “The Apocalypse Now” and “Taxi Driver”), we feel that we don’t even know half of what happened. Even contemplating horror seems inhuman. And progression - or retreat? - to the inhumanity it needs, is a key part of Apocalypse Now, the greatest and one of the most important films ever made by Coppola. Freely based on the classic picture of Joseph Conrad of 1902 “The Heart of Darkness”, which tells about the loss of sanity and moral corruption, what happens when you move away from civilization - as if the nature of the “Lord of the Flies” that pops up like a beastly nature Vietnam. The story of Willard, a general appointed to a special mission to Cambodia after his first service in Vietnam was served. Willard at the beginning of the film was stuck in Saigon, psychologically unable to return home - Niki terribly repeats in “The Deer Hunter”. So they contact him: his mission is to kill the Green Beret, the apostate, who isolated himself in a remote outpost on the Nung River, and who allegedly completely lost his mind - worshiped like gods to the locals and killed indiscriminately. This man's name is Colonel Kurtz, whom Marlon Brando played in the second best role in his career (the best role is Stanley Kowalski in “A Streetcar Named Desire”). As Willard travels upriver on a warship with the soldiers accompanying him, his testimony of horrors and madness — and the overwhelming futility of all this — leads to eerie sympathy and identification with Kurtz before they even meet. By the time they do this, Kurtz’s methods no longer seem so wrong or as they should be, and they certainly don’t seem too unusual or out of place. Apocalypse is a place outside of morality, an outpost at the end of the world. Loss of civilization, loss of judgment, yourself. Kurtz's monologue about the atrocity, which he witnessed as “The Green Beret”, and his later revelations are among the most frightening and well-read speeches in cinema history. The film is about trauma, about the human spirit and its turning point - here it is very similar to Deer Hunter and is just as good. The apocalypse, however, takes the boundaries of what we can bring to the global level — Coppola’s wide shots about Cambodia’s wet, muddy jungle and the opening sequence of helicopters amid the exploding forests and orange sky — against the doors’s sounding suitable soundtrack — as well as exciting scenes on the river and an air raid on the village where Wagner explodes from the speakers (a scene that has become one of the most frightening, darkly humorous and startlingly meaningless war scenes in history) - all this contributes to the meaning of Apoc lipsisa - end of the world - and not at some distant point in the future, and in the Apocalypse Now and forever. The deer hunter is much closer and more personal, you can even say by name, and it shows the total effect that the injury has on the individual psyche, the destruction of the human soul and the ability to fully obey the forces of darkness. or limp. That's why both films are equal - they are two parts of the same thing. In The Heart of Darkness, Kurtz is shown as contradictory between morality (civilization) and his inner savage. In the Apocalypse Now, Kurtz left the whole conflict behind. He is above good and evil. He let go of morality, as a drowning man let go of a saving hand at the moments before his death. Kurtz is really just waiting for death, quoting TS Eliot in his temple, lost in the jungle. His last words and words reflected at the end of the film: "Horror ... horror." He means the endless void of existence, the human psyche and the empty black void in his own mind, where atrocities are born again. It is impossible to put into words the experience that is experienced when watching this film - in short, the experience that Willard is experiencing in his journey. The final piece, at the outpost, almost comparable to its scene in “The Deer Hunter”, is one of the most profound, calm and seductive things I've ever seen.
