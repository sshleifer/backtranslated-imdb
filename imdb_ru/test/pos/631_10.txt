One of my favorite movies. Nothing compares to watching this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from instant amnesia, I would have enjoyed this film as much as I had the first time. This is still a pleasant second and third time, but I realized that I appreciate the humor more, because the shocks and thrills were not unexpected. If you want to watch a movie that you really can't predict the ending, I highly recommend this movie. She is frightening, shocking, full of indecision, as well as a lot of humor to help you with this. If you are watching this movie and do not like it, I really question your sanity!
