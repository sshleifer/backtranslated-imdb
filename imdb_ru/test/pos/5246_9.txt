The first role of John Wayne just struck me. The televised mailbox style on AMC, I had to check and make sure I had the correct date. Of course, this 1930 film was made using a 55 mm widescreen process. In addition, it presents some of the roughest and most realistic shots of the campaign to the west, which I have seen. The cars, people and animals really go down the cliff with a rope. Trees are cut by sturdy men - and sturdy women - so that the train can move another 10 feet. The Indians are not the “cute boy” city dudes who portrayed them later; they are real. Crossing the river during a heavy rain is so realistic that it has to be real (Actually, I understand that director Raul Walsh almost lost the whole cast during this sequence). I could smell the wet canvas. Every day is agony. Different stories can be forgotten, but the film as a whole - no. I can’t think of another title that can transcend the Great Footprint, evoking a feeling of living history on the way to Oregon. Bravo.
