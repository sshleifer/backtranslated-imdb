I once again watched this film and still consider it quite good. Chloe is one of the few hardcore stars who can really play. She sometimes appears in a soft core, such as "The Body of Love" and "Lady Chatterley's Stories" on Showtime. I thought Nicole Hilbig felt good too, with her beautiful body and charming accent. It is a pity that she is no longer in the movies.
