Clint Eastwood plays a wounded Union soldier found by a girl from a boarding school of the Confederation, and he is taken and recovered, and not transferred to Confederation soldiers. It seems that women-people in this place have ulterior motives. Geraldine Page, director, justifies not turning him into a Confederation and even betrays him as a cousin. Of course, when a man gets better, he becomes quite a female man and does a lot of rounds, but when he was bankrupt, he was REALLY bankrupted, in fact, so much that his leg was cut off, but for his own good. Of course, not retribution. However, things go a little further when some women do not get what they want. I have not seen this for many years, and there is still a certain scary thought that by today's standards it is still rather strange. Not typical Eastwood at all. If you have not seen this, it is worth a look. 8 out of 10.
