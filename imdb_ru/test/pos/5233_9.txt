This film is important for those of us who are interested in Western history because we use authentic methods in its production. <br /> <br /> Scenes from a train carriage are especially authentic; As far as I know, it contains the only scenes ever filmed illustrating the bluffing technique of crossing the river. Horses and mules should be lowered to the level of the river, and wagons lowered by ropes and pulleys. The scene is such that I could watch her again and again, just trying to understand what the transition was like ... and the early travelers did it again and again, crossing the country. <br /> <br /> In addition to the melodrama, this picture is as authentic in clothing and style as it is inherent, and it is worth looking only at it.
