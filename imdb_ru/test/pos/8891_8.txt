Larry Donner (Billy Crystal) has a crazy life: his wife (Kate Mulgrew) stole his book and left it, he has a new affair with a girl named Beth (Kim Greist), he doesn’t know how to start his book and his students from the class Screen writing is unfamiliar with most. However, one student (Danny DeVito) is very strange. He lives with his evil mom (Ann Ramsey) and cannot muster the courage to kill her. Therefore, he turns to Larry for help, transforming his life from an ordinary madman into a madman! <br /> <br /> Stu Silver had to do more! The dialogue, the characters, the whole script is almost perfect! And Danny DeVito proved to me that he is more than a great actor: he is a great director! His children's film “Matilda” is one of my favorite family films, and now it is one of my favorite comedies. <br /> <br /> This is a black comedy, most jokes about murder, but damn ridiculous! All the actors unleash their full potential, whether they are the main characters (Billy Crystal) or just secondary minor characters (Olivia Brown). <br /> <br /> If you like comedy (who doesn't like it?) than you will like it! 8/10 stars
