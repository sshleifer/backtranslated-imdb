I remember seeing it in the early 90s on British television, and it hooked me. The international scale of production is breathtaking, and watching how the characters develop during the five hours that he runs is simply superb. The scenes taking place in Pakistan and Afghanistan are of particular interest, and, as a spectator, you will get a real insight into the culture and atmosphere of these countries at the final stages of the Cold War. The characters Fazal and Helen are very well developed throughout the series and compete with modern shows such as The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in this area. In the UK, VHS costs about £ 6, and DVDs - around £ 10 is a bargain. I thought that Soderberg’s version was also great - but, undoubtedly, I owe this masterpiece a huge debt.
