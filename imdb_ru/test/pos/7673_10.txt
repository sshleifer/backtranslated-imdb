I saw it once, probably, like most people of my age (55 years) in the 60s. I understand the dissatisfaction with the end product by both families. But this is a great movie, it was a great opera; but how the movie is wonderful. This film should be released at least for the video, other generations can get an appreciation of great music and storytelling. The cast included some of the greatest black actors of all time, most of whom have already passed away; Only Sydney P. is still with us. Please do not wait until it leaves, and the film, like all old films, becomes unsuitable for the ravages of time. Again, this is a great film that is not often seen today, if they see it at all.
