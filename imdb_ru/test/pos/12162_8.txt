Frozen Limits is a big screen for artists known as The Crazy Gang. They were a group of British artists who formed in the early 1930s. There were mainly six people in the group: Bad Flanagan, Chesney Allen, Jimmy Nervo, Teddy Knox, Charlie Nothon and Jimmy Gold. The lovely royal families of that time were also extremely popular in the pop halls of the group. The plot here views them as the Wonder Boys troupe, which went looking for happiness in Alaska after reading about the gold rush in the newspaper. The only problem is that when they finally get to the Red Gorge, it turns out that they are 40 years late! <br /> <br /> I often cringe when I see the expression “this is very British” because it implies that those who are not from the British Isles can struggle to get it. The reason why this worries me is that in this age of the Internet and the Internet I have gathered many non-British film-loving friends who, as we know, divided their parties from Ealing, Will Hay and the powerful Terry-Thomas, at best. So, is it true that something like “Frozen Borders” is unlikely to be appreciated by a non-British audience? Well, yes, it's true, there is so much thematically British here, but in fact it’s necessary to say that a fan of classic cinema has a pretty good understanding of history, and when everything is said and done, visual joy is universal here. With the anarchic “not” so wild west, surpass the absolute winner. The winner, who has all the chances to be appreciated by the American audience more than the British. Not all comedic films, and, in truth, the Big Six exceeded all expectations due to the theft of the Moore Marriott film. But there are parodies and parodies that deserve respect and approval from more outstanding comedic acts. You can hardly fall from your chair like me because of the oval on Ovaltin, but if you are a fan of the classic comedy film? I am sure that you, at worst, admit that there are very talented people working here. <br /> <br /> Now, the dose that monty always get from their man? 8/10
