The film is partly a thriller, and partly a public announcement of events from the point of view of politicians, terrorists and, of course, victims. In this clever drama, lessons are given on the pollution and survival of chaos, while a behind-the-scenes look at how a crisis is managed, prompts viewers to distrust their guardians and fear attackers. The film, originally shown on the BBC, raises serious doubts about official readiness. The performances are correct, understated, but never amazing. The film is just the beginning, a provocative beginning leading to a wider discussion, but, in my opinion, it starts working, causing thrills and forcing the audience to reason and ask themselves questions.
