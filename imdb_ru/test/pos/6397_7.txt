This show was shit when it first appeared. The first actress who played the daughter was not suitable for this role, the script was successful or not, and Damon Wayans CLEARLY did not like to arrange such a show for a family with a cornball. The chemistry between him and Tisha Campbell (they are long-time friends, like the entire Vayan clan, with her husband Silence and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett) worked, so they restarted the show. As soon as it came back, they reworked their daughter, made their son much dumber (à la Eric from Boy Meets World) and turned the younger daughter into a genius ... (later they gave her a little genius guy for comedy) The show, while if the roller coaster often turns from insane jesters to rabies, go far enough to keep it as a show, in which you can see how Damon Wayans will be comfortable in his skin on the set (especially that the main scriptwriters, directors and consultants) were ALL members of the family vayanov) And in his character. Once everyone was on the show for a while, they worked on everyone in strong roles and were able to make a consistently funny live show. <br /> <br /> However, there are too many jesters, too many excessive antics, and often too much chaos in the life of the Kyle family. They made Junior TOO stupid, from time to time they also made the eldest daughter an attractive, clumsy idiot, and the youngest daughter was not even ignored by the writers. I feel that they jumped from the shark and signed the death sentence on the show, when Junior got pregnant with his girlfriend, she moved and he married her and her parents were introduced (the character of Junior’s father makes me think of him). The show was ridiculous ... but it was a UPN show on ABC, if there was any sense in it for the reader. <br /> <br /> The replays are funny enough, but I'm glad it's over ... it was not going anywhere. When it's bad, it's really bad. At times, this is usually Cornball, but at least he was a black man, whose comedy was in syndication on a large network ... Who can say this for himself right now? (Given the recent merger of CW and the “failure” in television networks). One.
