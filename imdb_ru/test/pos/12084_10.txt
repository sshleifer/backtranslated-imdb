I was just looking for "who will love my children" to buy when I stumbled upon this website and a record made by the same Briton !! I am a big fan of this movie and would recommend it to everyone. What seemed comforting to me was finding someone else who also found solace in the goodwill of others. I also have a son from Asperger (among other things), and I'm also afraid to think that if something happens to me and my husband, that someone wants to not only take my beautiful “normal” daughter, but my special and the gifted son too. Lack of home and the ability to communicate with people brought up with the same values ​​as me is more important than you know. Living here in the USA, I have not met anyone who has seen this film. So for all of you reading this, if you haven't seen it yet, try to do it. This is a very exciting experience, especially for those who are parents, or even if you just have a sympathetic bone in your body, you will cry and beg. After that, you will count your blessings, And to everyone who has ever experienced a similar or close to it, my heart turns to you. It makes me realize, no matter how hard or hard it is to survive, just remind yourself that there is always someone in a worse position than you. The amazing movie and what makes it more powerful is that it is based on a true story. Do not be discouraged by how sad it is, at the same time, this film warms the heart and makes you feel inspired about the strength and kindness of humanity.
