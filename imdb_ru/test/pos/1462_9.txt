Rotating comedy talk show from the creators of the “Dark Place of Garth Marengi”. The new series, “The Man-Man with Dean Learner,” tells about the manager, publisher, and advertising agent Garth performed by Richard Ayoade. <br /> <br /> Nightclub owner, restaurateur, publisher, international playboy - Dean Learner is a one-person brand. <br /> <br /> After jointly participating in the Garth Marenghi's Darkplace 4th television hit, he now invites you to his luxurious penthouse apartment for a completely new, exciting and incredibly stylish television talk show. <br /> <br /> Man-to-man with Dean The student will introduce all the remaining celebrity friends of Dean, as well as a lot of live music and delicious fish dishes that smell like class, but not fish! <br /> <br /> I attended two of the live recordings on it and I had seams. There are clear comparisons to Alan Partridge's “I Know that I Know You” layout, but the unique writing style of Richard Ayoade and Matt Holness takes him to another level. <br /> <br /> If you're a Darkplace fan, then you can't miss it. Catch it when it's aired this summer
