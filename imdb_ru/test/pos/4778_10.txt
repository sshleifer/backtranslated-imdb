STEAMBOAT WILLIE is a surprisingly important film in the history of our cinema. This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (after the silent film “PLANE CRAZY” at the beginning of this year) is probably his most famous film - mainly because it was so innovative. This is because it was the first cartoon sound. Although you have not yet heard Mickey say, in the film, tons of sound effects and music are something that we take for granted now, but which was a huge audience in 1928. <br /> <br /> Now, if It was just an important historical film, it would be worth seeing it - especially for animation fans. However, after about 25 years of watching a short film, I was amazed at how timeless the film really is. Although Mickey and Minnie behave a little strangely compared to the characters we love (mainly due to the strange mind and talent of the animator Ub Iverks), the film has a contagious charm. It’s just amazing to see Mickey playing The Straw Turkey very creatively (albeit sometimes brutally). Smart and truly pleasing to the public - this film is still among the best films of Mickey, even after 80 wonderful years.
