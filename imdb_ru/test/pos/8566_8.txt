This should be my guilty pleasure. I'm a HUGE fan of 80s films that were designed to entertain, and they didn't care if they offended anyone. In this movement there is neither meat, nor substance, nor deep thoughts causing scenes. It's just that old college kids are having fun, and if you need to show a few breasts, so be it! This film is for those who just want to relax and NOT think. Viva la nudity!
