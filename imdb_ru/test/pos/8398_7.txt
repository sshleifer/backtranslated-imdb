I watch this film without high expectations, I think everyone should do. This is a great TV series, and, of course, we cannot compare it with Gone With the Wind, but itâ€™s still nice to watch. It is also strange to see another Scarlett. Joan Wally does not play Scarlett with passion and fire, like Vivien Leigh, but I believe that Scarlett changed as she got older. Do not expect much of this, just look, but do not look like this: I think it would be terrible.
