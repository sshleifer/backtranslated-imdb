Hilarious movie! The script is terrible, but the quality of the actors saves the day. John Hurt is perfect, as is Jane Alexander. Beau Bridges is honest, and the actress who plays his wife is very weak. History is a real star. Based on real events, the pace moves well, and the whole concept of escaping from East Germany delays and holds you. A happy ending provides enough delight to offset the script. Do not expect the quality of an Oscar, but this is a great trip for the whole family.
