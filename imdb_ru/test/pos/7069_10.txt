<br /> <br /> This is a film that demands too much from the public, but most of them are disappointing. I think of Mexican people who (either trying to support Mexican films, or wanting to watch a movie about the main roles of Mexican stars) saw this, half of the people left the theater, when I went to watch it, it was definitely not the kind of movie one would expect. I also think of people from other countries who dared to spend 2 hours to see him until the very end, “what a piece of shit”. To understand the Cronica de un desayuno, you need to be Mexican and be familiar with the lower middle classes (or, even better, be part of them). There is nothing accidental in this film, the family is and is what many families share, at least in Mexico. You need to look at it with a wide open mind, to fully accept it, this is not the film that you fully understand after watching. The elder brother would not allow anyone to sit on his RED couch, the sister remains, no matter how she wants to leave, the younger brother goes on a tour, and all he cares is the yellow radio, the mother should prepare breakfast for the family, regardless on how tense and unbearable the situation is. The father returned after someone who knows how long, allowing the mother to live the night of passion, which somehow turns out to be instantaneous, and ends with the repetition of all the views of his sons ... Stories around the house are surreal (and like the film), travels for his cock, a factory worker and his suicide attempt, suppressed by the kisses of his girlfriend, a fat man riding a bicycle after an interesting conversation about homosexuals with his sister? wife? Mama? ... The music does not pretend too much, but it achieves much, no more than a snare drum, a plate, some strings. Thank you, a good movie like this one was made and released. <br /> <br /> One of the best Mexican films ever! and one of the less understood, even by the Mexican himself, no matter how he was identified with it. . <br /> <br />
