hey, i think this movie was great and it had great graphics and i was very happy that they used the final fantasy 7, i think the game was the best i have ever played in anyway This is a great movie and I liked it. They should do one more, but maybe they should use Final Fantasy 7 or Final Fantasy 10 again, both are pretty cool from: Tyler Sheena. I hope that you can send me an email, if you have any details, if there is someone else reading this, I suggest you watch this movie it is animated, but it looks quite realistic and in it There are amazing battle scenes that I havenâ€™t seen in the film for a long time. Final Fantasy 7 is also really great, not very good graphics, but very addictive and challenging.
