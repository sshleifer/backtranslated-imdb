I caught this 1969 movie on TCM cable one night. I remember when I first saw the film in Hong Kong, I really liked the songs and performances of Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. I love Clark most of all in Francis Ford Coppola's Rainbow Finnish (1968) with Fred Astaire, Don Frank and Tommy Steele. Just in awe of the fact that finally this amazing musical with a golden pot with Irish taste came out on DVD! Ah, "this is that old moon devil (in your eyes)." <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole in the role of Mr. Chips - yes, he really sang - a real liberation. He may not be a veteran in a musical like Rex Harrison, but he miraculously inhabited this role. The scene of his run on the lawn in a cape reminds me of the PBS series “Serving them all my days” - a cute school teacher and a loving person, he's Mr. Chipey. Clark and O'Toole gave us the right combination of sperm and circumstances. Leslie Brikussa songs and lyrics, as usual, cling. The melodies “You and me” and “Walk around the world (with me)” have stayed with me the most over the years. And there are “How many flowers”, “And the sky smiled”, “Fill the world with love” - not a syrup at all. Sometimes I think that if the world plunges into the songs and words of Bricuss, we will overcome all the divisions on earth, and all of our days will be "beautiful"! Yes, talk to animals too. (“Doctor Dolittle”, 1967) <br /> <br /> Musicals are a blessing for the world of movie goers, they are something more than life. Like the music and lyrics of the Sherman Brothers (Richard M. and Robert B.), who gave us "Chitty Chitty Bang Bag" (1968) and "Mary Poppins" (1964) - who would not feel absolute delight, just saying "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" " ? I was tickled by at least one song and dance number shown in the Spanish film “Km.0 - Kilometer Zero” (2000). My favorite film is the French directors Jacques Demi "Young Girls of Rochefort" (1967) with colorful actors Catherine Deneuve and (the deceased sister) Francoise Dorleac, Jacques Perrin, Michel Piccoli, Daniel Darry, Gene Kelly and George Shakiris singing and dancing Michel Music Legrand. Long live the musicals.
