I watched the NFL game, started surfing during the break and found it on one of the HBO channels. I missed the start, but when I started watching Deadly Voyage, the clicker was depressed and didn’t even think until the captions rolled. Throughout this, you will fight with the villans and on the edge of your La Zi-Boi. If you have a chance, take the time to watch it. From time to time I think about the cable company filming my Kino channels, but when you come across such great ones, you understand why it’s worth paying more. Happy Holidays to all with Cape Cod !!!
