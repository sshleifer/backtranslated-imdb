I have to admit, when I saw the previews of “Inglorious Bastards”, I revived high hopes. This film did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Rarely, when I watch a film with such high expectations, I justify or exceed these expectations; this film did it and more. Even less often, I clap at the end of the film; I and everyone else in the theater did it. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I am a bit addicted to Quentin, I grew up with "Pulp Fiction". " I watched it when I was 12 years old, and it is still my favorite and most influential film. <br /> <br /> However, since then Quentin has never been able to justify his obligations. His style was becoming a bit predictable, and not familiar, to be honest, the quality was not there (I never watched Jackie Brown, and then Grindhaus). That is, to "Inglorious bastards." What Quentin did was exactly what was needed for the military genre, the spaghetti western, which only Tarantino or Sergio Leone could do, but seeing how Leone was dead, Tarantino himself appointed the guy in this masterpiece. So, let's look at the film, which I will not distribute. The writing was in place, a wonderful transition between using not one, but four different languages ​​in this film. Not to mention the fact that this film was created in the classic form of Tarantino, magnificent scenes with a rich meaningful dialogue and a sudden shocking action. <br /> <br /> The acting was excellent !! Christopher Waltz deserves an Oscar, seriously. I do not say this often, but to be honest, the person should get one for this film, he spoke all languages ​​in this film, and delivered it with such an amazing touch and balance. He stole the show in a film that impressed everyone incredibly. <br /> <br /> I have no problem making this film, because this film is the best film I have seen all year, and probably the whole next year. Frankly, the more I think about it, this film can crack my best films of all time, and is Quentin's best movie since Pulp Fiction. Take it from me, see this movie. I loved that this does not make this film fair enough. <br /> <br /> I watched it yesterday and I'm still excited. Thank you, Quentin, from the bottom of my heart for making this film. You're at the top again, buddy. I can't say enough for "Inglorious bastards!"
