I have not seen this film for more than 20 years, but it had such an influence on me that I remember sitting out the credits for several minutes after complete fear. This is one of the most underrated films of the entire decade in which it was first released. I just ordered a copy of it on DVD and paid for the overnight delivery and can't wait for it to arrive. Sometimes it is uplifting, and also very dark and somewhat alarming. This is a story about a cohesive group of regular children growing up in the center of the city, and it seems that they are actually sitting on the sidelines and not watching on the screen of a movie or television. It is difficult to explain, but this is what you need to experience. The story begins in childhood and tracks the lives of the four main characters in high school and at the time when they set off on a journey through life. The entire cast has done an incredible job, and this is definitely the best job in Jodie Thelenâ€™s career. I hope that the DVD will justify my memory and plan to watch it this Friday with a good friend.
