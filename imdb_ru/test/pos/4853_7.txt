Well played drama based on the novel by Arthur Miller. Something as simple as glasses changes life. Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) - a man who decided to be content with his worldly life; the same work twenty years and still live with my mother. The boss told him to correct his eyesight with glasses. Newman's life changes dramatically and plunges him into hell. The glasses he chose make him look like a Jew. He loses his job and becomes the object of close attention to his neighborhood of Brooklyn. In search of work, he meets the attractive and outspoken Gertrude (Laura Dern), who herself lives in conflict because of her Jewish appearance. Soon the new joint life of the couple turns into a nightmare filled with humiliation and fanatical attacks. A very successful cast, in which Joseph Ziegler, Peter Aldring, Kay Hawtry and a well-known musician Meatloaf participate
