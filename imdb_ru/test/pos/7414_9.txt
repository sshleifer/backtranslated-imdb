How the hell is this movie not as widely known as me. <br /> <br /> I picked it up for 1 pound, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is the best pound I've ever spent a movie on. <br /> <br /> What usually makes films about the club scene is either music or real scenes made in a club environment. <br /> <br /> Music and club scenes are quite trustworthy here, using some of the great tunes of the time and filmed in real clubs, with people who actually look like they want to be there. <br /> <br /> High-level performances in all respects, although Jason Donovan, in particular, stands out for me (he played the Frank H Fürter at the Rocky Horror Show in London around the time it was supposed to filmed, so that his stage of dragging was in full flow!), and, of course, Tim Curry, the eloquent Boss of the drug lord convincing. <br /> <br /> Simply put, if you are a fan of a British film, you have to see it, it doesn’t matter if you like clubs, because the film is strong. Anyway, like a story. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
