Much has been said without words. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It was made in color — not color, like in today's films, but a special monochrome use (with shades) that reflected the meaning, mood, meaning, and time. This should be visible in color, as it becomes a completely different movie. The story, presented by the Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf, is effectively presented. A person never has a clear sense of reality, memory or ghost. The changes taking place in Swedish society at that time are thinly layered. Highly recommend. Try to rent it or find it online. I saw it in a Swedish film class and I want to add it to my movie library.
