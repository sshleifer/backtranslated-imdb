This is definitely a great show. I don't have a cable, so I started taking it off, because my friend recommended it. I thought it would be teenage soap, you know, who meets with someone, something like that. But this was not. This is amazingly deep. It is also very witty. It moves at a very fast pace, and every time you watch it, you are joking more and more. This is a comedy drama that is rarely well done. It's about the relationship between Rory and Lorelai. Instead of the classic relationship between mother and daughter, this is a story about best friends â€” about mother and daughter. The characters are well played, and everyone does a great job. This is definitely the best TV show I've come across.
