This film was an amazing tribute to someone who went through this type of pain and suffering. The game was not the best, I admit it, but it was passionate in its message: sending people to prisons without a lawyer or any other trial is cruel and unusual. They even had a damn trial of Saddam, so why isn’t every suspected terrorist had any fair and justified trial or hearing about why they were flagged first? I am filming a movie, but I think it is worth noting this sick, distorted idea that the government has. The way the film told the story and the backstory was a great mystery. I tried to connect the whole film with the plot, and it became very obvious at the end. There is no doubt that the direction was incredible, but the only thing that didn’t bother me was that there wasn’t much attention to the character’s interest Reese Witherspoon and the struggle that she had, a lot of omissions. Otherwise, it was quite fascinating, and most of all it held my attention and interest during the two hours that he played.
