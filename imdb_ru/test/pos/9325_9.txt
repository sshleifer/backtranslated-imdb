When it was announced that the “King of Pop” had died at 50, a month before he was to begin a series of live returns at the London O2 Arena, it was a huge shock to millions of people around the world. He was, and always will be one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry, and he will be sorely missed. I decided to remind myself how wonderful it was, seeing what many consider not only the best Jackson video (and, possibly, song), but also the best music video ever created by director John Landis (American werewolf in London). The film begins with the fact that Michael and his girlfriend (Ola Ray) have a car breakdown, and after she gave her a ring, the moon comes out and he turns into a werewolf. Then we see Michael and his Girl watching this horror movie in a movie, she is scared and leaves, and soon Michael follows her, sings a cult song. Soon the voice of Vincent Price sounded, and the zombies began to crawl on the ground and open the coffins from the cemetery, and Michael and the Girl were clearly surrounded. She turns away, and Michael himself became a zombie, and with all the other creatures they perform a cult dance before he returns to his normal self, at least for the chorus. The girl runs into the nearest eerie house, blocks the doorway, but Michael still manages to break through the zombie, and when he touches her, she screams to see how normal Michael says: “What is the problem?” The film ends up being taken away home and looks at us with evil eyes. Michael Jackson was 14th in 100 of the greatest icons of pop culture, and he was 6th on The Ultimate Pop Star, the album Thriller was No. 4 on 100 of the greatest albums, and this video was No. 71 on the 100 greatest scary moments, and that was number 1 in the top 100 pop video. Fine!
