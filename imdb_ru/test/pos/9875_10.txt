Wow, The Curse of Michael Myers, what a wonderful movie. Suspended, interesting, creative and intelligent plot, which I love. Many people hate the concept of "Thorn", I like it. I think this gives the Halloween TV series some conspiracy. Marianne Hagan is a great actress, and she played her role superbly, especially for her first film, and Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasant are also great. My only complaint is that why didn't Daniel Harris play the role of Jamie in this film? She wanted to come back, but the producers said no. I thought J.C Brandy was great, but I love Daniel Harris. However, I love Halloween: the curse of Michael Myers. I think that the Shape mask looks best in this film, and George P. Wilbur is the best Michael Myers. Incredibly creepy and stressful Halloween 6 rules! <br /> <br /> I adore this very cruel, but incredibly pleasant movie. The Halloween horror series is by far the best in the genre. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
