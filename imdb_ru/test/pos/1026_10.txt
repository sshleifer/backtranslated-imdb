Just as a reminder to everyone who is just reading the comments on this excellent BBC mini-series, published in 1981, it was not available on DVD until the last few years. It has since become available, but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an “international” DVD player, which you have to hack - illegally, I suspect, to see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com - 3 Disk - priced from 19 to 21 dollars, for viewing on DVD in US format, without hacking. There were 41 reviews, an average of 5 stars. This mini-series is one of the best on Oppenheimer, or on the Manhattan project, or on almost everything that is produced by the BBC.
