I got the impression from seeing this documentary that Nathaniel Kahn had more questions than he did before he made the film. <br /> <br /> It took him five years to do this — a work of love and longing. I can only imagine the cluttered editing process, what to leave, what to take out. <br /> <br /> His father, famous architect Louis Kahn, seems to be a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally accessible even to one wife, not just three. But, like many men of his character, he attracted women who were fascinated by remoteness and fascinated by creativity. <br /> <br /> One of his mistresses said he was “available,” but it was never explored. Other comments from people who knew him well suffered the same fate. A pity. <br /> <br /> The tension between the three brothers and sisters in a room designed by Louis is also palpable. The unspoken soars over the conversation. The only footprints his father left were in the buildings he left behind, some great, some not so big. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by the musical ship and the Salk Institute. Saddened by the little mothers, who are forever caught by his heartless inclusions, are never a more vivid example than what he told the director's mother after he was told about her pregnancy - "not again!" <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, beautifully shot, real. <br /> <br /> It seems that in this case at least the son is not the father of the person.
