Lackawanna Blues is a very touching film depicting an era filled with various emotions and characters, seen by the eyes of a young boy. The film clearly confirms that in order to raise a child, a village is needed, and recalls an important time in black history and culture. I received incredible respect for Macy Gray as an actress. Her character was a little crazy, but attractive; Obviously, we all knew someone like Macy's character. S. Epata Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as a nanny. I never understood that Epata was such a great actress. Law and order never demonstrated the depth of Epatá’s acting skills, such as Lackawanna Blues. I was pleasantly surprised and amazed! Music and characters reminded me of my childhood ... it was a sweet nostalgic walk through the memory lane. I really enjoyed the movie and am looking forward to the release of the DVD to add to my collection.
