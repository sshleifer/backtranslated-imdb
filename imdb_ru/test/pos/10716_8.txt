The Kramer vs. Kramer Academy Award follows the posh businessman Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and his divorce from a bored wife (Meryl Streep). One day, Ted's wife leaves him and their child in search of a better life, forcing Ted to get closer to his son (Justin Henry). The two get closer and become very close (but only after some friction), and as soon as everything goes perfectly, Ted's wife returns to the city and wants sole custody of their son. Then Ted goes on a mission to prevent his son from being taken from him, and fights with his wife in court. Dustin Hoffman gives an amazing game with Meryl Streep, and the young Justin Henry is impressive. This is a sad emotional slide of the film, but it is a very well-made and inspirational film. The film won an Oscar for best picture at the 1979 Academy Award ceremony, along with Best Actor for Hoffman and Best Supporting Actress for the Strip. If you donâ€™t mind tears, Kramer vs. Kramer is a great movie to watch. Rating: B +
