Uzumaki (“spiral” or “whirl” in Japanese) is one of the most absurd films I've ever watched. The city becomes possessed, and then completely absorbed by the vortex pattern, in some very grotesque way. The fingertips are cut off, people commit suicide in washing machines ... just wild and insane Japanese horror. Perhaps the same psychologically harmful as the "Ring". As a rule, not as scary as the "Eye", but the images in it are more disgusting than most things in the "Eye". And not as scary as the "Untold Story" ... but this does not mean that there is not so much blood and dismemberment. Seriously, if you like horror movies and especially Asian horror movies, you should add this movie to your list. A few pieces are a little weird with sound effects (the story is adapted from the manga comic, and it shows), but it does fit. Unlike some films that try too hard to capture the original source (“The House of the Dead”), this film does it perfectly. The most original film that you will see ... not only this year, but probably ever. Featured!
