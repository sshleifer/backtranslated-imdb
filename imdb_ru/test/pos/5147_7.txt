This surreal, absurdist film is the first film I saw about the cult Swedish director Roe Andersson. He is a veteran filmmaker who has made his live commercials, having shot just four feature films in the last forty years. This background shows: the film looks like a collection of fifty two-minute art commercials. There is no story linking these vignettes, although some characters appear in more than one vignette (although there is a theme beneath them: the absurdity of modern life). Some manners of the film (when the actors appear in a light white makeup) are more annoying than illuminate. Some of the parodies are very few (a person is not sure which queue to stand in?). Other parodies are better though. The best thing about a rock chick who dreams that she is going on a honeymoon trip with her fiancee from a rock guitarist to a house that includes something like a train (you have to watch this to get it). A film that is worth seeing, even if the comparisons made by some film critics with such great directors as Keaton, Tati and Kaurismaki, seem overloaded: Andersson lacks their vision, and the lack of history linking the vignettes is fatal for the claim of this film to be a masterpiece.
