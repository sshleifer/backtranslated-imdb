Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) is also an extremely talented pianist and singer. Ray is also a smart man. Ray began his career in the late 1940s, before he found his distinctive style. Ray, of course, is popular in nightclubs with his music. Everything changes when he meets an ambitious music producer (Curtis Armstrong). Who knows that Ray got what he needed to become a strong performer, and he also meets a woman (Kerry Washington), whom he also loves and marries along the way. Ray's album becomes a hit when he mixes soul music and the gospel together. What makes Ray a controversial person from the 1950s to the 1960s. Ray loves all the music, including country music. But Ray is not always the perfect man, as he seems. Since he had a lot of bad relationships with another woman while he was married. But he also had to fight racism, people who deceived him, his musical ideals and, of course, his addiction. This made Ray's life extremely difficult for him and to fight the tragedy of his childhood. For which Ray always blamed himself. <br /> <br /> Director Oscar-Winner: Taylor Hackford (against all odds, the devil's advocate, Dolores Clayborn) created a fascinating true story of the always interesting of the last “Ray” Charles. ” Fox received an Oscar for his touching performance by the late artist. Foxx brings soul and soul to film and humor. But this film has a lot of rich action from top actors, including: Regina King, Clifton Powell, Bokeem Woodbine, Aunjaune Ellis, Warwick Davis, Terrence Howard and Sharon Warren as Ray's mother. This is probably the best movie in Hackford’s career to date. The film also has a lot of songs about the best music of Charles. <br /> <br /> DVD has clear Pan & Scan (1.33: 1) and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. Disc 1 contains the director's informative commentary, and the DVD also has an original theatrical version and an extended version. But instead, you'd better watch the theatrical version, because bonus shots are sometimes in poor condition, and you need to click on the logo if you want to see these deleted scenes. Disc 2 deleted scenes with additional director comments (as seen in the extended version), features and much more. But favorites are disappointingly short for this DVD. Since the film is extremely good. This film was nominated for four Oscars, including "Best Design Costumes", "Best Director", "Best Editing" and "Best Photography". This is an amazing true story, well-told, but, of course, Charles’s life was even more controversial and outrageous than the final film. However, it is damn close. Scenario by James L. White. From the story of White and director: Hackford. Oscar Winner for the best sound. Do not miss it. (**** ½ / *****).
