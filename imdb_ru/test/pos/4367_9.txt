Turning Isherwood's bit of dark and completely brilliant novel into a light, comic rush might easily have been a cause of disaster, but for some reason this is not so. The story is moving at a very fast pace, and the black and white images are gorgeous, like Harvey and Harris when they make their way through quaint Weimar Berlin. Fun!
