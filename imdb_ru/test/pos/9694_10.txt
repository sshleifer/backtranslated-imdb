I don't have to love Jakas number two. No one should. In Jackass there is and there has never been anything especially redeeming. And yet ... this is one of the funniest things I've ever seen - and I just can't explain why. <br /> <br /> This new film leaves first in the dust. This is so funny, so terrible and so wrong. The whole team gives all its strength - Jacks, led by Knoxville, is leading the attack. He's crazy. I adore him, but he is insane. And more power to him. With his burgeoning movie career, he could sit back and just let everyone do the dirty work, but the fact that he literally literally threw himself into the world of "Ass" so sincerely makes me strangely respect him. More gratitude should be to Bam Margera, who previously seemed content to sit back and just make sure that everyone around him did pretty much what he wanted. Here Bam is not a torturer, but tortured, and so much the better for him. <br /> <br /> I just can't say what my favorite role is, because I laughed to the end. Admittedly, I watched most of the film between my fingers, but there was no “real” film that I had seen in a very long time that would make me feel as fresh as this. Love them or, most likely, hate them, the Jackass team exceeded all my expectations. But I agree with Bam. There can never be a donkey number three, because someone will die, and I want these guys to stay close.
