What is often forgotten about Harold Lloyd is that he was an actor. Unlike Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd did not have the background of Vaudeville / Music Hall, and he was not a natural comedian. He came to Hollywood to act; and he found that he knew how to behave funny - first in shorts, then in facial features. He made a name for himself “Lonely Luke”, a fake of Chaplin; with the "character glasses", which made him an All-American boy, rather than a grotesque, Lloyd found his step, and his films became one of the best ones made in the era of silence. <br /> <br /> He gained a reputation as a “daredevil” in some shorts, and retained it in some of his best films (“Last Safe”, “For God's sake”, “Shy Girl”). He was more popular than Chaplin or Keaton in the twenties, and he became very rich before the sound. <br /> <br /> The first sound films were often disasters. To get the most out of their “sound,” too many dialogs have been used in many films. <br /> <br /> Lloyd’s acting abilities were created after two decades for silence. He had no bad voice; his high height corresponded to his character of "points". And his sound films were not unqualified disasters of legend. Yet silent films were raised to high art (especially Lloyd's, which did not skimp on the budget and was extremely well handled); with the advent of sound films, they had to learn to walk again, and they made some mistakes. <br /> <br /> Although he tried to keep up with the times and covered the sound, Lloyd’s best pieces from his early (too talkative) conversations were still visually - for example, the scene in “Crazy Movie” where he seems to be rides in a posh car, but actually “drove” on his bike. <br /> <br /> An attempt to catch the reckless antics that made him famous, as he did in Legs first, was an oversight. (In the film “Security in the Past,” his best film, in which he deservedly or not thrust Lloyd into the field as a “brave comic”, he played a determined young man climbing to the top. The “security of the latter” had a natural character that rose before scaling his character on the side of the building. He was obviously afraid, but his fear added humor. In the "First legs" he accidentally fell into a dangerous position to scale the building, his insane calls for help distracted his attention from humor.pathetic and tenacious, the desire to save his neck - perhaps the exact statement of the 1930s, but not funny). <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd was not mired in the past, like some Weird Norma Desmond. He took the sound and tried to push his films in different directions, developing and changing with the industry. When Legs First failed, he left the daredevils business and made a satire on the film industry, Mad Movie. Just as he had to go through many films in the role of "Lonely Luke", before he took his place in the history of cinema with the help of a character in glasses, he tried several directions in sound films, before striking his step in sound, which he did with The Catspaw. <br /> <br /> In the Cat's Paw, he plays the son of a missionary raised in China, who is unwittingly elected mayor as a cover for corrupt political interests. When he learns the truth, he sets himself the task of clearing the city. Only in his forties, could Lloyd still play a daring young man. <br /> <br /> However, “The Catspaw” was another box office setback, and Lloyd made only three films, including the Milky Way. Of his main competitors, Chaplin still had silent films, and Keaton was hopelessly ruled. The Caterpillar and the Milky Way suggest that Lloyd might have mastered the sound comedy, if he was a little younger, or if the audience gave him the advantage of doubt after his early sound fiasco. <br /> <br /> Although the film was unjustly offended at the way Lloyd’s character removed the city, he suits him. Starting from his days in shorts, Lloyd wanted to scare his audience, and the Caterpillar climax reached it again, in an amazing way; until the trick is revealed, it seems terrible, and then laughter comes. <br /> <br /> Regarded as a product of its time, Cat's Paw is charming and fun. Very well written sound comedy, well played by Lloyd. Directed by Sam Taylor, his curious mix of drama and cunning humor makes him look like the comedy of Frank Capra or Preston Sturges.
