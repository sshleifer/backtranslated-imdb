This comedy series was popular in 1984-1985. It was a time when people could see deserted streets in most overpopulated Indian cities, when a comedy appeared on the screens of Indian television. All this was the result of the installation of television repeaters throughout the Indian nation. This was one of the important elements of the modernization strategy of the Indian television network adopted by the late Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi. She was also continued by her son Rajiv Gandhi. This series provided pure entertainment, which the vast majority of Indian television audiences watched on their black and white televisions. The funny thing about this show is that its sponsor was a local company that deals with Ayurvedic products. A couple of days ago I saw some episodes of this series, but the complete equation of laughter was missing. This continues to prove that perhaps with the ever-changing passage of time, entertainment material loses its charm and clings to people's minds.
