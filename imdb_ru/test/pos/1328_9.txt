Ocean Twelve is probably better than Ocean Eleven. I know that most people will disagree, but I liked it more. After three years, it was good to see the gang return. The reason for this robbery is a little inspiring a second time. I understand why they stole from Benedict (Andy Garcia) in the last movie. This film they have a little more motivation the second time. The Twelve Oceans are more interesting and cooler than the Eleven Oceans. With Toper Grace's funny cameo, who said: “I just came out in a new film by Dennis Quaid” and other things. I think Ocean's Twelve is probably the best on the show. <br /> <br /> Story: About a year after Ocean's Twelve, Terry Benedict (the guy they robbed in the last movie) comes back and says that if Ocean Eleven doesn't return him the money they stole, he is going to call the police. So Danny Ocean and the gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets her old police friend Isabel. After she meets him again, she begins to follow them. In addition, the gang finds out that they have an enemy, who is also a thief, who is a little better than they are. <br /> <br /> With many funny scenes, for example, when Tess (Julia Roberts) goes to Europe and pretends that Julia Roberts, Ocean Twelve is a pretty smart film. It's cooler, funnier and more interesting than Ocean's eleven.
