God bless Joe D'Amato ... I love Italian horror, cheese (from the point of view of the movie;)), science fiction, and so on. <br /> <br /> This, however, was a little harder to watch, but another funny, bad movie. <br /> <br /> I like the way people anticipate a negative review with the words “I usually enjoy bad movies, but ...” No, but it was a bad movie FOR people who like bad movies. This is one of my best bad movies. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keefe was Conan for the poor, but oh, how fun. Who can not have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb, hang glider and stupid rubber monster? You can hate this movie if you like Hollywood trees, such as Titanic or Pretty Woman, but if you really, I mean REAL, like bad movies, watch this one. <br /> <br /> those films that are interesting to rent for a beer or when you have a couple of buddies looking for a little thoughtless fun. <br /> <br /> My rating is 8/10.
