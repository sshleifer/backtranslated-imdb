This is a really cute movie. I had a big break (girls 10-11), and they really liked this film. They watched it twice! Don't let the rating fool you. To rate a movie on IMDb, you must be at least 13 years old, which excludes the target audience of the movie. If you have a girl (or boy) between the ages of 7 and 13, I guarantee that they will like this movie. <br /> <br /> High School Notting Hill. Aaron Carter plays a famous pop star who fails lessons in a private school. His mother sends him to an "ordinary" high school with an ultimatum, "to go through high school or not to attend summer at all." Following the advice of his manager (former pop star David Cassidy), he made friends with the smartest girl in school (Alan Austin) with plans to fool her. Look for a humorous and insightful Janitor (another former pop star Life Garrett).
