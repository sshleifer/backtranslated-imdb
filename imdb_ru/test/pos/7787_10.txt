Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time. Both Aamir and Salman Khan played brilliantly, while the actors of Aamir were much better than Salman’s. Aamir Khan is known as “Ã. PERFECTIONIST 'in Bollywood, and he proves it in every film. <br /> <br /> The story tells about two young guys, Amara (Amir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan), both from poor families and big dreamers. They want to become rich without any pain. Therefore, when they hear about Ravin Bajaj (Ravina Tandon), the daughter of Mr. Bajaya (Paresh Raval), who comes to India to find her fiance, they both cheat their fathers to marry Ravina Bajaj and the Journey begins. The film also has a twist that makes the film even more fun. Paresh Rawal plays a dual role (Teja and Mr. Bajaj) and acts brilliantly, as always. Shakti Kapoor (the criminal master of Gogo) also adds a great comedy. <br /> <br /> This film is a delicate comedy from the first to the last minute, one of the classic Bollywood comedy films.
