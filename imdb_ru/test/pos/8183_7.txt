Quite a staged film by a director telling the story of the ambitious plan of the Qing Emperor to unite all the kingdoms of China. Some great characters, scenery, costumes and scenes. However, I was not struck by the film in terms of the ability of the actors (which was good, I liked the marquis most of all) or its appearance (although the troop strength was extremely impressive if it were a real man, which is a lot extra!). <br /> <br /> I’ve seen Li Gong in other films, and she’s always great. I think this is a good historical article, but not one to judge true historical authenticity. Good movie and found 2 1/2 + hours no problem. <br /> <br /> Rated 7 out of 10.
