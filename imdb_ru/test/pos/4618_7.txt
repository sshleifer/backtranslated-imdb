This film, shown in 2006 at the Cannes Film Festival and received a certain fame, seems to be another modern and deep school drama. <br /> <br /> This is a group of teenagers who are experiencing a frank and desperate day at school. Everything revolves around suicide — shown to some extent at the very beginning — it happens at 2:37 PM. All characters are somehow connected with each other. What drives them is described in short interviews, strictly in b / w. The characters are well written, the acting is intriguing (especially Teresa Palmer as Melody and Frank Sweet as Marcas discoveries). <br /> <br /> Let's stick to the movie technique. This is what really impressed me. Cuts rarely happen, most of the time the camera follows one of the main characters, as in “The Elephant” by Gus van Sants. Some scenes are presented more often than once, but each time from a different point of view (here: the character). It certainly causes a slowly developing, but exciting atmosphere that literally draws you in. The colors are bright, for some reason inappropriate, given the complex plot - but this is nothing but a clever contrast, a disturbing “all is well”. Using lighting adequately all the time, emphasizing the real mood of the characters. And finally, there are decent musical places. <br /> <br /> 2:37 somehow itches from the start. This is not a compromise and does not serve laughter. Rather, it binds together what psychologists define as moments of terror. This film largely focuses on emotional chasms. There is no one who could not cope with any neurosis, even the depicted minor parts (for example, teachers) seem to be in a state of confusion. And this is what prevents this film from being really good. Summing up the penetrating tragedies is unreal to the bone. No: friendship, love, smile, true, passion. There is: pretense, humiliation, despair, illness and beating. It is like being hit hard in the face all the time, but after the first hour you were numb. This click continues to beat you, until in the end he finds something very instructive. <br /> <br /> For the fact that he is sensitive and acted magnificently: 9. For the fact that he is technically innovative and original: 9. For the fact that he is one-dimensional: 3. br /> <br /> Makes solid 7 out of 10.
