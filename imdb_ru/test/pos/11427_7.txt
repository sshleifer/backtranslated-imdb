“Dirt and Sand” is one of Stan Lorel’s fakes of popular films at the time, in this film “The Blood and Sand” by Rudolph Valentino (hence Stan is Rhubarb’s Vaselino rhubarb). Although this is partly contradictory in characterization (how he defeated these bulls at first, is not explained), it was mostly funny from beginning to end, when one of the best episodes was a dance that he performs with his then common-law wife, May Laurel. Another funny episode concerns his unwillingness to talk with the femme fatale Filet de Sole, while his wife, Caramel, is waiting for him, which shows some glimpses of his later innocent character with Oliver Hardy. It is worth seeing to anyone who is interested in seeing Mr. Laurel’s early work before his fateful team, which made him popular throughout the world.
