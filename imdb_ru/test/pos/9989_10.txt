I thought this movie was incredible. I absolutely loved it, although my brothers are not that many. The special effects were outstanding, and this film is about my favorite sport; golf. The only thing that disappointed us in this amazing film is that it is difficult to watch it twice or more in a row. This film simply surpasses everything else I've ever seen. That was all I expected from the movie. I just loved it. In addition, it was quite child friendly. This film helped me realize that when you think about it, everything is possible. I would give a clean 10/10! It was better than The Legend of Baggara Vants, and the two Pirates of the Caribbean films put together. Absolutely amazing. Loved it.
