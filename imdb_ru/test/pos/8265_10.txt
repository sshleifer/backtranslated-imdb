I am lucky that I have a quality copy of my VHS on DVD, so I can watch it again and again. The characters are so well played that I cannot find fault with any aspect of casting. So there are a few differences from the book, but the old cliche of love conquering everything is depicted so powerfully that it does not matter. The reality of life in the countryside of England in the early 19th century contrasts beautifully with the changing seasons: from winter biting to beautiful summer days, and this is reflected in different characters, from the brave father Prue to Kester's all-consuming love. A story that changed my life.
