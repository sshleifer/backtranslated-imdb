Recently I was at a birthday party with five other girls of all my age (eleven). We all thought it would be some kind of innocuous little film, such as Jaws, which I decided to rent with Rat Race. (We watched “Rat Races After Strangers Call” to ease our fear.) We shoot the movie at 11:00 am and lie in our sleeping bags, which hide behind their covers most of the time. I screamed five times, which is unusual for me, since I’m scared in the movies, but I’m never so scared to really scream. <br /> <br /> We were all terrified, even leaving the bedroom, as we were all confident that Stalker (Jenkins) as we called him for some reason) would get to us. I played a cruel joke; when all the rat races were over, I hid under a sleeping bag and said quietly and quietly: “Did you check the baby?” They all screamed like nuts and were so scared. In general, I would rate this film as 9. The only thing I didn’t like was that 1. There were too many false alarms when Jill thinks there is a Stalker and 2. The children never woke up during all this, while Jenkins kidnapped them and hid them in a closet, and all they did was cry like children. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a thriller. But one thing: I AM SO CHILD PAST 9:00 PM NEVER AGAIN!
