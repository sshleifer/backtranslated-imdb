Jimmy Van Yu, a genuine Asian superstar, shot and filmed this film, which I only saw in dubbed video. The widescreen form (Shaw Scope!) Was lost, and the voices of the original actor were absent, but it is still nice to watch. History is a common martial arts school that fights villains from Japan, and our young hero finally wins by beating many different thugs. <br /> <br /> As the movie unfolds, the fight gets better. At the beginning of the movie, it looks tough and boring, but later there is a wonderful scene where Wang Yu fights with hordes in the slot machine, then enters the snowy scene and defeats several more villains with knives, sword and fists. This part is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Then not bad, but it would be interesting to see a non-duplicated widescreen version, if there is one.
