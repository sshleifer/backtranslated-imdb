In a small, picturesque Sicilian village, someone cruelly kills young, sexually curious boys. Local police continue to try to track down the killer and reduce the list to five or so major suspects, including because of the voyeurs Giuseppe (Vito Passeri) and the elusive, rough, voodoo-waving witch of a forest witch named Makiar (Florinda Bolkan), there are also Don Alberto (Marc Popel), a handsome young priest who runs the boyâ€™s local school, Andrea (Thomas Milian), a policeman who helps the police, and the beautiful Patricia (Barbara Boucher) are magnificent but seriously stoned. an addict who seems to have something for very (I mean, VERY) young boys. As with the giallo subgenre, the plot will not be fully revealed until the last few shots, but if you can hold out there long enough, this film will pay off. The script (written by Fulci, Gianfranco Clerici and Roberto Janviti) reduces red herrings to a minimum and will keep you interesting, and the story is skillfully supported by excellent work on location, cinematography (Sergio D'Offisi) and musical score (Reese Ortolani). The game, especially Bolkan, is also very good. Fulci fans, who were weaned off from his 80s groteskers, such as THE BEYOND and ZOMBIE, will find here more artistry and less blood than they might have expected, but they will still enjoy a particularly disgusting chain beating around the stage at the cemetery ( strangely, but effectively, he put on the ballad of singer Ornella Vanoni "Quei giorni insieme a te") and a long landslide on the rocky embankment that Fulci liked so much that he used it again in his film "Psyche" (1977). The scenes of the murdered children are mostly hidden from the screen (except for a brief strangulation), but the camera does not hesitate to linger on their corpses. The film was not released theatrically in America and, probably due to some anti-Catholic elements in the storyline, received only a limited theatrical release in Europe.
