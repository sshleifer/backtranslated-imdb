If you have ever seen a Bollywood movie, you know that it is longer than most movies because of a few songs and dances (each of them lasts more than five minutes). Fortunately, this program has fewer songs and dances, and it fits into the “standard” length of the film. Don't get me wrong, I like Bollywood movies, but, as a rule, they quickly move in songs and dances. I bought this DVD because I am a fan of Ian Bohen. Although his role was not as big as I had hoped, he still had a lot of time on screen. And his character was very different from his other roles. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a good movie. As with most Bollywood films, there is at least one element of contradiction / conflict in traditional Indian culture. But true love overcomes adversity, and a happy ending comes to all.
