Any Batman fan will know how good the films are, they have had great success. Batman returns, however, is definitely the best movie in the series. The combination of excellent direction, great acting and setting makes it worth watching during the night. <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, the director of this film, specifically made sure that this film provides a realistic atmosphere, and he did a great job. Danny Devito (Penguin) is a man who inherited penguin traits as a child and grew up to become a disgusting and ugly ... man! Michelle Pfiffer plays the sleek and very seductive Catwoman after the cats gave her the bite genes. The result in both character changes is excellent, and Catwoman and Penguin man play a very important role in this excellent film. A mysterious cat-woman is very fun to watch - her classic sayings and a funny part in which jumping with a whip in a jewelry store adds a movie to this fun. Danny DeVito also succeeds, his ability to impersonate some strange creature was vital, and he adds a wonderful atmosphere to the film that brings us back to the dull sewers where he lives. <br /> <br /> You can't forget Batman, though. Michael Keaton again demonstrates a comfortable performance and shows us the other side of Batman. His love diminishes when he encounters a catwoman at the end of the film, and his meetings with her when she is a normal person, Selina Kyle, lead him to be seduced badly in his own home. After they leave, there is the smart part, and the film is full of wonderful scenes. It is worth noting that the mobile phone of Bruce Wayne Bat is not used as often as in other Batman films, as this movie uses scenes of melee and storytelling. <br /> <br /> The winter setting in Gotham City is beautifully created, as most of the scenes happen at night and the city is filled with snow. Therefore, if you watch this film in the summer, like me, it does not feel the same. It is best to watch it in the winter. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a terrific movie. All the merit of Tom Burton and the actors, they did an incredible job.
