My son Adam (5 years old) is a big fan of Scooby-Doo. He really likes this movie. He especially liked it when the monster Loch Ness tried to attack Shaggy and Scooby. Voting is his choice and reflects his love for the characters. <br /> <br /> When the movie “The Vampire Stone” was the first, then this, not surprisingly, was very similar, as they repeat the worn out main plot in different settings. <br /> <br /> Few adults will face this without having their own memories of the television series, and even less will watch it without children. You either like it or like it. I loved Scooby-Doo for half an hour as a child, I'm happy that my son loves it, I can just put up with it.
