I totally agree with GarryJohal’s Singapore commentary on this film. Quote: "Yes, not Singaporeans can not understand what is wrong with this movie." Some of the references in this film fly over the heads of foreign viewers, and it’s mostly Singaporeans who “get” it. This is still not entirely true, and, like the Malaysian-Chinese, I "understand", although I do not speak the Hokkien language, because we have similar "problems" in Malaysia. I know that it’s really hard to understand and accept it as REALITY, but it is definitely NOT “not a true story.” I was pleased to see this film outside of Malaysia, because it will and will definitely be banned in Malaysia. This means that you either get it in the form of "illegally copied VCDs or DVDs," or you hope that someone will be kind enough to "share" this on the Internet. This is not “another violent teenage drama .......”, because it represents an interesting reality that exists in Singapore (and in Malaysia) (sad + humor). I was a little sad to know that this film received about 20 censorship cuts. What a waste!
