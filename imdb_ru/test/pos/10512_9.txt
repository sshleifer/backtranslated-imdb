This one gets better with each new look. Of course, one of the best roles of Paul Sorvino. A great musical score that was also outstanding on the LP audio track (so why not a CD?). One of the earliest releases of Dolby Stereo Sound. By the way, the original 35mm theatrical trailer for this is really BIG!
