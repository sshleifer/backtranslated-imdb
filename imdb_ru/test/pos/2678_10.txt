Wow, this is, in my opinion, the best comedic film since Friends. If you had a shitty day, just sit with a beer (if you are old enough, that is. If you don't need root beer) and watch a couple of episodes, this is the perfect recipe for happiness. /> <br /> What I like the most is the fact that everyone in the series is very funny, and they all have a fantastic time for comedy. After a while you become attached to the characters and really care about them. I think the secret to the success of the show is that they have an enviable life. Dag is fat, but still pleased with this, he loves his wife, his work and his friends. The test is a fly in the ointment, but it is not perfect.
