I did not plan to leave the review, but after seeing other horrible reviews of this film, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give out the ending or something like that, but I give some important plot points in this review, so you should know about it. A short (non-spoiler) version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Gina Davis both dig up in this film, and it's a lot of fun. Watch it. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites of all time. Gina Davis is as beautiful as a militant heroine, torn between her present life as a housewife and mother, and memories that return to her former life as a CIA killer. Her performance is excellent, as she plays both sides of this relatively complex character perfectly. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson, as always, is as magnificent as the Private Investigator, who was hired by the character of Gina Davis to study her forgotten past. He plays great the unwitting assistant of hard character Gina Davis. Some of the lines he utters in this film are the best he has ever used in any film in which he was. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you haven't seen it, do it. This is a fantastic story with many unexpected turns, and it is very well directed and acted.
