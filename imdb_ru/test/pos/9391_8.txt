“Death Bed: A Bed That Eats” is a very strange horror film that you really have to watch in order to be believed. There is an ancient four-poster bed that just loves to eat people, and it does so at any time that it can tempt anyone to lie. on this. There is also a long-dead artist imprisoned behind one of his paintings, which provides a voice-over. George Barry is the first and only film that offers some truly surreal moments, such as a bed that absorbs its victims with a mysterious sea of ​​yellow foam and liquid. The atmosphere is dreamy, and there is only a little blood in it, unfortunately, the room is rather stupid, and acting skills are amateur. Nevertheless, as an admirer of an unusual movie, I enjoyed this low-budget oddity. chance.8 out of 10.
