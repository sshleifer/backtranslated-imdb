I need help identifying the King of Queens episode. It all starts with the scene where Doug is on the phone with Carrie, and he offers to agree to stop ending each conversation with the words "I love you." However, it is difficult to do, and he ends up calling her back, only to end with the words "I love you." This is a very smart moment, and I think it says a lot about relationships that have been going on for a long time. <br /> <br /> I THINK (but I am sure) that this is the very episode in which Doug meets local builders. to whistle and throw wicked comments at Carrie to cheer her up. <br /> <br /> I recently saw this episode, but it was probably a replay. I don't know which network I saw it on. Can anyone tell me the name and season of this episode?
