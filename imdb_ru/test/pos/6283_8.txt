I was filmed as a Surfer Dude in beach scenes. Almost got the role of a courageous guy, since the real muscular guy was really very late that day. Paulie asked my brother and me (a skateboarder in front of the tattoo site) to do some intermediate things live from Venice, since he was still working on his MTV. This movie is really good. If I were not in it, I would be in the top 100 ........?
