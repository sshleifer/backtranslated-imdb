I really did not expect this. Roy Andersson pulled me out, I am a perfect static camera lover (long live King Borovchik!), And I laughed hysterically during the first fifteen minutes of the film, he hit me right in the eye. You have to be a brilliant person so that self-pity is funny. Andersson reminds me of the third assistant on Pecode in Moby Dick, Flask, a man who has seen his whole life as a practical joke, which the kind gentleman himself has played with us. And the web of egoism in this film is truly fun. <br /> <br /> The level of satire at the limit, you have one deceptive harp, the pitiful dreamer about the cruelty of the world, and then completely ignoring spiritual self-reflection, crying in agony. The depths of egoism are at a height. I really never thought that you could go further than Bergman’s “Silence” in this regard. However, the grotesque self-love and self-esteem of each character in this film is staggering. We are shown existence where the mediocre and idle opponents of the world, who, in their opinion, are unfair to them, are indeed legends in their own living rooms. People in this film make self-deception and self-deception a great art form! <br /> <br /> It seems that only one woman in the film understands what is happening. An elderly woman who refuses to leave the chapel and knelt, praying for the forgiveness of all mankind, her speech is the most exciting condemnation of the modern world that I have ever heard. In her prayers, she reveals that what is wrong with the world cannot be corrected by simple tinkering, there are not just a few mistakes, there is an abyss of corruption that can be corrected only by self-immolation and judgment. When I watch this film, I remember a naked monk who stood at midnight in the cold river, shouting out a thousand sins of Kririev for the sins of humanity. Another great nonsense is that it is clear that her prayers are useless, and in fact she does not allow everyone to go home during the closing hours. <br /> <br /> This is not a film for the self-satisfied, no one spared, no idol remained on the altar, not a single group of people was blamed for the glory of another group. There has never been a greater, more transcendent, more surprisingly beautiful summation of our sins. This is a film about the end of the world, this is a great joke, a great disgusting practical joke of human life! <br /> <br /> From the image catalog it’s too difficult to choose a favorite, I slapped my thigh and nearly fell off a chair in a movie theater, screaming with laughter when a man tried to pull the tablecloth out of service. I will not spoil what is happening, but the tension is growing, and something really unexpected happens. This is probably the funniest thing I've ever seen in a movie. I am quite restrained and simply could not control myself: this is the greatness of this film. <br /> <br /> The shooting of “You, Live” is impeccable. We are shown the artist's palette, dirty brown, yellow, gray and sky blue, revived from the shock of luminous copper textures. There is never an inappropriate tone, it’s like an hour and a half of symphonic whistle-colored colors. The obsession that must have led to the creation of this color scheme is extraordinary. And not a single shot is in vain, as in all great movies, there is not a single inch of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best movie I've ever seen.
