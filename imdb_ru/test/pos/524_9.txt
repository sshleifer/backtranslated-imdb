This film must be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece with a bizarre and dark movie about four different stories from four different places in Sweden. The one in which the hotel was recently renovated with an unsuitable wooden figure of the old Minister of Finance is the absolute best of four strange love stories or careers. I would like to see all four as a movie on my own, they can be much longer. <br /> <br /> In addition, a unique pause in the middle is something I have never seen before. <br /> <br /> Can't wait for the series (if they do) or extended DVD. Apparently, they cut a lot in just 3.5 hours.
