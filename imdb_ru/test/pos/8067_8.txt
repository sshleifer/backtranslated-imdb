Annie Rooney lives with her officer, father and brother Tim in the slums of New York, where she constantly engages in many fights with other neighbors children. According to officer Rooney, Annie is secretly in love with Joe Kelly (whose younger brother Mickey leads the gang, with which Annie is constantly fighting). Kelly sponsors a dance where Tony plans to shoot Kelly to argue with him for what he looks like a fool to his girlfriend, but instead officer Kelly is mortally wounded. Tony and his friend Spyder tell Tim (part of Kelly's gang) that Kelly shot his father, so he follows him in revenge. Annie finds out about this and goes to stop her brother if she has time. A very good combination of humor and heart in this film, although the plot begins no earlier than 40 minutes of the film. Pickford is pleasant (despite the fact that she was 33 years old when she played a girl no older than 12-13 years old), and he really understands her character. Haynes does not play Kelly as hard as he should, but is able to make the viewer feel him on an emotional level. The scenes where the officer tells Annie about her father's death and ending really cause a lump in your throat. Mixing all sorts of children throughout the film is fun to watch. Rating, 8.
