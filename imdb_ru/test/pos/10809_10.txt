This is one of the best French Revolution films ever made. Being a man well versed in the period, I was amazed at the level of detail. Suits on the spot. Even detailed small everyday items such as ink tanks, serving plates, etc., are all flawless. As an American living in France who has access to sites in the film due to his membership in various historical associations such as the Napoleonic Alliance, I cannot help but say how impressed I was with the visual accuracy of the film. /> Dialogue in which virtual quotes are known, and where it is not recorded - a symbol. I was very pleased with this film and was disappointed that it was not yet on DVD. This is how historical drama should occur. Must see ....
