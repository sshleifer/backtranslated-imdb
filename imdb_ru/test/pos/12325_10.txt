I watched thousands of films in my life, and I believe that this film is the most "perfect" film ever made. By ideal, I mean story-telling, plot, acting, staging, cinematography, etc. (This is a non-professional opinion; I have no experience in filmmaking.) Many films have perfect scenes, such as the bartender reporting to a cop in the movie Fargo . (Indeed, this scene can play quite well.) In The Dead, each scene is perfected, which makes the whole movie perfect. Perhaps John Houston sold his soul to the Devil to make such a film. Hopefully Daniel Webster pulled him out of the contract!
