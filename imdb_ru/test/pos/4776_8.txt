Created in 1928 and originally named Mortimer before Walt Disney changed its name (because he was convinced by his wife), Mickey Mouse became one of the main products of the Disney brand. I always thought that this cartoon was the first cartoon with Mickey, in fact he is his third, but it doesn’t matter, for a six-minute short animation film it’s nice. The story says that Mickey pilots the ship until Captain Pete takes him off the bridge, stops to pick up the cargo, and Minnie Mouse misses the boat. Rising, she throws her musical sheets, and the goat eats them, Mickey helps her to twist her tail and play the melody, forcing other animals to play the drums, until Pete comes again to stop him, forcing Mickey to peel the potatoes. Mickey Mouse was number 53 in 100 of the greatest icons of pop culture, and he was number 31 in 100 of the greatest cartoons. Fine!
