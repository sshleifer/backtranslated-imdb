The Golden Door is a story about a Sicilian family’s journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, convinces his family to leave their homeland in Sicily, to make a difficult journey through the raging sea and to live on land, the rivers of which supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the sake of the New World, their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The images of the New World are optimistic, intelligent and very creative. Silver coins fall from the sky at Salvatore when he predicts how prosperous he will be in the New World; it is shown that carrots and onions, twice as large as humans, harvest to offer wealth and health, and rivers of milk flowed and flowed in the minds of those who foresee what the New World will bring. All these images are surrealistically intertwined with the characters and help pleasantly complement the sandy realism that history reveals to the audience. The contrast between these images and the dark reality of the Sicilians helps to find hope while they are on board the ship in the New World. <br /> <br /> Journey to the New World is removed almost in complete darkness, especially when sea storms roar and almost kill people inside. The dark reality of which I spoke is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World. The Old World is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive. This is evident from the fact that Salvatore fights together to sell the little he has left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) to get the appropriate clothes he needs to enter the New World. I thought it was rather interesting that these people believed that they had to comply with a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the New World; It was almost assumed that people must conform to a certain stereotype or form in order to be recognized as morally acceptable. The strongest image in the film was when the ship leaves its homeland and goes to the New World. This picture shows a top view of a crowd of people who seem to be slowly separating from each other, depicting the separation between the Old and New Worlds. This picture also suggested that people were cut off from everything that had once been familiar, wanted to divorce their former dismal living conditions, and sought to enter a world that promised more. <br /> <br /> How later they contrasted the way the New World looks like, the Old World seems dark and gloomy compared to the bright but foggy New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty never shows through the fog on Ellis Island, but remains hidden. I think it was a deliberate guiding choice that seemed to nullify the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty symbolizes: “Give me your poor, tired, and hungry,” seemed like a joke about what these people should pass when arriving in the New World. When they arrived in America, they had to undergo rather humiliating tests (that is, to learn mathematics, puzzles, etc.), in order to show that they were suitable for the New World. These tests have completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people. In particular, mother Salvatore had the most difficult time to obey the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more outraged than with respect. Where once their dreams gave hope and optimism about what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World demanded was scornful and crude. Salvatore does not make much difference, except for his attitude to what he feels like the New World will be compared to the fact that the New World actually seemed to him disappointing. This attitude was shared mainly by everyone who traveled with him. Their characters are dealing with a cherished dream that was very upset, and with a dark reality that had to be accepted. <br /> <br /> The film seems to contain a strong commentary on preparing yourself for entry into a heavenly and civilized society. Cleanliness, marriage, and intellect are prerequisites. Following these rules should prevent the domination of disease, immoral behavior and stupidity. Perhaps this is a comment about how America learned from the failures of other countries, and therefore was deliberately set to protect itself from the fact that these epidemics did not overrun or destroy. Although the rules seemed tough, they were there to protect and help people thrive.
