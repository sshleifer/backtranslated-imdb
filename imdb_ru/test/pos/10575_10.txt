It was a really amazing adaptation. I missed the first episode, so I, unfortunately, missed the connection between the characters and the smooth flow of the storyline. But as soon as I looked at the second and then the third installment, I was just blown away. I ordered the DVD in less than a week and, unable to wait for it to appear, went right out and brought the book. From the moment I opened it, I was hooked, I just could not tear myself away. I decided to finish the whole book before I even dare to watch the DVD. I preferred the book because it penetrated the consciousness of the characters, you could fully understand where they come from and what was the role in the story. They missed a lot because of the adaptation, which was disappointing, because the book is a masterpiece, and I think they could do it great if they could stretch it for a longer period of time. But, considering only the possibility of installation in a 3-hour slot, I think it was done perfectly. He brilliantly followed the main curved storyline. And the actors who were credited as the main characters, where amazing! The love scene was very beautiful. It was so tender and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be. I was completely amazed by both the adaptation of the book and the television! I loved both the previous Sarah Waters novels, and I also liked the Tipping Velvet adaptation. But when I read and watched Fingersmith, I knew that none of her previous novels / adaptations could win. Sarah Waters really outdid herself this time! I recommend you to watch this adaptation! If the Velvet tip is not your thing, then don't let it push you away. Fingersmith is a completely new ball game. This is a beautiful, but dark, perverted story about love, greed and betrayal ... <br /> <br /> MUST BE SEEN!
