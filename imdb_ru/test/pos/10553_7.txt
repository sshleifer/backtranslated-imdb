I have a problem with snobs from movies who believe that Americans are inept semi-literate people who are unable to appreciate the subtlety of more sophisticated Europeans, Les Francais, Les Italiens ... almost any person from le Continong for whom English is a foreign language. If the humor in My Father Hero is different from the Mon Pere ce heros humor, it is because the French sense of humor is different from the American one. No better, no smarter, just different. If you think that for Hollywood it’s stupid to “borrow” from French cinema, just think how much French cinema borrowed from Hollywood, first. Where would Belmondo and Delon be without Bogart? Truffaut without Hitchcock? Jerry Lewis - no. Famous for his refined and cerebral style, idolater in France. Go to the figure ........ Monsieur Depardieu is exceptionally good as the unfortunate divorced father of a premature 14-year-old daughter, resting in the Bahamas together. Unnoticed by him, she presents him to other people in the hotel as her lover, to make her more interesting for the boy she has her eye on. Not surprisingly, complications will follow. There are funny inserts in the Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac, and M. Dephardier is very good - naturally. He makes a good impression of Maurice Chevaler with “Thank Heaven for Little Girls”, which is actually funny and quite sharp, as his audience, all of whom consider him a lover of a 14-year-old girl, get up and leave together. - two, when he leaves, blissfully unaware of what is happening. When he turns around at the end of the song to acknowledge the expected applause, his expression is priceless. Without it, the film would really be very average. With his huge trembling figure dominating the screen, it would be very fun. No cookies, no six packs - just a real human being. Awful
