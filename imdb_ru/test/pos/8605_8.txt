After the atomic bomb hit Hiroshima, the charred bodies lie around, the deformed victims try to communicate with relatives who cannot even recognize them, and one person after another dies of radiation sickness. This black and white film, though sad and scary, is not devoid of humor. The story revolves around a young woman, Yasuko, who was hit by black rain after an explosion. She is trying to get married, but everyone continues to die, and people are worried that the same will happen to her. Having found a suitable assistant (who goes mad after a long stay in the war), she eventually shows signs of radiation sickness. This film is a magnificent image of atomic attacks on Japan, it will scare you and, perhaps, make you cry. The acting is good, not too dramatic, like many other ww2 films that were shot.
