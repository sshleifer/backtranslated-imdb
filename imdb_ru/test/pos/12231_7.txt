Most Christmas movies have a ransom theme, but most have a variation on a very similar plot. This film is stupid and has an unusual plot. You may have to hang there during the first half, where events may seem hard to believe in movies (but not as unbelievable as in real life - Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, says he never came up with anything in his cartoons - all based on real stories told to him by his fans). The second half begins to fit the plot. I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> By the way, one of the reviewers noted that the idea that someone does not have cash is not credible at ATMs these days, but it is likely that if you lost your wallet - who carries cards ATMs anywhere else while on a business trip?
