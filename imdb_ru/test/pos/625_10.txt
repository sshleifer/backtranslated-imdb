This is definitely one of the scariest and most enchanting films ever made. You are stuck in the film from the very beginning to the very end. Even though there are some plot holes, it continues to be exciting to the final autopsy. In addition to "8 MM" and "Peeping Tom", this is one of the best films about "Snuff films", the taboo topic of our culture. If you like the SCREAM trilogy, you will probably like this one.
