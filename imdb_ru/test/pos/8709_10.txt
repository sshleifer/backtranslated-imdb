This is one of my all time favorite cheap, banal vampire movies. <br /> <br /> Underwear model Calvin Klein ... oh, I mean, Stefan the Good Vampire, returns to Transylvania to ascend to the throne of the Royal Vampire family, but with a weakened manicure and forever drooling half-brother Radu there are other plans. After killing their father, the King of Vampires, Radu is now aiming at Stephen, a new mortal friend of Stephen Michelle and her two pretty friends, and an almighty Bloodstone. <br /> <br /> Well, the scenery is beautiful, and it should be the way it was shot on the spot in Transyl-fricken-vania for goodness sake. Actresses are not so good, and Stefan, the Heroic Vampire, is as charming as poker with a chilled fireplace, but who cares? There is only one reason to watch this movie, and its name is RADU! He is a physical respect for Nosferatu, and he has the best lines in the film, they are all pronounced in the hoarse voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day. The festival's graveyard scene is one of the best scenes in the film, as Radu slowly approaches the camera and shows her grinning, slobbering face to the world. I found myself cheering on him when he gathered the victims and mocked his ideal brother. But maybe I'm just sick. In addition to the dubious taste in men, I strongly recommend this film to vampire lovers. This is original, fun, and Radu is one of the best vampires I have seen in a long time ... much more fun than the hard, tragic, aching larvae of the Undead, which today endlessly adorn horror screens. Radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. He is what a vampire should be.
