So, this series seems to be on the way “back on the road!” Week after week, David Morse's character helps him on the trip, which is a bit of a pickle - but what's wrong with that? David Morse is one of the greatest actors of the characters, and certainly the coolest, and having him in the series created by David Kepp, the great writer, is heaven !! <br /> <br /> Due to the lack of love for this show from many, I cannot see it coming during the season of the season - but you never know? The amount of garbage that surpassed me confuses me - let's hope that something good can pass through the first series !!!
