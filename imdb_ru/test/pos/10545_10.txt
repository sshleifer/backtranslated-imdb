I can honestly tell you that this movie is the most amazing movie ever !!! If you're in the mood for comedy, I fully recommend this movie! So, here is a summary. There is this girl (Nikki), who is fourteen and a half years old, and she goes on vacation with her father (Andre), whom she has not seen for about two years. She expects the holidays to be completely boring until she meets this boy (Ben), who is much older than her. Therefore, in order to impress him, she says that she is not on vacation with her father, but with her lover. This is a hysterical film from start to finish, and I highly recommend it. Rent it and enjoy !!!
