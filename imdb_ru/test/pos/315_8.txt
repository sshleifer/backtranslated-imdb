Apocalypse Now Redux, Francis Ford Coppola's military opus, is probably the most beautiful war movie I've ever seen. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Shin) - a soldier from Vietnam who is called to send to Cambodia a very dangerous and extremely secret mission to "end the position" of Colonel Kurz (Marlon Brando), a high-ranking and respected military man, who seemed completely mad and deserted from army, creating their own small society and helped the cult following soldiers. Accompanying him upriver to Cambodia is a handful of naval forces, and along the way they encounter several interesting people (primarily Kilgore Robert Duvall, a retaining lieutenant colonel with weakened screws) and some terrifying situations. <br /> <br /> Apocalypse is a less historical film about war than a philosophical and psychological study. This is more of an “all-metal shell” than a “platoon”. The duration of the Apocalypse is more than three hours, but the film is so surprisingly dynamic and convincing that when the end of the film came, I was actually surprised by the amount of past tense. Nevertheless, beautiful cinematography, of course, is what stood out for me the most. After seeing this film, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in the history of cinema. All the films of The Godfather were painted almost sepia, and the shadows created a feeling of baroque composition. In the Apocalypse, the incredible use of natural light, and shadows, especially in scenes with Brando and Sheena, almost become living characters, they are so common and effective. Another great scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederick Forrest) were in the jungle in search of mangoes and came across a tiger. The enormous vastness of the surrounding foliage (leaves the size of a house) made the characters almost liliput, but the coloring of the scene was incredible. While everything else was almost muted gray, the leaves were incredibly bright green, an effect that was particularly striking. Another really insignificant positive moment in the film was the gorgeous scene when helicopters carrying Duval and company attacked a small village playing Wagner. It might just be an ultra-dramatic soundtrack for the stage, but instead, Coppola turns the song into a real part of the stage, and Duval noted that he likes to play it while they are approaching to “scare them to hell.” ". <br /> <br /> The performances in Apocalypse are first-class. Much has been made of the amount of money that Brando has earned for the film, and the number of problems he has caused. Regardless, he showed powerful performance in a relatively short screen time. Is Shin completely outstanding - is this the first time I see him really unleashed in a movie ?? and Duval is very fun to watch Kilgore's psycho. Apocalypse Now is a film that is now so popular in pop culture (most people know a few lines from the film I Like the Smell of Napalm in the Morning, etc.), but I didn’t know much about it, that there were many surprises left to go through . I have not seen the original fragment of the Apocalypse Now, so I can not compare it with this new version, but this is a film that is certainly worth seeing. 8/10 <br /> <br /> - Shelley
