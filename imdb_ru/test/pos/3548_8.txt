10 respected directors shot a short film with opera arias as inspiration (and music). I will do each separately: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Rogh (director) - Giuseppe Verdi (music). The story of the attempt in 1931 in Vienna. Teresa Russell (Robs' wife) plays a man! Not bad - very beautiful and exotic. Russell is great. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - Verdi. No history, but there are some obtrusive black and white images that blend perfectly with the music. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Goddard - Jean Baptiste Lully. Terrible. It is senseless, boring, there is no plot, there is nothing. Filled with free female nudity. Worse! <br /> <br /> Temple Julien - Verdi. Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo and Anita Morris starred in this funny, albeit obvious story about a cheating couple. Pretty good. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - Erich Korngold. Short, lush and romantic. Very good. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - Jean-Philippe Rameau. Stupid. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Fran Roddam - Richard Wagner. This is Bridget Fonda in her film debut. A beautifully made love story with a pretty frank sex scene. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - Giacomo Puccini. Really strange, but good. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - Gustave Chapantier. Lyrical view of youth and old age. Very cute. <br /> <br /> The last is Bill Bryden performing “I, Palyachi”. He has John Hurt (!), Dressed like a clown, screaming Caruso’s lip (!!!). <br /> <br /> When it came out, he almost received an X rating (for abundant nudity and a sex scene), He received R with a strict warning that the R rating would be strictly followed. After the film exploded, this warning disappeared. <br /> <br /> The idea is not bad, and 6 out of 10 segments were worth it. Worth seeing, even if you dislike opera. Just avoid the Godard segment. I give it 8.
