This 8-minute gem is not only timeless, but also a milestone from cartoons. This is the third cartoon of Mickey and one of his best. This is a milestone cartoon, because she was the first with sound. And, my God, even after more than 70 years is very good, and gives real additional weight to the story. Black and white animation is excellent, and character traits are convincing enough. The music is wonderful, I like the soundtrack, it adds fun to the cartoon, no matter how subtle it is. And a funny cartoon! So many memorable moments, like cow teeth used as a xylophone, and their udders as a bagpipe. The characters are also attractive, Mickey and Minnie, the two iconic characters of Disney, well voiced by Walt Disney, and Pete perfectly serves as the "villain of the piece." In general, “Steamboat Willie” is a timeless jewel that everyone should see at least once. 10/10 Bethany Cox
