Really wonderful movie. Bruce Willis gives this film-message his outstanding romantic comedy and acting power, and this film gives hope to the losers, which many of us know. A gift to every middle-aged person whose time spent seems complete and empty: there is something else around the next bend, and it can be great, enriching and romantic. Leave the recent past and go back to the lessons of the distant past, and then go to your favorite flight to your best future. If we could relive our youthful experience, if we could really recall the events that shaped us, wouldn't we find a special kind of freedom? Watch the movie, open the gift.
