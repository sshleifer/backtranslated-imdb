I went to watch this movie with care. The suicidal “comedy” did not seem consistent. Having a brother who tried to commit suicide, and seeing the devastation that caused our entire family, I know firsthand how difficult it is to solve this problem. I have to say - this film deals with a way that allows the viewer to "inside" someone who suffers and simply does not know why or how to stop it. Although the film is not perfect, he respects the subject and, more importantly, makes it accessible to the masses. I know that for our family, humor helped us cope with pain. Both Max and Grace are what he foretells - a suicidal comedy. This is fun - and I also felt that the characters were real and bright. It is also extremely clever, but simple. This shortens the chase, and I appreciate it! I give it 9 and will recommend it.
