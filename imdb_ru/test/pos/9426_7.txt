Since others complained that Sherlock Holmes was in a modern situation, I will not do that. Vasily Rathbone could fit in any era with such a voice, this bright voice. This is a well-crafted puzzle based on Dancing People, one of the best stories of Conan Doyle. Instead of the original conspiracy, he makes men part of the Nazi conspiracy. Holmes becomes the representative of the British military efforts. His opponent is Moriarity, who seems to die often enough to compete with the central figure in the movies on Friday the 13th. Of course, he is creative, but Rathbone Holmes is imperturbable. Watson is just ready to ride this. In this film, he does not give a lot of nonsense, and this is a real plus. The plot is complex enough to maintain interest. There is a closing speech, which is almost a parody of itself. But then I can not criticize the time and the nation, which was under great pressure. If they need to call Holmes, so be it.
