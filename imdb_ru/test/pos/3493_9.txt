The Ali G show was truly amazing - he was such a stupid imitator, but none of the respondents noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually a very smart guy who pretends to be stupid, so he can get really honest answers from people ... And this is very funny. So I did not expect the film to be good, because everything was shot - no real people or an interview. Thus, the main point of the entire show was lost. But I was wrong - I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Of course, it was stupid, but who cares if you can't actually brake with a car battery, as someone said? It was not supposed to be a realistic documentary ... And it doesn’t look like a show, it goes very differently, but that doesn’t mean that it’s bad. When I finished watching, I was completely impressed, but now that some time had passed, I realized that it was not so special, but still deserves nine - well, at least for what it should be.
