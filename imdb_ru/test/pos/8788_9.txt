Alfred Hitchcock's saboteur is not one of his most respected films; made between two much more popular and critically evaluated paintings, “Suspicions” and “Shadow of Doubt”, it is usually considered as less effort. I agree that a later film is groundbreaking, for the first time drawing Hitchcock into the American mainstream, but Saboteur is at least as alive as Suspicion; its main drawback is not the charismatic star players, Bob Cummings and Priscilla Lane. <br /> <br /> In Saboteur, we see Hitchcock literally sneaking around America as his main character travels from California to New York in search of the arsonist, for whose crime he was accused. Cummings is very young, and quite attractive. His boyish character (but not immaturity) is perfect for the character he portrays, and it seems appropriate, because the director, though of middle age, was in the process of rethinking himself, and the older, more established star could throw things off. The spontaneous heroine of Priscilla Lane, who was not typical for the director, was very common in American films at the time; and she and Cummings provide the openness and youth that the director needed in both his life and work at this time. I cannot imagine that older, more solid types, such as Cooper and Stanwyk, feel better, since there would be too much luggage between them. <br /> <br /> As this is the norm in Hitchcock films, everything is not as it seems. Saboteur differs from its more famous films in that the viewers get into the game early. Although Cummings is an accused arsonist, we know that he is innocent. Villains become apparent pretty soon; and the film is more dependent on the plot than on the irony. What pleasures happen, and here the Master does not disappoint. There is an interesting interlude between Tod Browning and some circus freaks that help Cummings escape from capture. In another scene, reminiscent of James Weil's "The Bride of Frankenstein", Cummings spends some time in the house of a blind man who, as it turns out, is Lane's uncle. Perhaps the director has studied key American films of the past decade? Be that as it may, these and other unusual and discursive aspects of the film give it playfulness and diversity, which, if you add the factor of very youthful roles, makes the picture look like the work of a young man who is still learning his skills. <br /> <br /> The later scenes of the film in New York are more disturbing and typical for the director, as the picture gradually becomes more slyly hithokistskoy as we move forward. In the end, I find it a satisfactory job; and since neither Cummings nor Lane has a dark side as an actor, neither is the film. It is intentionally lightweight, and I suspect that it is semi-experimental; Hitchcock's attempt to find out if he can make a story in the American context that he did so well in England. He excelled superbly. The next logical step: Shadow Of A Doubt, a film in which the main character travels from east to west, with a completely different set of values ​​and plans. <br /> <br />
