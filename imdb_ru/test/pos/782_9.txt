I only heard about driving lessons through ITV advertising, and, frankly, I did not know how much I would like it. I turned on the TV last night and was completely surprised. Driving lessons are a modest, simple film that has attracted you right from the start. Rupert Grint brilliantly plays the role of socially awkward teenager Ben. He is definitely one to watch in the future. Dame Yves Walton plays the awesome Julie Walters. I liked the simple plot and how the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the film for me was pretty colorful poem Evie. It shows how friendship can develop between the most unexpected couples. In my opinion, watching driving lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours. The landscape was astounding, especially in the countryside. Anyone who can call this sparkling comedy unforgettable, I strongly disagree with
