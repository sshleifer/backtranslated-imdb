This film accurately depicts the struggle for the typical East German life. Under the supervision of the secret police, friends and colleagues, most Easterners simply existed. <br /> <br /> Streltsy and Wetzel were two families who decided that they were no longer going to take it. <br /> <br /> Despite the extreme danger of escaping to the West, they feel that the benefits far outweigh the risks. John Hurt and Beau Bridges, depicting the heads of the families concerned, came up with the idea of ​​flying across the heavily fortified border of East Germany. <br /> <br /> There are tense moments when they gather and select the necessary materials for the flight. They work during the day and build a balloon at night, right under the noses of the authorities, one of which is Strelchik’s neighbor (Klaus Lovich). <br /> <br /> The first attempt, in which only archers participate, ends in failure when the balloon falls a few yards from the border. The broken balloon was discovered by the border guards, and a tireless search for conspirators who are determined to try again begins. Thanks to careful control over the sales of materials, Peter and Gunther still manage to purchase pieces and pieces of fabric with which they can build a second balloon so that they can be bitten off with a fingernail. The film also features the touching and effective soundtrack of the late Jerry Goldsmith.
