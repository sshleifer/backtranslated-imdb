Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr., where they played well in this film. This is a heartbreaking story that confirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just don't care. I think there was a lot of realism with characters. The screenwriter did not include racism in the film in the way most films do, which seemed to me to create a more realistic storyline. <br /> <br /> Script writers tend to introduce incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism, but usually go overboard. <br /> <br /> There are many cities like this where people of different races live harmoniously. Ed Harris had to be nominated for an Oscar, because he was great as a leader and trainer, realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side, helping Radio.
