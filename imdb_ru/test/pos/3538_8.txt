I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago, and a few days ago I didn’t see the original TV show, and it far surpasses the sequel. Well, this is not a million miles from the plot of the Seven, but it is still irresistible. Much of my praise is related to Ken Stott’s performance as DCI Red Metcalfe, a policeman who seems to have led a very unfortunate life and has a terrible secret. Stott would be easy to beat, but he plays the role in a rather subtle way. Similarly, the killings are very shocking, but - unlike the sequel, where the killings are committed on the screen in a rather OTT-way - in fact, there is little violence. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that the red herring was too obvious, the red herring, which meant that I was not absorbed by the spin twist (and you will probably see that the twist is spinning, so I I won’t worry about the spoiler warning), and that when the real killer was discovered, it seemed that both were a bit far removed and resulted in several plot holes in the story. If I remember correctly, the sequel had similar problems after the killer was discovered, so it might be a good idea not to do MESSIAH 3
