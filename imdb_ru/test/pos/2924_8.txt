Few people realize this, but in the ancient world there existed world literature before the advent of the Greeks. In addition to the literary remains that are in the "Old Testament" of the Jews, there were significant works from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The first summit was religious poetry and the Epic of Gilgamesh. The Egyptians released a lot of poems, but the main addition was the story of the adventures of the traveler and the doctor called "The History of Xinuha." It was from this work (in fact, a fragment about which we do not know the ending) that the novel "Egyptian" originated. <br /> <br /> The story is unique (as is the film). Egyptian was a bestseller in the early 1950s, and Darryl Zanuck decided to take a chance by doing this: yes, he wanted to demonstrate his girlfriend Bella Darvi as Nefer and the rest of the actors (Victor Matty, Edmund Purdom, Peter Ustinov, Michael Wilding and Gene Tierney), but he knew that these films rarely take off the big box office. This can be cited as an example of how Zanuk tried something else. <br /> <br /> The number of films about ancient Egypt is very small. "Land of the Pharaohs", "Egyptian", "Ten Commandments" (both versions of De Mille), "Moses", "Holy Moses!", "Cleopatra", "Mummy" (all versions), "Scorpion" King ". If there is 20 films about ancient Egypt are amazing, but “Egyptian” is unique. While the second “Ten Commandments” discusses Ramses the Great (Pharoah Ramses II - Yul Brynner) and his father Seth I (Cedric Hardwick), as well as Cleopatra films with her, in the film there are few other names of ancient Egypt. Egypt’s biggest pharaoh was Thutmose III, who conquered most of the famous Near about the Orient of 1470 BC or so. There was no film about him, nor about his predecessor-usurper, the first great woman-ruler in the history of Hatshepsut, but the only known pharaoh who tried to make a religious revolution close to what the Jews (and later Christians) did - monotheism, is the subject of “Egyptian.” This is Pharoah Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> Actually, Akhnaton practiced a personal form of monotheism, not intended for public consumption. But this angered the class of priests who worshiped Amon, not Aton. Because of our vague historical records (although the official records of Aknaton - the letters "Tel el-Aman" - are quite complete, how far they are preserved), we do not know whether Pharaoh was killed during a palace coup or not. No matter how he died, he was succeeded by his younger brother or son, whose name is better remembered than any other pharaoh, except Ramses: Tutankhamun. <br /> <br /> Actually this movie is pretty good. Wilding is a good-natured Ahnaton who is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer should be. Mature is good as ambitious (and - beyond the film - ultimately successful future Faroa) Horemheb. Tierney and Purdom succeed in their leading roles, and Ustinov is good as a friend of Purdom. Ms. Darvey is also good, in a large supporting part. In the beautiful cameo there is John Carridin, as the philosopher’s grave robber. The film is certainly worth watching because it is one of the few attempts to show part of the history and culture of ancient Egypt.
