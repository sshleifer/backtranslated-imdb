I caught it recently, noticing the name of James Earl Jones in the title. It was better than I expected. Of course, it is quite old - made in the early / mid 70s, but in fact it is a worthy drama. He works quickly for 90 minutes or so and demonstrates the good performances of James Earl Jones and Diahann Carroll. The plot is generally ordinary, but is told from the point of view of one black woman to social security, which has 6 children and is trying to solve all remaining problems. It makes for an interesting look ..... also in the fact that the script was not too sentimental or overly dramatized - it is almost like looking at a piece of the past. All 70s styles are plentiful. The ending is kind of strange, though .... probably it would be better without theatricality.
