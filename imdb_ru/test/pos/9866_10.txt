This review is based on producer reduction: <br /> <br /> Halloween 5 was a big disappointment at the box office back in '89. Personally, I have always loved it and am proud that it is in my collection. But because of the failure, as well as due to rights problems, it will be another 6 years before we see another installment. The film was one of the best, if not the best in the series. Hardcore screenwriting fan, returning not only Donald Pleasant as Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur as Michael Myers, but also the return of Tommy Doyle's character from the first film, a large studio supporting the project, and Fall. So what went wrong? I will give you two good reasons: re-shooting and poor editing. Due to poor test validation, as well as the failure of Donald Pleasant, the film has changed, and not for the better. The film, as well as parts III and 5, was shot at the box office and received negative reviews from both critics and most fans of TV series. But then, thanks to the magic of bootlegging, the original cut was leaked, and many fans, including myself, were very happy. I will finish this part of my review by saying the following: This film, at least for now, is my favorite Halloween movie, and I'm not afraid to admit it. <br /> <br /> Pros: the account is just fascinating. Has some of the best writing and dialogue series. Halloween 4 imitated the original in the sense that it was more about tension and mood, not blood and courage, and 6 is the same. Great performances, especially of the late and very bored Donald Pleasant. Moves with exciting speed. An interesting explanation for evil Michael and why he will not die. Some brutal killings. Some pretty scary moments, my favorite is Kim Darby's character. A lot of really cool nods on previous films. A few pleasant surprises. Like the two previous sequels, this one has a terrific finale. <br /> <br /> Cons: although Michaelâ€™s explanation of evil is fascinating, it makes him a little less scary. Since when can Michael move so quickly from place to place? <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: this was the first Halloween I saw in the theater. I was so excited because I really thought that 5 would be the last, and then I heard that this was happening. At that time, I enjoyed it, but over time I saw it as it really was: a great movie, trapped in OK, with a terrible end. Why did the filmmakers have to listen to people on test shows? If they had released this excellent version, it could have been much better, and the series might not have been stuck in the mess it is in now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
