This film is BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> I don’t remember this movie even when I was in theaters, so, thinking that it was a “direct DVD,” I have rather low expectations, although I’m a big fan of Mike. judge. There is something like a comic future satire in it, similar to "Brazil" and "Destroyer", but it has reached the next level. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the cast; Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, they were all great in their roles. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, this film won me over the first 5 minutes, where it shows people of medium height, having fewer children and the poorest, most stupid, most rude people, having many ignorant children, and how leads to some reverse evolution. He takes this concept and then shows where we are going with this contamination of the gene pool. Unfortunately, I do not think it will take 500 years, as depicted, but probably only about 50 years. I already see the shocking growth of "easy backwardness" among the population, the media and culture. People who love classical music and art are mocked and not respected. It seems to be ruled by the lowest common denominator, especially in Hollywood and on television (for example, “Awesome Film” and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for money). <br /> <br /> All but political / social satire, this film is also just funny! And I do not say it easily; Because of a few films, I’m really getting "LOL", but it really is. <br /> <br /> Many of the best jokes are the verbal spectacles in the background, so you really need to pay attention to get some of them. I even had to pause and zoom in for some of them (for example, when Joe received his government ID and “hair” was told “yes”, and for “eyes” - “yes”). In addition, the “Home for Individuals” was engraved in front of the prison, because the police in the film (like real police officers) call all “individuals” and not people, etc. Again, this was just a moment on the screen .. This is one of those films that you can watch again and again and disassemble it to go through the funny layers. <br /> <br /> In addition, I usually watch movies with subtitles on, and this tells me. For example, in jokes that may sound in your dialogue, the police constantly talk about people who are “running away” rather than “ run away, ”and there are a lot of other wrong pronunciations that just infuriated me. But again, I could not see them only because of the dialogue mixed with the music / sound effects; It is very thin, but still fun. <br /> <br /> In addition, the special effects were really good for science fiction / social satire. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but overall, I think this is one of those films that, if you DON'T THINK funny, you may be laughing at you! I plan to recommend this to many, many people!
