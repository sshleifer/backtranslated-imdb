A charming film, enhanced by musical and vocal background, especially during competitions. As far as I understand, there was never a soundtrack, but could you tell me through your sources where I can get information about the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song he sang. Your help will be appreciated. The song really touched me and my wife, and we would like to get a copy where it is possible, so that we can play it as background music when we have family and friends for our Italian Nights. If you can give us this information, we will be very grateful. Even if you can consult with the studio contact so that we can act directly. <br /> <br /> Regards, <br /> <br /> John Peiling
