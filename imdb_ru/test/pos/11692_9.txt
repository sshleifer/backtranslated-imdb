“Beauty is in trouble” (“Paint against inconscience”) is not a very good name. All the descriptions of this film are not able to grasp what it really is ?? adult tale. The poor girl is caring for the prince. "The Girl", Marcela, played by the amazing Anna Gaislerova, has the beauty of Isabel Huppert, with red hair, face and figure that are seductive, sexy and infinitely charming. She has a husband's louse, but they have great sex. Children listen to making love through the walls. This is rude and passionate, since working-class sex is often portrayed in the movies. But we must also recognize that this is what binds them in an incompatible marriage. The husband, a professional car thief, is eventually caught and imprisoned. How she got into this marriage, we do not know, but she herself is not very high class. But she is beautiful, smart (we suppose) and loves her gorgeous and cheerful children. She deserves more. And she can get the life she deserves - in the end. (without a spoiler!) She is forced to return with her mother after her husband is sent to prison. Mom has a disgusting second husband (read ugly stepfather). He is a real horror. It borders on the fact that it is the abuser of children. He is obsessed with the idea of ​​cleanliness, but he is horribly farting at the table, while at the same time demanding manners and propriety from the children. He is a real inferior wretch. Mom makes up with him, like Marcella's husband, at least he is lustful - disgusting, but excited. Ambiguous, intricate, multi-layer characteristics make the film so strong and interesting. These characters have flaws, some seem to be driven by a class, some - by an innate character. These flaws and details of character are charming in one minute and contemptible in the next. The audience really needs to agree on the conflicting feelings of class, sexuality, ambition, commitment, and the role of women as mother and wife in a rapidly changing field of history. As a result, as in many films, such as the wonderful Icelandic film “Thicker Than Water” (Blórbönd), children can become victims. What could be better in the end for children who are our salvation and our future? This theme is played out in our days in films, ranging from Pan Labyrinth and ending with Children of Humans. Foreign. In the intricate moralizing stories, the cinema recognizes that life is tangled, cruel, unfair, and as adults we must act together to pass on something worthwhile to the next generation. If we give in to our basic instincts, we can lose ourselves and the world in the process. Unusual, complex and colorful characters in the "Red Element" talk about the qualities of what makes a man, what drives women, what embodies the hope that such a class is the economic status of the fabric of his character? The film is richly human, embodied in the last two frames, which incredibly and unexpectedly touched me. The choice of the director is so subtle and intelligent that it seems unfair to compare it with an American film. Sometimes it seems that Americans have no desire to believe that paradoxes in human nature do not offer certain solutions. But here, dangerously immersed in supposedly a fairy tale for adults, moral questions are interesting. Do not be deceived by the simple story; this is a great movie
