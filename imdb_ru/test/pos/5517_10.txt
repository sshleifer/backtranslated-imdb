I liked the film, and the fact that it was aimed at working with some complicated material. I saw the movie in the preview, and it was not spoiled by any stupid video boxes that spoiled the final. The performances were pretty good, especially Andrew McCarthy on a more mature roll. I also liked the look of the film, which gave it a mysterious, forbidden look. I also enjoyed some of the "twists and turns" in the plot, and don't want to give away too much in case video boxes from other countries don't give it all out! From time to time the script was a bit excessive, but I appreciated the fact that the filmmakers were not afraid to challenge viewers through interesting and mysterious questions about the role of faith in our world. And, although some may find the ending too open, I appreciated the fact that the film refused to tie everything neatly with a bow. It is not like life.
