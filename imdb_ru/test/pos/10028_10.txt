After working on 7 films with director Michael Curtis (“The Adventures of Robin Hood” is their best achievement), Errol Flynn was tired of his dictatorial leadership and decided to work with the great Raul Walsh. This reunion is a happy thing for cinematography. "Dead in Boots" - their first and best movie together. Raoul Walsh portrays General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) from his debuts at West Point to the Civil War and, finally, in the Battle of Little Big Horn. It is true that the film shows a too heroic portrait of Custer, but it does not matter. What is important is that we are endured with the passion and fame of the characters. Who can forget California Joe, the great "Royal's own butler" with his song "Garryowen", touching Mrs. Custer (Olivia de Havilland), devilish Sharp, who was well played by Arthur Kennedy? <br /> <br /> The perpetual blow remains on this epic and tragic frezo.
