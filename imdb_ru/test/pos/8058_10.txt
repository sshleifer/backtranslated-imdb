During the preface of Clit Roberts, I began to think that it was Ed Wood's production work, however, there is something pretty tough here. The story of crime and corruption in the southern city is told using the cast, taken from the Hollywood "Poverty", and this makes the film even more realistic. There are no blows here, and sometimes the film resembles The Well (1951). The black and white texture gives a quality similar to newsreels. Undoubtedly, young viewers will be reminded of the “Blair Witch Project,” but this one is based on REAL events!
