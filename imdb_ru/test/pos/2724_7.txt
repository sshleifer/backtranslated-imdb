Aparna Sen's 15 Park Avenue - a film about the nature of reality. <br /> <br /> A young, educated father and older half-sister, prone to schizophrenia, believe that the young delusional girl, prone to imagination and hearing voices, perhaps because of boredom, is schizophrenic. Controlled, pitiful and regarded as disabled (even if it is caused by love and affection), she has a chance to develop as a normal person. When the boy offers to marry her, her father and stepsister are passionately trying to convince him not to take such a step. The traumatic experience, caused primarily by her sheltered existence, eventually leads her through the trait of no return, and she lives all the time in her delusional world. <br /> <br /> The family and the community around her are intolerant of her delusions and want to crush them with drugs, electro-shock therapy, anything, even though they all have their own faults of one kind or another. <br /> <br /> Her mother does not see the irony that she allows the ghost killer to cure her of delusions. Her half-sister is a physics professor who teaches, among other things, quantum mechanics, a subject in which the flow of experts takes parallel multi-universes and much more dimensions in space than the 3 we see. A friend with admiration tells about the experience of the holy man, who claims that he hears hallucinatory voices. Far away, George Bush has a real or fake misconception about Saddamâ€™s weapons of mass destruction, and he is allowed to invade Iraq. <br /> <br /> As some viewers have noted, Aparna Sen avoided attacks on the mother of all delusions - the main religions, which is a great pity. <br /> <br /> In other words, accepted reality is what the majority or influential minority believe in. This was the case from the very beginning, and the film is much more influential people than Mitali, among them Bruno and Galileo, suffered as a result. <br /> <br /> The scandalous and difficult finale of the film was necessary to show that it was a film about the nature of reality, and not a case study of a schizophrenic girl. <br /> <br /> All the actors gave excellent performances, but Shabana Azmi and Concona Saint Sharm succeeded. Aparna Sen released an outstanding philosophical film.
