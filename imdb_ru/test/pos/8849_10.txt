A brilliant horror movie. Absolutely terrible and very scary. The Thing is a remake of John Carpenter, but please don't let this tear you away from this movie. This is just great. The beginning of the film makes the alien spacecraft fly to Earth centuries before mankind circumnavigated the planet with an explosion that highlighted the name of the film in an amazing shining white and blue color with the inscription “THING”. One of the best opening credits for the horror movie ever. <br /> <br /> The team of actors playing a scientific team of twelve people is a joy, and the locations of their station in Antarctica are visually impressive. on DVD widescreen. It must have been great in the movies. Sorry I didn’t see it on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is great in the role of Makridi, the helicopter pilot, who reluctantly becomes the leader of people trying to fight the deadly shape-changing monster who has penetrated their base. All the actors are really good at this and create stunning scenes of paranoia and stress about who infected it. My favorite scene in the whole movie should be when Macready checks everyone who is still alive for an infection, it is tense, scary and finally exciting. I love him because he's funny too. <br /> <br /> Special mention should be made of Rob Bottin for his truly amazing effects of make-up and changing the shape of the stranger himself. If he didn't get an Oscar for the best visual effects at the time, then he would have to do it. It's also debatable to see if this is John Carpenter's greatest film ... its, of course, a terrible masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Wait for the cold winter night. Take some Budweiser from the fridge. Sit down and watch the "Thing", a masterpiece of horror fire-breathing heroes fighting the shape-changing towers of blood and mucus. <br /> <br /> Absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten.
