Yes, I am sentimental, and yes, I like films where children are the best people. True, Klatretesen has some logical or even plot flaws. This is more than compensated for by the magnificent play of children (the role of Julius in the first film in general!) And the charm of the film Dogma (I liked this cinematic film long before Dogma; from the time of Hertz Glace Duke). Well, I cried for the last fifteen minutes, which is a higher tear factor than for me Bambi or Fly Away.
