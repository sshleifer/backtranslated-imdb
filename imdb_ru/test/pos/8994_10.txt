I wanted to watch this movie since the previews appeared. I don't understand why everyone tries so hard in this film. This is not all may be technically correct for rugby sport, but this film is not mainly about sport. This is a rugby team that is taught to be more than the world expects of them. They are taught to become men, and not vanity boys in time. Hollywood is never 100% right in its productions. They are there to make a product that sells. Something entertaining. The story of Coach Gelvix and what he taught over the years is amazing. He teaches about service, honor, honesty, and moral integrity. How many other films teach our young people these days? I was proud to see such an amazing story that taught respect and esteem.
