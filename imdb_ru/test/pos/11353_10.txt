I was recommended this film as one of the best love stories ever told. And since I'm a big fan of love, I bought tickets and sat in the theater. After 90 minutes, I left the theater with disappointment and the only positive thing about the film. I was shocked by the very story that two people can love each other, but so afraid that they will never act. I just could not pass the language barrier and cultural barrier. The second time I ran into this ... I had a different mood, I no longer expected ... and I had more patience, more mind to "see" the movie ... and as soon as I opened my eyes I discovered love ... the beauty of the movie. I went beyond the language and love stories and saw the art of acting (even for a moment I did not even feel that they were playing!) And cinema. When I first heard the definition of a film, I was told that it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photographs (pictures), and this film should correspond to the description. Almost every frame has an idea, and in combination with music ... and light effects ... the result is simply a masterpiece! A masterpiece is what you should have in your movie collection.
