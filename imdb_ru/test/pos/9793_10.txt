This is really a sad and touching movie! This concerns the subject of child abuse. This is really sad, but mostly true story, because it happens every day. Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello play two children or Lorain Bracco, a single mother who is just trying to create a home for them. Living with his parents, a man enters their lives, who loves to be called "The King". He beats the younger boy, Bobby, but the two brothers swear not to speak to their mother. But finally, she finds out after Bobby was badly hurt. The end sort of ruined it for me, because it is completely unbelievable. But besides that, I love the movie.
