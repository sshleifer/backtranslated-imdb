As a Canadian, I did not know much about Whitlamâ€™s dismissal. I read the Wikipedia page about these events, but that was about it. At the beginning of this year, when Canada experienced a potential constitutional crisis (fortunately, faded) that could lead to the intervention of our governor-general, the dismissal of Whitlam was mentioned in the press. To learn more, I ordered the DVD of this mini-series via EBay. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed with how interesting this account was. No matter how dramatic the events, it could be a very boring political drama. However, it was a rather intense mini-series. I was also impressed with how understandable this was, despite the fact that I was not familiar with Australian politics. It did not take long to figure out who everyone was and what their roles were. <br /> <br /> Having said that, this is not a completely impartial report. Malcolm Fraser is, of course, portrayed as a rather Machiavellian figure, which does not allow any person or subject to interfere with his desire to become prime minister. Gough Whitlam is depicted in a more noble, almost holy, light. However, the actor depicting Whitlam, directs the nobility in such a way that it looks rather like bombast. I thought that Sir John Kerr was portrayed rather sympathetically. <br /> <br /> I have to warn people that the DVD is of very poor quality. I understand that this was done for television in the early 80s, but it seems that no effort was made to restore the quality of the image or sound. It was very disappointing that no additions were added. A documentary or even some interviews with historical figures could improve the experience, but there is nothing in it. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this mini-series to anyone interested in real-life events.
