There is this whole horror theory that some people strictly adhere to the fact that monsters and violence should be behind the scenes. Pak Chan-Wook completely throws this concept out of the window and shows what he wants, and what he wants to show is almost everything he can think about. Leaving it for the actors and the dialogue to create subtlety, from a stylistic point of view, the Park seems ready to do anything to get the message across. Whether long ensemble scenes with a camera whistling around the mahjong table, or whole weeks limited to one frame between the other two scenes, the scene dialogue before and after passing over them, the Park does not adhere to a specially structured style but focuses more on telling the whole story the couple's relationship from virgin separation through complete interdependence until complete self-destruction - and uses vampirism as a bond, and the priesthood as a drama. It is so simple and so difficult at the same time. <br /> <br /> You have to give him credit. Too many people are willing to compare any modern vampire film with Twilight, and Twilight are almost always the smaller of the pieces, but here the stories are actually comparable, but this one is more raw and honest. None of this appeared in the window at night to talk nonsense, but everything from the dirtiest, most desperate and virginal sex scene to possible marital violence when the two are fighting for power over each other. This is the same deal - the boy and the girl meet, the girl finds out that the guy is a vampire, still decides to join him, but without much happiness, just a limited time when they are forced to hold each other closer and closer and exhaust options. The girl’s motivation is especially interesting because she desperately craves the strength and attention to a mistake ripped off by a guy who just wants to live as best as possible in the circumstances, but is a hypocrite who cannot admit that he just uses his vampirism as an excuse to act against his moral education. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect and tends to stretch (there are no three actions, five actions or some kind of action structure, only scene by scene of character development and dysfunctional novel), but what’s good about this is that Pak Chan-Vuk is ready to show everything frankly and honestly, rejoicing in the sensations of horror from tension and blood. He also offers a masterfully selected soundtrack, which also strikes emotional notes very effectively. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
