The consequences of World War II almost led to the death of Soviet cinema. In the early years of the 1950s, film production approached a full stop (in 1951, only nine full-length films were released), and the work of all filmmakers was carefully controlled and often censored by the government. After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, filmmakers were given great artistic freedom with their paintings, although many of them were reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic and propaganda position regarding the war that had been prevalent in previous years. Only in 1957, director Mikhail Kalatozov and writer Viktor Rozov became bold enough to create what is widely considered the first post-Stalinist Soviet masterpiece Flying Cranes / Flying Cranes, one of the best images of the first war. seen from any country or time period. The film was not only praised for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union, but international recognition soon followed, and Kalatozov’s film was awarded the Palm d'Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> “Cranes are flying” is at once an invigorating visual feast and a daring, humanistic image of war. Unlike many Soviet war films of the time, he was less limited by the archetypal figure of the traditional wartime hero and was more concerned with the futility, cruelty and, indeed, the inevitability of conflict. Love as a cinematic concept is too often idealized as a concept that somehow overcomes everyone and endures endless difficulties, yet reality is much less romantic. In the film, two lovers, Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) and Boris (Alexei Batalov), separated by the start of the Second World War {widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945}, promise to marry after the war. But the tragedy deprives the spouse of their desires. Trusting treachery because of endless torment and uncertainty in anticipation, Veronica agrees to marry the cousin of Boris Mark (Alexander Shvorin), a handsome but unworthy young man. The film can end with a proud victory of the Soviets and a patriotic parade waving flags, but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly overshadowed by the bitter-sweet tragedy of our young heroine, who soullessly wanders through the famous crowds. <Br /> <br /> Perhaps the most remarkable feature of “The Cranes Are Flying” is Sergei Urusevsky’s inspirational and dynamic manual cinematography, which realistically and dizzily reflects the chaos and confusion of war, not necessarily under a hail of shooting and shouting. of the dying comrades {in fact, only one of the episodes of the film joins Boris on the Eastern Front, but from the point of view of family and friends who are left behind. In one particularly impressive, often quoted long shot, the camera follows Veronica, who frantically searches for Boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families. A hand-held camera smoothly follows the girl from the bus, pushing through the crowd next to her - capturing instant passages of loved ones saying goodbye to their sons and husbands - and then suddenly rises above the crowd when Veronica disappears in the dust of a passing squadron of army tanks, breathtaking movement, which offers the scale and urgency of a dramatic episode. Urusevsky first acquired the experience of filming as a military cameraman during the war and, obviously, fell in love with the possibility of narration using manual photography: “The camera,” he once said, “can express what an actor cannot depict: his inner feelings. The operator must act with the actors. "
