Well, I can safely say that I am a man, Wong. And I did not quit. I was laughing. And they laughed. If this movie made you nauseous, then something is wrong with you. But this film is incredible. I bought it four days ago and have already watched 5 times. Animal cruelty captures my heart, but not long enough to be guilty. The film is shocking, disgusting and vulgar. The game is terrible. What else do you want from the movie? I am a die-hard cult maniac. Pink Flamingo is awesome. This makes Rocky Horror, as someone said, look like telepuzik.
