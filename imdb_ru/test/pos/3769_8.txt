An uneasy comedy in which comedian Mark Blankfield portrays Jekyll as a worried doctor deeply committed to his research. After he snorted his experimental formula, he turned into Hyde's greedy landscape without creating any problems for everyone around him. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by this. He has a really crazy, crazy approach; this is a complete pair ahead with one outrageously stupid yet undeniably hilarious joke after another. Funny lines and sights are abundant; Blankfield plays every role, no matter how much it stands. At one highlight, Hyde breaks into a song; "Hyde's Got's Got's Nothing to Hyde" is quite memorable, and even now I can still hear it in my head. The climax even goes so far as to fake old black and white horror films. <br /> <br /> The cast is also quite inspired: Bess Armstrong as the furious bride Mary, Krista Errikson as the teddy Ivy, and Tim Tomerson as the bright supporting doctor Knut Lannon. I would like to do more with Thomson’s character, since I’m a fan of this person, but it's always nice to see him in something. <br /> <br /> A large number of familiar faces passes in front of the Camera: Cassandra "Elvira" Peterson, Peter Brocco, Liz Sheridan, George Wendt, Michael Ensign, John Dennis Johnston, Art La Fleur, Lin Shay and George Chakiris in a cameo, like him. <br /> <br /> This is not to mention that if you prefer a highly developed, intellectual comedy, you better avoid it at all costs. But for those who love crazy, politically incorrect, fun pastime, this can help. <br /> <br /> One of the best moments saved for last. <br /> <br /> 8/10
