I really liked the first part of this film in Africa for about an hour or so, until the cruel treatment of animals of civilized people in Scotland did not reach me in the second half and made me so upset that I could not watch some of them. However, this was done by the creator of the film to emphasize that early naturalists destroyed all life, which they did not understand, “studying” it literally to death, without taking into account the rights and comfort of the animals studied, which, as we know, must be learned anywhere, but not in the natural world in which they live, and as unobtrusively as possible. I recommend this film, as it was basically a serious and honest story about Tarzan, which showed cruel cruelty to animals raging in the scientific world of the 19th century, as well as a clean and simple, beautifully primitive life that Tarzan led as a young man who was found in childhood and brought up chimpanzees after the violent death of his parents in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert was wonderful and very spiritual in his role as Tarzan, as was Ralph Richardson. in his latest movie role as the ultra-rich, fragrant Tarzan rake in Scotland. Andy MacDowell was good and quite good as the gifted and civilized “Jane” Tarzan in her first movie role. From his charismatic work in this film and his very obsessive eyes, I cannot understand why Lambert did not later become a big star, but his really poor choice of film later might have made it. Stunning Jan Holm, as a wounded Frenchman in Africa, helped Tarzan, who then accompanied Tarzan back to his previously unknown, ancestral homeland in Scotland, as always, was magnificent. <br /> <br /> I am so glad that Tarzan fell ill and did not stay in the cruel animals of the civilized world at that time and eventually went home to Africa to live his life with his tender and loving "relatives" of monkeys, who raised him instead of staying in Scotland and living like a royal person, which would have destroyed him if it had not happened kill him first.
