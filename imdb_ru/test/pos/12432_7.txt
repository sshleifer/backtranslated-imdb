Well, I must say that “Monster Man” is a huge mess in the film, but somehow several different genres and conspiracy came together to make one of the most pleasant modern horror films I've seen in recent years! The two biggest styles that the movie mixes are the teen road comedy in the style of “Road Trip” and the horror style “Texas Chainsaw Massacre,” while one often interferes with the other; Director Michael Davis manages to keep moving due to the fact that the constant change in tone means that we are never quite sure where the film will be made in the following. It all starts worryingly, when we meet two characters, both are annoying in different ways. Adam is a girl, and Harley is a fat A-hole. They both travel in the wilderness to attend the wedding of some chick they liked in high school. After a couple of strange events, they pick up a hitchhiker, and then find themselves harassed by some kind of maniac in a monster truck for unknown reasons ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​someone chasing someone. the rest in a larger car is hardly original, but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the main advantages of the film. The truck itself looks creepy because it is so haggard and rusty, and the fact that it jumps on the screen makes the unfolding action exciting and tense. After a while, you get used to the characters, and as soon as Amy Brooks enters the fray, things start to improve. The teenage comedy side of the film actually works quite well, as Justin Ulrich is always ready to provide some interesting lines of dialogue, and the scenes between the devil virgin and the hot female hitchhiker are quite interesting. Just when you think that a movie cannot become even more confusing, in the last third everything changes. Without spoiling things, I must say that Monster Man has a kind of end that was impossible to see, and with the turn this is a big surprise. Some people may feel ripped off by a sudden turn at the end - but I actually thought that it worked quite well, as it fits the film, in which there is nothing really appropriate ... In general, this is not a “great” movie. way - but if you're looking for some silly entertainment, Monster Man should hit the target!
