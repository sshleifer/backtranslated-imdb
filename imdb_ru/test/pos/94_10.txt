This amazing short film will amaze everyone who specifically asked for something in childhood, because it was fashionable or cool, just to be given something that will mark you for life with your peers and tell your mom or dad (or both ) that it didn’t matter, since you sincerely began to consider including in the Witness Protection Program to avoid ridicule. For those US residents who are not terrified that you don’t watch hockey, it’s just like a Dallas Cowboy fan gets a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan gets a Red Sox jersey. It's not beautiful. For our European friends, think about two great rival football clubs and imagine how a fan of one gets a T-shirt from the other. Oh !!! NFB of C surpassed themselves here! <br /> <br /> Une hommage du Maurice "Rocket" Richard, Mercy, M. Richard.
