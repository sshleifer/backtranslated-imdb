Obviously, my rating for this does not mean that it compares with class horrors such as Argento, but with other budget 70s, at a high price, and in this section it is really a classic. Lack of money shows, (someone cares too much?), The game is adequate, not professional, (Does it make it more realistic?), But unlike many other films, and not only the budget, it does not pull. moment. Shit it can be, but nonstop shit, shit in your face, and although it is inevitable from time to time a little restrained, everyone who understands at least something about what I am talking about should see. Sometimes quite crazy, this crazy little movie, filled with crazy characters, is clearly created for fun and entertainment.
