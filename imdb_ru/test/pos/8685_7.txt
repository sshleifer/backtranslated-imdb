Algernon4’s comment that “Mrs. Paget’s ultralone dance (this film) is the most erotic in the history of films” undoubtedly exaggerates us. This is not even the most erotic dance of Debra Paget. Her almost nude movements in Fritz Lang's Indian Tomb make this number look decidedly tame. As for the most erotic in dance history. Well! Where do I begin? Salma Hayek as Sandanico Pandaemonium in From Dusk Till Dawn (1996); Jamie Lee Curtis in True Lies (1994); Jessica Alba in Sin City (2005); Rose McGowan in Planet of Terror (2007); Sheila Kelly in Dancing on the Blue Iguana (2000), blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. I love the sequence and included it in my “Cheesecake Dance” series on Youtube. I just think that a statement like “the most erotic in the history of cinema” is really very fragile.
