“Death Bed: The Bed That Eats” is, in fact, a dark tale told in horror movies. This, in my opinion, is one of the best films of the 1970s, and it’s completely criminal that the picture was basically stolen and distributed without Barry’s knowledge (those responsible for this theft should be fed to bed ASAP). If you are looking for outright blood or rabid action, “Death Bed: A Bed That Eats” is not for you. The Bed of Death is a softer, bizarre picture; he plays like a completely strange dream, half remembered. I would recommend reading Stephen Troer’s Summing Up Death Bed in The Thrower's Press, The Nightmare USA (he describes the film’s atmosphere perfectly). Regardless of whether intentionally or not, I noticed the colors of Death Bed in everything from Ghost films to Michel Soavi's Cemetery, to artistic fiction / fantasy fiction by authors like Kelly Link. Barry is the original, and in an honest world, I'm sure he would follow Death Bed with many fantastically fancy movies.
