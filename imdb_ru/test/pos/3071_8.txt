I first saw Robin Hood: People in tights back in 1994 in the movies. I went to see him, because I always liked Robin Hood, I saw the trailer for this film and thought it was fun. After I watched the movie, I must say that it was even better than I thought. This is not only very funny, it is also a very well-made film with beautiful decorations and costumes, as well as a very beautiful score by Hammi Mann. The cast is also good, Cary Elvis is funny, like Robin Hood, as well as Tracy Ullman, Richard Lewis, Mark Blankfield, David Chapelle, Amy Yasbek, Megan Cavana, Eric Allan Kramer, Matthew Porretta and Mel Brooks himself. But the best role in the film is played by Roger Rees as the evil Sheriff of Rottingham. He has the best scenes in the film, as well as the best dialogue (“The king is an illegal forest to kill a pig in it as it is,” which means “It is forbidden to kill a wild pig in the royal forest”). He somehow mixes all the words and utters a sentence that no one understands. Robin Hood: “People in Pantyhose” in my book is one of Mel Brooks’s best films to date, and I cannot say that I laughed at the film as much as this one. It's just nonstop laughter.
