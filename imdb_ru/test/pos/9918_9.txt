If you don't like Italian horror, you won't like this movie. On that note ... <br /> <br /> "On the whole ... it was a terrible experience ... Many things happened. Vanessa Redgrave should have been in the film and she came out. One of the actors was crushed by the car. I was engaged to marry, but by the end of the picture that was finished. My father died during the shooting ... all kinds of things. " - Dario Argento about creating the "Opera" <br /> <br /> I was really impressed with Argento and the film he made here - especially against such gloomy circumstances. The whole mystery of Macbeth and its curse on those who try to put on the play add innumerable volumes to the Opera. <br /> <br /> In the film, Argento talks about some of his most intelligent (and audience-directed) stunts. The young opera singer Christina is pursued by a brutal psychopath who makes her watch a series of brutal murders. By attaching several sharp blades to Christine's eyelids, the killer makes it impossible for her to close her eyes: “Look carefully. If you try to close your eyes, you will tear them apart. ! "<br /> <br /> It’s clear that Argento took great care in creating the screen opera Macbeth, and his hard work pays off. Add to this some unforgettably brutal murders, an incredibly intense sequence of persecutions and ingenious use of POV to portray a certain character (the role that Vanessa Redgrave fulfilled, thank God), and you get one of the best Italian horror films ever created. <br /> <br /> However, this is still an Italian horror. Why did Christina never talks about It’s hard to understand these brutal murders.Some scenes can be difficult for some viewers, but personally I felt more stress on Christine and her eyes than on any brutal murders in the film.In the final of "Tenebrae" my stomach ached most of all in "Opera "but it's probably just me. <br /> <br /> And the last five minutes ... Argento wanted it, he shot it, and he fought to keep it in the film. Absolutely no one likes it, including me, but that's not enough to spoil the rest of the film for me. It remains one of the best Argento films to date. <br /> <br /> 9/10
