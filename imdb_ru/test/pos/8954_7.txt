Watched this movie on a Saturday afternoon. Man, it pulled. I have metaphors, symbolism and all that. No, I somehow do not care about the sexuality of the characters. But the course of history and scenarios almost put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> That is ..... until Ruth Marshall was exposed. If you are a nursing man who is not homophobic, you can rent it. Ruth has a lesbian sex scene, which is rather hot, and then a heterosexual scene, which is one step higher than in most standard films. Her wobbly D-cups made the film worth seeing. <br /> <br /> - The Mighty Avatar
