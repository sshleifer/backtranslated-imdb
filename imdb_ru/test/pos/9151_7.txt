Most of the silent films I saw were serious in nature, so it was funny to watch one with a comic touch. The setting and some scenes for “Beloved Rogue” reminded “Brokeback Notre Dame” of 1923 regarding the Paris street scenes and the celebration of the “King of Fools”. John Barrymore portrays the greatest French poet, François Villon, in characterization, which ranges from virtual farce to romantic tenderness; this “water to wine” in the early stage of the painting was rather funny. <br /> <br /> It seems that times never change, and it is interesting that the film makes a compelling observation almost a century ago - in Paris there is a fool to rule for one night, while everywhere there is one all the time. How true. <br /> <br /> Conrad Weidt’s appearance in the film was a bit surprising for this viewer, I only saw him as Major Strasser in “Casablanca”, oddly enough, one of his most recent films. Like King Louis XI, he is a monarch obsessed with astrology, cunning but suspicious, and it was a bit unpleasant to see how closely he resembled the Worm Hall character Brad Dourif from the last chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Not quite exuding the confidence that the king of France can expect. That is why the rule of the Duke of Burgundy (Lawson Butt) seemed even more plausible until Villon seized the opportunity to put one on both rulers. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me interesting that the use of title cards were exclusively spare, were used only when it is absolutely necessary to advance the story. However, without them one could miss the curious nugget. Looks like Villon made his link from Paris to the Lame Flea Hostel! <br /> <br /> The imprint I watched was of exceptional quality, the very first film featured on a hundred DVD of the Action and Action film from Mill Creek Entertainment, which speaks of a film now eighty years old . It's great that the films of the era of silence are now finding wider distribution in a commercial format of this type, which makes them accessible to a completely new generation of movie lovers. <br /> <br /> One question - did Conrad Weidt seem like King Louis was picking his nose deliberately, or as an unintentional gesture that simply remained safe from the cooking room?
