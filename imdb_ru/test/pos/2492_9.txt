My curiosity and patience, finally, to see this scandalous film, which was first released on DVD in the UK, was more than rewarded. Peter Watkins has excelled in his courage and technical skills. This pseudo-documentary film was definitely ahead of its time and still frighteningly relevant and relevant. <br /> <br /> The film is inspired by the upheavals of the late 60s in the United States, when the government expanded its legitimate use. violence and oppression, while the anti-war movement is responding increasingly cruel and radical. To cope with this, overcrowding in prisons, and in order to provide special training for the riot police, the government introduced so-called punishment parks. Convicted "criminals", mostly activists, are given a "choice" - either to remain in prison for years and years, or spend three days in one of these parks, where they either gain freedom, or their death or even longer imprisonment. However, the situation in the parks exceeds their worst expectations. It reminded me of some realistic version of the Battle Royale (2000). <br /> <br /> The structure of the film is extremely effective and resembles parallels with the Holocaust of cannibalism, which was made almost 10 years later. Both films are built and shot in such a way that it is difficult for the viewer to think and feel that he is actually watching a real documentary and is therefore shocked, although he is aware of the fact that: this is a film. Both confront us with violent nature inherent to humanity, but where the Cannibal Holocaust lacks any deeper meaning (first of all, it is a film about exploitation in every sense of the word) and does not raise any critical questions about the state of the world . <br /> <br /> I was deeply impressed with Punishment Park, and it’s hard for me to believe how such a powerful and important film could be rejected and marginalized for so long. Perhaps, it speaks about the veracity of its content, about how power structures function in this world. I do not agree with the criticism that Watkins polarizes and stereotypes, because the film depicts activists and custodians of legalized power structures, which are in fact as polarized as here. If they were not, there would be no conflict and, therefore, no change in our societies. In fact, confrontations between these two groups often take stereotypical forms, regardless of whether you place them between activists and the establishment in Latin America, Russia, or New York. If these groups were not polarized to these extremes, activists would be part of a silent majority who silently complains, but at the same time remains in the injustice of the world. <br /> <br /> As Peter Watkins tells us in the introduction to the DVD, the actors in the Park of Punishments are mostly amateurs. Most of the children were real activists from Los Angeles, most of the police were part of the national forces, and even some of the members of the tribunals are part of the social and political establishment of the time. Failure to present both groups before filming scenes in the improvised courtroom adds ease and improvisation. There are parallels with the problems of time, such as repression against members of the Black Panther (one of the blacks, as they say, reminds of convicted charismatic BPleader leader Bobby Sila) and the trial of the Chicago seven. <br /> <br /> I admire Watkins’s obvious and sincere involvement in injustice and his concern about human rights, as well as the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments (now in the name of the war on terror) to silence those who disagree and refuses brainwashing. The punishment park remains an extremely important film that should be shown in schools and watched by anyone who shares these concerns. Maybe his marginalization can be finally compensated.
