I think this is a terrific movie ... I constantly watched it from 4 to 8 years ... However, watching it led to many nightmares. I got them especially because of the guy who always looked like the “other world” and his friends. I am 12 years old, and I still have nightmares about it to this day. I can't fall asleep right now because I think about it. I love this movie, but it's so scary! I definitely love this film, I have very good memories of it. Kate is very good in this movie. Surprisingly, I still do not understand what it is! I also think that the graphics were of very high quality, unlike what some others think.
