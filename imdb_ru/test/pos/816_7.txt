Working girl Kitty (Sauternes) is engaged to Bill (Kelly), who neglects her, working long hours in her garage to save money on their marriage. After she got up on her birthday, Kitty goes on a double / blind date where she meets the heir to the department store Bob Hartwell (Hamilton). She falls in love, but leaves him when his protests of love seem to cover the desire that she be his mistress, not his wife. Faithful Bill gathers a round to comfort her, and finally she succumbs to his repeated requests to restore their engagement, partly under the pressure of Bill’s support for her family after she lost her job. However, when Bob returns, convinced that he finally wants to marry, will Kitty follow her heart or conscience? <br /> <br /> This film was much better than I expected. At first, Bill’s character sounds like a kind of loud comic Irishman that Jack Carson played so often. But Kelly (and the script) gives the hero real compassion and love, and Bill turns out to be the best person in the whole group. Viewers can support him against helpless Hartwell! However, the tone of the film fluctuates between a carefree romance and a much darker side, especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather terrible accident in Bill’s garage. <br /> <br /> The cast is rounded off by reliable Jane Darwell, who was Kitty's mother, shameless, but not quite nasty Mickey Rooney as Kitty's younger brother, and Spencer Charters, who was Kitty's poor father.
