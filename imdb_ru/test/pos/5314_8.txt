I loved the rye catcher, this is my favorite book. J. D. Salinger, author of The Dream Catcher, has rights to the book and made it so that no one could make a film about it with his permission. <br /> <br /> Having said that, here is “United States of Leland”. “A beautiful film with a lot of meaning and depth of emotion. But a lot of it reminded me of the spectacle almost reminded me too much of the spectacle. The several stories Leland told in the film, such as visiting New York and his adventures, were very similar Holden's stories in Dreamcatcher, and how Leland views people and emotions are also similar to Holden, they are both simple and true to themselves and others. An excellent acting game is attributed to Don Chidlu and Kevin Spacey. Excellent editing, everything fits together story all together onravilas. recommended as a purchase or even rent. Good movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing he pulls at some point, but makes up for it in the long run. Give time and appreciate a good movie.
