This film could easily be qualified as a film <br /> <br /> that best promotes human understanding between people. <br /> <br /> It can be quite unpleasant to even try to understand that a young Jewish southern girl may give refuge to an escaped German prisoner of war. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol portrays an amazing portrait of an unhappy young girl eager for acceptance and love. Michael Constantine played a remarkable role, as her difficult father and Esther Roll played the role of the maid, Ruth, and won the Emmy perfectly when an understanding maid caught up with these events. <br /> <br /> Bruce Davison portrays a German who is allegedly not guilty of the atrocities of the Nazis. This is his role. He fled, but joined the German army and, perhaps, was a member of Hitlerâ€™s youth movement. <br /> <br /> The action takes place in 1944 in Georgia, in the countryside. Citizens are full of prejudices. Even the FBI inspector acts as if he would like to find out something for the Jews. Note the opposite interpretation of the fact that when McNichol is in bed, Davison is tracked down and eventually shot. It is interesting to see that society considers McNichol as a traitor to shelter an escaped prisoner of war. The film also talks about the extremely complex relationship between father and daughter. The explosion of Constantine in his daughter at the end - acting skills. Like her mother, Barbara Barry, there is little to do. It was annoying that she was stereotypically perceived as a typical Jewish mother with such a loud touch of lipstick on her lips. <br /> <br /> A memorable work worth seeing.
