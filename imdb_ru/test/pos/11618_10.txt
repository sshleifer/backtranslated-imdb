I finally watched this shocking film last night, and what anxious minds, and incredibly bloody, and some unforgettable scenes, and a complete attack on the senses. Looks like a film from Lynch's mind (in particular, ERASERHEAD), Buttgereit, and even a bit of Begotten. What this guy does with his pregnant sister is hard to believe, but again, did this really happen or is it the left and right sides of his brain fighting. This is the main theme of this work of art - to draw a thin line between fantasy and reality and what will happen if the right side of the brain, which dreams and fantasizes, will overtake the sensible and logical left side. And the music in this film is incredible, a kind of electronic score, which is absolutely perfect. Despite the fact that this film is absolutely shocking and rather disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes (including hard sex) that you have ever seen in any film, I saw it as a work of art, and I really liked it. And this music still amazes me, I must try to find the soundtrack, if there is one. Watching “Subconscious Cruelty” is a real event, and not something that the viewer easily forgets. And a note for peas is what you need to have. <br /> <br /> Warning ... Be careful when purchasing this movie, because some prints have misting on graphic sex scenes and extreme blood, especially copies from the Japanese edition.
