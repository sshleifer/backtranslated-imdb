During the short Golden Age of Super 8 Magnetic Sound Home Movies, we purchased a GAF projector for $ 148.00 on sale at the Downtown Chicago Camera Store. GAF seemed to go out of the business of cameras and projectors; although they would continue to work with their other businesses, such as the former Sawyer Vue-Master 3 Dimensional Color Viewer. <br /> <br /> We knew little and did not expect a quick approach of the camcorder, Betamax, VHS and possible DVD revolutions. With the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Camera, which we also purchased, we took several sound film recordings as our daughter, Jenn and her younger sister, Michelle's graduate school from preschool. All this was approximately in 1979-82. <br /> <br /> During this time, we also purchased several Daddy Toys for this; like some Super 8 Magnetic Sound LAUREL & HARDY Films and W.C. FIELD 'Blackhawk Films Shorts, Davenport, Iowa. We also shot the sound film “Home Films of Colombian Pictures”, which was then shot in some way by a forgotten classic cartoon, Gerald McBowing-Boeing from UPA (United Productions of America / Columbia, 1951). It was a hit of our time home movies! <br /> <br /> As members of this generation of baby boomers, Wife (Dina) and I recalled the character of Gerald McBoing-Boeing; because Gerald had a network show on CBS, early Sunday evening, approx. 1955. Bill Goodwin was the Announcer / Presenter. But we have never seen this original UPA theater cartoon; we also did not know that the young master MacBoing-Boeing was the creation of Dr. Suze from Greench, Horton and Mulberry Street. <br /> <br /> The assembled staff was very talented and deep. Outstanding production values ​​are obvious. Directed by Robert Cannon and director of oversight John Hubley were veterans at the top of their craft. The authors were Theodore Geisel (Dr. Suze himself), Phil Eastman and Bill Scott. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott is remembered not so much for his writing contribution to the UPA, as for his partnership with Jay Ward in such television properties as ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, MR. PIGAIKA, FREE FLAKERS, GEORGE JUNGLE, HOPE OF HOPER and Broken FLAKERS. In Jay Ward Productions, he was a writer, voice-over and a kibitzer general from the entire company. <br /> <br /> The cartoon gets its only “voice” from narrator, radio / film / television actor Marvin Miller. Remember him? He was Michael Anthony on the television show MILLIONER (Don Fedderson Productions television network, CBS, 1955–1960). <br /> <br /> Bold color scheme and creative approach led to UPA animations giving special feelings of loneliness to fear of fear and possible triumph. And, we might add that animation definitely refers to “limited” diversity. <br /> <br /> Since there are so many wonderful stories, ours begins with a simple premise; man is born of others. In this case, this is a young boy, Gerald McCloy, who was born to create sound effects when communicating, not when talking. Children can be cruel, and soon a group of youthful mockers repeats his not very flattering nickname: “Nya, nya, your name is not McCloy; This is Gerald McBoying-Boeing, Boy, making noise! ​​”At this stage, the animation team does an outstanding job of switching the emotional outlook of a young outcast from happy and carefree to lonely and lonely, and finally to depression and despair, without being able to turn - for help and understanding; not even for his mother and father. <br /> <br /> A terribly fashioned dark scene that includes a stylized scene of the escape of the UPA, including the Train and the equally stylized Snowfall, takes Gerald to the brink of absolute despair. But then he was interrupted by a gentleman who announced that the producer of a radio program wanted young Gerald to provide sounds for the show in the studio. <br /> <br /> ONCE the premiere show is made with Gerald. In the lead role in the recording department, he rides a huge limousine (which seems to have anticipated these stretching limousines of our time) to greet and delight his classmates and the whole world. <br /> <br /> THIS has already been said that there are so many plots, and in this case this story is most likely a variation of The Ugly Duckling; in the end, a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and true happiness. <br /> <br /> NOTE: United Productions of America, or UPA, in short, was an outstanding center of creativity in the field of Cartoon. They were responsible not only for GERALD McBOING-BOING and several sequels and serials, but also for the very popular MR. MAGOO theatrical cartoons and the subsequent TV show (with Jim Backus voice talent), the classic original TV cartoon FROG OF SNEAK and the rather strange cartoon show DICK TRACY (with Tracy's voice, performed by Mr. Everett Sloan!).
