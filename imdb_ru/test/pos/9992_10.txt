I will divide my review into the following 5 categories, each of which will be a maximum of 100% (if ideal) Visual pleasure: [100%] This is a very visually pleasing movie. I had a great time watching this. Golfing scenes were very well shot, and the dramatic effects on green were pretty awesome. I also liked to see old wooden golf clubs and a bag. <br /> <br /> Directorial work: [70%] Bill Paxton has more to do with acting, but this film shows that he has talent. Did a decent job. <br /> <br /> Acting as: [90%] Shea LeBefe was very good in her role as Francis Uymet (this guy can ACT good). The rest of the cast was also good. <br /> <br /> Entertainment: [100%] I enjoyed every minute. It was incredibly exciting. <br /> <br /> Written by: [91%] Based on real events and therefore makes the film much more special. He was intriguing from the start and loved every scene until the very end. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> My advice: definitely, you MUST look for all sports lovers, especially for golf (you will all love this). Anyone who is looking for a good entertainment movie and does not hate sports can watch it. <br /> <br /> _____ <br /> <br /> 10/10
