And she really was beautiful (that is, Day Larin) - herself, her role and her performance. An exciting story of selfish and unselfish love for the same man, rich heartbreaker and dipsoman Robert Cummings. One of his bouts of intoxication leads to an incident that enrages the local community and checks the character of two sisters (Jean Muir and Larain Day), who are close to him (and to each other). Their comfortable and somewhat superficial situation has escalated as the two girls confront the crisis and respond to its conflicting demands for prudence, honesty, devotion and love, the consequences of which for each of them differ significantly. If you forget about the old bustle and subtleties, their real characters are revealed in exciting contrast. <br /> <br /> Great find in TCM!
