I find it surprising that in fact so little has been done about the atomic bomb and its development over the decades after the completion of the Manhattan project. I suspect that this was due to serious fears in the film and entertainment industries (from 1950–1970s) to McCarthyism and the related phobias of national security (including the Hollywood blacklist). In the 1950s, there was one film (with Robert Taylor) about Colonel Paul Tibbitts, who ruled Enola gay during the bombing of Hiroshima, but nothing else. In the description by Robert Shaw of the shark attacks on the survivors in the Jaws of the Robert Shaw, one could look at the side problem of the tragedy (the death of Indianapolis in the United States shortly after the bombing in Tinian) But the real trials and tribulations of Groves, Oppenheimer and their teams were not considered capable of making films. <br /> <br /> And then in 1989 two films appeared. I have already considered one (DAY ONE), which, in my opinion, is the best of two when discussing long-term technical, emotional and political issues in the Manhattan project. The actions of Brian Dennehy in the role of General Groves and David Streyrn in the role of Oppenheimer were first-class and neatly balanced. Small side vignettes relating to the crusade against the Szilard bomber (Michael Tucker) help to reveal the story well. <br /> <br /> This is the problem. Paul Newman is a great actor (like Mr. Dennehy), but Newman approached Groves in a different way, which, though not terribly, is less than the intelligent, but quiet military team of Dennehy. Newman seems to be too distressed about the possibility of using weapons as the biggest stick that can be encountered by other boys in the yard after school. Yes, of course, but the real Groves would be more similar to how Dennehy thought not about that great toy of the future, but about the business of creating this great toy. <br /> <br /> The performance of Dwight Schultz as Oppeheimer helps to maintain a generally interesting and good production of the film, which is assisted by Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. But the most interesting aspect of this film is the improvement of the two tragedies of Daglian and Slotin, in particular the latter, in the image of Merriman John Cusack. In all technological advances, people inevitably die. It’s just that these two tragedies (in addition to the tens of thousands lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) brought home the danger of a new unleashing power even in a so-called peaceful controlled experiment. Two tragedies (in particular, the slow, painful death of Louis Slotin from radiation poisoning) showed how necessary caution is needed when using atomic energy - and how even the smallest chances can still lead to a catastrophe. The only thing I really saw in the performance of Cusack (and the script) and the actual incident with Slotin was that it took Slotin some time after the accident to find out where all his fellow researchers were when they suffered radiation from an accident ( he was able to show that only he received the full effect of an accidental explosion, so that the rest will need only a relatively small treatment). Perhaps the full story of Slotin’s actions was too technical for the screen, but, given the enormous pain he suffered at the end, he took a break to think about others, revealing what he was in fact a first-class person.
