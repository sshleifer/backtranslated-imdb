Chop Shop. Screenwriter and director Ramin Bakhrani. Bakhrani specializes in character-based research on naturalist-style films about how little people pass by every day, and no one notices that they are there in New York. <br /> <br /> These are people who have been pushed to the very edge of society. They exist in a kind of gray world, many of them are migrants, whose legal status in America looks somewhat doubtful. Where are they from? How did they get there? How do they cope? Where will they be? These are not good stories as such, but stories about survival at the most basic, everyday level. <br /> <br /> Ale is one such street child. He has no education, and he still fusses to save money, he also does not focus on petty theft. Mainly he seeks to reunite with his older sister. We see him in early scenes, calling to a safe house, looking for her, but having no real success. A young friend, Carlos, gets him a job at a butcher shop, in the shadow of the Shea baseball stadium. In the end, his older sister comes to live with him on the spot, but he envies the motives of his friends and suspects how she earns extra money. He wants to buy a van with food and build a business with his older sister. <br /> <br /> Bahrani shoots all his films on the spot. There is nothing glossy or gloomy about them. This is the life of how these people should live raw. It's not beautiful, although it is never ominous, and the slightly desperate air that hangs over most of the film is the same that hangs over the daily lives of these people. <br /> <br /> The script is also very natural and the characters are provided with ample opportunities and space to work. Polanco plays a prominent role in the lead role, and Gonzalez provides solid support as an older sister.
