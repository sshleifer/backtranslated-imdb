Why did Jesse Matthews, one of the best music stars in Britain, end up in this film between her sparkling Good Companions and the classic Evergreen - a good question? When I first saw this, I was very disappointed. I wanted her to sing and dance - she was called "Millie - a girl without stopping", but there were more stops than diversity. <br /> <br /> Now I see it as a good little drama. <br /> This is about a car accident and telling stories about people in a bus. <br /> <br /> Aside from Jesse Matthews, who is as good as Millie, Sir Ralph Richardson plays his bride (yes, that's right). <br /> <br /> Edmund Gwenn - who went to Hollywood to star in Lassie films, as well as with Natalie Wood in “The Miracle on 34th Street”, plays a grumpy businessman, Gordon Harker - his very annoying partner. <br /> <br /> Emlyn Williams, who wrote Night Must Fall, was a black villain and Frank Lawton, who went to Hollywood and appeared in David Copperfield and The Devil Doll - a young man in trouble. Sonny Hale who was married to Jesse Matthews at the time, played the role of a bus conductor.
