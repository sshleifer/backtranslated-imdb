For many years I have been recollecting the song “JUST A PAIR IN THE LOCK” (“No. twenty lunar square, just a couple in the air castle”). I could not find the song, but I remembered that this was due to cartoon errors. I found a link to a movie on the Internet. I saw the film when I was only 9 years old, in the Ligonie Theater. I was pleased to learn that he has singer Kenny Gardner with Guy Lombaro (I'm a Lombardo fan). And then, to see that it was produced by the Fleisher brothers, who made another very good full cartoon feature of Gullivar's Travels (also remembered with love) The songs were also associated with Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, which are among the best. No wonder I remembered the movie, the song and the colorful animation. As a full-length musical, this is a film that should be remembered as one of the best early full-length musicals. Now that I remember this, the plot may not have been amazing, but it was very well presented and makes it easy to watch a delightful movie.
