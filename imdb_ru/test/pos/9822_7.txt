I read about 10 reviews of this film, but never once took them to heart. Harrison Ford is being criticized for everything from his haircut to his earrings, and I really don't understand how these things are related to the film. As far as I remember, he had bad hair and bad reviews in Blade Runner, but he is still a favorite among us, video films. This is slower than in most of his previous films, but it is not worthy of the garbage he received. <br /> <br /> I would gladly pay $ 7.50 just to see how bald Harrison Ford mows his lawn.
