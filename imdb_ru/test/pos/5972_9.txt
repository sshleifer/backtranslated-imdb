Fantastic Russian film about the Second World War. Like most Russian films about World War II, Ascension is incredibly painful. It is also dense in its symbolism. The story tells about two partisans, Sotnikov and Rybak (Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin), who go on a mission in search of food. During the trip, they are noticed by German soldiers who have wounded Sotnikova. Sotnikov, in turn, kills one of the Germans, which leads to trouble for the two partisans and everyone else they encounter later. The greatest success of the film is its vibrant sense of place. Russia is frozen and snowy, and it's hard not to feel that the cold is coming straight to your bones. Shepitko keeps his shot close to the characters, examining every rock on their faces. It was probably not a choice, but the film was created in 1.33: 1 format, which gives the film a claustrophobic feel. Although the entire film is a real achievement, I felt that the first half was stronger than the second. My main claim to the film is that its climax is a very fragile Christian allegory. I just do not think that symbolism adds much to the process, especially when I was already intrigued by the debate between the two partisans. This is not entirely fair. I weighed the pros and cons of their argument. I began to lean towards the point of view of a certain character, and then the director pops out and says that he is Judas! Despite some severity, it is still necessary to see.
