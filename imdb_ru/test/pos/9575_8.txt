You know, this film reminded me of so many people whom I know, I think, that is why I loved this film so much. I just laughed at the floor, because it was so serious and documented, but the dialogue is so cheerful that you can't not have a good time. In fact, the film tells about these crazy dog ​​owners who compete in a big dog show to see which one is the best. Although it seems that it should be dogs that are serious about this competition, it turns out that the owners are just as crazy. Megan, one of the dog owners, becomes almost a serial killer psycho at the hotel manager, because she can't find a special squeaky toy for her dog. <br /> <br /> There is another great couple, Jerry and Kuki. This complete nerd and attractive woman who is so attractive. At the beginning of the film, Jerry describes how many guys Cook had. Throughout the film, her “lovers” see her and beat her even in front of Jerry! It was just great and fun to watch Jerry's appearance. This entire film is just a scream, and you can't stop with recognizable faces that continue to appear. This is a great movie, just fun to watch, I highly recommend! Now I have to find a good way to show it to my friends, who are like these couples, to see their mirror image. : D <br /> <br /> 8/10
