This film was shown at the Egyptian American Cinematheque Theater in Hollywood on April 7, 1999. In the American Cinematheque, it was described as follows: <br /> <br /> “TOMORROW OTHER DAY 1951, Warners, 90 min. Steve Cochran is a former con woman who has never been with a woman. Ruth Roman is a lady who dances dime and is useless for juicy men. A hotel room, a dirty cop, a shotgun shot - a perfect jump for fugitives. Running love story. This virtually unknown noir is a masterpiece by Felix Feist, filled with candid stage plays. Cochrane has never been more vulnerable, Roman is never sexier. Imagine that GUN CRAZY was written by Steinbeck’s script — that’s so good. /> I just saw this movie, and I agree with every word of the above description.
