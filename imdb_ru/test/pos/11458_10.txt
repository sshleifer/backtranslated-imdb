This film was great, I do not understand disrespect for him. I first filmed this scene around 87-88, and it was really scary. If you're a fan of the horror of the 80s, you should have no problems with this film, which has everything that makes the horror of the 80s great. I met a few actors and they were awesome. Which is not very good in a creepy old house, demons, a crazy party and excited cute young people. Dialogue and special effects made this film a classic. This film also took care of one of those classic rumors of horror that a black guy doesn't always have to die in the end. Even though this film was great, there is one thing that remains unknown to me, what really happened to the old couple; it was on purpose or not, this little incidental story always puzzled me.
