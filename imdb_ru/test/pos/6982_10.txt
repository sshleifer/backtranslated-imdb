(VERY slightly spoyle) <br /> <br /> I have to start by saying that science fiction usually doesn’t impress me, so Pitch Black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. From the very beginning, I was hooked by the rhythm, intensity and visual surge that left me fascinated and glued to my place. I am very happy to say that this film was the best (well, at least * one * of the best) science fiction piece that I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The plot is, in short, it may seem simple - (the spacecraft) falls on a supposedly deserted planet, and Captain Caroline Fry (impressive Radha Mitchell) should lead the survivors to safety. At first, the cold-blooded killer Riddick (Vin Diesel, playing a role with a very believable spare style) may seem to be the group's biggest problem, but when dusk begins to creep, creatures of the night start to wake up ... This leads to a desperate attempt to escape from the bloodthirsty predators that, like we can all guess, does not lead to a happy family picnic. <br /> <br /> It’s not the plot that makes the film worth seeing - after all, let's face it, if you get it to the basics, it’s not * this * original - but the skill in which it is said. The story went on, not leaving me gaping (at least a little) at any moment. Directing was an incredible job. It was a very visual, even beautiful film; purple night view was a real treat. Although “beautiful” cannot be the right word; Yes, the images shown were candy for the eyes, but they also added an unidentified grotesque, eerie, as if something was about to break out from under a fixed surface. (Not to mention that the monsters were really well done, they looked realistic, which seems rare nowadays [maybe people just can't be bothered to make them look real ...]) <br /> <br I not only enjoyed the visual side of the film, but also the psychological aspect of the story. During the film, we see how the characters fall apart - some of them fall, some rise - but what struck me most was the development of Riddick's character. I enjoyed watching him change throughout the entire film. To go even further, another thing that I really liked about Riddick is the incredibly good and original UST (Unresolved Sexual Tension) between Fry and him, which is “no” (you’ll understand what I mean him) [It’s impossible to deny that they had chemistry. Don't even try, otherwise I will find you and make you listen as I play Chopsticks until you scream * grins *] It was fresh. As Radha Mitchell once said (modified quote), “Pitch Black is a really sexy movie without sex,” which makes it even more interesting. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I recommend this film - even if you're not really a fan of space stories. The wait persisted until the very end, and, importantly, we (or at least I) were left to want more. If you can't think about psychology, overtones, and the like (like my bad habit), you will still find Pitch Black very interesting. Just take off your shoes and enjoy.
