When it comes to these creepy and supernatural little crime movies, their types revolve around characters bordering scum and equally grim, and, moreover, carry this wobbling and somber feeling thanks to some rather dirty cinematography and very black comedy; Dead Bodies is a movie in which Paul McGuigan would like to play. Alas, the maddening and sporadic Gangster No. 1, as well as the shop everywhere, but an interesting exercise in surrealism combined with realism, the effort called Acid House is the only one that we must continue to this day. “Dead Bodies” is a work by Robert Quinn based on the screenplay of Derek Landy, a film that crosses the line between psychological horror and neo-noir; elements of crime and terror are mixed with themes related to morality and unnatural obsessive unrest. <br /> <br /> The British anti-crime efforts at McGuigan create a wavy and distorted feeling as if someone is seeing a nightmare and is taking place in the front row. His films are capable of disgusting in some areas and amusing in others with their outlandish and ubiquitous approach. Do they carry a very sleepy sensibility, despite the fact that they are based in a very realistic, tired out, dirty world? the real world with the same emphasis on the horror and horror of the situations in which his characters spawn, than anything else. “Dead bodies” is a film that considers both rather gloomy, character-driven situations, and a brief study of subtle psychological thinking, only here the film balances the eccentricity of its characters; horror of the scenarios in which they find themselves, and moral issues that arise much better. <br /> <br /> Dead bodies are efficient and fairly simple, never feeling manipulative. His thought-provoking and knowledgeable tendency to want to hammer home exactly what people think and feel does not detract from the experience. Soon we meet with Tommy McGann (Scott), a young guy whose girlfriend Jean (Davis) dominates him, his life and the screen when she is for a short time during which she is. The fact is that he lives in a less desirable home; with stacking work shelves and a partner with whom he doesn’t get along at all, he is exposed in an excellent manner. As well as the way that the audience gives explicit permission to dislike Jin, that with her coarse, spoiled and expectant looks that she so clearly possesses. Later, the film will most likely linger on the face of a policeman, as suspicion and tension are growing in what is clearly a cheap and simple way to tell viewers that our hero is not quite in trouble. <br /> <br /> But compare this with “Gangster No. 1,” in which this is the episodic and erroneous approach that McGuigan applies to the material; that a vital plot point arises when a character is noticed, leaving the building to someone else on a “random disk” in a scene set a few months after the previous one. The feeling is not so reasonable and not satisfying. In the dead bodies dominates Gene Kay Davis; the future femme fatale, simply thirsty to grab some kind of fight, but just not able to find her. She led Tommy, jumping through the rings; go there, do this and that without Tommy never reacting as he could, mainly because his promises of sex controlled him. The onset creates a certain amount of stress due to Tommy’s unappreciated reaction to what is happening, and it ends in a separate release when the first incident occurs, and Jin dies. <br /> <br /> If the setting is simple enough, then this is one thing, but the main thing in the project is how Tommy decides to rid Jean of his hands by burying her, without informing anyone of her death as the best friend. The situation is delayed when it turns out that in the same place where Tommy had buried Jean, a second dead body appeared with suspicions, denials and common problems with all the components of the day. It is at this point that the film blurs the line between noir and horror; in fact, Tommy lives in a rather large, sinister, eerie, and even gothic house that he shares with an older relative who lives in the upper parts of this house. This brings back memories of the 1960 Hitchcock film Psycho and Bates, which he established with his mother and where she is. Moreover, it is not by chance that this potential place of horror is the place for Jean’s unfortunate demise. <br /> <br /> Putting the dead body directly into the hands of the unfortunate male leash so that it can act since the initial incident is a classic installation for any noir; from the Ulmer film of 1945, The Circumvention, to a more modern and more modern film, The Dead Bodies, 2006 called Big Nothing. What this film is turning into is distorted; a rather unpredictable and rather frightening story about genre hybridity and intellectual games, told under a palette of distinctly depleted visual effects. A voice-over and a step on the fine line that the presenter makes for the most part of the film between right and wrong helps to move him into the realm of neo-noir; Considering the fact that the main role is essentially innocent, and his murder charges are unfair, this is one thing, but his attitude towards Jean initially made him act thoughtlessly, and his concealment of her death is an anti-thesis for refusing to charge murder. Dead bodies are taught; it is entertaining to watch without even feeling exploitative, and provides a consistent tone for the rather unpleasant physical and psychological content that is explored.
