“Live Together, Die Alone” is divided into three storylines, and each of them would be enough for a great episode. Therefore, when you put them all together, you get a great ^ 3 episode. It was a bold step to give memories of the season finale to the character (Desmond), which appeared only in 3 episodes up to this point, but it worked: its background is absolutely fascinating, as the informative about the past the island and the Swan station itself honestly move. Desmond and Penny seem to be magically connected to each other, even when they are at opposite ends of the world, and both characters work beautifully (it's hard not to cry when Desmond is reading a Penny letter). The action inside the hatch strains the edge of your place, since Locke is determined not to allow the button to be pressed again, I am convinced that this is just a psychological experiment, Desmond is gradually aware of the consequences of this decision, and Eco is locked out and desperately trying to return inside. Melting watches and Locke "I was wrong" - unforgettable moments. In external action, Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley were captured by Others because of Michael's treachery (after they made the mysterious discovery associated with the Pearl) and the game-changing return of Henry Gale as the leader of the Others. Even the least important storyline - Said, Jin and Song, sailing to the beach where the camp “The Rest” are supposedly located, contains one of the series’s greatest mythological puzzles - a giant statue that is almost completely missing, with the exception of a four-toed leg. In short: emotion + history + mythology + adventure + suspense + threat of destruction + ray of hope = classic TV series LOST. *** 1/2 of 4.
