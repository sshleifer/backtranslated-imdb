After a summer full of repetitions and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is not like the others I've ever seen. Directed by Neil Labute proves that he can not only take disturbing photographs of men and women and how they approach sex (his previous two films were great in the company of men and almost brilliant “Your friends and neighbors”). Renee Zellweger shows the best role in her career as Betty, a waitress, who, when she witnesses the brutal death of her husband-Muhux (LaButh guardian Aaron Eckhart), is lost in the fantasy world. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play assassins who killed her husband and are now at her trial. The trick of the film is that Freeman and Zellweger are truly parallel characters. While Zellweger falls in love with the image of the handsome and polite Dr. Dave Ravel in the soap opera, Freeman idealizes Betty. Nurse Betty is a bright film full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. My rating: 10/10.
