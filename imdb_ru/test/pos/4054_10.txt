I saw this movie on PBS for the first time. Then I bought a video and watched it countless times. Every time I watch it, I can get something else out of it. This is real evidence that we want to save a life that was good, but now the world is changing. But you don’t need to be older to keep the past; even young characters like Charlotte don’t want everything to change. The overall tone and mood are excellent. The cast is outstanding with all the stars, like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy. And it’s very nice to see future stars before they play in more recognizable feature films, such as Kevin J. O'Connor (The Mummy) and Vincent D'Onofrio ("Men in Black and Law and Order: Malice" is of my favorite shows), This is just one of those films that remain with you.
