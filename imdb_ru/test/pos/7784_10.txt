Well, this is the best comedy film I've ever seen ... My favorite actors did a great job. Salman Khan and Amir Khan swayed. I hope to see Andaz Apna Apna part 2 as soon as I heard that they will come back with part 2. I have a request for those who have not watched it. Please buy a DVD and watch it, you will not be bored. I watch this movie once a week. Everything else was good in this movie too. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and others. The music is also good, there are good songs in it. There is some meaning that will kill you from laughing. Salman Khan played a very good role, as well as Amir. <br /> <br /> So the actors and directors should watch the movie perfectly.
