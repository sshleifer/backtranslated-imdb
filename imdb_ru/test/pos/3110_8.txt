I recently watched this movie again (after 25 years). In the original, there is a scene in the bathroom of the plane during the landing between the character Jacqueline Bisset and the character Michael Brandon. The rented version did not have this scene. I imagined it? <br /> <br /> Or is it part of the “clean up” of films, where some change to exclude parts that, according to some, are not “suitable”? <br /> <br /> I like this film - it looks like a friendship between me and a friend, and we have been friends for 25 years and have seen it together. Her husband also thought it was us. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Joan
