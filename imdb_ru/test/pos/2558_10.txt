my girlfriend, when we walk on a cold London evening to Leicester Square after the film, says: if they didn’t speak English and didn’t show the stadium, you might think that these are slums of a South American city or some other slums of the world, not in Queens in New York. <br /> <br /> Ramin Bakhrani is now my official hero, because he seems to have dedicated his work in order not to show ANOTHER American face but the PRESENT face of America. <br /> <br /> Ramina Bakhrani’s films are similar to Ladri di biciclette, or Germania anno zero, or Roma citta 'aperta. The chop shop is a reality turned into a film, more realistic than a documentary, in fact, I think that the films of Ramin Bakhrani are more realistic than documentaries. These are great movies, but don't expect to chase or shoot. This film is about the tragic lives on the edge of the richest, richest country in the world.
