Leos Carax shot 3 great films: “Boys Meet Girls”, “Mouve Sang”, “Le Amant du Pont Neuf”. In fact, these films were not so good, but they have the violence of youth, the beauty of the young desert. Carax in these three films knew well what a movie was, but he tried to create his own vision of art, not thinking about everything he saw, but using it and dissolving it in his times. Paula X is a completely different film because Carax created the film Les Amants du Pont Neuf, a monstrosity of $ 20 million, a film that destroyed everything in its path. After such a film, you cannot do another from the same point of view. So Leos Carax must change, and he did it. The film is not as beautiful as its first film, it is more reasonable, there is no more studio, no longer dreamed of Paris, Carax has finally come into reality. It is no longer pure, it is not poetic characters. Carax became a romantic in the German sense of the word.
