After watching the trailer on the DVD "Little Mermaid 2: Return to the Sea" I got the feeling that this film would be great because I am a big Disney fan. And guess what? I'm right! This film is a very worthy successor to the original classic Lady and the Tramp. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of Scamp, the mischievous son of the Lady and Trump, Samp, who wants to be wild and free, and not live a home life. Although the film may not be as good as the first one, it has a wonderful moral that you cannot find anywhere else until you watch it. <br /> <br /> I admit that the film is not for everyone, but those of you who hate it, all I can say is that you do not have the spirit for this, and I advise you not to attend him again. But hey! This is truly an amazing story, filled with brilliant animation, music and talent voiced by stars with the participation of Scott Wolf (Party of Five) and Alyssa Milano (Charmed). So, if you haven't seen the movie yet, why stand there? Go and get a copy !!!
