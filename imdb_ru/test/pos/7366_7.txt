A good (not big) small horror film with a high creep factor (not to be confused with the 1991 film of the same name or later (2001) Campfire HISTORY). The central story of stuck adolescents telling ghost stories around a campfire in terrible forests pleasantly leads and ties together the different stories that make up the main part of the film (“Watch for Ron Livingstone” (“Office Space”, “Brothers in Spirit”) and Jennifer MacDonald in the energetic, sexual segment ("Honeymoon")). Hard action and some really scary moments make this chiller above average. A good example of an interesting storyline combined with a high-quality ensemble game, resulting in a whole, larger than the sum of its parts. “Surprise” in the final of the main plot adds a pleasant eerie twist, although some may see it coming. The film is not available on DVD, but it can be found on VHS.
