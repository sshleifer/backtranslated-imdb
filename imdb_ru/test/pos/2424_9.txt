This is another of Robert Altmanâ€™s underrated films (let's be honest, the only film he shot that really didn't work was Ready to Wear), and Sandy Dennis gives him a stunning presentation. She is much better here than she was "Outside the townspeople." I admit the material is under the great director Altman and extraordinary actress Dennis, but it still hardly matters. story.
