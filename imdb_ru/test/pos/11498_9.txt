Jolene (Heather Graham) goes after her husband Carl (Luke Wilson), who disappeared to clear his head about himself and his marriage. Jolene, who is devoted to their marriage, begins her journey to find Carl, but on the way she learns a lot about herself. On her trip, she meets many interesting characters who unknowingly help her find her way. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a classic road film that moves at the right pace (some viewers may find it too). slow). Throughout the film, he keeps his humorous note, while Jolene responds to the crazy world around her with a warm, understanding, sometimes sad smile. All the actresses and actors give great performances, and the music is impeccable. 9/10
