Well, maybe Posse can't compare with other popular cowboy / western movies. But this is because he did not have the FINANCING that those films had. Obviously, whenever you want to create a story that focuses on the historical participation of African Americans (and NO, servants and “moms” is not historical participation), Hollywood will not be too supportive. And believe me, they were not. The producers and actors donated huge “pocket” expenses to make “Posse”, just to tell this story. I think that one thing is commendable. Posse may not be Oscar material (and they don’t like Black media too much), but this is just the beginning. This is interesting, and it introduces us to a black cowboy, a character with whom most of us are unfamiliar.
