I bought this film from my local blockbuster for 99 pence, and he has been on my video book for at least a year. Then I decided to watch it tonight, the film was very different from what I was expecting, and I didn’t find any humor in it, all I saw was that it was a gloomy view of people engaged in love and sexual orientation I really don’t see a psycho-killer plot that really makes sense but to add tension to the end of the film. I felt like a man playing a lesbian woman did a great job. I followed her emotions and what was happening around her. Some people might have seen some things that she does as funny, but I really could put myself in her place, love someone, but they rejected you at every step, no matter how hard you try. I thought it was a very touching film and coped well with all kinds of sexuality. I was expecting something like Bound & Gagged: a love story, but this is a completely different movie. Not for fans.
