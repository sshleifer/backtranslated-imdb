I’m a Junior Officer 1st Class (E-6), I’ve been in the USCG for 6 years and I feel that this film is a strong representation of the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were contrived. The most contrived was the case when P.O. Fisher (Kutcher) went inside the sinking ship to pull the captain out of the engine room ... this will never happen. Swimmers are not allowed to go inside any vessel, regardless of the circumstances. Secondly, the command center (presumably in Kodiak), it was more like a NASA command center ... we do not have a single mechanism that would be high-tech. Thirdly, the captain of the station will not be engaged in search and rescue operations, when there will be about 10 people on guard. In fact, it will be E-6 or E-7 as a SAR controller and possibly 2 other auxiliary employees, such as an auxiliary SAR controller and a surveillance radio. Otherwise, the film would be dead, I think they should include more indicators in CG and their role in search and rescue, and not just in aviation rates. Some scenes from school “A” reminded me of my days, of them and of the nonsense that I did, and I had problems in my young years.
