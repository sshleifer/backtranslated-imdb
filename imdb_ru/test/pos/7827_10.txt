When I first saw that this show was advertised to be shown on Australian television in the late 90s, I ignored it, thinking that it was simply benefiting from Kevin Costnerâ€™s film The Bodyguard. But then I caught the episode and would like to watch it from the very beginning. The partnership between Shaun Pertwee and Louise Lombard was so successful, and the structure of each episode was extremely interesting. It was not a bloated television show that, as you can tell, spent most of its energy on making things explode so they could put this clip on a commercial to attract an audience and then not show it on any other level . The show penetrated the lives of the two main characters, and this made it interesting. The stories for each episode are also well written with guest stars who were good actors. And of course there was a lot of action and intrigue, which is always good. But what was great was the fact that there was humor, and it flowed naturally from the characters, it did not look frivolous. It was British, but in a good way, and if this show were made in America, it would undoubtedly be already on DVD. I do not know why British television companies are not interested in releasing this show on DVD. It was a great show and deserves a DVD release.
