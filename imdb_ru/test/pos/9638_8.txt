In my personal opinion, The Patriot is one of the best films about Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> I heard that people say that this is the worst film, this is not the SS, etc. I do not agree. Being a highly spiritual person, the great master Sigal created a good tradition in action movies. He always has a good background, excellent actions, high professionalism and a clever message. This film has it all. You have good shots, great aikido. Although it is not so much, it shows us its peaceful side. This change in his film making only proves his spiritual growth (in the end, he does not kill Chisolm's friend). <br /> <br /> “Patriot” is undoubtedly one of the best films from the “director’s” point of view, which I’ve seen recently. You have magnificent panoramic images of Montana, we see real American nature and beautiful wildlife (among other things - horses and flowers). The soundtrack also deserves a few words. During the film, I had a great opportunity to listen to classic American-cowboy-western music (but not Country). Similar music sounded in “Back to the Future Prt.3”. The acting skills of the SS have greatly improved since his last films. His role is unfamiliar to him (unlike the police and commandos), but he copes well with the role of "retired doctor from the government." His actions are convincing, and his lines are good. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased with the actors. LQ Jones proves that life and death walk the Earth together, Whitney Yellow Robe plays a beautiful and intelligent scientist, Camilla Belle performs wonderfully in the role of McLaren's daughter. <br /> <br /> Mr. Seagal talks about the controversial “Real Americans.” ”Traditions and militia provide their point of view (he really likes the Constitution, but plump bearded men have nothing to do with this). Good comments are also made regarding the system and nature of East-West medicine. <br /> <br /> Best in Seagal. And opening up new horizons in his cinematic career. <br /> <br />
