Immediately, I love this movie. I like everything about it. He has a great soundtrack, he has many recognizable faces, and this is pretty damn funny. There are so many plots in this film, and each of them is somehow funny. <br /> <br /> Although Spikolli lit up the screen two years ago, Drake is almost the same catchy character. All he wants to do is have some fun. He leaves home without parental consent, he misses work whenever he likes it, he is obsessed with sex, he loves drugs and alcohol, and he tries to be a good friend. It is his unworthy attitude that makes him such a joy to watch. And he comes out with some wonderful lines. And there are so many tiny observations that you do not see the approximation, but they make you laugh at the absolute speed when it hits you. One particular point is when Tommy and Bill talk about the ex-girlfriend of Bill who is dating someone else. At the end of the conversation, Tommy takes his huge beer bottle and just throws it over his shoulder, by chance. Then he says good night and the scene ends. This is the perfect scene. Tommy's world is his own. He really lives to have fun and have fun. When the conversation is over, his time is up, and he doesn't care who he insults in the process. He has an innocence about him. "This is an accident" - his favorite saying. <br /> <br /> Another classic scene is Reggie giving a donut to Bill. He tells him something that my friends and I will never forget, because we rewound the film ten times and watched this part again and again and hurt ourselves. This is a must see to appreciate. <br /> <br /> “Wildlife” is a comeback when the young comedies were funny, lustful, had a good ear, entertained us and just wanted us to get lost in their world of 90 minutes. Wild Life does it all perfectly. If this is a movie that you have not seen, give it a chance. This is a classic. <br /> <br /> Also look at the guy from the army store, with whom Jim has problems. Now he is a very familiar face, and this is his first role on the big screen.
