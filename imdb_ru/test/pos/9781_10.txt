My family and I enjoy this show and find it in a rather interesting sketch of what people went through. <br /> <br /> My father spent some time in Changi before heading for the Thailand-Burma railway in the "F" strength. As was already said about the treatment of prisoners of war, I simply say that my father was 6 feet 1 inch and 196 pounds when Singapore fell, at the end of the war he was 5 feet 11 inches and 91 pounds. <Br /> <br /> None of the shows could really tell about what prisoners of war went through, but this is closer than most. <br /> <br /> As a former prisoner of war says: "If you had no comrades, you did not survive." This show successfully transmits this message.
