I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere). <br /> <br /> An obsessive, intimate portrait of loneliness and the consequences of growing up and becoming something more sombre. <br /> <br /> The game of two roles (Jessica Ball and Richard Brandeige) is excellent, and you want you to meet with these characters before they become so damaged. <br /> <br /> He reminded me of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (From where I call). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and enhances the moments in the film without attracting attention. <Br /> <br /> Strongly recommend the movie and soundtrack.
