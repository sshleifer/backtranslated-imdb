“American next top model” - the best reality show! I was having fun 99.9% of the time watching this. I kept my eyes open all the time. (well, I blinked) It might be sad, funny, or addicting. (mostly addicted) "America's Next Top Model" made me want more, and that's the point. It's also on more than one channel. Sometimes it's on MTV, and sometimes not. I hope she gets more fans and becomes a hit! This is great for all ages, so everyone can enjoy it! :) <br /> <br /> In addition, if you watched the show before, did you not notice that Tyra has different hairstyles in the judges' hall every time? She will have a short and curly week, and next week she will be long and straight.
