Great book, great movie, great soundtrack. Frank Sinatra shows in this film that when he wants to make an effort, he can act. The ending is a bit dull, but so far it is clear that the studio wanted a happy ending. The graphic nature of heroin addiction (innovative for the period) is a plus. Add a stunning soundtrack and youâ€™ll get one of the best American movies.
