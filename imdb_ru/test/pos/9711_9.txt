Where should I start? I sat down, ready to laugh a little, and I was amazed! This film is just perfect, indescribable. Donkey number two in all honesty was rougher, more obscene, ridiculous and more interesting than the first. That was exactly what I needed tonight. <br /> <br /> There are so many scenes in this movie that make you say, “Oh my! No way! ”Or“ Oh! ” Perfectly mastered and tuned, each event and scene was coordinated long before that and, therefore, made it even more perfect. I loved every minute of it! I just want to say that there was even a scene where it was necessary to censor certain frames in order to prevent the NC-17 rating! It was so much fun that they still had to put it in! Surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> 9/10. Incredibly funny, do not miss!
