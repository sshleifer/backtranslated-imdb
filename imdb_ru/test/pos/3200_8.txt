This short film (and the poem behind it) is one of the greatest metaphors I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The poem is beautiful! Does this accurately describe the feeling of a person who is chasing a dream and cannot realize it ?? but it also tells how to accomplish this! In "The Story of a Cat and the Moon," I see one beautiful metaphor of human relationships, passion and love. <br /> <br /> Technically this is also well done. Despite its simplicity, the animation in black and white gives the tone to the allegory of the film and its message, as well as tenderness and nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Depending on the music, it also contributes to this poetic feeling. <br /> <br /> “Nothing else matters! I'll wait! She will come when she can, or when she wants! ”
