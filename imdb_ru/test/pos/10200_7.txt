This Western was installed in 1861 and was associated with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by Western Union. While the good guy Dean Jagger (with a lot of hair) did his best to achieve this, there was a bad guy who just waited to cancel it for his selfish reasons. Thus, Randolph Scott or Robert Young can save the day. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best westerns of the 1940s, which I saw, and he scored almost 8 - it was so good. However, I don’t know why Fritz Lang was commissioned to make this film, after all, he didn’t know anything about westerns. His strong point was drama - and I believe that this film is a kind of drama set in the old West. Strange, yes, but it seems that everything turned out well, although I wonder how this great German director felt that he had been given this work. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the film, it is exceptional - with bright color, a great shooting location and a very good acting game. As usual, Randolph Scott delivered another calm and realistic presentation. I was surprised that Robert Young was also filmed in the film, but it was a good decision - he had to be an Oriental resident at Harvard. When I saw that Barton McLain also starred in the film, I pretty much assumed that he would be a “villain”, and my thoughts were quite reasonable, since he made a career playing idiots! As for the screenplay, it seemed pretty mundane for the most part, but the final fight between Scott and Barton McLain was much better than I had hoped to complete this film on a very high note.
