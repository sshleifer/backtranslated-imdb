I have to admit that I liked this movie much more than I expected. Will Smith has that charming charm that simply cannot fail to please. The plot was a slight twist on the main romantic comedies, somewhat reminiscent of Emma by Jane Austen. This guy Kevin James has a real talent for comic time and physical comedy. I have never seen his television show, but in this film he was played very well. Amber Valletta was good enough. I can't remember why she was a rich celebrity in this film, but if she were to be an actress or a model, then the casting could leave much to be desired. I enjoyed Julie Ann Emery and would like her to have a big part. But, saving the best from the last, Eva Mendez more or less stole the show. Her beauty, charm, and just unceremoniousness led me to the screen whenever she was there. I hope to see more of her in the future. This movie is definitely worth seeing.
