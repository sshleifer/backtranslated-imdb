The grace of this film is his humor. Taking advantage of the strengths of their star, Warner Brothers presented their version of General Custer as a daring, dashing, disrespectful joker with a romantic stripe and an unexpected manifestation of idealism; it was Robin Hood again and again, and Flynn flourished in the role. All of his best action films used his talent for pranks and ridiculous timing, and this film was no exception. <br /> <br /> He also benefits from Olivia de Havilland’s former colleague’s return, despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership; Libby Custer's decisive role is a better role than the sweet love types she was tired of playing in the studio in Flynn’s later films, and when he saw the script, he specifically requested that De Havilland be played out so that she could pay tribute to the pieces. In this latest collaboration, she puts all her significant acting skills into what is, at bottom, an exciting adventure film, and screen chemistry is rekindling - this time she and Flynn get a chance to develop their characters beyond the original novel. in the old couple, to the same advantageous effect. <br /> <br /> The Flynn / de Havilland pairing and the comedy strip - this is what ensured the longevity of this film, when most of the other Flynn westerns were held in such affection by the modern American public, although they were not their star - long forgotten. The scenes in the films are rather superficial (despite the fact that, ironically, during one of the dropped charges, an additional one died in the fall), and the villains from this play, the school manners, turn out to be the same people who were disgusting before Our hero. on the very first day at West Point, and thus continued to upset him throughout his career. This shortens the list of actors, but it is too convenient from a moral point of view. <br /> <br /> Still, this is a niggle, largely unrelated to a film that should never have been more than exciting entertainment. Cleverly supported and instigated by a group of supportive players (in particular, Anthony Quinn as the Sioux leader without words), Errol Flynn jumps over the plot thanks to his usual arsenal: charmingly embarrassed glances, unexpected sweetness, mischievous blinks, outrage, outrage, cheerful communication and complete high octane charisma. He is a reckless bouncer, but you can't help loving him. And it's hard to leave without the “Garryowen” tune leaking through your ears for many days after that. <br /> <br /> This is one of Flynn's latest hits; it also contains an amazing amount of good acting in a fun way and deserves to be remembered.
