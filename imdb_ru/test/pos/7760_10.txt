Suzumiya Haruhi no yutsu (Melancholia Haruhi Suzumiya) may at first glance make you think that this is just another animated school comedy / drama. Well, it is not so! The setting just happens in the school environment. This is a good comedy, but very clever with great sarcasm. And the characters really have a psychological sublimency, which is almost in the same class, which can be found in the works of Ingmar Bergman. The episodes are transmitted, as it seems, out of order, that is, the pilot is actually episode 11. This allows you to submit small hints to the upcoming episodes. The show is an adaptation of Nagaru Tanigawa's popular novel about Haruhi Suzumiya. <br /> <br /> How about a story? As in all episodes, the story revolves around Haruhi Suzumiya, who tries to ease her own boredom by going on adventures. Haruhi herself is not interested in ordinary people and is actively looking for aliens, time travelers and espers (people with supernatural forces). To find this kind of people, she created a club that she calls the SOS Brigade (Save the world by overloading it with fun: Haruhi Sudzumias’s brigade). Besides Haruhi, the rest of the SOS brigade is Kion. He is the real main character of the series. It is from his point of view that we are following the story. He just happened to be in front of the class when Haruhi got the idea to form a SOS brigade. He is quite skeptical of most club events and just makes sure that Haruhi doesn’t take himself to extremes too much, and he is the only one in the class with whom Haruhi likes to talk. Another participant is Yuki Nagato, who is “an irreplaceable silent member”, and also the only remaining member of the literary club, whose room SOS-Brigade occupied in search of a free club room. She does not mind that the SOS team uses its club while it can sit in the corner and read its books. She is also involved in brigade activities. Mikuru Asahina was “voluntarily arrested” by Haruhi, because the club needed a talisman similar to Lolita for something suspicious to happen. She often acts as a maid in clubs. The last participant is the always smiling Itsuki Koizumi, who turned out to be a “mysterious student-translator” (that is, he translated two months into a semester, which Haruhi considers mysterious). <br /> <br /> Haruhi believes that all the participants, except for Ken, are random people at school, but they do have an interest in her.
