Well-filmed, renowned director Hugh Hudson (“Chariots of Fire”) creates a story in which the entire legend of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke and Tarzan of monkeys comes to life with reverence and dignity, as well as with the scale that has not yet been in the films of Tarzan . Christopher Lambert debuts starring as a young lord raised in the wild by a gorilla woman after his parents died in Africa. Later, returning to the fact that for him is an alien world, class and privileged, he feels completely out of place. As soon as he finds out what happened to the monkeys that raised him and their world, he realizes that he must return. A sad but triumphant story, told against the backdrop of fantastic perspectives. This is one of those films that is required for every Cinemaphile collection.
