Checking Out will be released on Friday, September 15, 2006, through the AMC cinema chain, starting in New York. Times Square, 66th and 3rd Ave., West 84th Street. This film was one from the heart, for the heart. Mark Lane, John Karas, Richard Marcus, Jeff Hare, Dana Harrlo, Matt Jensen Ed Abrams, Nick Pike, Peter Falk, Laura San Giacomo, David Peimer, Judge Reinhold, all the actors and film crew knew that this film was something special. It is supposed to comfort older people, the proximity of the family is now more obvious than ever. I would recommend this movie to all ages and races. This story sounds true to everyone, with or without family.
