Florence Widor plays the role of the daughter of a strict biblical father who throws her out of the house when gossip spoils her name. In the big city, she finds the dying wife of her own brother (they secretly married) and brings up her own child. Years later, she returns home to confront her family. <br /> <br /> This old melodrama is full of exciting feminist themes (circa 1921, but sounds surprisingly modern). Some of them are superimposed with a trowel (like his father, Theodore Roberts gives his eyebrows a real workout), but he is well drafted and lovingly composed and filmed by filmmaker Henry Sharp.
