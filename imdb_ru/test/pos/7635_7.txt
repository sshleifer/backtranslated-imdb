L'OSSESSA, also known as THE TORMENTED or SEXORCIST, or ridiculously called EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is the forgotten EXORCIST plagiarism, containing one of the best horror moments I've ever seen. The scene when the crucifix comes to life. This great creepy scene is unforgettable and absolutely effective (great effects). It is a pity that the rest of the film does not support the level of eeriness shown in this scene. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most unpleasant movies ever. Imagine that the manufacturers decided to make a copy of EXORCIST, but by making it, they actually manage to create something truly original (an obsessive sculpture of a crucified person who is shocking when you think about it), but then completely forgets his original idea to make a boring and boring plagiarism EXORCIST. If the film continued with the concept of a possessed sculpture (with characters trying to destroy it, etc.), this film would have been shocked. But as soon as the girl becomes obsessed with the spirit of the sculpture, she never tells anyone where the demon came from. She and the script completely forget the haunted crucifix, which is stupid !!! <br /> <br /> If you like the so-called Eurocult films, the first 45 minutes are shown, unlike any other eurocult. films. But after the scene, when the girl has a vision of a crucifix, and she gets stigmatized, the remaining 45 minutes suck. Boring. He is not going anywhere fast, as he is trying (poorly) to imitate the EXORTSIST. So, watch the first 45 minutes of L'OSSESSA and enjoy the 1970s fashion, the chic scene and the amazing scene “comes alive and rapes a girl”, but after the first 45 minutes click “Stop” and “throw it away”, and maybe go as well. toenails.
