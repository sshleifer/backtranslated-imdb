Faqrscape is truly one of those shows that have everything: a great acting, a great cast, great scripts, productions, chemistry, dolls ... he has everything, and then some, except at home. It seems that this fantastic series has everything except the end and the end. TPTB seems to think that this is a series of consecutive single shows, when anyone who looks knows that this is a continuous, one epic love story that has an end to be seen. If you have never seen Farscape do yourself a favor and check it out on DVD when the 1st season comes out in October ... and the 2nd season is the best! Watch the replays on the SciFi channel to catch up, and then the new season will start in January-March, when most of the shows will take place during the breaks and be sure to watch. If all goes well, we will get our end!
