Oddly enough, the Independent Film Channel showed this film a week later AFTER the KARATE BEAR FIGHTER film was shown - although the bear film was the second in the trilogy, and this film was the first !!! What were they thinking about ?! Although all three of these films are supposedly based on the life of this great Kyokushin karate master, you can't help but think that they MUST embellish the story, especially in this first film. Of course, the guy obviously REALLY fought and killed a bull, and then a bear (in fact, he fought and killed MANY bulls for his career), but in this film, filmed in the early 50s, at the end of the film, the hero on in fact, about 60 guys are fighting and brutally killing many of them. I just can not imagine that this really happened. So I checked some things and found that, although many of the details are correct, part of this film is sheer nonsense! Yes, he REALLY killed a man in self-defense, and YES, he really followed the widow and her son and spent a year working on them - trying to make them forgive him. But the end of the film is nice to watch, but garbage. Seeing how one of his opponents received a blow to the head, and all the other terrible details could not have happened, otherwise the Japanese government would have blocked Oyama to protect society! The film is interesting, and the fight is great. No claim to action or action. The only minor complaint is working with the camera - which is a bit messy during some battle scenes. Despite this minor complaint, this is the most enjoyable movie. In many respects, the theme of the master of wandering karate is rather reminiscent of Zatoichi films, which are also very interesting to watch, but many of the feats are truly impossible. <br /> <br /> For your information - there is a dubbed version of this film called “Death Champion,” and I just saw it. This is not a bad dubbing, and it was in the mailbox (a big plus), but I still prefer the subtitle version.
