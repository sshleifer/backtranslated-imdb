This film offers one of the greatest impressions available to film fans. It is by no means a pleasant film, but it offers realities and emotions that the human mind may never have wanted to touch. This opens the way to how a person thinks, and subsequently changes a person forever. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this film was in class, and immediately after watching it, I had to skip the next lesson and walk around the campus to restore my body and mind. I felt devastated and somehow unreal, as if I did not exist. Only a few months later, I told one of my friends about SHAME, and she asked: â€œOh, is that when you got confused to see this, and came across me saying everything strange about it? I do not even remember whether I came across or spoke to anyone at all when I was surprised that day. <br /> <br /> In plot terms, this is a simple story about a couple torn by war. There is more suffering than the dead, and by the end ... there are no words to complete the image that Bergman creates. It's like a terrible dream that makes you wake up, forever changing your own reality. This film is a must see.
