well ... first fans of Anne Rice BOOKS .... <br /> <br /> Of course, Lestatâ€™s eyes are not blue ... sure that he is not blond in this film ... but even if Marius is not a Lestat creator. .. although they completely changed the story ..... <br /> <br /> how can you say that this is not a very good film .. <br /> <br /> this film ... THE BEST film about vampires I've ever seen ... and Lestat is beautifully depicted in it ... maybe not in his features ... but I don't think that you can find the best flattering ... as he says ... and as he looks at mere mortals ... his arrogance ... and chi a flock of love of glory is depicted flawlessly. <br /> <br /> if you are this time ... consider it just a movie ... and do not try to link each scene with a book ... you will love the movie as much as I do. <br /> <br /> now ... not to readers .. <br /> <br /> be ready to fall absolutely in love with this film .... everything has it .... and gothic music ... it's like an extra pleasure ... the dialogues ... are beautiful ... and exciting ... and even though it is a movie about vampires ... you will have a smile ... the intelligence of the characters ... and you will find that you sympathize with vampires .. . <br /> <br /> overall ... one of my favorite movies ... !! 10/10
