Another Asian horror movie, filled with tense and creepy moments. Another Asian horror trademark is plot complexity, which is also here. THE MAIN WARNING ABOUT SPOILER! <br /> <br /> The film begins quite simply: the two sisters start living with their father and stepmother after they are placed in a mental hospital after their mother hangs herself. The sisters seem very hostile towards their mother — especially the older one — and they seem to ignore their father. Everything goes smoothly until the mother locks the younger sister in the closet, and the older sister does not tell her father about it. Then he hits you: “Your sister has been dead for years.” It turns out that the older sister still has not recovered from the death of her mother, and we did not know that the wardrobe in which she was hanged fell on her younger sister and killed her as well. As for the stepmother, she is the elder sister's alter ego - revealed when the stepmother (actually the sister's alter ego) is sitting on the couch when the real stepmother enters! I hope this has become clearer for the bewildered Asian horror fans. <br /> <br /> Finally, my favorite scene is a scene where a father invites friends for dinner, and one of his friends begins to choke, which results in a panic attack. Very creepy! 7 out of 10
