Ham actor without a penny. Who is better than Michael Kane to play such a character? He is very, very funny, but, as in most of Kane's speeches, he does it for real. The film seems to be the showcase of Dylan Moran, and he is great in his double action with Kane. This, however, is where the script breaks down. Moran's avatars should have been included in a more organic way. They act too much on their own, and the potential plausibility of the plot flies out of the window. Nevermind. Get it if you can. It is enough to make it a pleasant journey.
