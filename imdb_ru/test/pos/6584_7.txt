I saw this film in 2006 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, and director Aku Louhimis presented his film and then prepared for answers. For some reason, this film is called “Frozen Land” in English, so I don’t know how distributors froze from Paha. This is a very good movie. I miss the fact that I would have raised it a notch, but I spoke with some viewers who felt it was a great movie. Luimis said that in Finland, people either loved this film or hated it, and said that many people in cinemas went to it. I’m sure that some have objected to some of the scenes of violence, abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, and sex scenes. This is a very clever story about how these different lives are woven together due to the trickle-down effect. In this film, very interesting and strong characters. I would rate it 7.0 out of a possible 10 and would like to see it again and recommend it with caution.
