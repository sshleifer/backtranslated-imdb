Spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> 2001: A Space Odyssey is without a doubt the most complex and successful film of the late Stanley Kubrick. This is not a movie that you watch to have fun or have fun. Instead, he provides you with a banquet of food for thought, images that linger in your mind long after the end of the film itself. This is a movie you could meditate on. <br /> <br /> The film intentionally offers us more questions than it can answer, it was created to perplex and guess, but, nevertheless, leaves the viewer with a sense of awe and reverence. (this allows him to participate in the process of viewing it, some viewer’s effort is needed from the viewers) or the creative mind behind the structure of the universe itself. <br /> <br /> The first of the Four Quartet films gives us a clear view of the past of the species. We see our distant ancestors, half apes, in a state of almost hunger. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life, and vegetarian animals are close to exhaustion. An extreme object appears, a completely smooth and angular black monolith, and animals are simultaneously inspired by its presence for making tools and violence. They turn into carnivores overnight, and when two tribes collide with each other near a water source, the tribe that has developed the ability to make tools, as well as obedience, intelligently destroys the neighboring tribe. The new leader of the victorious tribe, authorized by the first remnants of technology, triumphantly throws the bone, which he used as a weapon, into the air. We see the bone turning into a floating satellite containing nuclear weapons. Soon we learn that the world is broken by nuclear paranoia. Characteristics, inspired by the appearance of the monument, which once helped us survive, now threaten our very existence. <br /> <br /> Again, humanity is in crisis, once again the unearthly presence, represented by the black monolith, will come to the aid of humanity. in the next stage of its development. In the study of the moon found a monolith, identical to the one we saw earlier. The governments of the world, usually mortal enemies, gathered in secret to discuss the consequences. The mission is organized. the monument was engaged in some kind of radio communication with Jupiter. Several people will travel to the destination of the transfer. Most of them will be in a state of suspended animation most of the time. The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL - a supercomputer programmed to imitate all human qualities. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of great episodes in the film. As usual for Kubrick, the use of classical music is outstanding. The most memorable are the "Blue Danube" and "Zarathustra also says" (especially appropriate, given that the film goes beyond the ordinary consciousness). Cinematography is also particularly good, after 30 minutes of watching a movie will chase you to the end your life. <br /> <br /> The character of HAL is the most important from the point of view of the central thesis of the film. Imitating all the characteristics of a person, he comes to their negative features. The paranoia he develops, which almost leads to the collapse of the mission, is an exact reflection of the paranoia that allowed the political situation on earth to reach the point of a desperate crisis. The film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave in order to proceed to the next stage of our evolution. <br /> <br /> The architecture of the film also makes sense. Projects of many spacecraft are designed to offer reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motive of the film. The ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphal ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This film tells about a life similar to that represented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce’s novel Finnegan's Awakening. He sets a sample of the history and evolution of man, which is cyclical, but progressive, repeating the same events over long periods of time, but at the same time the human race develops in accordance with the will of the creature with a larger goal. Although we will never know what this goal is, the film convinces us that the human race is not meant for failure, its fate is great beyond its ability to imagine. I am still amazed by the fact that, despite this film, many people still consider Kubrick to be a misanthrope. <br /> <br /> This is a religious film, not in the generally accepted sense of adherence to any particular religion, but because of this is a call of a miracle in the vast panorama of existence and its participation in the most profound and vital issues of purpose and truth. <br /> <br /> In the hands of any other director, all this will, perhaps, be too much. The Hollywood view of life is too gloomy, as a rule, to capture the greatness and intensity of a vision like this. But Kubrick was a visionary, he directs with full confidence not only that he can handle materials of this kind, but also that he is the only one who does this. In the process of creating this film all his creative resources were used. Written partnership with Arthur Clarke is the most fruitful in the history of cinema. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the amazing climax of the film. At that time there were no resources for the realization of his plan, therefore he brought them to life. <br /> <br /> 2001 is an absolutely unique film. Those who miss it do so at the expense of their intellectual and creative abilities.
