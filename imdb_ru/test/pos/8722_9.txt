What an absolutely charming movie. The cast is wonderful, and the story is witty and funny. All around enjoyable movie experience. Although the plot is somewhat predictable, it does not make the story less pleasant, in fact I did not want it to end. I have always been a fan of Ingrid Bergman, and it was interesting to see her in a comedic role. She did not let me down; it was interesting to watch Ingrid Bergman’s performance as Miss Dickinson. I liked her communication with Tony at the record store, as well as her dancing and "Dentist". Only what I already knew proved that she is one of the greatest actresses of all time. Goldie Hawn is also a pleasure to watch. Her cheerful, kindhearted and sweet Tony is the driving force of the film. You don’t even wonder why she cares so much about his finish woman’s wife, you just admit that she’s just the type of person who wouldn’t be happy if he didn’t know that everyone else is too. And Walter Mattaw is great, like Julian. His actions never cause feelings of hostility towards the viewer, in fact they almost make him more resilient. There was no unattractive character in the group. This film has definitely stood the test of time, I only watched it last night and I think that this is one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. If you're looking for a fun, frivolous, romantic comedy, look no further.
