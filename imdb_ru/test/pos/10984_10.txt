I didn't know much about this movie - my roommate seemed to have dragged me into it. I was so pleasantly surprised! The plot really captured my attention and kept it, and the characters are well drawn and realistic. The script is very smart and funny, and the actors do beautiful things with it. And the best part is that he managed to have fun without obvious sex or violence! If this film appears in your area, you really should watch it - stand up for this little film, it's worth it!
