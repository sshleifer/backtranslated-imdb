I also saw it in the cinema in the 80s and never forgot about it, although I never saw it anywhere else. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if I’d see it now, it would seem outdated, but, recalling the storyline and comparing it with some of the terrible modern films I’ve seen in the Horror Zone, I’ll have to think very good. <br /> <br /> I still remember how his coffin slipped and opened, and all the dead bodies came to life, and the blue lightning. After seeing hundreds of horror films and still remembering this, it should be good.
