Without a doubt, Lucio Fulci’s most respected film “Don't Torment the Duckling” is widely known for its sharp plots, terrible images and a strong storyline. The terror falls on a small Italian village, when young boys begin to appear killed, absorbing confused and decisive authorities and a mystery devoted to the detective story. Was it a creepy hermit? Spastic voodoo witch? One of the prostitutes? Rich girl? Someone else? Contrary to the fact that most fans often think about the violent content of the film - I think this is much more plot; showing only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (involving chains and shields). This in no way detracts from the positive qualities that this film gives. Fulci proves that he is quite capable of depicting one hellish dark and disturbing hyallo with the killing of children, black magic and, of course, a good set of sensations ... Although I especially like "Lizard Fulci in the female Skin" and "New York Ripper" Duckling "dominates the giallo genre as the sullen and compelling mystery of murder!
