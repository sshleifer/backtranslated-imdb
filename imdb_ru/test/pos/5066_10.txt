It was a great movie with a good acting game, and it keeps your attention until the very end. Maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the subject, which is why it is so loud. It may also be too deep for many viewers who put films like the American Pie on a higher rating. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is a CIA analyst, not an agent who should monitor the Egyptian interrogation of Moroccans, not Egyptians. He should not be a seasoned agent and therefore is considered the naive of the interrogation methods used. This is more believable than if it seemed to him that this is an “old hat”. <br /> <br /> The story jumps a bit and can be confusing, but it also makes you focus on what is happening. until the end, until everything comes together, how the mystery will fall into place. Supporting actors helped carry the film. I found the film to be strong and thought provoking.
