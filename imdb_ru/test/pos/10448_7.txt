Ahhh ... 80s. The year 1982 makes me remember the really crazy time that we encountered in America. In the late 70s, “The Last American Virgin” is a “wolf in sheep's clothing”, like the latest “teenage sex comedy” from glory days. Oh, of course, there is sex, but I can't think of another movie - well, that and “Fast Times in Ridgemont High” - it really didn’t kill the time between teenage scenes topless - there were some pretty good things here among the splitting. <br /> <br /> The film tells about three hormonal friends. Gary (wanting to lose his virginity), Rick (incarnate herd) and David (overweight, but inexperienced), who are desperately trying to convince Gary to join the world of masculinity. But on the way to Kegger, a funny thing happens - Gary falls in love with Karen (a pretty brunette who loves the bad guys) and doesn't seem to be able to complete any sexual conquests that can ease David and Rick. The only problem is that Rick and Karen get hot and heavy, and Karen skips the period. This is Gary, who is next to her when she goes to have an abortion, and this is Gary, who really cares. But with whom Karen is dancing by the end of the film ... Rick. Subtract “R” and add “D” where necessary. <br /> <br /> What makes this film different from the others from the 80s that we think about is that, damn it, they are trying to create a real drama here, and not from “my parents just dragged on driveway. " And you know what? I bought it. <br /> <br /> It was not sloppy. It was not contrived. And when Gary sees Rick dancing with Karen at a party at the end of the movie, I really felt sorry for this guy. Our young Romeo really believed in unrequited love - and when his heart was broken at the end, it all somehow touched me. <br /> <br /> So, if you put all this aside, there is a fairly believable and exciting story. Here it is. Oscar worthy? Not a mile away, but I don’t know that I would also refer it to the “let's set” category. As in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, they actually tried to make a real movie here, allowing hi-jinx between the fall, where possible.
