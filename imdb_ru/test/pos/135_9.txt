Cinematography is a bright feature of the film. The park really knows its stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind the camera. Each shot is filled with bright colors that jump out of the screen. It seems that each frame of the film tells the story in itself. I hope this movie comes out in Blu-ray format, because it will look fantastic. It is quite intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology park used for their vision. Sung Hyun must drink blood to survive and look immaculate, has incredible strength and is vulnerable to sunlight. He has, however, no fangs, as well as a reflection in the mirror. <br /> <br /> Although I have never seen the movie, I could not help but feel that this is the version of Chan-wook Park Twilight. The entire middle section of the film is about San Heon and Tae Joo's love for each other It was like an "Twilight" for adults. There is a lot of blood, nudity, sex and even a few obscenities. Maybe it's a fan of Chen-Vuksky Park in me, but I sincerely feel that I can guarantee that this is the best movie of the two. The psychological aspect, which I like in previous films Park, is also in Thirst. For me, this is a major factor, as any film that makes me think, or is unusual in any way, becomes a favorite of fans. Movie Soundtracks Park always seems to fit his film like a glove. Thirst is no exception. Although this time the soundtrack is a bit more subtle, it fits into the overall atmosphere of the film quite easily. <br /> <br /> The middle section of the film seems to have lasted longer than anything else in the film. Although it is strange, since the scenes of that time are crucial for the plot line of the film, and it is difficult to imagine that Thirst is the same film if one of these scenes was shot. However, this is my most picky movie. <br /> <br /> Chang-wook Park with Thirst bites into vampire mythology and makes its own grim psychological twist. It seems that Park films always have a definite formula, or they include most of the following: great writing, beautiful cinema, a solid cast, some kind of psychological twist that will ruin your head, and a memorable ending. Thirst works on all fronts and, we hope, will get more attention, which he deserved during his theatrical performance on DVD (and, ultimately, Blu-ray, I hope).
