After seeing the full-length film filmed by Keslowski from this episode of “Decalogue” several years ago, we returned to this viewer when we watched as many as ten vignettes. As in other films, this film is based on the fifth commandment, or "Thou shalt not kill." <br /> <br /> Kryzsztof Kieslowski, writing with Kryzsztof Piesewicz, glanced at the mind of a young man who commits a heinous crime, killing an innocent man to express his own frustrations. This piece has the character of Dostoevsky, who constantly reminded us of “Crime and Punishment”, or at least some of the qualities of the novel are transmitted to aimless youth, who obviously do not have redemptive qualities. <br /> <br /> The story shows a young man who wanders through the streets of the city without a clear idea of ​​what to do or where to go. The only gentle moment that he shows is when he visits the photographer's place to ask for his old photo to be restored. Kislovsky leaves fate for the fact that the killer gets into a taxi with the intention of robbing the driver, but his anger and frustration make the youth kill a man who does not deserve death. The last moments of this criminal is one of the most exciting sequences in any film, past or present. <br /> <br /> Another element of the story is the relationship between the public accused and the criminal. Nothing can prevent a court from sentencing a young man to death. The lawyer at the end feels that he has failed his client and goes to the judge to find out where he was wrong. All he asks is to take a picture and send it to his mother. <br /> <br /> Keslowski’s presentation of how he interprets the fifth commandment makes an amazing film that will remain in the viewer's mind for a long time. after this episode forgotten.
