78 years ago ... the premiere of the film "Anna Christie", advertised under the slogan "Garbo says!" The film lasts 16 minutes, and the audience culminates in curiosity: Greta enters the bar and experiences the long-awaited transition from silence to sound: a few seconds completing her silent era, and finally Greta Garbo says the historical line: "Give me whiskey, ginger ale side and not get bored, baby! " <br /> <br /> “Anna Christie” (1930) is the film by Clarence Brown, which shows the great silent star Greta Garbo on the rollers. At present we can only imagine what a serious translation this was for actors and actresses. The career of many should have ended - something that we almost or completely do not see at the present time. And it is not by chance that Clarence Brown sent the first walkie-talkie with a Swedish beauty. Garbo trusted the director after two of his great dumb productions: "Flesh and the Devil" (1926) and "Woman for Business" (1928): films that have achieved great success at the box office, both with Garbo at the head. <br /> <br /> But we are in 2008, and the fact about the film, which is now purely historical in nature, seems insignificant. The question for today's viewer is not how Garbo’s voice sounds, but whether you can watch a movie after these 78 years. In other words, we all seek to answer the question of whether the film has stood the test of time. Is not it? <br /> <br /> When I recently watched it, I came to the conclusion that, with the exception of some minor technical aspects, including the static camera, “Anna Christie” is still very interesting. This is, on the one hand, a wonderful story of life, a reality that a young woman faces (based on the play by Eugene O "Neil), and on the other hand, an artistic manifestation of true magnificence in the field of leadership and action. Let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs . <br /> <br /> CONTENTS: Chris Christopherson (George F. Marion), an alcoholic, lives the life of a sailor on a barge. Although his days are full of sorrows, he is comforted by the letter of his daughter Anna (Garbo), whom he has not seen for 15 years She says she will come back to him. He starts everything. for the better, however, he forgets that his daughter is no longer a child who lacks experience, but a 23-year-old woman who survived various things on a farm in Minnesota where she lived and worked, and he also forgets that she has the right take another kind of masculine love in her life ... This summary of the content is not from the point of view of the main enchantment, but the one presented to us earlier than Anna (her father Chris) makes you realize how versatile it is. Just a single letter from the entire text, which seems life, has not been erased over all these years. The cases discussed here in 1930 are still significant and valid ... <br /> <br /> EFFICIENCY. There are not so many characters in the film, but there are two who really shine in the roles. This, of course, is Greta Garbo herself, who did something unusual in her 15-year-old phenomenon, a presence that strongly marked the history of early cinema (which I have already discussed in many of my previous comments on her films). But here Garbo is a little different. I admit that there are moments in this film when she does not feel comfortable in her role. This seems to be due to her new experience with sound in English; however, her performance is, as always, authentic and unique. But this is what everyone expected from Garbo. The real surprise of the film for the audience in 1930, as well as for us is Marie Dressler in the role of Marty. She is excellent in facial expression, in accent, in the whole image of a drinking woman who looks at life from the point of “hitting the bottle”. Her best moments include a conversation with Anna Cristi at the bar, preceded by her cheerful conversation with Chris. The rest of the cast is good, but not very good (here the German version compensates for this). In particular, Dressler, with the exception of Garbo herself, is an absolutely flawless choice. <br /> <br /> If you asked me what I liked about Anna Christie today, I would tell you: this is a classic film. However, there is one more thing that I must mention at the end. This is humor, a wonderful mind that is noticeable in everything. Although the content is rather serious and “Anna Christie” in no way bears the comic spirit (Garbo’s only comedy was NINOTCHKA), there are times when you split. Do not miss, for example, the visit of Anna and Matt to the amusement park, especially the restaurant where he orders milk, so that she thinks how good and innocent she is, the beer for himself and where Marty suddenly joins them ... <br /> “Anna Christie” is an ideal film for classical music lovers who should be seen by anyone who is even slightly interested in the true magnificence of the performance. If you are tired of many of these modern stars, look for such films, and you will be satisfied. Very worth your search! <br /> <br /> Skaal Greta Garbo! Skaal Marie Dressler! Let's drink toast for the excellent work you did in the film! Skaal after all these years, when the wine tastes better, and your mood with us is in a different sense ...
