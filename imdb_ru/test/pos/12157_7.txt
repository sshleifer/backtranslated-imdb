Like most people, I became interested in "More" exclusively because of the Pink Floyd soundtrack, which turned out to be the only Pink Floyd album that I still listen to after all these years. It was quite unexpected to stumble upon a movie at a local video store in a digital remounted version. Another big surprise was that it was a pretty good movie. <br /> <br /> Visually, he is quite handsome, especially when the two main characters jump on the rocks on the Spanish island of Ibiza. And the use of music for the soundtrack, which, as far as I can tell, exclusively from Pink Floyd, is excellent. I was pleased to watch the film with my copy of the album, mentally marking each track as it was used in the film. Brief by Dave Gilmore “The Spanish Play” was the only one that I hadn’t heard, and several tracks are used quite noticeably, especially “Cymbalin”, “Main theme” and “Mercury”. This last track is tedious on the soundtrack album, but works very well during the title sequence of the film, updating it at least once later. Maybe now I can appreciate it on the album, now that I have some visual effects that accompany this in my memory. <br /> <br /> The “More” plot is sometimes difficult to accept, especially at the beginning when the film seems to be just a means of demonstrating the fashion of those who are involved in its creation. But ultimately the film proves that it has much more to offer than the plot, as the plot becomes more focused. Why does Stephen take heroin? Why is NO one taking heroin, fully knowing the possible consequences? The film does not attempt to answer this question directly, but Stephen’s use of heroin seems to be a logical continuation of his purposeful pursuit of pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie to any Pink Floyd fan who has a rating of the highly underrated More soundtrack. I also recommend it to anyone interested in the counterculture of the sixties and how it is portrayed in the media. I have no idea how realistic this film is, because I am too young to survive the sixties firsthand, but it seems to reflect the spirit of the times like no other film.
