[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> Written by husband and wife Wally Volodarsky (who also directed) and Maya Forbes, this indie film is one of the best romantic comedies lately. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr is taking a break from playing smart petting to be a good guy, faced with the fact that his bride wants to sleep with other people, and he is also allowed to do this. Julianne Nicholson, who was so good at Tully, plays pompous and vulnerable with great pleasure. It is a pity that she does not receive the recognition she deserves. <br /> <br /> Good performances help very well. Lauren Graham, who made last year's Bad Santa unforgettable, brings a cynical, cynical sister to perfection to exhaustion, Brian Cranston (father on television "Malcolm in the middle") gets some funny, poppy moments, and Andy Richter plays a brilliant guy who falls in love as a single mother - Helen Slater in the credible, although familiar, role of a mousse woman. <br /> <br /> What surprised me the most in the “Vision of other people” is how ridiculous it is. There are some sincere laughter here. Ed's first attempt at meaningless sex has some distinct traits, and there is a menage that causes one of the most truthful reactions of a man when a man’s fantasy is tuned. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is not unusual. But I liked what Alice (Nicholson) thought about this, much to the chagrin of Ed (Mora). Given the genre, you know that, no matter how good her intentions, Alice’s plan is doomed. We see how the couple works through this strange situation. Alice and Ed were originally included with this idea, but then the human factor sets it up. <br /> <br /> I appreciated that Forbes and Volodarsky did not turn this into a cheap sexual prank. Yes, there is sex and undressing, but there are also real emotions here. Alice and Ed are friends with "other people" who do not want to be objects of casual sex; they also have feelings. In one case, too many feelings. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are too many jokes in some scenes, there is no need for the Richter-Slater storyline, and Alice does something really uncharacteristic. But this is forgivable, because Maura and Nicholson generate such tremendous closeness and honesty - look at the scenes where Ed is rummaging in Alice's underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement of the end of the experiment - that no matter how much we can enjoy them little game, we cheer for this couple to succeed. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film received little, if any, commercials and a limited release. Hollywood studios, whose romantic comedies often deviate from the ridiculous, rude and unsurprising, would succeed in learning from this clever and funny movie.
