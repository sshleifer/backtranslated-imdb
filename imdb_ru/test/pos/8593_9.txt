To answer the question of a previous reviewer, who asked the name of the American official mentioned in Lumumba, the character’s name is “Mr. Carlucci”. Frank Carlucci, reportedly at the time was the second secretary at the US embassy in Congo. Subsequently, in addition to other appointments, he was appointed US Ambassador to Portugal, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Secretary of Defense, and now is the chairman of the Carlyle Group. Not surprisingly, Carlucci’s biographical sketch on his website www.carlylegroup.com is not able to believe in his service in the Belgian Congo. If his name was deliberately censored from the HBO version of “Lumumba”, this was probably done in order to avoid HBO being prosecuted in US courts. The name of Carlucci, however, is clearly mentioned in the theatrical version of Lumumba, which I saw recently. In this case, I expect that he will deny any involvement in the murder of Lumumba. <br /> <br /> Others commented on the impartiality with which the film "Lumumba" refers to interested parties: supporters of Lumumba, other Congolese, even Belgians. A somewhat more sinister opinion arises, I think, from the BBC documentary entitled “Who Killed Lumumba?”, Based on the book “The Killing of Lumumba” by the Belgian historian Ludo de Witte. On closer examination, these films demonstrate that the fate of Lumumba and the history of the Congo are not only a matter of black and white. Only Lumumba's killers believe in this.
