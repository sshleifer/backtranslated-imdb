Painted in Pain is one of the best works of film I've ever seen. Here are my reviews of episodes released so far: <br /> <br /> The first episode was even better than I expected, and I expected quite a lot from everything I've heard about it. I am already very impressed with the actors. My father was creepy and played well. The little girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey such emotions. The animation was superb. The cinematography was amazing, each camera angle perfectly reflected the sensation of the scene. Editing was done very well, each scene smoothly proceeded to the next. The music caught the emotions pretty well and plunged you into the story. I just can't say enough about how wonderful this episode was. It definitely whets my appetite for more! <br /> <br /> Episode 2 was even better than the first! Everything I said about the first episode comes to an end, only you can see even more character development. I can't wait to finally see episode 3, or the rest of the series for that matter. What develops is an intriguing, character-driven storyline with all the attributes of a large Hollywood production, but no complaints. So many words, so few words. This series is similar to what you have never seen and could not become a real success. <br /> <br /> This episode was awesome! Other words do not describe it! BLIMEY! Everything I said about previous episodes is true for this, and yet it was even better! I do not know how you manage to take something amazing and make it even better! Further character development proves that this is a thing completely controlled by the character. Cinematography, as always, is excellent and attracts pain, fear, hate, and an emotional rollercoaster to Emily. I can't wait to see Episode 4 ... or the rest of the series for that matter. You really outdid yourself! <br /> <br /> No matter how much I like the other episodes, episode 4 is still the best. I love the character progression. I feel that we really will know Emily, her pain and her inner struggle. Other topics that I have outlined in past reviews continue. EXCELLENT cinematography, excellent writing, the actors perfectly cope with their images and made the characters their own, and the animation is just awesome! Another great job from the DbP team!
