Frankly, the promise of Martin Donovan to play Jesus was enough for me to watch the movie. Definitely worth it; smart and funny, don't overdo it. Shooting low quality was probably the appropriate effect, but in the end it turned out too sharp, and the final sounded more like a PBS program than a Hartley. However, there are too many memorable lines and wonderful moments for me to judge this strictly.
