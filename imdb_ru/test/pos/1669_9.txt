The recent re-release of the French crime film (original title “Du Rififi Chez les Hommes”), with its famous 20-minute sequence of silent gem robbery, is now coming out to the USA in a magnificent new print from The Criterion Collection with improved subtitles and some additions. Jules Dassin was an American (born Julius Dassin in Middletown, Connecticut) who was forced to make films in Europe because he was on the black list. Rififi was widely advertised in the USA and worked well in art houses. Later, Dassin became much more famous in the USA thanks to the film “Never on Sunday” (1960), in which the main role was played by his wife, Greek actress and political figure Melina Mercury. (Greece was once again fascinated and popularized for Americans and other people with Anthony Quinn in Michalis Kacogannis’s 1964 Greek Zorba film, which was even a great success in Cairo.) The new Rififi DVD includes a recent interview with Dassin. Previously, I did not realize that one of the main robbers, Cesar of Milan, was played by Dassin, who intervened when the original actor became unavailable. He is one of the most memorable characters, a graceful Italian safe cracker who does not speak French. <br /> <br /> Although this classic has all the trappings of a French film noir - the black and white twilight world of well-lit apartments, brilliant black cars, men in suits, scenes in a nightclub, including a dramatic title and an illuminated title song , performed in the club, stony faces and gauloises in the hands or in the mouth - I do not think it is so atmospheric or has as distinctive a style as Melville films. But there is a fascinating robbery, which is still preserved as a tour de force. It goes like clockwork, with a delicate sense of skill and teamwork among robbers. Some curious cops are effectively dealt with. The situation quickly goes wrong, after they return home and distribute loot, when one of the players becomes sloppy and gives the lady a ring with a bracelet of a million dollars. Has there ever been a film about a robbery whose criminals lived happily ever after? <br /> <br /> This wordless sequence of robberies guarantees this special place, and Dassin, the American director, who had an unusually diverse and exotic career, deserves full confidence for that. He took the novel so conditionally that he was going to reject it, and added some key elements that make it special. In this case, he could not continue the adaptation: he needed money too much. Jean Servais, who stars Tony Le Stefanua, was an actor, rather unfortunate on his luck. His dark face is perfect for this role. Later, he played a major role in the Dassin film Who Must Die (1957), in which French actors used political history in Greece. Topkapi is a somewhat disappointing 1964 caper film (compared to Rififi), which also became popular in the United States. He has a really good environment, but he is wasted, lost peacefully, vividly and pretentiously. From Dassin's post-Hollywood creativity “Never on Sunday” with his memorable dark song and charismatic heroine is a popular choice (and won the best film in Cannes in 1960); “The One Who Should Die” is a political choice; "Rifi" choice of genre. A strange piece - his "Fedra" with Mercury and Tony Perkins (1962). Tough guys purists from the Hollywood genre will abandon them and support Dassin’s early films, which include Brute Force (1947) prison drama, Naked City (1948); and two hard noirs, “Vorovskoe Highway” (1949) and “Night in the City” (1950). Personally, I like the French noir and American neo-noir by-products more than the original American noir material - hence my endless passion “Rififi”. But Dassin is quite unique in that he not only made a Hollywood noir, but then went to Paris and created an unforgettable example of the French derivative of the fifties.
