This is a large collection of interviews and excerpts from the films of the late sixties and early seventies, which were the opposite of the movement for the big film studios of the late sixties. Directed by Ted Demme, this is obviously a labor of love for films of that period, but he does not pay enough attention to masterpieces of time. <br /> <br /> Many of the directors of this period were influenced by Truffaut Antonioni, Fellini, Bergman and, of course, John Cassavetes. Unfortunately, documenting registration at 138 minutes is too short! The film is rich in interviews and views of filmmakers. Among those surveyed were Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdonovich, Ellen Burstyn and Roger Corman, Bruce Dern, Sydney Pollack, Dennis Hopper and John Voight. <br /> <br /> Bruce Dern has a moment of truth when he says that he and Jack Nicholson might not have looked as good as the other stars who were before them, but they were “interesting.” It summarizes other areas of this filmmaking period in American history. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers dealt with a lack of funding from Studios because they expressed unconventional attitudes towards politics, gender, drugs, sex and race issues, and North and South America participation in foreign conflicts such as the Vietnam War. . <br /> <br /> Francis Coppola said he had a chance to do a “Talk” because the producers knew that he was Roger Corman who taught him to make a film without anything, so they controlled his film. <br /> <br /> Another interview with John Voight, directed by Hal Ashby, in Coming Home, a clear anti-war film about a disabled soldier plunges into society after the battle. Voight talks about how his working methods helped him achieve emotional expressiveness when Ashby said that they were doing a “rehearsal” double, and eventually he became the duplicate used in the film - it was better because it was so unreserved and not exhausted by their freshness due to excessive rehearsal. <br /> <br /> There are also many excellent excerpts from the Al Pacino breakthrough film “Panic in Eagle Park” and an interview with Dennis Hopper about creating an Easy Rider and an interview with Sydney Pollack about filming. <br /> <br /> In general, a documentary is a great starting point for any movie lover who wants to see great examples of what the new voices in the film were like. in the seventies. Many of Sundance Folk, where this film has produced a lot of resonance, don’t know how much the Independent Cinematographer today owes to the films of John Cassavetes, Milos Forman, William Friedkin and Roger Corman. <br /> <br /> Rent it at your favorite store.
