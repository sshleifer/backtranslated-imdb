Taylor Hackford wanted to star in this film for 15 years and finally found Jamie Foxx in the lead role. Fox is amazing in his portrayal of Ray Charles. From the interview I saw with Fox, he met with Charles several times and they also played the piano together (in childhood, Fox had piano lessons and he played the piano in all of his scenes). I did not see Charles alive until his late years, so it was great to know how his career developed. I hope Fox will be nominated for Best Actor Oscar, as he certainly deserves it. The music is also incredible - it really demonstrates the breadth of Charlesâ€™s music, from country to blues and everything in between. The film also flawlessly tells about the life of Ray Charles, from the many women with whom he had a relationship, to his drug habit and the consequences of that.
