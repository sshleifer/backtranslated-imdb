... and usually I do not like surprises !! Watch this movie by chance at a motel in South Africa, the second week of a three-month motorcycle vacation in ZA. Besides the fact that I was well shot and acted, it helped me understand the problems of the countries. Just watched "Million Dollar Baby" and had to look for Hillary Swank, because the name sounded somewhat familiar, and her game was excellent. I did not understand that she was a solicitor in the "Red Dust". Well, now I donâ€™t worry that it will disappear, like many other supporters of Clint before ... Now they ask me to write ten whole lines of comments, which is rather ridiculous, since I wrote what I wanted to write. Well, that's all: I think that if you are from a western country, especially from Europe, observation will help you understand a little better why what is happening there! So hopefully fill out ten lines.
