When the Jurassic Park first appeared, it was revolutionary in filmmaking and special effects. For the first time, people froze, going to a movie about dinosaurs and making sure that they look at the real dinosaurs brought to life. Although some dinosaurs were almost perfect examples of what real creatures (T.Rex, brachiosaurus, triceratops, etc.) could look like, some were modified to fit the film (Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus), and the film was currently happening on a tropical an island where they were not in their natural habitat, Walking with dinosaurs shows us real animals in their true habitats all these millions of years ago. The amount of detail and scientific information used in this is large. Now we can see sights such as the grim Triassic desert, a whole herd of diplodocus, the birth of ikthiosaurs, a massive sea monster, the eyes of pterosaurs, dinosaurs thriving at the South Pole, the two horns of Torozavr castle, the roar of T.Rex on the camera and the impact of a comet that recorded their doom. These dinosaurs walk, run, feed, fight, breed, hunt and swim. But the series also shows other creatures with whom they shared the world, two episodes mainly devoted to two different types of animals, flying pterosaurs and sea reptiles that lived under the waves. The places and landscapes are impressive and look even more unique when CG Dino comes to the screen. As for CGI and animatronics, CGI dinosaur movements look completely and completely natural, coloring is bright and vibrant, and crew members have taken careful steps to ensure that CG animals interact with the environment in any way the real creature sprays water, cleaning the bushes by raising dust and casting shadows on the ground. Admittedly, CG is not perfect with a few brief instances where the animals look too computerized, but the rest of the time it looks breathtaking. The puppet in some cases leaves much to be desired, but it has its moments, especially the scene with Cynodonts in the first episode. Kenneth Branah's narration is very good, it also gives us vital pieces of information and drama at the same time. But, of course, itâ€™s a real pleasure to see a living dinosaur doing what they did all these years ago, as well as seeing some really cute moments with Cynodont puppies (mammal / reptile hybrid), Sauropodlets (Diplodocus baby) and T.Rex chickens (Yes, even T .Rex can be cute), and then reminds us that nature can be cruel and was even more then. All this complements the prehistoric masterpiece of nature, which allows you to see the real dinosaur and take a breath, all from the safety of your living room. If you love nature, dinosaurs, informative training, amazing visual effects or just for really good viewing and entertainment, then Walking With Dinosaurs is for you. Easy recommended.
