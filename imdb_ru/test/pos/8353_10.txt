I thought it was a wonderfully written movie. I love little Scamp and street Angel. This film is very easy to understand for small children, but also a good film for adults. I liked this film because it continues the original Lady and the Tramp, and this film is a classic. Lady and the Tramp 2 Scamp's Adventure was filled with new characters, memorable songs, brilliant animation and unforgettable classic characters. I really liked the movie since I saw it for the first time. I also liked how they showed the different personalities of each character. It also reveals flaws and good things to make new friends with whom you can hang out. My favorite song in the movie "Always Was There", because she showed how different characters share their views on how they feel. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who was a fan of the original Lady and the Vagabond.
