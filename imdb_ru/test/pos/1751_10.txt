Well, I can be biased because I grew up watching a VHS copy of this film, which is now ready for filming, and just spent the last couple of hours looking for a DVD copy as a press release for my father. The film is so harmless and innocuous that it is suitable for all ages .... much better than anything Disney has ever done in my opinion (and I worked at a Disney store !!!). The characters are pleasant, and the reward for the best scene is the connection between a wrecked wedding (especially the musical talents of Swat, the fly and the smacking mosquito) and the amazing nightclub scene. The musical numbers still make me hum 20 years after I first saw it. there is no other film that I could best recommend while babysitting, and virtually every child I know (thanks to my loving Hoppity parents) has seen this movie many times. He will always receive top marks for his incredible love story, a brilliant villain and all his originality.
