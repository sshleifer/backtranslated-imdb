The self-awakening of humanity is the theme "2001: A Space Odyssey," a process that unfolds in the space-time continuum. We "see" our original past and "deduce" the cosmic future. Thus, the powers of intuition become the doors of perception in our ongoing collective journey. <br /> <br /> From this transcendental point of view, the usual egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our mad conflicts and important dialogue are swallowed up by evolutionary changes and are not related to the cosmos that is beyond comprehension. This is a hard lesson for conceited and aggressive species. Not surprisingly, some of us are unhappy with the slowness and minimality of the film. For discerning viewers, reward is an inspiring feeling of wonder and awe. <br /> <br /> In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think that a smooth black monolith is a von Neumann test. May be. Without a doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for the extraterrestrial mind, the physical form of which never appears. "Mystery is more than an explanation." <br /> <br /> “2001 ...” is unique among films in content and volume. Cinematography is not from this world, special and visual effects are breathtaking, and classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word “masterpiece” to describe a movie. But “Stanley Kubrick” “2001: A Space Odyssey” is an art in the highest sense, like “Mona Lisa” by Leonardo da Vinci or “Starry Night” by Vincent Van Gogh.
