Sweeney Todd's story brings back memories of the works of classical writers, such as Charles Dickens, and more modern writers, such as Edward Goree. Like a musical, it naturally looks more like the musical Les Miserables. Both deal with the grim effects of poverty in the industrial revolution and the breakdown of organized society. But this musical differs from Les Mis in one very important aspect: Stephen Sondheim, songwriter who can adapt to any style. Of course, he had his successes and failures, but one thing in his show that you can always count on: they will be something unique. Who would have thought that someone would write a musical about a hairdresser who would cut people's throats and turn them into meat pies? Sondheim did, and he did it amazingly. The whole performance is set up in a factory to show the constantly present catastrophic consequences of the suffering of those at the bottom of society, and this perfectly meets the needs of the show. Podiums and railings move everywhere, offering streets, walkways and bridges. Techniques borrowed from Kabuki and No, with visual scenic hands and multiple changes. Then, to top it all off, imagine great Angela Lansbury as the awfully practical and humorous Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn with his operatic baritone voice as the murderous Todd, and you get a star music machine. The rest of the cast moves smoothly along the cliché of a love story perfectly, with the exception of Johanna and Pirelli, who sound too forced. If Joanna and Pirelli were from the Broadway show, it would be great. Hearn plays while he sings more than Len Cariou on the OBC album, and the accents here are not so violent. Despite all this, Sondheim’s assessment never ceases to emphasize the dark seriousness of the story. As I said, he can adapt to any style. In the Follies, he imitates the style of the “30s” of the 40s, in “Pacific Overtures” he conveys the subtle art of Asian music, “Into the Woods” knocks down 32-beat Disney songs, and “Assassins” - the history of American music Here, however, he does wonders, making his account distinctly English, from salon songs to opera duets and monologues, to waltzes of society, to the Gilbert / Sullivan patter. And, nevertheless, the show remains deadly serious, although it causes more laughter than any musical comedy. It still has a grim warning about the evils of revenge. This is where this film makes the mistake of filming the judge’s solo of which he blames himself for his crimes. Without this, the Judge is just an ordinary villain, and the meaning of this film is that there are no direct villains. Both Todd and the Judge find out too late about the horrors associated with taking responsibility for their actions, and Todd loses everything because of his obsession. This can be clearly seen from the chilling reprise of the grim, but shocking ballad of Sweeney Todd, ending the show with Todd and Lovett, rising from the grave to tell us that the end is the same: in a world full of Sweeney, revenge creates only revenge. “Visit the story of Sweeney Todd. He served the dark and vengeful God. Striving for revenge can lead to Hell, but everyone does it, and rarely, just like Sweeney, like Sweeney Todd, the demon-hairdresser from Fleet Street. ”
