I first saw this film in 1988, when he was on HBO, and I liked it !! It was so much fun, I saw it too many times to count. I love the brothers Storks and pathetic, ugly dog ​​Bosco! My favorite quotation from the film: “It's so ugly that you need to put it to sleep.” I also liked it when the younger sister slapped the girls on the back, and their faces remain so. I love John Cusack and Demi Moore in this film too. They were beautiful. This film brings back memories of my student days when I first saw it. I shot the movie countless times and watched it over and over. My college roommate and I just couldn't get enough of it. Who couldn't love this crazy movie ?! I want to buy a copy on DVD, does anyone know where I can get it?
