Every time I donâ€™t give 150% of my dream or my goal, I think of Mark Borchardt, the real theme of "American cinema." Mark's stubborn preservation in his first function film, made and shot so fascinating that you will laugh, shaking his head with sadness and cheering for him. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this honest documentary, because the film is about R. Crumba. Supporting the "cast" (real family and friends of Mark) - it's all great. Give this film a chance, and you will see an excellent film and a beautiful portrait of what the American dream is made of.
