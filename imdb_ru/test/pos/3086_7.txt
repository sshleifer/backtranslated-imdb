This is a funny movie, and I really like it. Carey Elvis plays Robin Hood in a t-shirt. This, of course, is the usual good against evil with Robin against the evil sheriff of Nottingham. Humor is something like your face, but it still works well. Comedy at night, when you do not want to think a lot, it is worth rolling!
