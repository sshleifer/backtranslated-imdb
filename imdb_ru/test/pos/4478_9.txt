My opinion does not coincide with the majority in most cases. I tend to lean towards frilly, imaginative and other. This film was reminiscent of “Black Stallion” by Francis Ford, in which a fantastic situation is created, demonstrating the beauty of a magnificent creature that is not available for viewing at the peak, except on these sets of documentaries, of course. Unlike these nature films, this proposal uses the best filmmaking techniques that the industry can offer to create for diva one of the most sensual superstars (cat) on the screen. <br /> <br /> This fantasy depicting the love relationship that develops between the French soldier (he is also very good) lost in the Egyptian desert and the female leopard he encounters when he accidentally encounters an abandoned Egyptian temple are fascinating. I bought it from my heart. If you are the least open fantasy and appreciate the feline grace, beauty, strength and sensuality, you should like it. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in my book was the final. It was the perfect script for the final of Romeo and Juliet, which would surpass me. <br /> <br />
