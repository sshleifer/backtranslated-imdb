So real and surreal, all in one. I remember how Tessa felt. Hell, I remember that was Tessa. It was a beautiful vignette ending the relationship. I especially liked the tangent of the protesters. It's nice to see the symbolism in the film, without hitting it on the head. If you have a chance to see it, take it. It costs 30 minutes.
