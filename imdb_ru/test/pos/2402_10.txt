The internet is an amazing thing, isn't it? I watch a taped episode of one of my favorite documentaries “Vietnam: War for Ten Thousand Days” from my DVR in Florida, USA to my laptop in Kuwait; I’m writing a review about this series and just read another review from a person who really lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I would just like to say that for Min Nguyen to make a statement that America brought the war to Vietnam is one-sided. I know that America was a major player in the west, but two sides are needed to wage war. The Soviets and the Chinese were major suppliers of weapons to the North, so why Nguyen does not mention them as partly to blame, this demonstrates ignorance (well, I think we all know why he doesn’t mention them, or ignorance because he was raised) the communist system and its political dogma, or because it is afraid to tell the truth for fear of being arrested.). In addition, Mr. Nguyen, I believe that the parts that the North is the main aggressor of the whole war have not been shown in your country, so blaming America once again proves ignorance. Despite this, it is interesting to read a review from Vietnam (of course, this could also be invented, but I will consider it real), at least the communist east is somewhat open. As for the mini-series; why i love it It does not focus on American participation exclusively. It was a war that began 15 years before America intervened, and the series covers all aspects of history, so this is a real plus. The frames used are first-class, all the programs of the Vietnam War that you have just done will use the same frames so that you don’t miss anything by watching this older series. The date this series was made is another plus. He has interviews with all the major players that you cannot do now, because they are dead from old age, this is the main historical reference. Thirdly, Richard Bayshart adds a very peculiar narrative voice, his voice sounds as distinctly as that of James Earl Jones, and I think this is very cool praise. I don’t think you could find the best military documentary ever made, it’s like taking a relatively modern technology from 1980 and moving it to 1950 and interviewing all generals and politicians on both sides of World War II, This is done for the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> OK, I see some bias, its subtle, subtle 1970s-80s style bias like NPR "Everything counts" when it all seems so straightforward, but when you blink, you finish shaking your head. In this illustrative case, later episodes do not shed much light on the role of the media and propaganda in general, all useful tools that influence the outcome of the war, DO NOT THINK ????? <br /> <br /> 30 years later, the same happened to the OMF veteran.
