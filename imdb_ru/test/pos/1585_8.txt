After the death of all senior officers, the commander of the Laundry and Moral Corps Craig-Scott is appointed commander of an intergalactic spacecraft belonging to Starcups Corporation. Its main mission is to look for habitable planets and, of course, long-term coffee markets. <br /> <br /> Craig-Scott and his second commander, Chief Blazer, are poorly prepared for command, unless they are fully capable of keeping the crewâ€™s underwear clean, which does not diminish the importance of clean things, especially when incompetent commanders force these very things to be polluted regularly. <br /> <br /> Episodes are presented as a series of short 2-3 minute messages from the Commander to Earth. Humor is a mixture of irony and incredible physical comedy. Think yes, the minister meets the Red Gnome, but with a limited budget. All the usual science fiction storyline techniques here are aliens, nuclear weapons, computer crashes - but each one is enhanced by the fresh lemon scent of high-quality laundry detergent. <br /> <br /> Commander Magazine is definitely low-budget, but somewhat stupid effects and props fit the absurd premise of the show. Remember those funny hockey helmets that they wore on the old Battlestar Galactica? Is the trademark "Jofa" still visible? Okay, Commander Magazine has a lot of things, but it's cute. <br /> <br /> Commander Magazine is not high-tech, but this is not what it is trying to be. This is just a little fun. It does a good job to be this.
