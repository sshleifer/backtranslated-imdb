History to a single China should be popular. The hero of Jet Li made the killing of the king popular. <br /> <br /> This is another story made several years earlier. It depicts the incredibly beautiful Lee Gon (“The Geisha Memories”, 2046, vice miami) as the king's lover, who was sent to hire a killer so that the king could defeat him. She recruits Fanji Zhang, but falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> No matter, he still cannot complete the mission, as the king knew about him in advance. I suspected that he also knew, but he went anyway. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful story with major military operations and, of course, another chance to see Lee Gong.
