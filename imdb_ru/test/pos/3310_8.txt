It is interesting to see how this film depicts the society of the late 1950s. Men are depraved, chained drinkers with one thought (time didnâ€™t change men much, but "sexual harassment" changed), and women are in the workplace only until they find a husband and calm down. Some dialogues are worthy of any lust, but still they are charming in an innocent, passive way. I like the opening credits that show a romantic, breathtaking view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing "The Best Of Everything" on the soundtrack. I want to jump right into some of the scenes filmed on the streets of New York, around 1959, and experience the time I've only seen in movies and in photos. Some scenes in this film reminded me of "Working Girl" by Melanie Griffith. Especially when Hope Lange (something between Grace Kelly and Dolores Hart) is bombed in the apartment of handsome Stephen Boyd, he refills her and just watches her sleep (like Melanie, she wants to know if something happened between them day ). Joan Crawford is definitely comparable to the terrible female boss Sigourney Weaver, except for the fact that she was outwardly nasty (with a soft core), but Sigourney's character was pleasant outside and terrible inside. I was upset that the character Suzy Parker (Gregg) began as an independent woman with career goals to become an actress who, presumably, does not need a man to finish her, in the end. She becomes a stalker / crazy when he allows the man she loves to drive her bananas after he is finished with her. I liked the character Mary Agnes, office gossip with her thick New York accent. If you like movies like Doll Valley, then you will also like this movie.
