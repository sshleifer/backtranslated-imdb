Frank Sinatra took over this role, chewed it along with the rest of the scenery and - spat out YOUR way. TMWTGA stage, the final banal, some scenes need a little more cut, but that's all. This is great entertainment from start to finish, and while you watch it, you realize that Sinatra, this long-dead MOR bully, had drug addicts, gangster card games and all the city fuss in the US - he did not recognize this from the current coach. There are all kinds of directorial touches to make you happy, and (no date) the soundtrack prepares completely. Marathon card game beat Gudfellu, Soprano, etc. For forty years! So it was not the right book? What movie? And I cannot imagine being remembered about him if Brando let him go; cold turkey scenes would be embarrassing, not harsh, convincing and moving with Sinatra. No one else has mentioned malicious, lazy, cynical policemen - absolutely for sure! And Eleanor Parker would lead me to me.
