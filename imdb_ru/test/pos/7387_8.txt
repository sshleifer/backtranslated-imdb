If the finale were not so fantastically unexpected, I don’t think I could rate this movie so well. <br /> <br /> In this film, there are many uncomfortable, heartbreaking, “crumbling marriages” character interactions. Such things are not my drama, so the pace seems to be dragging me down. <br /> <br /> In addition, it’s difficult to communicate with the main characters, and therefore they care a lot about her husband (Alan) Rickman, who is rather bitter and capricious, and his wife (Polly Walker) is alienated and a bit arrogant. The acting was just great (Norman Reedus was very tempting), but the characters themselves were probably a little TOO realistic defaced (for me). <br /> <br /> The setting was pleasant, suitable insulation and a bit creepy. In the cinema there was something that seemed a little old-fashioned to me. <br /> <br /> But the last 5-15 minutes of this film are so brilliant that every awkward scene, awkward conversation and inexplicable behavior of the character is absolutely worth it. I guessed every typical plot twist, except for what happened. <br /> <br /> The ending is definitely worth watching this movie. Intrigue and drama is not so much.
