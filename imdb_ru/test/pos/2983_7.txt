I was in my teens when I saw this film, and I was struck by the beauty of young stars, as well as the loving cinematography and simple sweetness of the story. I am surprised to learn that Alvina recently died, that Bury, apparently, has not worked in the movie business for almost 30 years, and that they both will be over fifty. <br /> <br /> Elton John’s soundtrack is amazingly beautiful and maintains the atmosphere of protected innocence that the characters experience in solitude. I saw a movie poster with the words “Deux Enfants Quis'Aiment”, which apparently means something like “Two children who love each other” - it was reasonable for the distributors of English to shorten the title! <br /> <br /> Paul, ignored by the 15-year-old son of an English businessman living in Paris, meets Michel, an orphan, at the zoo. They will take what they intend to do, like a one-day vacation to the rural dacha of the late father Michel, but will remain there for a year, being isolated from the outside world. They fall in love, Michel becomes pregnant, and they have one child at home. After the baby is born, the police come to work to Paul and pick him up. <br /> <br /> Blue Lagoon comes to mind as another film that almost reflects the theme of innocence, protected in an isolated paradise. So sad that Friends has never been released on DVD.
