This story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle way, which distinguishes it from most films with this plot. Mr. Lam (Jackie Chung) has a relationship with Choi (Karen Lam, who was also so good at Coma) that at first glance it seems inexplicable. He has been married for 20 years with Ching (the great Anita Mui, in her last role before being brutally robbed of us), and this seems to be a love relationship. When Ching offers to take care of her and Mr. Lamâ€™s former teacher, Choi and Mr. Lam have the opportunity to be together. What makes a movie so good is the pace of director Ann Hui. It takes time to unlock the secrets of Lamsma, and it all makes sense. The film is very dramatic and touching. You are not disgusted with the teacher / student situation, which raises this film over many with the same plot. It's a slow motion, but stay with it. Also, enjoy Ms. Mui's beautiful, not charming, but beautiful presentation. She was and still is someone really special, and in this film you fall in love with her for the last time. It is worth the time to witness and just be with her.
