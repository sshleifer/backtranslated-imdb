I really like this particular production of "Mikado". Producers have added a few touches everywhere to make it more fun for the modern audience - for example, “As Some Day It May Happen” (the song “small list”) is completely updated, and a few lines throughout the ad play. Freedom was also taken with the setting. The costumes are not Japanese, but English ones of the 1920s (although some of the Tittipudlian girls wear 20s kimonos). This production is well-staged with some dance styles from the 1920s, and there are some additional dance maids and messengers to entertain your eyes (as well as your ears) during songs. If you're the purist of Gilbert and Sullivan, these changes may bother you, but I think they are fine - and I like the costumes! <br /> <br /> Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely funny; all her scenes make me laugh out loud (one of my favorite add-ons is when she first comes out - dancing messengers annoy her with their antics, so she screams in a loud voice: "STOP IT !!!"). All other main characters also do an excellent job. I especially like Mark Richardson as Pisch-Touche (this wig!) And Leslie Garrett as Yum-Yum. <br /> <br /> You should keep in mind that this is a production film that is being shot and set your own expectations accordingly. There are no changes in the setting, although the creators of the film Ma used some of the film techniques of the 1930s to add interest. If this production has one drawback, it’s that stage makeup wasn’t modified to take close-up shots with the camera. The tonal lines are often visible, and it seems there is a surplus of eyeliner, lipstick and rouge. I’ve seen such things before with films about plays, and at first it’s a bit annoying. However, I hope you get used to it and enjoy “Mikado” for what it costs - a completely enjoyable performance of cla shiki!
