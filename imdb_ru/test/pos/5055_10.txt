"Labyrinth of Passion" - with the possible exception of "Matador" is the best film of Almodovar. He shows his unique personality in the best and least censored before he became more massive. Almodovar is the only modern director to come close to the beautiful brand of madness of Preston Sturges. It is useless to try to explain what the film is about, the real point of view is Almodovarâ€™s readiness and ability to take his situations beyond the limits of reasonable, and sometimes likelihood and taste.
