“Oh brother, where are you?” Is a joyful retelling of Homer's Odyssey, created in the Mississippi in the 1930s and the rampant, bizarre quirkiness that is the Cohen brothers trademark. In this delightful film, three unlucky criminals escape to find the treasure - and not only their share of adventures. George Clooney in a beautiful, inventive way, like the talkative, friendly leader of the trio; but true praise goes to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as his stupid but attractive cohorts, whom Clooney's character called “boring lower boys” after they were baptized by full immersion in the river. Three broke the record under this homespun denomination for cash, and unwittingly became sensations with real status of a "rock star". The film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical. And here there are some incredible exploits of filmmaking: the scene at a rally in the KKK looks very sad and is so similar to the scene when Dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in The Wizard of Oz, which is almost equal to cinematic plagiarism. And what an amazing job of plagiarism! Without giving up the ending, I have to say that the climax of the film is one of the most exciting scenes filmed lately (along with the exciting finale of Magnolia, another one of my favorites). "Oh, brother" - this is a must-see, perfect ten!
