Wow, I love this movie. This is definitely added to my list of ghetto films. <br /> <br /> Juice - starring Tupac “I do not live, F ***” Threat Society II - O-Daug, I will smoke anyone, I just Do not let F **** 'New Jersey Drive - Hey, they steal cars in broad daylight, they obviously don’t give up F *** <br /> <br /> New Jersey Drive is the best hood movie ever. He is at the top of the list, Threat II is the second, and the juice is the third, Clockers is really stupid. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack for the film “New Jersey Drive” is also Pwnage Mac Mall & Young Lay - everything about My Fetty is heard in the film. <br /> <br /> The masters of the underground - Burn Rubber, another good song, like Ill & Al Scratch, - don't close the player <br /> If you are a fan of GTA-SA, you will love the hell with this movie and awesome soundtrack. Soundtrack is basically a car theft rap ^ _ ^ SWEETTTT Movie!
