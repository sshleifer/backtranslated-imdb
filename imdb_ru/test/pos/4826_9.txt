I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Apart from the fact that the mother was a complete idiot several times, and the youngest daughter was so idiotic that she went out at night in the woods that frightened her during the day, this film was pretty good.

It worked for the plumber and the guy in the trailer, but apparently the teenagers and the mother had to be idiots for the director to finish this film. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere was gorgeous, the scenery was awesome and the undead kids scared me to shit ... I live in a wooded area, so taking out the trash has been pushing me for quite a while. The film works for me, accept what I have already mentioned. Raise mom's IQ a bit, and I would give ten ...
