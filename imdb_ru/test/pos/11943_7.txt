This is a good little film about the life of a guy (Peter Coyote) who lives an ideal life in a suburban middle class, when late at night the police suddenly broke into his house and arrested him for killing a guy 27 years ago. <br /> <br /> In his prison cell, Coyote tells his wife about the fateful events 27 years ago and how he came into contact with Wayne Kennedy, the man he allegedly killed. <br /> <br /> This tells the story in retrospect, and the more you learn about Wayne and Coyote, how they met, and what happened when they did, the more you will be interested. <br /> <br /> The acting is nothing to fuss, although the guy who plays Wayne Kennedy is pretty creepy. The real strength of the film is the mystery of what actually happened on the mountain. The wife spends the film trying to find the clue to the mystery, and every time something new appears, we recall a memory that reveals a riddle. This is actually very good. <br /> <br /> So, as is the case with Lifetime TV, this little movie is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Enjoy your viewing!
