Finally!! Sandra Bullock is a really beautiful woman, but I finally found a movie in which she will play an actress! Forget about the predictable KEANU forage speed, forget about the predictable Kleenex forage, WHEN YOU SALT - it checks it! <br /> <br /> And she's great! Techno-feminist role, which really works well on the screen, on an object that is very close to the bone. Raised problems do not seem far-fetched at all, and the whole experience, accompanied by an excellent cast, makes a rather nervous couple of hours. <br /> <br /> You can never enter another chat. Iâ€™m getting nervous again, just writing this review ... uh ... bye!
