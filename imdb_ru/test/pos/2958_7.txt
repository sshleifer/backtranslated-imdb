This second full-length game “The Lone Ranger” does not match the classics of 1956, but it is an excellent film with a rather rough and tumble and moves with a good clip. The ranger studies a series of mysterious murders that are ominous for them when peaceful Indians become victims of a gang of hooded killers. There are more murders and violence usually associated with the adventures of the Lone Ranger, and the film has hidden racial insensitivity, the comments of which are scattered throughout the script. The Ranger uses disguise, since only he can gather evidence and expose the criminal group and bring them to justice. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels are shot in a colorful presentation that shows the desert and country of old Tucson cacti with a good advantage. The music is good, but the familiar theme of the William Tell Overture is repelled by interesting vocals that lack the heyday and beauty of the traditional Ranger theme.
