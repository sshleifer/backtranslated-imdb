This is a great movie and I would like them to release it on DVD so that people can buy it. It's hard all the time to catch him on TV. Since you do not know when one of the stations will decide on this. Can someone tell me which file company does this so that I can write to them and see if they release it to the public? I caught only the last hour and a half yesterday, and I only saw him once last year. My sisters and I are looking for it in every store selling any videos. John Denver is a great singer and actor, and the storyline is gorgeous. They released some older films, and I think it’s great, but there are a lot of them that they haven’t released, and I think if we could contact the producers and voice our requests, we could release some of them on DVD .
