This series when the dinosaur lived 65 million years ago. The dinosaur looks very real and very realistic when it moves. It is also very interesting how the climate is changing. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting to me how dinosaurs lived and died. I am also interested to know how dinosaurs behaved. <br /> <br /> The color of dinosaurs is also interesting to see and discover. They think what color they had. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing is why dinosaurs died and what happened after that. <br /> <br /> BBC made a brilliant series on how dinosaurs lived and died!
