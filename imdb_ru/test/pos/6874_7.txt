Almost a wonderful mixture of comedy, romance and medical chaos makes a rocking single doctor of 50 years old, tired of going to rock concerts with nubilous heads, to meet with a patient of his age, whom he met during his tours. The script of Julius Epstein demonstrates an abundance of sophistication, although he does not have enough material to fill the last third of the picture, and you can almost feel how the film escapes. The subplot that the hospital is under investigation for its crappy business relationships has not been resolved satisfactorily, and in any case it looks very contrived. Nevertheless, Walter Mattau and Glenda Jackson are an amazing team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney are very funny in support. Directed by Howard Ziff keeps it all pop-up, and even when Epsteinâ€™s single-row lines feel like Neil Simon rejects, Ziff moves happily forward. The results are attractive and sometimes quite sweet. Following an unsuccessful show. *** from ****
