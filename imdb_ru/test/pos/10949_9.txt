I'm not sure which version of the movie I saw, but it was very interesting. <br /> <br /> I didn’t know who Gemini was (Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi) before watching this film, and I think the English translation of the title is somewhat misleading. <br /> <br /> Martial arts are very well done. I especially liked them because there were a lot of judo / bouts that were shot very well. Donnie Yen (see Him in “Hero”, great performance) is great as a director because he knows how to shoot these scenes. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that everything was going smoothly, except for one scene in which girls participate. the roof fights with bamboo poles. It really has nothing to do with the plot, but still interesting. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the best (modern) HK fighters I've ever seen. Despite the fact that he is in some sense cheesy, he still copes. <br /> <br /> Definitely 9/10
