I grabbed my attention to Netflix Instant Play because it lasted only an hour and a half (around 4 o'clock in the morning), and because it is Norwegian, which I wanted to develop with Dead Snow and see what else the country offers in international cinema right now. This funny and funny humorous film tells about a man, Andreas, who is sent to the Purgatory of the City of the Brave New World, where everyone is happy, but the food and taste are tasteless, nothing smells, and even sex loses its appeal, driven by an extreme lack of common sense, he feels almost ready to kill himself. <br /> <br /> After a fun, unsuccessful attempt by the latter, Andreas hunts down a person with similar complaints, and both discover a tiny, vaginal-shaped hole in the concrete wall from which the music emanates. The two are trying to break through to see what is on the other side, tracking a tiny piece of light that they can barely see. But, of course, in a fantastic country of allegory, desire and discrepancy are not allowed, and elements of the city act to put an end to Andreas' attempts for freedom and sensuality. <br /> <br /> Jens Lien and the team create a simple, straightforward movement towards a story that blends well with its themes and moves with enough speed to keep up. The similarities in other similar science fiction are not worth listing, but the film is still unique and balances some very funny scenes with some rather terrifying ones. I like the limited but effective use of blood in this film, some kind of shock and flagellum that will cause your heart to stutter more than the Passion of the Christ, simply because it is completely inappropriate because of the gray tones of the stage play. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a reliable actor who physically feels out of place in his environment, which works very well. Despite the fact that the concept itself is not something special, everyone involved makes it work, and the film is fully aware of its own world. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
