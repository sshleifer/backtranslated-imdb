A truly unique and terrific July Verne film “For The Flag” by Czech chief director Karel Zeman. Although the plot unfolds in a rather restrained late Victorian style, visual effects are knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted scenery, animation of models in combination with live action to create the atmosphere of Verna, which the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore, Bennett and Riu, which illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of added Georges Melis. The picture, made in beautiful black and white color, demonstrates the highest order, not Saturday morning. There are underwater sequences where the fish swimming around are drawn so precisely that they can be used in the field guide. There are images of ships, submarines, aircraft, locks and mechanisms that are drawn so accurately that you need to freeze the frame on his VCR or DVD to pause the scene and explore the wonderful details that went into this performance. The late Victorian atmosphere is designed to look like this world, which has never been, and to delight us with the magic of science, which made Verna the great father of the Genre. If this is not enough, there is also a film that is probably one of the best films ever created for a science fiction or science fiction film. Truly forgotten classics, this one is worth finding and buying. Always one of my favorite movies of all time, it will definitely be one of yours. And remember - this was done decades before computer graphics or computer animation. Kudos to great artists who obviously put their heart into it. It shows. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this film. A film that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it love him and value them. This is an outstanding achievement, this wonderful film is getting better every time. This cinematic work of art from a visionary director.
