Riefifi, directed by Jules Dassin, is consistent with Melville’s crime scenes (Bob le Flemer in particular and Le Cirque Rouge in a sense): he is fully focused on history and character and makes sure that not a word is said which is not needed and was ahead of its time. Ionically, he still has a kind of professionalism among his characters, a kind of respect (if not for himself than for others, a kind of duty) that sounds good in France after World War II. His actors carry the faces of these characters, who say "we know what these guys are about," and from there the story takes off. Maybe this is because I have a weak point for photos of the robbery, especially when we see only nuts and bolts (erroneously, the actual physical side) of how the robbery occurs. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with how the actual robbery is filmed in today's films is that it’s all very fast (like Snatch), or done in ways that we have seen too many times before. Dassin, like Melville a few years later, decided to create a practically silent film about robbery, including sound effects. The tension that accumulates in this scene may not exceed what Melville had in Rouge, but at his own level he achieves his own greatness and impulse, and just as important originality for what was done before. For example, there are several close-ups when a safe is cracked, and this is the best I've ever seen in France at the time. An additional advantage to the film, in addition to the new wave related to the film, which makes it a bit more modern, is that the story works so well and differently. It becomes completely about character in points, and then maintains the thrill. The last ten to fifteen minutes are wonderful below; as in the case of another classic picture of robbery “Asphalt jungle”, not even the last stop is important, but how much a person will overcome the call of duty, putting humanism over greed. <br /> <br /> You are almost surprised at the whole delight of the camera flying through the trees at high speed with the car so that he can just do it. Dassin has a very interesting and intuitive film of his genre, as well as a great musical number.
