This is the best job I've ever seen on television. The story is convincing - especially since it is true. Writers have done their homework - the accuracy of the events is well documented. The game is great. It should be the best role Sam Waterston ever had. And black and white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it is not available for purchase. A few years ago I contacted someone related to production (either with PBS or in England), and I was told that they had no plans to release it on VHS (at that time). It was produced by the BBC and took place in the United States at the American Playhouse. There is such an interest in this — it’s just hard to believe that no one can make it available.
