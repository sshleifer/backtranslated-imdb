For a long time I was not a fan of Madonna, but I thought that I would comment on this film. <br /> <br /> This film is wrong. One of them, like Madonna, was criticized by critics. They made a big mistake, and many potential viewers were rejected by bad reviews. <br /> <br /> First of all, Madonna does an excellent job with the work in this film, which was one of her first. She plays a little blonde in a movie, she is far from being a little blonde in real life. Most critics were somewhat biased due to her singing glory and did not give her an equal. When you watch this movie, I hope that you understand that accent and stupidity are just a game. She was absolutely hysterical, like the movie. <br /> <br /> Griffen Dunn is another person who was not given an objective review in the film. If you look at his filmography, you will see that he is quite an experienced actor. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, it looks like a pretty woman, but appeared 3 years before Roberts, Hera, good luck. This is a funny comedy with a lot of plugs, a farce and a single liner. Some of the comedies are ruthless and need comedy fans to truly appreciate more subtle humor. <br /> <br /> I know that says little about a film, but I hope that it will help dispel any belief that this is a bad film. Absolutely worth renting for a pleasant night of great fun. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Gary
