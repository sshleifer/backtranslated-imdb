Wow, I liked this movie, this movie was filled with plot twists, a good game, a great story and an unexpected ending. Honestly, this film was not too bloody, although it contained some blood, but was rather psychological. I read it on the Internet: the film cost 3000 dollars and was shot in 8 days. Amazing !!! This is for those who want to think and love to make great films. What begins as a terrifying thriller gradually turns into something more perverted, even more sinister. Not much I can say without giving plot points only that this film exceeded my expectations
