I bought it some time ago, during a large-scale martial arts film. Although this, of course, is not the best, I really like this kind of filming, and there were a lot of interesting things about it. Leung Kar Yang is one of my favorite martial arts stars, I always appreciate the fact that although he lacked formal training in martial arts, he usually gave more than combat-ready martial skills. He also has a good beard. In this film, he plays a good heroic role, and although he didn’t kick as much as he did in some of his other films, he still feels good. Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat’s early performances are also clearly visible, especially since Chow Yun Fat fights bad guys without his trademark weapons. He may not be a great fighter, but he does well. Eddie Co, as always, a great bad guy, he performs the same villainy as in many of his other films, and does it superbly, as usual. The guy who plays Boo is also good, I don’t remember his name, but he is also in The Magnificent Butcher. Although the fights are not as good as in other films of that era, the Postman resists, compensating for this with great imagination, high-quality cinema and a pleasant unusual atmosphere. There are some very good scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mix of Hong Kong talents that have all come together to get a decent effect. In general, I would recommend this to Kung Fu and militant fans in Hong Kong. It may not be a stylized classic, such as the Shaw Brothers films, or a crowd like Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but this is incredible entertainment.
