Growing up in GWTW, I still avoided the Scarlett sequels book and mini-series. When I first watched the video, I was amazed at how I enjoyed watching Timothy Dalton portray Rhett Butler and Joan Wally-Kilmer as Scarlet. I feel that “Scarlet” should be appreciated, and not try to compare it with the respected work of Selznick GWTW. While the Scarlet storyline and some dialogues suffered from a lack of inspiring writing, I generally thought it was worth what could be between Scarlett and Rett.
