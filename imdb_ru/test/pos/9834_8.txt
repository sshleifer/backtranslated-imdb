True, there are some nonsense for someone who wants to find them. They are not important though. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this film is to observe how experienced veteran actors do their work. Christine Scott Thomas is beautiful and well plays the role of a strong woman, but injured. The same goes for Harrison Ford, who for women is just as handsome as Christine, beautiful for us guys. <br /> <br /> Their injury at the hands of their spouses reduces them embarrassingly, but one in which they find support in each other. The way they evoke their offensive feelings and their humanity on the screen is why they are such in-demand performers. The viewer can not feel what he feels, and can not help but wish to encourage them when they are together. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are a few action scenes involving angry, corrupt police, but they only spice it up. a bit, and are not an important part of the film. <br /> <br /> For music lover, Dave Grusen offers a superb jazz-based background featuring trumpeter Terrence Blanchard. Like the actors, Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought-after music consultants in the movie business. Blanchard shows why he is one of the main trumpeters on stage. <br /> <br /> Not a movie for lovers of courage, blood and blood. But for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside, watch the beautiful English actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act like Harrison Ford under the endless soothing accompaniment of Dave Grusen and Terrence Blanchard with the one you love. It is desirable in bed. <br /> <br /> I thought it deserved at least 8.
