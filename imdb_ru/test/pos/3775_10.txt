I first watched this film in the early 80s, and we had it on beta max. As we all know, betamax followed the path of the tape with 8 tracks, sigh, it really had a good image quality. In any case, I am glad that I found this film again, I have been looking for it for more than 10 years! This film falls into the category of films such as “Airplane”: continuous jokes, single liners, funny actions (bodylanguage). Mark Blankfield is absolutely funny. His transformation from the shy Dr. Daniel Jekyll into a madly in love with an animal party, Mr. Hyde, is unforgettable, complete with gold teeth, a bib and gold chains. The part that I loved the most was when he stole a car from this poor guy and then drove to Madame Wu Wu. Absolutely psychedelic drug-free experience! If you need laughter therapy, this is the movie to do it. When I first saw this, I had tears in my eyes, and my stomach ached from constant laughter. This is a movie that I could watch again and again. I highly recommend it.
