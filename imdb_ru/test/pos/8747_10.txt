I was disappointed with the recent (2000) American remake of this English mini-series. Although he closely followed the storyline, he seemed to ignore the soul and the original. Not to mention the addition of a fine sermon with tough "messages" ... Therefore, I advise you to skip the modern remake and stick to the original. It is much longer, but exciting and perfectly well done. Interesting, complex and textured, without preaching complacency ... and it is also beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> I find it unpleasant that these soulless remakes of great foreign films get so much Hollywood fanfare on the Oscars. (Although I liked when Benicio Del Torro received deserved praise ...)
