Family travels in the Midwest. There is a widower Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and the little daughter of Ben K. T. (Jerry rushle). Then go to a town called Hillsboro, where everyone behaves more than strange. Their car breaks down and they have to stay. Soon they will learn that the coven has a spell over the city and is ready for incredible evil. <br /> <br /> The story is not so good. People just figure out things from nothing, and they just figure out where the witches are at the end. Also at the end there are many loopholes. The game is also pretty bad. Bateman and Capri are soft, and everything else is about the same. Only old pros Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones gives good performances. Still this movie works. He refuses blood and blood (there are some, but it is PG) and manages to work with some very creepy visual effects and atmosphere. Acting gets in the way of many of these, but it still works. Martin especially chews up the scenery in his role. I can't explain exactly why I (like) like this film, but it worked for me. This is a quiet horror, which is no more. Hardly a masterpiece, but it deserves to be rediscovered. A 7
