I like this film, first of all because Mark Wahlberg is present, and secondly, because the end justifies the means. In this film, there is something that absorbs you and allows you to feel all the emotions that characters experience. Jen Aniston is gorgeous as a girl in this movie. He looks at the lifestyle of Rockstar, which many hardcore rockers lived in those times (they may have become a little smarter these days). It passes through a rainbow of emotions and has many fine lines to let the light through. Like a diamond, this film shines. You will not waste popcorn on it. Half nestling, but my husband liked it too. There is laughter too.
