Here is another nice surprise. Whenever I hear a movie being redone, I cringe. Films such as Gone in Sixty Seconds and The Day of the Jackal will be redone and the results will be less than stellar. Therefore, when I heard that “Italian work” is being reworked, I expected it to be bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I had the opportunity to calm down, read some reviews and, finally, watch a movie, and was proven wrong. Of course, this is not original and not predictable, but it is fun. From start to finish, you get into one very fun trip. Minis scenes are great and the characters really enjoy it. <br /> <br /> So even if there are any flaws, who cares while it is fun? <br /> <br /> Overall, 8 out of 10. The only lost moments are maybe a few details and a slight lack of realism. But you will be so fun that you will not even be allowed to stop and notice.
