This movie was just awesome. The script was incredible, as well as directing and acting. This story immediately interested you. This film is one of those films in which your heart beats all the time. As always, Damian Chapa is great, he is interested in Actor's game is as strong as that of any Hollywood actor. The cast in this movie is perfect. Each character made the story more complete. The cinematography was exciting, and it lifted the film. I was completely stuck on the screen and could not stop watching it. It was one of the best films of the whole year, maybe even the best. Definitely rent this movie, I recommend this movie if you want to watch great movies or just for fun.
