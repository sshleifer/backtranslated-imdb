I watched this film quite regularly most of my life, and it never gets old. Despite all the obscene remarks and insults (mostly from David Spade), Tommy Boy has a huge heart. And this is what makes this movie fun after all these years. <br /> <br /> Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) is the son of Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy), auto parts sales assistant, and has traveled all his life. But after his deceased is on his wedding day, Tommy finds out that the company is in debt, and Ray Zalinsky (Dan Akroyd), the owner of a huge auto parts company, is going to buy it. Therefore, to save the company, Tommy must hit the road to sell the new brake pads of the company. However, Richard Hayden (David Spade) is Tommy's former classmate, who was Big Tom's right-handed man. <br /> <br /> The film is about chemistry between two SNL stars. (and true best friends) Chris Farley and David Spade. The duet has enough comic energy going between them to put the world into action. This is a big, dumb guy compared to a smart little guy. It works, and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny. Farley and Spade are really worthy drama actors too. Although the film is mostly comedic, there is some drama in it, but Spade and especially Farley are as good there as when they make the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I have a little talk about Chris Farley. I read his biography (“The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts,” for all who care), and understanding who Chris was in real life made this film more special to me. Chris Farley was a really good man who fought, and ultimately failed to beat his addiction. Although it was the first film in which he played the title role, this is his best film. It really showed who he was and how talented he was. Knowing the story of Chris adds another layer to this film, although it doesn’t make it any less funny. <br /> <br /> Farley and Spade go well with the cast. Rob Lowe is slimy, respectively, like Tommy's “new brother,” and Bo Derek is as firm as his stepmother. Brian Dennehy is great as Big Tom. Dennehy makes it easy to believe that they are father in son. Big Tom is as crazy as his son, although he is smarter and more mature. Dan Aroyd gives one of his best performances as Zalinsky, giving Tommy a hard truth about advertising. Julie Warner is as good as Tommy's love interest, Michelle. <br /> <br /> For me, Peter Seagal is one of the great comedy directors. He keeps pace fast and energetic, but most importantly, he knows how to make a comedy funny. He does not caress the joke and realizes that the funny actors know what they are doing, and he allows them to do it. But Seagal goes further. He publishes “Tommy Boy” a friendly, almost nostalgic tone that simultaneously jerks the heart strings and tickles a funny bone. <br /> <br /> Critics didn’t like Tommy Boy. Shame on them. The film should not be very complex or subversively intellectual to be funny (God forbid Farley and Spade had to make a muffled comedy in the style of “Office”). This is a great movie and one of my favorites.
