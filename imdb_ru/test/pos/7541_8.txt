Choose your destiny: terrible fourth-class tiki, playing practical jokes with axes, or ... mmm ... well-developed sixth-class girls who recently discovered cigarettes, gin, sex and how easily men can be led astray. The problem is that one set comes with another. They are all there, in St. Trinian, in this surprisingly easy school for girls, which is headed by director Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim). Like Miss Fritton, she likes to point out: "In other schools, girls are sent completely unprepared to a ruthless world, but when our girls leave here, you need to prepare a ruthless world." Miss Fritton sounds like a fusion of Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt, and she definitely has the comic genes of Sim. <br /> <br /> In "Beauties of sv. Trinins ", a sly, chaotic comedy from the team of Frank Lounder and Sidney Gilliat," St. Trinia, as usual, is on the verge of a financial catastrophe. However, salvation can be at hand when a rich sheikh sends his daughter to the fourth grade and receives the appropriate education in English. Sheikh also owns a horse, and one of his prize racers, an Arab boy, is preparing for a race near the school. It’s just a matter of time when fourth-grade girls will form a racing pool and make big bets on Arab Boy, and Miss Fritton will add funds left by the school to the pool. (A significant part of the fourth-grade girl’s money comes from gin, which they do in chemistry, then bottled and lowered on the rope to Flash Harry (George Cole), Cockney, the rectifier, for distribution. "He has something ... I don’t I know that, ”says Miss Fritton, trying things,“ but send a few bottles to my room. ”<br /> <br /> Miss Fritton, however, has a brother, Clarence Fritton (who, according to some, Coincidence Casting is also Alastair Sim), a bookmaker, which not only put a bunch on another horse but he also has a daughter. And he placed the premature Arabella in sixth grade to keep him informed. Soon the sixth grade kidnapped the Arab boy, the fourth grade took the horse, Flash Harry joined forces with Miss Fritton, the sixth grade girls decided the Arab boy will not leave the second floor of St. Trinian, Clarence and his gang in Homburg arrived, the parents go to Parents' Day, and the Ministry of Education arrived in the person of a very suitable inspector. Total war flared up at the holy Trinina. It is difficult to say what is more dangerous, African spears or flour-bombs. <br /> <br /> Alastair Sim as Millicent Fritton takes part in the performance. Miss Fritton is a tall woman with a magnificent chest, loves long dresses with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with lots of feathers. She readily perceives everything, even the fourth, knocking on something in a chemistry class and, having heard the explosion a few minutes later, results. "Oh, dear. I told Bessie to be more careful with this nitroglycerin!" She firmly believes that “St. Trinian "is" a cheerful arcade of happy girls. " Sim was one of the great British eccentric actors. In addition to the pure chaos of all the little (and not so) girls doing terrible things, he delivers much of the pleasure of the film.
