Before it was shown on MTV or VH1, it was in my local theater before the most important film. I remember this short film more than the film that I saw that day. It was the first time I had such a musical film, but I will tell you that watching a 35-millimeter print on a big screen in a darkened theater gives a much better effect than watching a cropped version of panning and scanning on VH1 on Halloween.
