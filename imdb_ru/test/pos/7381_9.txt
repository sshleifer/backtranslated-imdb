... this noir film plot suffers from a gloomy sound (at least as shown in the inadequate facilities of Seattle and Maine film festivals) and a gloomy plot, while Rickman suffers from American accent, old tennis shoes and baggy sweats. However, he has moments of star-chewing scenery, and the film offers an ominous ambiguity from Norman Reedus, pretty Polly Walker, and an unexpected finale (a telescope for frequent moviegoers), while also providing a fine look at the physiography of both Men and Rickman . In March there will be a video release (after going on the air). Don't miss a single Rickman fan. Do not pay attention to the fly agaric.
