STMD! This is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films that I've seen for a long time. Directed by Jeff Smith (who was also a co-author, filmmaker and editor) definitely shows his love for the under-rated 80s horror films with this movie! Anyone who loves frivolity, absurd situations, stupid and stereotypical characters of the horror films of the 80s will surely fall in love with this same stupid tribute to the past. definitely corresponds to the qualities described in the poster, and then some. It has all the "excessive violence" and "unwarranted nudity," which are reminiscent of those entertaining 80s horror films that we all love. I had a blast watching STMD! From the outfits of the 80s, which are stereotyped characters, to splashes of blood to stupid tones, I just could not get enough!
