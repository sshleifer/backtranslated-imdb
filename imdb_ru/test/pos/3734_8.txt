Hey look, you don't watch this film to change your life! But if you are especially a woman and you always had something for Richard Gere; this movie is right on your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere talk about chemistry on screen. Nights in Rodanthe is not an Oscar-winning film, and most likely it will be forgotten sooner rather than later, but if you want to create a beautiful and charming love story between middle-aged people (they don't make your stomach to turn and even when Gere is "on top", it does not look too joyful) then this film is for you. I liked the theme of this story, and it was very relevant in many ways. Of course, all of this was presented superficially, embellished and irrelevant to the matter ..... I mean, I would like to know more about the father-son relationship between Gere and James Franco, but the story was really about the idea that love can change you for the better; be it a lover, a child, a friend, etc. Theme of the film about love and its mysterious ways. I was a little surprised that James Franco played such an insignificant role in this film, but he is always good even for a few minutes of screen time. I really liked this film because it was exciting and enjoyable.
