Roy Andersson managed to create something that challenges almost all agreements on how a film should be, a work of art that is both beautiful, funny and memorable. The end result is a touching, albeit somewhat broken, story of humanity in its most simple and honest forms. <br /> <br /> This is unlikely to please everyone, in fact, humor is so well tuned that many are unlikely to get at its wavelength. Almost absurdly long strokes, awkward silence and constant medium shots will definitely repel even the most willing viewers. But it is in these disparate stories and out-of-the-box thinking that Andersson forms a world in which each character seems to be centrally absurd in its own way. Each scene is absorbed by the desert environment, and the characters seem to be left alone in their weirdness. Sometimes it's hard to watch, not least because, like in many other scenes, patience is required. But while some may welcome it on the artistic throne, others will simply look confused. This is a film that combines understated humor with its own brand of heart.
