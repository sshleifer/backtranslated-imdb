The terrible picture, which is ultimately tuned to a parody, but still in the game, can scare some of those who are broken, nervous, or easily disgusted when they see something under their skin. I laughed at it though. Uncovering the true killer was easy, and his game did not help. This only led to the fact that Potente looked even better. “Anatomy” is not a terrible picture for those who do not know the genre, but those contained in it should cause some unintended laughter and an interesting peak in the German horror film. 6/10
