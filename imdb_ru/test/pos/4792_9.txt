A black-comic story about a ousted priest, Nazarin demonstrates the economy that Luis Bunuel could achieve by telling a deeply humanistic fable with a minimum of fuss. As a result of his Mexican filmmaking era, he had invaluable talent, with little money and an extremely tight schedule. Nazarin, however, surpasses many of Bunuel's previous Mexican films in terms of acting (Francisco Rabal - excellent), narration and themes. <br /> <br /> The topic, which is interesting, is again explored in the Viridian. three years later in Spain. This applies to the struggle of man for humanity and altruism in a society that rejects any concept of virtue. Father Nazarin, however, is depicted more sympathetically than Viridian’s sister. Considering that the latter seems to choose charity because she wants to atone for her (supposed) sins, it seems that the whole existence of Nazarin and the reason for his existence is to help others, like them (or us) or not. The last scenes in the film, in which he questions his behavior and in the blink of an eye is forced to choose between the life he leads, or the ordinary life that a priest expects, are so emotional because they concern his moral integrity. and we are never sure if it will remain untouched. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film, and I urge anyone interested in classic cinema to look for it. This is one of the most touching films of Bunuel, which embodies many of his obsessive ideas: disappointed desire, insane love, religious hypocrisy, etc. In my opinion, "Nazarin" is second only to "Destroying Angel", in terms of his Mexican films, and of course, at the top of the list of Bunuel’s overall cinematic production.
