This is a great show with full freshness and innovation. This ordinary chair (a sofa for a woman), this mandatory group playing monotonous melodies, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the times of Nebuchadnezzar ... probably the pattern of Johnny Carson copied by everyone, Latterman Leno, Conan ... Daley seems to have none of them on this show. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this show for the first 10 minutes and am going to stick with it. Although it’s too early to talk about it, it seems that there are no intellectual claims in this show that most talk shows try to project so much, and I hope that this is what distinguishes this show from all the others. I hope this show will last a long time! <br /> <br /> Coming back after months, I still love this show, and I love his self-deprecating humor (For example, his statement that only lonely beggars will be home to Watch his show on Saturday at midnight, and thus , jokes are ridiculous only for stoned guys), which, however, does not include the usual monkey Conan O'Brien, for example (I know this is a cardinal sin that should be reflected on O'Brien's Pranks, but I really don’t like him style and repeatability). <br /> <br /> I watched it again last night with Tom Arnold in it. Ferensen's parody of the Trade Spouses (and Nanny 911 in an earlier episode) is ridiculous. Idiotic paparazzi are fun, especially when the guard warns them against photographing people, and (if I'm not mistaken) they start photographing him, shouting "Gary Coleman." <br /> <br /> Posted on April 16, 2007: Returning once more, I’m confused by my neighbor and her dog. I can't decide if this is a joke or a real thing. In any case, it was damn funny. <br /> <br /> I don’t expect Spike Peresten to read these pages, but maybe he will. He is crazy than a bunch of monkeys, and so I’d better write my offer for him here: I would like him to give a 30-minute full show with Mad Gideon, the star of the night TV commercial. I would like Crazy Gideon to give an interview on Spike's talk show, sing a song (and play the guitar), make a parody of the SNL line, and also answer questions from the audience about his potential mayor of Los Angeles (I know Crazy Gideon know about it, but there are sites that tell in detail why he would be an ideal candidate for mayor of Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> God forbid! <br /> <br /> Returning back July 14, 2007 years: someone wrote here that people who praised Spike's talk show should be bribed by Spike. Well, Spike really bribed me, but I also have to admit that Rockefeller called me in his will, and last night I had sex with Cindy Crawford.
