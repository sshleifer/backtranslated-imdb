El Padrino has just been released in Europe and is really good. This film with a great cast - Damien Chapa (Blood in Blood), Robert Wager, Jennifer Tilly, Robert Wagner and many others - is the best gangster film since SCARFACE. A film that all MUST SEE. 2 hours of work with a fantastic incredible trick !!!! <br /> <br /> GRACIAS JENNIFER !!!! We look forward to part 2 !!!! Does anyone know if he will? Keep up the good work !!! I like it !!
