Once I stumbled upon The Last Stop in a video store, and they sold it for only $ 2. I decided to try and buy. It was pretty good, I liked it. The story of a few people who all ended up in a cabin somewhere to nowhere because of the raging snowstorm. There is a policeman, Nancy, his ex-girlfriend, two brothers who have just come out of prison, an elderly man and his lover, a black man and a couple who own houses, and their backward son who never speaks. Suddenly, someone was found dead and found a bag with money. All suspects. Last Stop is a pretty good thriller, I would give 8/10
