Very reliable entertainment, both Las Vegas fun and intrigue, is very frivolous and very much supported by Josh Dianel !! I like this TV show, and I think many people watch it as a form of escapist voyeurism ... Voyeurism in this case is very positive, and many women in this series are very nice to watch ... This show includes Las Vegas such legends like Wayne Newton, like fickle characters to authenticate the Las Vegas genre !! There were abundant images of the city of sin, this is one of the best works ... Producers and directors were lucky that James Caan appeared in the series because he is a very experienced actor !!! By and large, I like a Las Vegas TV show, and I watch it on Fridays, I watched it on Mondays, but on Monday evening I could understand why NBC had switched it on Fridays ... Nevertheless I like Las Vegas a lot !!
