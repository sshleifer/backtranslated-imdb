Goldeneye from 007 is one of the best N64 releases ever. <br /> <br /> Better than this game? Well ... Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Episode I-Racer and The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarin of Time are much better and superior games. But I still love Golden Eye. <br /> <br /> This is the best adaptation from the movie, second only to the Star Wars animation. The story is beautiful. It's like in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> The graphics are excellent. The movements are extremely realistic. The artificial intelligence of enemies is the best part of this game. I liked to play on the stage where James and Natalia break away from the base of Janus while the Golden Eye prepares to burn it. Running without an alarm was very difficult. Camera exclusion and fire control are excellent aspects of the gameplay. <br /> <br /> This is also the most challenging game I've ever played. N64 games are usually very, very easy. The golden eye is the only exception. I'm still trying to overcome the difficult level 00 Agent, but winning at simpler levels was already a big victory. I really liked it when Alec Trevelyan asked: “For England, James?”. I replied: “No, for me!” It happened just at the moment when I killed him. Just like in the movie. I love to do all the tasks. <br /> <br /> Multiplayer games are even better. First, I was killed every holy second. Now I know how to win. I love to get my playmates playing License to Kill. <br /> <br /> Music and sound are amazing. Super Mario 64 looks like an Atari next to it. The only thing I still wanted to hear was the song "Golden Eye", which plays at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> After the release of Zelda, I almost forgot that I still have this game. It is still excellent, even if it has already surpassed. I hope that other games will be released 007. <br /> <br /> Fantastic work Rareware! Nintendo was very smart to release this game exclusively on the N64. The great work of Nintendo!
