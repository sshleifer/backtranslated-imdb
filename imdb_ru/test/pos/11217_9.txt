The second episode of “Mr. Eco” has somewhat less interesting memories than the first (“Psalm 23”), but in almost every other department it is one of the best episodes of the second season, promoting the mythology / history of the series as well as characters. Locke and Eco opened a new station, the Dharma Initiative — Pearl, and the film they find and watch inside completes Locke’s transformation from the believer (Orientation — after the movie ends: watch it again) to the hesitant ("SOS "-" Did you press this button, Henry? I need to know ") to an unbeliever ("? "- after the end of the film:" Do you want to watch it again? - "No, I have seen enough"). Terry O'Quinn's play is, as usual, powerful (“every second of my pitiful little life is useless, like this button”). Meanwhile, Eco takes his place as a person who becomes confident that he was brought to the island as part of his true destiny, which is to keep pressing the button. The other high points "?" Are a striking, unique sequence of dreams, where person A sees a dream as being person B (this is a bold idea that this LOST season can use much more), and the haunting scene of Libby’s last word before h is death, and as Jack and Hurley cannot know its true meaning. *** 1/2 of 4.
