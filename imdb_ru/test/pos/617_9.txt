This is one of the films that you want to watch with an open heart. Someone knows that it is about dumb, someone can look forward or fear many feelings. <br /> <br /> Okay, forget about it. The film begins with a slight black humor, and then begins. Since then, he has embarked on a horrific trip through the dark centers of Moscow. Well, I must say: unexpected turns are expected, and dumb is mainly used as a tool for plotting or creating fear. But this film does not let you go. <br /> <br /> It's like old gangster movies, but without any charm in Russia. And this is one of the most important aspects of this film: it is in Russia. This has a big impact on the film, in my opinion, it makes it better. Everything becomes simple and basic, life without stupidity. This could be a great potential for creating more films in the future, gangster films about the Russian mafia. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful and scary movie. It's terrible, but you can not feel, but sympathy for the little dumb. Last tip: don't watch it too late in the evening if you want to sleep well.
