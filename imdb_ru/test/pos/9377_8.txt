As a rule, there are a few things more depressing than Hollywood’s attempts to show courage. Combining caution with authority, "movies with messages" loudly pat themselves on the back to dare to cope with serious problems. CROSSFIRE is not entirely free from this corruption; this includes a sermon on the nature of meaningless hatred, which is embarrassingly obvious, suggesting a level of naivety in an audience that depresses contemplation. Back in 1947 it was very important for the film to declare that anti-Semitism exists and that it is bad. (Of course, for Hollywood it was unthinkable to touch on the real subject of the book on which the film is based - his victim was homosexual.) Nevertheless, thanks to good writing and a great game, CROSSFIRE remains a convincing study of what we now would call it a hate crime . <br /> <br /> Post-war malaise was one of the main components of the film noir, and CROSSFIRE refers to it directly. The film takes place in Washington, DC, among soldiers still in uniform, but without cause, who spend their days playing poker and crawling around the bars. Joseph Samuels (Sam Leuven), an intelligent and kind Jew, explains that the end of the war created a void: all the energy that went into hatred and fight with the enemy, is now not focused and accumulates. Samuels meets at the bar three soldiers: a sensitive Mitchell, close to a nervous breakdown, weak-willed Floyd Bowers and Montgomery, a tall, powerful bully, who maliciously downgrades a young soldier from Tennessee for a stupid hunchback. Three soldiers find themselves in Samuel’s apartment, where drunk Monty is becoming more and more offensive, calling his master a “Jewish boy”. Samuels was beaten to death, and Mitchell disappears, making him the prime suspect in the murder. <br /> <br /> Detective Finlay (Robert Young), dry and off-screen, uncovers the crime, and Sergeant Keely (Robert Mitchum), a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows that Mitchell is not capable of murder. Among the puzzle pieces, Ginny (Gloria Grame), the owner of a nightclub who met Mitchell and gave him the key to her apartment, and Floyd (Steve Brodie), who discovered horror in a horrible apartment building as a witness to the crime. Despite the fact that there is no real "someone else's" unknown, the story remains fascinating, and the trap laid for the killer is extremely clever. <br /> <br /> The strong atmosphere of noir saves the film from a sense of didactics or hypocrisy. Cinematography is a striking play of shadows, with inky dark and harsh lights; rooms are often illuminated with a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke. Fatigue of the world is as common as noir. “Nothing interests me,” Finley says quietly; "To nothing" is Ginny's toast at a nightclub. Gloria Graham, a sample of noir femininity, almost stole the film with its two scenes. Platinum blonde, exhausted and fretful, she is the most typical bi-girl poisoned by the “gin stinky mill” where she works (“for fun,” she says bitterly), her sweet face bends when Mitchell tells her that reminds him of his wife. From time to time, thoughtful kindness peeks through her protective shell, as when she dances with Mitchell in a deserted courtyard, and then offers to cook him spaghetti in her apartment. When he goes there, he meets a weak man with a wrinkled face (Paul Kelly), who seems to be ruining Ginny, and the conversation about which consists of a thick layer of lies and false confessions. Gloria is tearing off the screen Mitchell's young wife in a scene where she is asked to give an alibi to Mitchell. Slender and frail in her dressing gown, with her girlish lips, she lets us see how often Ginny was insulted and fired as a vagabond. <br /> <br /> Robert Young is a nondescript actor, and he has no chance against Charisma Mitchum, but he copes well with keeping his smoking character burdened with a serious message from the film, this side of bombast. Mitchum, meanwhile, engages in a cool dialogue, but it is not enough for that; nevertheless, even when he does nothing, only idle in the corner, you cannot take your eyes off him. The third Robert, Ryan, creates a completely obscured and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant, unstable fanatic; we see his fake genius, his mockery, his offense at someone with the benefits, his "Am I right or am I right?" complacency; how easily he labels people and what satisfaction he gets by despising them. <br /> <br /> The CROSSFIRE message looks cautious and outdated, although not as strong as the Gentleman’s agreement of the same year. Finley's speech about fanaticism copes with the situation when she lives to be a hundred years old in the case of a white victim, reminding us that Irish Catholics were once persecuted; The next may be a man from Tennessee, he says, or men who wear striped ties. Or maybe blacks, or Japanese, or homosexuals, or communists? The script seems to be afraid to mention any real modern problems. He softens his message by making the Jewish sacrifice holy, as if his innocence is not enough; and he takes care to justify the military by ordering a high-ranking officer to declare that the army is ashamed of people like Montgomery, and stressing that Samuels served with honor in the war. However, immediately after World War II, it took a little courage to portray an American who was perhaps happier in the Nazi army, and the basic premise of the film is still valid. If Monty had been alive today, he would have gone out on September 12, 2001 and would have beaten the Sikh.
