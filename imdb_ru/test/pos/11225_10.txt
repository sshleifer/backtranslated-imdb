This is a rare and beautiful sight, an allegory of death and transfiguration, which is neither preaching nor disgusting. Northfork is a mature and bold job that avoids differences between buildings, refusing to belong to any kind. Unlike the most memorable and completed film, which imposes an obvious comparison, Wim Wenders' 1987 Wings of Desires (Der Himmel Ã¼ber Berlin), he supports ambivalence in the narrative spectrum, ranging from the mundane to the supernatural. This story of earthly and celestial eminent regions in the American West hides a fabulous literalness that marked its German predecessor in a special genre of angels, spreading their wings with obscene sentimentalism. His heavenly transcendence, whether inspired by sad faith or prompted by a feverish sleep, never part with mud and rot. This foundation of the company has a positive effect on the reputation of writers and directors Mark and Michael Polish.
