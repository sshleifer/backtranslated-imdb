Without a doubt, a pleasant film, very reminiscent of his era and of this particular stage of the "rites of passage" of any boy. But I have to say that after reading very positive comments here, I was a little disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. All this revolves around the most blatant mistake in the history of school plays. The idea that quacking quack will ever be chosen for the game, not only in one of the three star courses, but also in the role of a philander, is risky. And without it, nada. The plots had nothing to do, which I could see to the main plot - they could all be completely removed without in any way affecting the main story - which undoubtedly indicates a fundamental flaw. When all your subplots look like indentation, you know that the central idea goes beyond it. However, this is a good movie with a heart in the right place, there are a few good performances, and you just feel that all the participants felt bloated in the final “piece!” This good feeling permeates the movie. And that should mean something. The disadvantage of a really good movie. 7 out of 10.
