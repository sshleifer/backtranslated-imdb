I really liked the puppet movie. It was the first of the Muppet films, and he is by far the best because he is so creative and fresh. With later films, the ideas simply did not seem so original. But here we see Kermit and Miss Piggy riding bikes (an incredibly difficult scene), great cast and just a lot of fun. I loved every minute when the dolls were performing, and I would rate the film much higher, if not for one serious problem. In this and most subsequent Mappet films, some of the forces that were felt should have included many non-Muppets, in particular, many, many cameos with stars. Some worked fine (for example, with Charles Durning), but many simply seemed out of place and slowed the picture to a complete stop. Probably the worst of them was with Edgar Bergan. Yes, he was an amazing person who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his team, but the tiny scene he was in was simply not needed, like most cameos. Nevertheless, despite this great complaint, this is an excellent film for the whole family - from children to even the most demanding adults.
