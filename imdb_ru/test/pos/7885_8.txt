The residents of New York, at the same time as this film, will remember how it reflects their time and how well the actors and the film crew captured America, New York of that era. <br /> <br /> The Norman Wechler scenario outlines the different worlds of different subgroups living in and the Avildsen direction reveals phenomenal performances throughout. Peter Boyleâ€™s tremendous talent is demonstrated more than ever before and since then. Clearly, this is the best character character Dennis Patrick has always loved. <br /> <br /> What I will always remember about Joe is the feeling that he was in a state of shock coming out of the theater. Knowing that what the screen was depicting was boiling under the surface around the five districts of the city of New York. <br /> <br /> This film must be remembered.
