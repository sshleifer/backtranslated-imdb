PINK FLAMINGOS, who received the title of the sickest film ever created, is an indisputable classic. Of course, camera work is shaky and not in the center, the story is tangled and slow, and every character in the film is disgusting and contemptible, but PINK FLAMINGOS has a certain playful charm and brilliant satirical wit that cannot be compared to any other film. <br /> <br /> Although this film is really offensive, reading the descriptions of what is happening in the film is much worse than actually watching it. Only John Waters can succeed in making rape, murder, sadism, cannibalism, coprophagy and almost any other form of human licentiousness known to man seem completely ridiculous. This film must be seen to be believed.
