A pile of human flesh sleeps on a red pillow. This is a piece of naked meat, this is “Little Joe,” a New York hustler who lives with his bisexual wife and small child. The film tells about the day in his life, after his wife woke up from sleep, demanding that he go out and take up the traditional male business - he was the breadwinner. But she wants to use bread to pay for the abortion of her new friend. We, of course, are not in a traditional family family ... <br /> <br /> After playing with his child, Joe goes out in search of John. Customers go quickly and quickly: the usual gay who wants to meet him again because they “work well together,” an old English classical scholar who pays $ 100 to see Joe posing as an ancient Greek athlete; the topless dancer who blows Joe, boasts that she was raped; an aging bunny in the gym who doesn't think that what he and Joe are doing together is weird. After a hard day at work, Joe returns home exhausted, but his wife and girlfriend suppress him. He returns to sleep when they harp and undermine him. <br /> <br /> The flesh is enchanting because it takes what is the traditional classical structure of the mainstream - it has an incitement incident (money for abortion) and setting up confrontation and decision (albeit very grim), even the main character with much motivated purpose, and then proceeds to concentrate on the details of the daily routine of these people, which are quite common for themselves, but unusual for most "main" people. It all seems very authentic and natural - it’s hard to see acting skills, the actors play their roles so fully - but still this is just a piece of crafty fiction - a beautifully painted portrait or an intricately carved statue. Director Morrissey carefully plants every incident, every collision around his subject of human flesh becomes a packaged commodity, but with such cunning weakness of the hands that you almost do not notice how he does it. Joe's wife “packs” Joe, old Englishmen mourn the long-gone Order of Classical Beauty, which created art and poetry from human bodily beauty, stripper friends — strippers — pack themselves as women by reading a Hollywood magazine in which “real” women are packaged as products; gym bunny buys Joe friendship and love, believes artificial porn really and can not say, since we can not, that Joe fulfills his friendship and intimacy for cash. The film itself presents itself as a plus plus ultra cinematic realism, but with this we could also deal with visual art or an early example of conceptual art. <br /> <br /> Genius - a word that is not so easy to use - Morrissey had to find a way to accept Warhol’s skilful claims to filmmaking, which were interesting, of course, but damn boring, and turned into selling products that remain Among the most intriguing works of cinematographic art ever made are commercial banks with the words Flesh and Trash and Heat with the product label, Andy Warhol, which sells an idea of ​​the product in the same way as the product itself. However, just as you swing from Morrissey’s cynicism, you are amazed at his ability to maintain the highest standards and depth of meaning. Constant flashes, reminiscent of camera flashes, constantly draw attention to the cinematic nature of what you see, but you still fall into the illusion - Flesh, of course, is one of the most unusual works of cinematic magic ever captivating the audience.
