Although this film unfolds among the sophisticated English upper classes, it is a simple story about a pair break. It has a slightly outdated appearance, being an adaptation of Nigel Balchin’s 1950 novel Path through the Forest (once extremely popular, and now forgotten). Julian Fellows, who, despite the Academy's award for the Gosford Park script, is himself a somewhat anachronistic character, wrote the script and directed (the latter for the first time). With the DVD version I saw, there is Julian’s most vivid audio commentary. His main focus was on properly understanding his characters, and on the whole he achieved success. He was assisted in this by two outstanding speeches by Tom Wilkinson in the role of James, a stitched city lawyer, and Emily Watson in the role of his attractive wife Ann. He also kept it short; Travel time is only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> James and Anna have a Chelsea townhouse and a cozy former vicar in Buckinghamshire. Ann is a few years younger, but they are childless. Outwardly, they seem happy, but James, one of the moralists of nature (unusual for a city lawyer), is a freak. Down the road is the aristocrat Hon. William Buele, who does not like the morality of the middle class, and he is more than happy to use. But there is a complication, a traffic accident in which an elderly cyclist is knocked down in the countryside by a ruthlessly controlled Range Rover, such as Hon. Bill. Soon, James, Ann, Bill and the widow of the victim (who turns out to be the cleaning lady of James and Ann) are drawn into a conspiracy to hide what really happened. The focus is on the corrosive effects of all of this on the relationship between James and Anna. <br /> <br /> The third person in this trio movie, Bill, is played by Rupert Everett. From the point of view of casting, his languid, excellent manner is suitable for this role, but somehow he does not reach the goal. This is partly because he has to be sick for some time, and he looks good when he needs to be sick, and vice versa. Part seems underdeveloped. Interestingly, John Neville, as Bill's father, who has only one significant scene, manages to beautifully establish his character during the time that he has. <br /> <br /> The world of five star hotels and superb restaurants is very well invoked. As Julian Fellows says in sound commentary, these people are able to convince themselves that the Edwardian age still exists. In fact, the film is about what unites the couple and what breaks them apart. Nigel Balchin experienced a breakup of marriage when he was writing a book, and Fellowes made a good fist, conveying the atmosphere. According to him, this is a fairly free adaptation, but the central theme remains the same.
