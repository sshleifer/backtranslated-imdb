David Cronenberg's EXistenZ is a well-designed reflection of the philosophy of existentialism. It addresses the problems of a culture incorporated into a technology that can no longer distinguish between fantasy and reality or between organic and mechanical. The film shocks the audience by replacing mechanical technologies with organic, metabolic. In this context, technology may be part of the human body. After playing virtual reality “eXistenZ”, the real world feels like a game, and as a result, human behavior changes to apply violent impulses to the game, even when the game is over. In eXistenZ technology has evolved from machines into biological organisms that connect directly to the human nervous system; an idea that reflects the conviction of Marshall McLuhan, a well-known media theorist, that computers are an expansion of human consciousness. As a telephone is an extension of ears, television is an extension of eyes, a telegram is an extension of the central nervous system. High-tech virtual reality is an expansion of human consciousness. In eXistenZ technologies are biological and, therefore, more humane than in our world. But as technology becomes organic, people become more mechanical and, therefore, less free, unable to resist their gaming desires. eXistenZ is a virtual simulation of human existence. Jean Baudrillard describes mediated society in his book Simulacrum and Simulation, in which the whole force of action was transformed into a phenomenon. The world turned into a pure simulation of itself. In eXistenZ, it is obvious that Baudrillard’s society is mediated by the themes of invading the body, losing control, and transforming itself into another. <br /> <br /> While you are in eXistenZ, consciousness slowly replaces your role in the game with another person, which reflects the real subconscious of each person. As long as you step by step get control of your super-real life, the aura of your real life is disappointing. For Baudrillard, "simulations or simulacra became hyperreal, more than real." Our hyperreality, like the world of computer simulation of Kronenberg, "now feels, and for all goals and objectives it is more real than what we call the real world." (Baudrillard) The purpose of the game, which can be called "experience", is rather metaphorical. Because you cannot even know what experience is if you have not experienced it. According to the existentialists, life without precise explanations is absurd, and the game eXistenZ is also absurd. Cronenberg, ironically, reflects the absurdity of our lives. For example, in a game, other roles simply stop if you do not ask them a pre-programmed question. And when you put their aimless, ridiculous state into a representation of our lives, the revealing absurdity is truly shocking. <br /> <br /> The theme of the game is to understand what it is for? This hidden metaphorical question causes suffering for people playing eXistenZ. They have no doubts about their existence, but they do not know the main reason for their existence. The bottom line. <br /> <br /> Existentialists claim that humans do not have a fixed nature or entity like other animals and plants; each person makes a choice that creates his or her own nature. In the formulation of the French philosopher of the 20th century, Jean-Paul Sartre, existence precedes essence. “Consequently, the choice is central in human existence and is inevitable; even refusal to choose is a choice. Freedom of choice entails obligations and responsibilities. Because existentialists argue that people are free to choose their own path, they must take the risk and responsibility for fulfilling their obligations wherever they lead. ” Perhaps I should mention that eXistenZ also deals with the concept of freedom of choice. You reach your final role in the game by making the right decisions. If you do not, the game becomes irrelevant and boring. So, you begin to poll the game, its existence, and not its essence. You suddenly become schizophrenic excluded from the game and understand your position outside the game. And the last word: eXistenZ is a well thought-out inverse simulation of life, that is, existentialism. <br /> <br />
