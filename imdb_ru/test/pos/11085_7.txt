My father worked with top secret information in DIA, and it was he who mentioned this film to me. When I was a kid, I always asked him what would happen if he revealed secrets, and he would recommend this film. <br /> <br /> The film actually shows 2, almost completely different FRIENDS! in confusion, they never knew what the outcome would be. Snowman, Donton really enraged me, because in the film he was portrayed as some kind of drug dealer who didn't know what he was arguing about, and in the film it seemed that he got the worst of everything. Falcon, Chris - just a guy who wanted to express his feelings for the US government very radically. <br /> <br /> For movie lovers, this is a must see !!!
