Music videos are often completely ignored when discussing films, and most people consider them to be a smaller form of art. While the vast majority are simply catchy clips advertising the last hit of a popular artist, very few really rise above the rest, becoming works of art in their own {all directed by Spike Jones or Michel Gondry are always worth seeing}. Although “art” is not the word that I would use to describe Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” (1983), it’s an extremely cute mix of Schlok’s horror and music, as well as a short film that is still remarkably attractive. 25 years later, the Thirteen Minute Music Video, the longest and most expensive since its release, was shot by John Landis, a director with whom I don’t know much, although Blues Brothers (1980) is a classic, and I heard that “American werewolf in London (1981) ”is a terrific horror movie / comedy. <br /> <br /> The question of whether or not Thriller can really be called a music video is certainly negotiable, considering its extensive duration {although Jackson improved this effort with 1997 Ghosts in 38 minutes} and the fact that the title track is less than half the total lead time. The video begins with a short film in the film, when Michael quietly and brightly lit the night reveals to his girlfriend (Ole Ray) that he is "different" from other guys, turning into a disgusting werewolf as night clouds fly away to show the full moon. When he presumably beheads the unfortunate heroine, we are confronted by Michael and his girlfriend in a movie theater, actually watching how this drama unfolds in a horror picture. When the girl gets scared, they both leave the cinema and start going home, after which Michael begins to sing the introductory lines of his last song, Thriller. However, when a bloodthirsty zombie treasure appears from the local cemetery (their input, Vincent Price eagerly tells), the situation begins to become interesting. <br /> <br /> It’s hard to see why “Thriller” is considered one of the greatest music videos. It can not be that the song itself is very funny, and Michael Jackson ?? although since then he has become the subject of all comedians' jokes for his particular personality and actions ?? There is no doubt that he is a great singer and performer. Perhaps a worthy explanation of the film’s popularity is the incredible amount of work that needs to be done in it; there was nothing like this before, and it still remains a strange thing in the world of music videos. The horrific effects of monster makeup were designed by Rick Baker and are amazingly graphic for a music video, although they are all made with a good sense of fun. A few moments create a truly exciting expectation, successfully reflecting the atmosphere of films that parody (although always with a slight turn on the usual formula). Simply put, you will never watch a movie about zombies in the same way again!
