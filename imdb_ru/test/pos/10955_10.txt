In this film, improvisation was used to a revolutionary degree, but it functions only as a novelty. There is no greater truth about the situation when asking actors to improvise. The performances do not improve with improvisation, because now the actors have twice as many reasons for concern: not only whether they deliver the line well, but whether the line itself is good. That is why performances in many films about Robert Altman are often indecisive - because the actors are not quite sure what the lines they come up with and therefore are not sure that they are good. <br /> <br /> And frankly, this is often not very good. Often the dialogue does not actually follow from one line to another and does not fit into the environment. <br /> <br /> It crackles from an unpredictable, young energy - but, to be honest, it was difficult for me to watch and concentrate on it, squirming so terribly. <br /> <br /> However, a breathtaking, raw piece of film, and a commendable 100% for taking authority over the green light to the street. <br /> <br /> There are some generally wonderful things in this. This is a joke, for example: <br /> <br /> I am a dancer. What kind of dancer like a ballet dancer? Oh, no ... exotic. <br /> <br /> And the whole party begins, the next trip to the park, and the scene where the boys look at the statues. <br /> <br /> 2 / 5. I would not say that they cost 2 hours of your time.
