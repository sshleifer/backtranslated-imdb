I missed it in the movie and filmed on DVD. If you had such an opportunity, I would recommend it, as it is better than almost everything I saw in the movie or on DVD this year. This does not mean that this is one of the best films in the entire history, I just saw a lot of rubbish :) <br /> <br /> I canâ€™t add to what has already been said, except for 8/10
