I caught "On the Run" at a cinema in New York, and I was immediately seduced by its true independent spirit. Starring Michael Imperoli and John Ventimiglia from the Actor "Soprano" "Running" sends us on a wild 24-hour trip around a city that never sleeps, and we follow the convolutions of an introspective sales agent who was suddenly dragged away by his long missing from school , just got out of jail. In fact, he fled from this and "on the run", looking for some kind of action and a glimpse of life among the great metropolis. This film, created on the basis of great performances, brings us back to the old sense of the photographs of the 70s, when both characters rediscover themselves when they burn through the city, running into wild events and local residents. Elegy to a certain side of New York, which seems to be disappearing, “In the run” demonstrates great sensitivity and humor. I predict that this will be a cult classic that calls for discovery: future viewers must surrender to this night trip.
