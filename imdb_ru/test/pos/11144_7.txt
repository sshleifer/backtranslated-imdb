Especially a delightful film for those of us who saw it in our youth, because, after all, it had to look young — when it is considered as an adult again, it’s better if it gets rose-colored glasses. It was the first of 16 Jim Jungle Films and the later television series Johnny Weismuller continued to do for Colombia (in the last 3 films he had to use his own name because they lost their rights) after receiving a bag from the Tarzan game for Sol Lessser. Johnny Sheffield also quit Boi to play Jungle Boy Bomb in a series of 12 films. <br /> <br /> Jim and the group set off on a dangerous safari to hunt down the hidden temple of Zimbalu, inhabited by a little-known devil's tribe of doctors, who seem to have a secret of poison, which can also be a cure for polio. Edgar Rice Burrows is probably approved. After 16 years of monosyllabic conversation, Weismüller seemed awkward, tying up sentences, but it didn't matter. On the fast march, we meet many interesting, but generally playful inhabitants of the jungle, except that the sinister crocodile is going to eat the leading lady with a leg caught under the branch and the surreal hustle of the elephant (the footage is squeezed into the corner of the frame). The dog Skipper and Kou-Kou crow had many adventures, none of which proved to be essential for the plot if you concentrated! The biggest problem with the film is the farcical climax, which can be exciting, but, unfortunately, remind you of the end of the serial part. and the original excellent series was made 12 years before. Although I personally would not mind if it lasted a couple more hours! <br /> <br /> The only thing that is difficult in this is Veismuller; In many respects, a nice children's film from the old days is not recommended for serious adults, so I love it.
