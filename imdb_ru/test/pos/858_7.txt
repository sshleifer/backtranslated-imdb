When I watched this movie, the first thing that caught my eye was actress Kelly Overton, a young (and op and future star) actress I saw for the first time, just struck me ... sheâ€™s amazing on the screen, and I'm really looking forward to to see what awaits her in the future .... <br /> <br /> The film itself was good in the sense that it allowed Kelly Overton to do his job and ride with Weaver ... not much new, although I have there was a feeling that I had seen it all before ... but good experience :) I would recommend this movie ... if only to see Kell Overton ... this actor takes the screen by storm ... I give for this film ... 5 7 voted for the actor's performance and 2 for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> And the last remark ... sorry for my bad english ... if this is nonsense: P plz ignore me ...
