I recently saw House of Wax, and I must say that I really liked it. <br /> <br /> It was one of the best horror films / thrillers in the last few years, if not one of the best and most entertaining. /> <br /> I heard that many people scolded the so-called slow start and character development, which takes Films opening in 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> And yet, if the film plunged straight into death, viewers and critics would criticize the film for not having decent characters that they wouldn't care about. <br /> <br /> Regarding character development, I think it worked surprisingly. <br /> Taking into account my own answer and others (from reading posts on the bulletin board), many people eventually wanted the characters to survive, one of which, I noticed, many refer to as Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton). considering warner. The brothers advertised her death, and suddenly it turned out that many viewers encouraged her for survival. <br /> <br /> Talking about the chase / death scenes, they were among the most inventive and intense. I have been a witness for some time and have received great pleasure from everyone. <br /> <br /> The movie was absolutely good, I couldnâ€™t blame anyone, especially Paris Hilton, I thought she was very decent and I hoped she would get a more than 25-minute screen at 120 -minute film, but her chase scene made up for it, and trust me when I say that Paris can get scared (see the scene where she hides the car from Vincent, and he drives past her .... the expression of horror on her face looks VERY real). <br /> <br /> In general, I give House of Wax maximum stars, even blood is entertaining and waiting ... the only criticism is that I want them to not disclose the list of mortals who die , and who survives, as he Would be ten times better, not knowing whether the pursued character is going to live or die and a terrible death. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the DVD, but while you can watch it in the Cinema, in your front room everything will be different, but if you wait for the DVD, watch a movie in the dark without interruptions, trust me, you will not be disappointed.
