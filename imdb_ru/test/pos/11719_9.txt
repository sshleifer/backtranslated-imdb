Intense dark drama with extraordinary rich support from Casey, Keita and others. Many of them get the best roles in their careers and work with them. The film is of a strange form - often the action slows down, just that the characters are drawn into strange, but well-executed, seemingly improved dialogues - during the breakdown almost all the “Machines” fall into perfectly set humorous monologues - and Reynolds, the director, deserves great respect for that Reynolds went away from the star and gave them a place. And unlike most action movies, you really like the characters, which makes the 2nd half, when their various fates are good and bad, unfold, unusually impressive. The combination of character development, brutal violence, jazz soundtrack (Tarantino must be a fan - watch this, and then Jackie Brown, and you will understand what I'm talking about), make this sometimes flawed film a little melodramatic) one of the best modern films about the cops, and, in my opinion, surpasses many of the overvalued modern noirs, such as Body Heat and the like.
