I rarely watch short films, because they seem to only be shown on nightly television and not published enough to let me know which short films are worth it. Since The Room is an extra feature on the Hitcher DVD, it gave me a great opportunity to witness a high-quality short with Rutger Hauer in great shape. <br /> <br /> Artistically shot in black and white, The Room explores the personâ€™s obsession with the room, which he went through in the early stages of adulthood, expressed in the style of a documentary / interview. The dialogue is very poetic, typical of a man expressing his feelings for a woman, but also combined with delirium and occasional flaws in fluency. This adds a lot of realism and depth to the performance of Hauer, who is ideally suited as an eccentric person, for most of his life behind him. <br /> <br /> The piano music that Harry (Hauer) hears from the room is constantly in the background, and heightens the moving atmosphere of the film and heightens the feelings of sadness expressed by Hauer. <br /> <br /> Hower proves that he is more than just a psychotic Hollywood bad guy with this role, and beautifully shows his more sensitive side. Mattin Hartemink is also effective in memories as a young Harry with a dumb role. He shows how much music influenced him and his frustration when it leaves. <br /> <br /> The ending is prophetic and leaves you in a reflecting mood longer than in many feature films. Very good effort.
