Short three Stooges, this one featuring Schempe. Of all the ones I participated with Schempe, this is my favorite performance in the short film Stooges. The main plot is that Shemp should marry that evening at 6 o'clock if he inherits the half million dollars that a rich uncle left for him in his will. Thus, Shemp is going to get a bride, but believes that this is a more difficult way than expected, until they find out about his hereditary money. Highlights here include shaving Shemp, Schempe and Mo in the phone booth and Larry on the piano as an accompaniment to Schempe's training. In addition, the sequence in which Schemp is mistaken for Cousin Basil, and his result is ridiculous.
