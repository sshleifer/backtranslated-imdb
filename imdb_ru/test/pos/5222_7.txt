“Father Hood” is a little gem of the “road film”. Wonderful performances by Halley Berry, Sabina Lloyd and Brian Bonsalla, two really funny “super-top” Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside, <br /> <br /> and a completely outstanding Patrick Swayze The film is helped by an unconventional storyline, but greatly undermined by its frame memories, which leads to a formal, sharp ending. "Father Hood" would work much better without these "bookends." However, the film raises important questions about “family responsibilities” and the consequences of government intervention. As long as the receiving system rewards public institutions for not placing children, such abuses will exist. <br /> <br /> Take this. It's worth a ride.
