as a “disabled person” (god, how I hate this phrase), I just stumbled upon it by telegram, where there was nothing else to watch - in general, it was a fantastic film. Yes, I was a little disappointed to learn that no actor is disabled, and yes, I was a little disappointed that a large part of the film was not shot from the “true” point of view of a disabled person (you can imagine that this is always the case the tallest man in the room, and then live the rest of his life, seeing nothing but donkeys and crotches of other people - always wait until the idiot stops reading the newspaper in a single stall for the disabled, enduring gross bodily banishment of everyone else while you wait? ). and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me! was there, did it, literally. but the film was truthful enough to make a difference - although I never lived in a house or residence with support, there were many times in the film when I nodded my head and said to myself: “Yes, that's true ... it happened” for me .. "What struck me was that some of the commentators on this forum expressed the fact that the film made them look at life a little differently and with a bit more understanding of the life of the silent" minority "- maybe" You don’t need to ask the movie that makes you think and look at life differently, Therefore, thanks to this one, the films have been extremely successful. You must demand viewing of each child in high school. <br /> <br /> To a large extent for every person with severe physical disabilities, independence is one of, if not the most important, direction of our daily life, from work to socializing to recreate. for those of you who feel that the movie is “cliche,” try living our lives for one day — you will see that the movie is “cliche” because ... it's true. the challenges faced by the actors only superficially reflected what happens to us every day - if we are lucky, we will experience the same emotional and personal growth as the three characters (including the girl). every day confronts us with obstacles that we must overcome - there is simply no exciting dramatic music that would accompany our life, if it was not in our stakes ... laughs!
