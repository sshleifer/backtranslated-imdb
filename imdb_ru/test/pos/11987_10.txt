I like this movie. <br /> <br /> None of his friends like him, but I like him. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like him as much as the first, but he was still good. The script and plot may not have changed at all, but the story was better than Caddyshack 1. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn’t like Caddyshack 2 is ... <br /> <br /> NO FAMILY HAZARD! <br /> <br /> I think the film would be better if Rodney Dangerfield played the role of Jackie Mason. Although I really liked Jackie Mason in the film, it would be better if they left Rodney Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> Another flaw in the film that I didn’t hate so much was Dan Aroyd. The film was shot 8 years after the first one. Bill Murray, "Karl", could leave the post of assistant greengrocer and join the army, you know? If Warner Bros. thought about it, it could make the film even better. <br /> <br /> This was my comment on Caddyshack II. <br /> <br /> I give it 8.2 out of 10 <br /> <br /> It could have been better, but good nonetheless. <br /> <br /> If you have seen Caddyshack 1 and are discussing whether to see Caddyshack 2, I say “give” this is an attempt.
