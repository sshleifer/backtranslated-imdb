I really like this movie. This is not very interesting, but it is a celebration of fancy and amazing images! There is no dialogue, only some background sounds and noises. If you are fond of something completely different and original, and enjoying the dark and strange ... then you may like this piece of art. Ik looks like a film made by the very first camera ever made, at a time when strange creatures that look like humans live and fulfill their strange habits. God killed himself with a razor and gave birth to Mother Earth. Mother Earth saturated herself with God's sperm after the act of fellatio and gave birth to the son Flesh on the Bone. What follows inhuman acts of ritual torture, rape and murder for purposes we do not know ... or not?
