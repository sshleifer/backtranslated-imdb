I saw Ray when he first came out. What for? Partly because of the commercials, and secondly, because I just liked Ray Charles’s goddamn music. But not being with him, when his greatest things happened in music and his life, I wanted to learn more about this person’s life. And in this film I did. His addiction to drugs was something I did not know, and the film let us know. <br /> <br /> But the thing is, although it was a decent autobiographical film ... I can’t say it was a “great movie. I saw“ Malcolm X ”and was amazed. The same thing with” What love has to do with this "and" Bird ". The performances of each of these films were outstanding. I was attracted not only by the main characters of these films who did an incredible job, but also by others. It helps me to make a picture. <br /> <br /> I felt that in some parts this film was superficial and heavy for emotional appeal. And yes, I recognized I almost fell asleep in some parts of the film. And the film was too long. And the film missed several "other" important details of Ray Charles’s life that would make the film better. The film became "changeable" for me in certain parts. And the film it seemed to end with a whimper, not a blow — some parts, including the ending, played to me, as if tied to a film about the cable network “Lifetime.” I expect more from the cinema. <br /> <br /> So, where does my ambivalence come from? With the game of Jamie Fox. In general, he did - well. Not "Malcolm X" Denzel Washington or "Tina Turner" by Angela Bassett, but ... well. <br /> <br /> Sorry, guys, but it seemed to me that there were several moments in the film in which I saw Jamie Fox Ray Ray’s interpretation, and in others - due to the wonderful camera angles and lighting - he “looked” like Ray Charles. But I paid attention to ... acting skills. The actor must make you believe that he is the character he plays. Do not make a caricature of the character. I believed that Jamie Foxx was Ray on the screen? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. <br /> <br /> Jamie Fox deserved a Golden Globe? Still would. Does he deserve an Oscar ...? It depends on who he is up against. He has several major competitors there, and he can simply push them out. But then again ... maybe not. If Jamie Fox does not win, I will not get up and say "he was robbed." I do not particularly feel that he was. <br /> <br /> It was a decent movie with decent action and a decent story. The "magnificent" autobiographical film of the late Ray Charles? Not. Somewhere there, I feel, there is a great film about Ray Charles, who is just waiting for him to be shot, and an actor who will take you out of the way.
