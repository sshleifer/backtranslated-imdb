Saw this movie when he entered the Santa Fe Film Festival. Heavy film! The image of a completely dysfunctional family, brought to a different level of extremity, could have depressed me to the extreme, if not for the very funny shows and dialogues along the way that illuminated the general tone of the film. The relatively “sublime” finale gave hope to those who suffered from the initial tragedy. And yet I did not leave the theater, ready to go to a fun party. The film stayed with me for several days. <br /> <br /> Memories of "Ordinary People", but with humor mixed with tragedy. I thought the game was excellent, especially Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hirsch. The way each character coped with this tragedy was sometimes sad, suicidal, but sometimes fun. Smart dialogue and situations.
