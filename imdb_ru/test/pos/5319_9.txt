I remember seeing the trailer for this film, and I knew for sure that I had to watch this movie. It looked like something that would be right in my alley. <br /> <br /> “United States of Leland” is a terrific movie. This is not one that will leave you with a good, pleasant ending, but instead with a sad, empty feeling. And when I say that it will leave you with an “empty” feeling, I do not mean it as a bad thing. I believe that you are called to fill this empty feeling with your thoughts about the characters and the general motives of a person and how they act as parts of society. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling perfectly plays the role of Leland. He is clever, but stoic. I like the way he tells the film with his magazine. The supporting cast is also awesome. Kevin Spacey, as always, is very good, and Don Cheadle is great as a teacher and mentor Leland. <br /> <br /> It was a great story, very clever and thought provoking. I highly recommend it.
