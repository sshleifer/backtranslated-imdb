It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of “cutting” films in the early 1980s, some good films could slip through the cracks. This is an excellent “rare” film by Jeff Lieberman, who insured his cult status with his 1970s memorable films Squirm and Blue Sunshine. <br /> <br /> Five young people head to Oregon's mountains (this film was actually shot on the spot) to make a campsite and check the action on some land that one of them had acquired. Soon they, as expected, would be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh. <br /> <br /> “Shortly before dawn” is noticeably more ambitious, “artistic” and intelligent than some killer films. Lieberman actually fleshes out the characters — well, in any case, two of them are as many as the 90-minute film will allow him. The film has genuine moments of anticipation and tension, and actually abstains from drawing blood, except for one murder right at the beginning. <br /> <br /> There is a throw above the average, including the winner of Oscar George Kennedy, as a forester, who, for obvious reasons, was a little shaky because he was alone in the desert for too long. Jack Lemmon's son Chris, future permanent Brian De Palma Gregg Henry, lead blonde Deborah Benson (very sorry that she did not become a more famous performer, judging by her work here), Ralph Seymour ("Ghoulies"), Mike Kellin ("Sleepaway Camp ") And Jamie Rose (" Chopper Chicks in Zombietown ") complete the cast. <br /> <br /> Some shots are interesting, and the score of early music by Brad Fadel (now the most famous) for his theme “The Terminator” is haunting and atmospheric. <br /> <br /> It’s worth catching for an important plot twist at about one o'clock, albeit about 75 minutes as the heroine and the tree. and the killer is almost comedic; this may actually remind the viewer of the cartoon! One of the cleverest touches is the final dispatch of the killer, which I have never seen in a horror movie before and will probably not see it again. <br /> <br /> I did not give 10 out of 10 because I can not honestly say that I was so scared. However, this is an interesting slasher that deserves to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> “This act means nothing, son. These mountains cannot read. ” <br /> <br /> 9/10
