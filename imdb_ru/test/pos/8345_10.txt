I am a college student, and I bought this film in a used book store because it sounds very funny from the description on the back. Nothing will prepare me for what will be the funniest movie ever made! <br /> <br /> Especially good to see if you are an atheist, like me. Because then you can see how stupid these Christians are. They seem to think that unbelievers love to live in really disgusting, dirty houses and do nothing but drink beer and be angry with their neighbors. This is a ridiculous riot! <br /> <br /> My friends and I watch it every couple of weeks so that we can have fun beyond our wildest imagination! Watch this movie NOW! <br /> <br /> Let's hope Rich Cristiano will make some more such films to entertain us, the pagans!
