I suspect that there are several abbreviations of this paper making the rounds. The copy that I saw was focused on Joe's erotic films and in turn referred to his horrors. There are many films rated "X" in their glory "X", and the legendary "Sniffing" frame EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA (cut off the chest) is given a lot of time to show. <br /> <br /> Interviews with very cute Joe are informative and frank. He is a modest, articulate gentleman and discusses his interest in a shocking audience, why he wanted to mix erotica with horror, and how he could be responsible for the fact that one of his performers had become gay. <br /> <br /> His friendship and Working relationship with Indonesian beauty Laura Gemser are affected, as well as his indifferent attitude towards hardcore shooting. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato personifies an incredible period in continental cinema that has already passed. It is great to see a documentary about him and his beautiful, unique work. <br /> <br /> RIP, Joe.
