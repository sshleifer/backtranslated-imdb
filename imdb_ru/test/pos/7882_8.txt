Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend, and then reveals his secret at a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), the fan who gets drunk there, first takes it as a joke, but then the story is confirmed in the evening news. Instead of calling the police or the like, Joe decides that since the guy killed the hippies, they should be soul mates! He is blackmailing a man to become his friend. At first, the film seemed harsh and condemning, but, as he showed himself, he actually became a rather complex portrait of modern society. Yes, I think it exaggerates a little, but in funny ways that really do not detract from the power of his messages. Susan Sarandon made her debut in this film, and it is shocking when she saw how pretty she was about 23 years old. Worth seeing.
