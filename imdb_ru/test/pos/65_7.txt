I am an avid fan of Julie Andrews, and for the first time I watched it on a DVD version of the Director's edition. I was very surprised that it was rated G. How they got the bedroom scenes, the plot of seduction, the two acts of striptease and the war / shooting / blood in the G. Weird rating. I would rate this as PG-13. <br /> <br /> In addition, I really liked the movie. It was a wonderful demonstration of Andrew’s voice and talent. The game was great. The storyline was a bit weak, leaving gaps that could be filled with a good dialogue. For me, there were too many scenes of “not talking, but just walking” ... I would like to see the relationship between Julie and Rock, so that strong love would be more believable.
