I love, love, love this show. Will you say it is because I am mad in the brain or not. I think this show is very funny and interesting, although sometimes Uncle Bama Vito scares me ... so overall I give this show a great overview. And so I really think that if you like a humorous kind of humor, this show is for you. It's really fun to see the expression on the faces of the joking people, and there are a lot of musical guests who come to Bam's house. Buy it because it swings! You have to buy it. Yes. And Bam's brother is in the CKY group, and they are really good and sometimes come to the show. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is ... please watch the show.
