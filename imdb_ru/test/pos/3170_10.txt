Awesome movie, I just watched it and already want to see it again. I had never heard of Derek Jarman before seeing this film, but now I can't wait to see others. The film opens up a completely new perspective on Shakespeare's “Storm Storm,” I am sure that he would appreciate her for her use of the play on the themes of love, magic, darkness and atmospheric tension. Well, well, maybe the film was a little nudity, which I did not expect, but it did not offend me, but just surprised me and made the film more unpredictable. One spoiler (for those who are nervous: transfer the flashback scene from Sycorax & Caliban and Ariel as their slave, its nice graphics. In general, if you start to find Shakespeare Kenneth Brann's performances, lethargic and monotone, then you need to see this Movie. Fantastic and surreal, it will blow you away, but only if you let it in. Be unbiased - and then let this film work, this is magic for you.
