If you’re looking for a typical war movie, this isn’t true, so don’t worry, pay attention to all action movies that are hungry for carnage and infested with testosterone. Although the film is about Russian characters in World War II, do not expect to see the Nazis, guns, blood, blood, etc. This is not a film about people who cause war or fight. This is a film about ordinary people who are at war, and about the choices they make when dealing with it. <br /> <br /> Acting, cinematography, writing: everything is perfect here. You will surely appreciate it if you are Russian, like me, but even if not, you will probably like it. If you do not speak Russian, look for the DVD version of RUSCICO. There are subtitles in about 14 different languages, but English on this duplication, I would say, is just as good. This, of course, is not as good as the original Russian track (some things are lost in translation), but as good as English subtitles. So check it out, especially if you study the film in any aspect.
