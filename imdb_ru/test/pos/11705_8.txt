This is the first feature film by Australian comedian Mick Molloy. Mick wrote a film with his brother Richard with the help of John Clark, another comedian and actor. Mick and John also have leading roles along with several other Australian actors - Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson and others. The main premise of the film is that slimy Jack Simpson (Mick Molloy) became a member of the Lawn Ball Club for the sole purpose of getting free parking near his work. The club is in a difficult financial situation and calls on Jack to help. John Clark plays the role of the sworn enemy of the clubs - he is trying to capture the club and turn it into Jack "Poker Machine", along with other members of the club, to try to save the club with a lot of funny turns and buyout of Jax. This is much higher than the usual humor of Mick Mollois. It's pretty well written and acted well. Senior Australian actors are great (Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maugan, etc.). The film wriggles rather than goes at a break tempo, but this adds to the charm of the film. Low level of coarse language.
