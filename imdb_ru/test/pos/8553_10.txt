This film ... I saw him 15 years ago and in recent years I could not remember him anymore, his name or something else, he was just about a Romanian country man who Anthony Quinn played beautifully. The impression I received from this drama will be eternal. I finally found the name of the film, I hope I can buy it. And honestly this film is worth 10 Oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was quite young when I first saw the movie. I asked my friends if they had heard about this story, but no one would know that Anthony Quinn is playing the role of a Romanian peasant. I remember when a German officer came and saw Anthony and told him that he was a good "breed", but in fact the German was cheating on him. For a few dollars you will not get rich if you buy the film, but you will get rich if you have it.
