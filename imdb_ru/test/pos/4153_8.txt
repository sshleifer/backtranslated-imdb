“Nuovomondo” was a great experience. Many directors tell their stories largely through dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually. For all that he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that can stand up for himself. Thus, he understands the film as a medium, which basically tells its stories on top of the pictures on the screen. In particular, European cinema is often very dialogue-oriented (and many young American-American directors are strongly influenced by this). Crealese's opposite attitude was precisely what made this film special to me. It is also a very interesting topic, which is wrapped in a rather unusual story and told with humor. Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as head of the Salvatore family, as well as the amazing Charlotte Gainsburg, whom I love to watch in each of her films. There are a lot of great episodes in this movie. Just to choose one: when the ship leaves Italy and people just look quietly. This scene is gorgeous, especially considering the pop cultural references that accompany it (Titanic!).
