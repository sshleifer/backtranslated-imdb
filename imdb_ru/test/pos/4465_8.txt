Having a title that seems more suitable for the fantasy Looney Tunes than terrible hyallo, “Do not torture the duckling” (1972), however, is a class A thriller from the horror maestro Lucio Fulci. In this episode, someone strangled teenagers in a rural village in southern Italy, and, as a rule, this is a lot of suspects. This is Barbara Boucher (Patricia), looking more helpless than you have ever seen her, a rich girl hiding after a drug scandal; Florinda Bolkan (Martiara), a local epileptic voodoo woman; her sorceress, practicing witchcraft; Giuseppe, the local idiot; a priest with a sweet face; his stern mother; and so on. There are several unusually cruel scenery in the film, including the chain knock of one of the main characters in the cemetery (one of the most realistic bloody episodes I have ever seen) and the elegant Duke when the killer is finally uncovered. The outbreaks of violence in the film compensate for the fact that there are no real scares or fears to talk about. Nevertheless, this giallo enchants with its unusual rural background, anxious children's murders, strange characters and the quirky game of Reese Ortolani. The film was beautifully photographed in that I suppose to be Monte Sant'Angelo, near the Adriatic Sea in southern Italy (at least the police forces of this city are grateful for the closing credits). And although the subtitles would make this beautiful DVD even better (American slang is not convincing in this rural Italian setting), Anchor Bay should be thanked for other well-done work. Oh ... this title in the end also makes sense!
