I’m sure there are certain gaps in the movie, but I was so fascinated by this that I didn’t care. The film is played out as a fun, frivolous teenage joke in combination with a Schwarzenegger-type action movie. It is filled with action, filled with excitement and has some humorous moments as well. Sean Astin is fun to watch, and I have not seen Louis Gossett Jr. since I saw Diggstown in theaters. He is a good, underrated actor, and I love watching him on screen. I just wonder what he's doing now. Unfortunately, he can play a major role in many of these direct films. I hope my guess is wrong. Anyway, this is a funny thriller, and I definitely advise you to check it out. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 (out of 10)
