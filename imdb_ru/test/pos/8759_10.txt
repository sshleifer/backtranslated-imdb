I can only agree with many observers that Traffik is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television. I saw Traffik when he was on TV and I just watched it again. I am especially touched by Tim Sawster's haunting original music, and especially by the sound of Dmitry Shostakovich's Chamber Symphony melodies in C minor (music for titles and parts of the film). The music intensifies the despair of the characters chasing their sad fate. The music is very emotional. This composition combines two movements from a symphony, but I recommend listening to the symphony as such.
