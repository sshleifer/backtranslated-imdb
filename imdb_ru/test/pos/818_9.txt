In fact, this film contains all the elements of a great movie about the exploitation of the 70s, except that it was made in the late 80s for the direct video market. <br /> <br /> You have a young couple in love, but the whole world around them is involved in either cracking or gang violence. When a guy goes to prison, the girl is vulnerable to all the criminals who are all in this film, except for the police. First, the dealer hooked her, and then, because he owed drug lord Jim Brown, she became Brownâ€™s property. She is then mostly enslaved in military style in Mallards, named in the title of the film. <br /> <br /> As if this is not enough to watch this film, you also have Anthony Geary playing at first glance a conservative school counselor, but he really is a big dealer. In the scruffy, but fun scene, he requires the heroine of sexual favors, because she has no money for repairs. In an earlier scene, it was established that he is her adviser. That scene and the other where Jim Brown makes her take a hot shower because she stinks, hysterical. Lead actress Cheryl Kay was really good in this film. Tarantino, bring her back. <br /> <br /> I am not surprised that someone mentioned in another review that Tarantino is a big fan of him. There is only the right combination of comedy, action, sex, romance and, of course, the central message to stay away from drugs. Jim Brown's villainous twist here deserves mentioning in the same breath with another great villain In the 80s, Wings Hauser from Vice Squad. Sometimes I think there should be an Oscar film in which such performances could be recognized. At the same time, let's hope that modern directors working directly from the DVD will learn to use this language in humor.
