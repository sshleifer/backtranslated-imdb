I found the Judas Kiss movie excellent. Carla Gugino's performance was extraordinary, perhaps the best in her career. Her facial expressions in many scenes were incredibly loyal to the character, and director Gutierrez made full use of them. All the actors and actresses were very good at their performances. Emma Thomps was amazing as usual. Her acting skills are much higher than what would be required for this character, so she actually strengthens him in the film. <br /> <br /> History, although sometimes too complicated, continues to occupy and point to the end. Very very good. A movie not to be missed. The story is well woven and brilliantly directed. The quality of the film is excellent.
