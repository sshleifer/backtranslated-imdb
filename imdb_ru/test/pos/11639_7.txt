Although it may not be his most ridiculous film, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE acts as one of the most satisfying farcical comedies of Charlie Chase, twenty minutes of clever jokes, beautifully set up physical comedy and funny jokes (played with a title page, of course) all based on a stupid and incredibly improbable premise. We are told from above that this is “the story of household people — a wife with a face that will stop the clock — and her husband with a face that will start it again.” Soon we meet toothy Charlie Musa and his wife Vivien, who has a huge nose. But there is no point in discussing credibility when our plot depends on such a clearly incredible series of interrelated coincidences: that is, firstly, Charlie will correct her bite on the very day his wife will correct her nose, and secondly, each of the spouses will keep them appropriate cosmetic operations secrete from each other, and thirdly, that after colliding with each other in public, Charlie and Vivienne do not recognize each other. Sounds like a stretch, doesn't it? Some segments like more. Obviously, we are in the world of farce here, and we just need to roll with stupid plot twists, so while you can relax and forget about the believability, you will probably like this short one. <br /> <br /> Mighty, like MOOSE, is a leisurely start, as the various complexities of this story are set, but things start to develop when Charlie and Vivien "met" and agreed to meet at a party together at the dentist's house Charlie. Each of them excitedly hurries home, enters separately and at first does not know about the presence of each other. (By the way, Mr. and Mrs. Moose seem to be quite rich, as they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel.) This is followed by a beautifully timed sequence, somewhat reminiscent of Buster Keaton's “Navigator,” in which the husband and wife scatter about the house, even without meeting face to face. And as soon as they arrive at the party, the comedy is really gaining momentum, since Charlie is forced to dance with clumsy little flowers, Gail Henry. Henry, a worthy player of his kind, starring in many short comedies of 1914, is cheerful, as a dance partner who gives her great energy, but little grace. In this sequence, there is also an elegant cinematic touch, when the camera shows us only Charlie, Gale, Vivien’s shoes and Vivien’s dancing partner, but we can precisely follow what happens between the principles while watching their legs. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Charlie and Vivien, at the party they attend they raid, and since then complications have multiplied when they manage to escape from the police dragan and return home. When Charlie realizes that his new wife is trying to go out with another man, he decides for each one her lesson. It is convenient to forget, of course, that he tried to do the same. The last few minutes of this film offer some of Chase’s most amusing physical comedies, topped with a good show for the highlight. MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE leaves the viewer with a warm light and is undoubtedly one of the funniest comedies created by the prolific, sadly underrated Charlie Chase.
