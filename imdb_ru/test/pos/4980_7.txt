Stanvik at his best villain, Robinson, equal to her - as the ruthless earth baron in this rather ordinary western. <br /> <br /> Several good action movies, strong use of location, color and Cinemascope. But why the obvious use of video in a stampede? <br /> <br /> Ford, as always, is reliable, and Foster is as strong as Robinson’s daughter, but this is a villain’s movie. And it's not just Stanfield and Robinson - Brian Keith makes a surprisingly dashing villain in the role of Stanvik's lover, and Richard Jackel is memorable as a cold-blooded killer. <br /> <br /> Look at the cost of the camp.
