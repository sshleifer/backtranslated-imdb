Little Vera is the story of a Russian teenager, his family and her attempts to find meaning and value in a life that is declining more and more. In search of meaning, she falls in love with a more intelligent and rebellious Sergei, whose hatred of her deeply vicious parents is quickly out of control. <br /> <br /> Little Vera is shocking and worried in almost every way. The fatherâ€™s drunkenness, the ability and misunderstanding of the mother, the accidental lies and the wrong direction of the brother, and Vera herself, who forgives them for all their shortcomings, are all shocked and slightly disturbed by observation. However, the harsh honesty of a movie can somehow become even more shocking than the plot or characters. Little Vera, located in cramped spaces and extensive urban decays, was a completely different view of Soviet life than ever before. In fact, Little Vera is a portrait of the collapse of Soviet society, painted in shades of pain, despair and rust. This is a family explosion, opposed to the destruction of a whole social order. <br /> <br /> Although the film is painful, but desperately unsatisfactory, the film itself is definitely worth seeing, if only to understand the feelings and cultures still changing Russia today.
