Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about the Zephyr skateboarding team and their impact on skateboarding. It is also about skateboarding history. It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr team, and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecic, another member of the team. A documentary featuring members of the Zephyr Team and recounted by Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> The documentary tells about the beginning of skateboarding and how it evolved from surfing. It discusses the popularity of skateboarding in the late 60s and 70s, its fall in the 80s and its “rebirth” in the 90s. Skateboarding was introduced in Dogtown, the nickname of the poor part of Santa Monica, California. Zephyr team was founded in Zephyr Surf Shop, which produced the first modern skateboards. The documentary mainly consists of original Zephyr team members telling about the past in the Zephyr team, the competitions they won, as well as their popularity and prestige. The focus is on three specific team members; Peralta, Tony Alva and Jay Adams, three skateboard virtuosos and possibly the three best team members. <br /> <br /> Voices in the documentary usually sounded from the archival footage from Dogtown in the late 60s. 70s. Very rarely, you actually see people interviewed, but when you do, they are displayed in black and white, while the archived footage has been colored. I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was about the past (that is, the Days of Glory of the Zephyr team), and not about the present. The documentary is developing very fast, we often see clips with impressive skateboarding over the modern music of that era (such as Jimi Hendrix, Ice Zeppelin and David Bowie), and interviews are usually quick and accurate. Without knowing anything about skateboarding (that is, without even knowing how to drive one directly on the ground), I was very surprised that I found this documentary so interesting. The reason is that this document was more about the Zephyr Team than about the real sport of skateboarding, so although I couldn't relate to skateboarding, I could relate to the guys on the team. Since this was done by actual team members, it gives him a little more depth and authenticity. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would have to say that this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. This gave me a completely new understanding of not only the Zephyr team, but the whole of skateboarding. For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it should be even more interesting. Seven and a half stars out of ten.
