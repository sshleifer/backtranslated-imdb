The life of three different and distant people intersects with the brutal murder one by one. In the one-hour film, an event is revealed that unites three people only after half of the film is finished. I saw other segments of the Decalogue, but this one struck me as the most rare in the dialogue and, nevertheless, the most exciting in structure. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a law student practicing a false request for protection for a person accused of murder. Obviously, the same argument should be repeated by a person as a full-fledged lawyer, but this is never shown on the screen (at least in the short 1-hour version of Dekalog 5). We are created to imagine that this should be so. The taxi driver, who is a misanthrope, has two aspects of his character: the good side feeds the dirty dog, carefully cleans his taxi, picks up the dirty rags thrown by people who have no civil sense, and remembers his wife when he dies; the bad side scares the little poodles, refuses to give a drunk a lift - probably worried about being pulled out of a taxi - and looks at pretty girls. The repulsive protagonist, who kills without mercy, throws stones from bridges on fast-moving vehicles and pushes strangers into urinals without any provocation, is also a man who can make innocent young girls laugh. Kislovsky’s film and screenplay thus represent the good and bad sides of two of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not about the death penalty, but rather a treatise on murder. The fifth commandment, “Thou shalt not kill,” is studied theologically - (“Even God spared Cain ...”), sociologically — the tenderness of cattle for children and poor abandoned dogs, as well as psychologically (after the consequences of a drunk night with a male friend). which led to the accidental death of his sister, whose picture he carries with him.) What makes ordinary people turn into killers is never fully explained, but the proposals are legion. <br /> <br /> In the world of Kislovsky, there is a model in which events and people are interconnected in a cosmic sense (note the similarity of a clown with a murderer, as it hangs on a mirror in the cabin). Kislovsky and a young idealist lawyer seem to be asking us to take a look at the commandment literally and figuratively - why are we killing? Are people legally killing really bad? Is there some kind of power outside of society (drunken night that led to the life of a girl) that turns us into hideous murderers? <br /> <br /> This will lack the forest for the trees to discuss the two sick killings in the film - both without mercy. The film invites the viewer to think about why God asks us not to kill. <br /> <br /> I understand that the longer full-length version of the film was made by Kislovsky. But even this short 1-hour version is excellent for its grim and rare script, intelligent editing, interesting cinematography and first-class direction, which provides much more than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> This segment anticipates the more useful decalogues 6.7 and 8.
