I remember watching this film in the theater and I liked it. I happened to stumble upon it in the net of fear last month, and I looked at it again, and with age I became better. First of all, for those of you who describe it as the cheese of the 80s, if you objectively compare it with the horror films of the last two decades, it compares quite well, if you compare films with its unique subgenre of horrors, which I would call the fighter / horror like Unlike psychological horror, such as "Shining" or "Exorcist." <br /> <br /> In addition, for its budget, this film really delivers the goods (or, in this case, the bad ones). The film actually has some character development and gives enough of the story of the infamous corpus to create an atmosphere right before the characters step on the front door. The film also has a few funny liners and gives the appropriate mood, which should have a creepy click of horror. If you compare NOD with modern big budget horror films like I Am Legend (Vincent Price's version was much better), this film really stands out. Modern horror films have become almost completely dominate the CGI. Most of them have no plot or character at all and are completely predictable. The special effects dominate these films from start to finish, and the characters are made of 24 KB plastic. If this is the horror cheese of the 80s, I will take more than 95% of current recordings in the genre <br /> <br /> On the final note, when I watched NOD, I remembered the beautiful Jill Terashita and wondered why I didnâ€™t see her in more horror films or not. Jill, by chance reading this, I think you are great and should have been shot in other films. Finally, if you like action movies, you will surely enjoy this movie.
