My film quality guide is if I still think about it after leaving the theater. I still think about it the next day, which does not happen often. <br /> <br /> Landscape (a reasonable assumption for Italy of the 16th century), costumes, lighting, cinematography - everything is fine. This is a beautiful film visually. <br /> <br /> Characters can never rise above the script, which they should repeat, but these actors made the most of their material, which is excellent. This is one of the best plays of Shakespeare, which people will enjoy another 400 years later. All the directors were interesting and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Those who say that this is an anti-Semite must be deaf and blind. In any case, it is an anti-Venetian Catholic of the 16th century. While Shylock plays a person who is controlled and tortured by the harm done to him, it is clear that the society in which he lives is largely to blame. The script also clearly defines his personal responsibility. <br /> <br /> Great movie.
