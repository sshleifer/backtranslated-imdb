I have a 4-year-old daughter, and before this film she was all about Disney princesses, now she watched this film, and all she can talk about is Princess Genevieve and all her sisters. I definitely recommend this film for all young girls. This film is one of the best from the Barbie collection. It shows all the good values ​​that any mother would like to promote there little girls. Thanks to the great songs and dance moves, my daughter gets up and tries to imitate the movements. Additions are also good, one even works on how good your memory is. I would definitely say that this is a must see for both children and adults.
