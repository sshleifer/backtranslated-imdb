I went on this channel many times, mainly because the synopsis sounded as stupid as "Love American Style". However, it turned out well, very well done. Two outstanding features are dialogue and action. Great cast. The premise is actually well executed and there are not so many weak points. I think what impressed me most was how often you thought that the wheels would fall off the cart, and instead, the cart just twists and turns, as it were, and the film continues to fly. There are some good little plots, especially the relationship that develops between the character, played by former Conan's assistant Andy Richter. I also want to note that the music accompanying him was good.
