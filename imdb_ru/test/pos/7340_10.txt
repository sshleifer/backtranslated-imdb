The gymnast (2006) was written and directed by Ned Farr. Dreya Weber portrays Jane Hawkins, a former world-class gymnast who was seriously injured and is now making a living as a certified masseur. <br /> <br /> Promotional material makes you believe that the plot is based on the occasional reunion of Jane with a former teammate. Although this meeting takes place, this storyline is secondary to the main plot, in which Jane, her husband, and a professional dancer named Serena (Addi Yungme) participate. Two women develop an act of the type performed by the Cirque de Soleil. They complement each other - Jane is more experienced in growth and has tremendous upper body strength. Serena is more elegant and artistic, although, obviously, also capable of incredible physical feats. <br /> <br /> The film works because we can understand how Jane will turn to Eddie, who is caring and compassionate, while Jane's husband has taken it for granted for the long years of their marriage. <br /> <br /> Both women are incredibly healthy and athletic, while Dreya has a slim body and well-defined muscles characteristic of gymnasts. They obviously do perform their actions, and the results are so excellent that we can believe that they will indeed be successful in Las Vegas or any other place where they traveled. <br /> <br /> Sexual tension between women. Obviously, the situation becomes even more complicated when the act requires them to kiss in the air. A woman with a careless husband and an attractive female partner create an explosive situation that cannot be solved accurately and accurately. <br /> <br /> Of the six films that we saw in Rochester New York, Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival, we thought this was the best. It will work on DVD and is definitely worth looking for on a large or small screen. NOTE: stay for the credits!
