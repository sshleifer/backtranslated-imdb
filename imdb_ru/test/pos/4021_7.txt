Of the two films, "Slaughter" is better, and although his list of Schindlers in terms of complexity can hardly be called damn funny. All men are goodies or villains, and women are just wasps and emotionally needy, for example, Slaughters Girl. It's also damn funny, and Pro should be the funniest movie pimp of all time, you just can't get enough of these hats, purple costumes, gold chains and jive pato forever. Best of all, when he has a harem around him that says "THE BITCH DOESN'T START." Everything in it is more than life and reminds of Morris Day in Purple Rain. Jim Brown also proves that he is a private member for all chicks, and again he kicks white ass in all directions. The car scene is very unreal that they survive on it unscathed, but hey, this is a movie. Definitely the best film, and it surpasses Shaft (1971). Even the first movie is pretty good.
