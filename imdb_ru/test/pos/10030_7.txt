I myself blame the “Birth of a Nation” - for starting a long tradition of Hollywood parodies of history, an example of which may be a little more than this. Apart from the fact that the names of Custer and his 7th cavalry, “Mad Horse” and “Sioux” and President Grant were spelled correctly, the geography is correct and the fact that Custer and his people were really exterminated by man, the rest just need hyperbole and invention ridiculous limits. Add a few plainly battered scenes of the cleanest exposition (try Caster and his wife to learn about the fake gold rush to justify the invasion of Sioux territory, Custer’s testimony before Congress, which asks for the rights of red Indians and upstairs all of this, Custer bursts into the presidential office , to be asked to return to his post), to be honest, there is still a lot of the same thing, some of these scenes are almost comical in their self-interest ... ... And yet, and yet, this is still a great actor with Flynn, as always strive body, De Havilland, as always, attractive, young Anthony Quinn, beginning as Mad Horse, and director Walsh, as always, with incredible enthusiasm talk about the crowd scenes and, of course, about the stormy action films. Ford taught us in Liberty Valance to believe the legend before the truth. Here I think we are closer to the legend of the legend, but hey, this is just a movie and a stunning, surprisingly pleasant classic Hollywood movie!
