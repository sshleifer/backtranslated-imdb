Hal Hartley was likened to modern William Shakespeare, thanks to the fact that he forces his actors to deliver their lines in the iambic pentameter. He, of course, knows how to assemble the cast, and Martin Donovan is again sensational, while Thomas J. Ryan plays his part with unforgettable intensity. Although the film lasts only 1 hour, the timeframe works fine and keeps the audience in a quick race to the very end. Without a doubt, Hal Hartley is one of the best directors who have come out of America over the past 20 years, with a unique, funny and warming vision.
