Porter Perks (Mr. B. Cribbins), proudly and defiantly working, ultimately conquers the upper middle class family with his luck. The father (Mr. I. Cuthbertson) is imprisoned for treason - for which the punishment was death in those days so as not to forget about it), the mother (very beautiful Miss D. Sheridan) is brave and resourceful, loyal and loving, mostly - the older daughter (Miss J. Agutter) staggers on the threshold of adolescence - offended and confused by the fate of her father. Mr. Perks, like many working people of his time, will have nothing to do with what he considers "charity", and this is a key moment in the film when he finally recognizes that the birthday gifts that the children gave him Do not compromise his principles. Although the beautiful Miss Agutter received all the awards, it is Mr. Cribbins and Miss Sheridan, whose performances dominate the Children of the Railway. They both know how Edwardian society works from different ends of the spectrum, but between them there is a tacit mutual respect and understanding, But basically this is a film about the family. In an era when a mother can kidnap her own daughter and ransom her, to be considered “socially inept” and not incapable of living in a decent society, and when two “people” can beat and kick a child to death without accusing him of murder, The “family” can be viewed as an old-fashioned, elitist, racist and even homophobic concept, but a century ago it was the glue that held society together at all levels. Mr. Cribbins' and Miss Sheridan's family are typical of the era. Strong and loving, clinging from external influences, inalienable units with moral certainty, ridiculed in the 21st century. What may seem like a boring, preaching political treatise, has been turned by Lionel Jeffries into a delightful hymn to hope, faith, optimism and courage. The fact that all these attributes were once considered the norm and are now too often the subject of contempt and cynicism is a reflection of our society, and not Miss Nesbit. This perfectly perfect film can not affect anyone who cares about the condition of a person.
