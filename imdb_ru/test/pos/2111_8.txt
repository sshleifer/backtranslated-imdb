I had the honor of being one of Still's photographers on the set of “Grand Champion” and enjoyed every minute of 42 days while I was working on the film. I have been taking photographs for 25 years and have worked on 16 films, and I cannot remember the time when I liked to do my craft more. It was a pleasure to work with children, and little Emma Roberts has so much energy that she is a real trip. She even took one of my cameras during the rehearsal scene and started shooting. Some of her images were used for public relations. I could have earned more money working on staging with a big budget, but I doubt I would enjoy it and be with so many great actors and great people in West Texas, like me.
