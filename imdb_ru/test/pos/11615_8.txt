Going into this movie, I knew two things about it. I knew that it was a real extreme click, and I knew that it was a bit pretentious. Both appeal to me in their own way, but if you combine them, it can become something truly unique. And it was damn right, without a doubt, unique. As I said above, this is an artsy movie. The way they used some kind of intense sound reminded me a lot of Aronofsky’s film. Visually, I have not seen anything like it. Cinematography and lighting were done very well. The film seriously uses visual effects and sounds better than anything I've seen lately. Especially if you take into account the experience of these young cinematographers (a couple of 20 years), you really need to take off their hat. <br /> <br /> It’s not easy to describe the film or even discuss it. This is not a true story ... Could you say that it revolves around the right and left side of the brain and how they control your life? I think. These are four segments or four ideas embodied in visual and auditory extremes. Some speak and hear, but basically it is not a talking film. <br /> <br /> The first segment is the shortest and rotates the naked body and the eyeball. Try and guess what is going on? The second segment is my favorite. Brother and sister are involved in it (which is a bit like Sarah Silverman, but with big tits). Brother is crazy, and my sister is some kind of whore. I would say that this is the most extreme of all segments and the most well done. The effects of blood in this were great. The third segment revolves around a group of naked people who share it with their mother earth. He is probably considered the weakest of all, but still he is intelligent and well made. The fourth segment is probably the strongest in the film, and I would also say the deepest. As for me, I will have to look at it a couple of times to understand what is actually being said. I know that it solves the problem of Christianity in such a way that it is likely to make your mother cheat or snatch ?? now in my movie collection. This is extreme, cruel, bloody, very sexy and surprisingly damn provoking. The next line I’m going to say was used in almost every review I read for this movie. "This film is not for everyone." Now this is not true. If you're into extreme movies and / or you're just a fan of movies that want to see something else ... check it out. 8 1/2 out of 10
