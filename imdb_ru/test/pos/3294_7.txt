Director: Ty Garnett, Ford Beebe, Cast: Mike Mazurki, Vic Christie, Fritz Ford, Tai Garnett. <br /> <br /> Judging by the number of comments that I see on IMDb, this film seems forgotten. It seems rather ironic to me, because this is one of the first films I remember. My mother took me and my younger brother to watch this film at the Garland Theater in Spokane when it first came out in the mid-1970s, and I still remember it. <br /> <br /> I have memories here, but I believe this move is about a catcher who was accused of a crime he did not commit, and the law pursues him. I believe it will be installed in the 1800s in Alaska. The narrator tells the story of the catcher played by Mike Mazurki. Indeed, this is a very good movie with a great setting. This can be compared to the 1981 film “The Hunt for Death” with Charles Bronson. Two films have a very similar storyline. The main difference between the two is that Death Hunt is an adult movie, while Challenge is a family movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Mazurki and Tai Garnett were quite old when this film was made, and I find it pretty impressive considering that this film was shot on the spot in the wilds of Alaska. It was the last film shot by Tay Garnett before his death, just a few years later. Both of them have been around since the quiet era.
