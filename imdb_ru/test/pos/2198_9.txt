Sweeney Todd, in my opinion, is one of the few "perfect" musicals. Like “My Fair Lady” and “West Side Story,” she has a wonderful, smart account. He offers two leading and several supporting characters of interesting roles. This is an eternal theme, revenge. He has a lot of humor, and he is just as strong when presented simply or on a large scale. <br /> <br /> Sweeney Todd tells a story about a man who is simply offended during the industrial period in England. This shows the inhumanity of a person in relation to a person, as, according to Sweeney's own words, “there are two kinds of people. One remains in its place, and the other - with the foot on the face of the other. ” In an attempt to correct the evil done to him, Mr. Todd puts forth a plan for revenge. With the help of Mrs. Lovett, who owns a meat patty shop under Mr. Todd's hairdresser, they decided "those at the top to serve those at the bottom." <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see the original Broadway version eight times (six with Cariou and Lansbury, the other two with Hearn and Loudon). I saw a revival with Bob Ganton and Beth Fowler, as well as several other live versions. <br /> <br /> Although the technical aspects of this production are absent, at least I think that this filmed production version is the best, Lansbury and Hearn were the two best in these roles and they have a great time playing against each other . <br /> <br /> Very good support work by Ken Jennings and Edmund Lindek. Although Betsy Joslin and Chris Gruenenda, as young lovers, absolutely have no chemistry, and basically they cannot be seen. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
