Bwana Devil is reputedly the first major studio full-length film made entirely in 3D. Perhaps producer Oboler went to Africa to make another film, but when he heard a story about two man-eating lions terrorizing railroad workers, this one decided. This is also a good story, almost like Hemmingway; fear, redemption, the great white hunter and all. This is a story that seems addictive, as if shooting in a new process was too heavy for the film crew. The action scene is tough, almost too staged. But these technical issues seem insignificant in the light of the dramatic conclusion of the film.
