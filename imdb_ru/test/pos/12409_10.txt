In this picture there are no big explosions or expensive chases. Nonetheless, he has really great performances and an exceptional script that puts it in first place on my “indie-necessarily” list. Taylor Nichols and James Remar are awesome together. The young cast surprised me with a really consistent play. Usually indie pictures have weak links, but there are no weak links. Impressive. Go get it.
