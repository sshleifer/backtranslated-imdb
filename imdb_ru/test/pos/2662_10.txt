This film is definitely one of the greatest films in history. This is a story told at a steady pace, told mostly not by words, but by cinematic means of expression. The perfect combination of spectacular special effects and classical music brings to life the creativity of the human imagination in both realistic and poetic form. The story itself at first glance is quite simple. As the name suggests, there is an archetypal journey, the motive of which is repeated thousands of years. This motive has always been used not only to depict travel in space and time and beyond, but also had a rich philosophical meaning. The film is a poetic contemplation of the most exciting eternal questions. This is not just a man's odyssey; this is an odyssey of our kind. The film itself is great, but in my case the impression of it will always be mixed with the impression of the book. I read it at the age of 10, without really thinking about such problems as “what is the relationship between the development of humanity and the development of human morality”. But the impression was strong enough to make me fall in love with the whole genre of science fiction. <br /> <br /> On that day, when I learned that “2001” received only special effects, Oscar and was not even nominated for “Best Picture”, it was the Oscar Day that completely became for me in two words, nothing not meaningful to me.
