"The Last Frontier" was one of the most obscure westerns of Anthony Mann. He was also his only cavalry western (except for one short episode in Winchester 73), although, naturally, he focuses on foreign and internal conflicts, rather than offering a Ford partnership celebration and common ideals. Located not in his beloved highland country, but in the foothills and forests, this is a much more cynical view of the life of the border, in many respects its fort Apache without the need to preserve the legend: this outpost consists of losers, failures, cowards and a strange competent officer, ignored by him bosses, poorly guided, while civil war has priority and all the best that the army can offer. <br /> <br /> Victor Matrei and James Whitmore are free hunters who find civilization creeping on them when they are freed from their skins and pack horses by a local tribe affected by the invasion of cavalry into their territory. Instead of blaming the Indians for their losses, they decide that it is the army’s fault for building the fort, and decide to demand compensation from them, ending up joining their ranks as scouts instead. But despite the best efforts of the kind and competent acting commander Guy Madison, to bring a mature man into the 19th century and force him to wear a uniform, the arrival of the humiliated Colonel Robert Preston, who was seeking revenge for the tribe, drove him out of his own outpost ?? and the clumsy passion of the Mature to the colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft, too much of a clean slate here to do a lot with the role of a woman who is tired of being rescued by men who think they know what is best for her) ?? Soon to drive things into a much darker territory. Soon, some soldiers are planning to kill each other, both sides are trying to push their subordinates to carry out the case for them: it is not surprising that at some point a mature man throws out his uniform, which he so long craved with disgust and cry "I would die for that, but it is nothing but a dirty dirty blue rag! Stallone of his time, Mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with a strange, superb performance here and there when the right part and the right director are selected. This is not one of his best days, despite the fact that he has the most difficult part, perverted, like a simple person? well-meaning, but drunk, cruel, uneducated and with an unconvincing, almost childish lust for life, the role seems to have been designed to fit Bert Lancaster, with some startling similarities to his character in Kentucky. But the Ahab-like Colonel Robert Preston is undoubtedly the best role to decide to revive the career he destroyed in one catastrophic suicidal battle in the civil war, launching another senseless suicide campaign against the tribe, which added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out visual field and crazy with a billboard. In an effort to redeem his career, he moves away from any hope of moral redemption, driven not only by a sense of shame for sympathy for his wife, but also by the promotion of former comrades whom he considers his subordinates. He is beyond salvation, but is there still a recognizable person who is not entirely without a sense of integrity ?? does he genuinely admire Madison’s courage, which makes a futile attempt to ensure that Preston’s orders are subordinate to their superiors ?? Fatal imbalance, although it is. <br /> <br /> Like his character, the film is a bit rough (and boasts one of the most surreal and lively title songs of any Western genre), but this only leads to it more interesting, and there are many typically elegant Mann camera movements. and games in perspective, while borders are convincingly sharp and primitive. Unfortunately, the drawbacks of the early CinemaScope lenses are very noticeable on the Columbia DVD, the image is often dark (2.55: 1 CinemaScope required huge additional lighting, and Scope had a lot of trial and error in the early films) and grainy.
