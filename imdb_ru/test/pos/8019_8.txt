Very clever and exciting thriller, which does not rely on action, but on a situation that is rarely seen today. I would compare this film with The Day of the Jackal, another film about the pursuit of a dangerous international criminal. Acting through the board is superb - Aidan Quinn has a complex double role as the evil terrorist Carlos and as the man of the Navy who emulates him. Donald Sutherland plays an immoral CIA agent who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays an Israeli officer who helps with the plan. This is a very tense and effective film, and it's great, considering how little action it has. The first half of the film is fully prepared as the naval man prepares to pass himself off as Carlos. The second half is an actor holding his breath, an action emanating from the characters and their situations, which makes him even more exciting. A really dense film that should not be overlooked.
