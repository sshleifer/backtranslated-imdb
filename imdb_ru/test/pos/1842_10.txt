Awesome movie! Great combination of talents! I'm a huge fan of David Duchovny, and he is outstanding in this film! I would like to see him in other films of this nature. His talents are definitely underutilized, and he has a lot more to us, except for “Agent Mulder” (although I'm also a big fan of this series), in any case, I want to see more of him. He is an easy cary grant of our generation. If you have not seen this movie, you MUST! A great love story that shows that love never dies ... it is with you forever. Minnie Driver is great, and how can you go wrong with the actors who have Mr. O'Connor, Mr. Loggia and Mr. Belushi? This film won no awards, but deserved it. Great work Bonnie Hunt! ** By the way ... the soundtrack is great too! **
