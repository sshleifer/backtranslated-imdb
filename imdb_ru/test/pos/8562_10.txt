I watched this movie with my family for a long holiday weekend. I am grateful for the fact that someone insisted that we watched him, although I did not pay much attention to the end of the film, when I thought they promised to cut the head, but alas, this did not happen. on the other hand, I watched this film a few years later and loved its liveliness, absurdity, brilliance and just fun. I think the film has a feminine tone. Women are not exploited in it, although I am sure that someone might think that the film is pure exploitation. I think the film plays with the trails of that period. <br /> <br /> I keep thinking that someone has to redo it. And flesh out some of the consequences in the original.
