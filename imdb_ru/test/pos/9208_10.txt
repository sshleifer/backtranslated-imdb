I would like to express my dissatisfaction with NBC Canceling Las Vegas. The show has been top notch for the past 5 years. The addition of Tom Sellex was great. He really brought a nice fresh addition to the show. What does NBC have now? Lame reality and nightly game shows. I mean, let's Save Old and Tired Law and Order? Do not even put Jack McCoy on the role of DA, he can keep the show interesting. Gee, let's keep a quality program like Deal or No Deal or ED? ER should be put on pasture. NBC is worse now than at the time of Pre Seinfeld Cheers. With cable and internet, NBC cannot afford to fail. PLEASE GO BACK! I remember when life on street killing ended the way it was. At least they had the finale of a two-hour series. Hey CBS, are you listening? Please take Vegas, this is a great show.
