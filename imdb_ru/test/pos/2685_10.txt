This is by far the funniest comedic film ever televised. I own all 9 seasons on DVD and literally can watch them again and again. Anyone who does not find this show fun, warming, interesting, and out loud laughing hysterically, is insane! Kevin James is one of the most talented comedians. My boyfriend and I love to go to comedy shows in Boston (where we live) and have seen Kevin James and his brother Gary Valentine (Danny) twice. They are both incredibly talented and simply cleverly plan their work. There are so many comedians who are simply terrible, and Kevin and Gary really show the true side of this comedy. Lia Remini, although the snob and bitch in real life (as I read) is an amazing actress and deserves more respect than any other woman on the sitcom. She really does the show ... with Jerry Stiller! This show is a must see, and you will become addicted in one or two episodes!
