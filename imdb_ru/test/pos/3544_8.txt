I think several top-notch directors sat idle, sipping their absinthe, grappa, aramanhak, or jungle juice one night in the 80s during a Cannes or other film festival, and one of them said, "Hey, guys, let's make a film in which of us creates a segment around world-class aria. "Welllll ... it seemed to work. Obviously, someone was smart enough to select some of the best recordings of selected arias, for example, Bjoreling's Nessun Dorm, so if you were blind and lay on the floor just listening to the DVD , you got more than your money was worth. Not every director succeeded, but did more than he didn't, and the film seems to improve with each viewing over the years. My favorite is a terribly beautiful love duet from Die Todt Statd; young naked Elizabeth Hurley - sweet tooth, but her husband, singing to her, the ghost of his wife, Nevero but beautiful with love music, inferior only to Othello and "Gia nella Notte Densa" Desdemona throughout the operatic repertoire. Maybe a better film, of course, something that could not be, but it's worth it, especially if you're in a hyper-romantic mood.
