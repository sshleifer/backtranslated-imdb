Well ... this film (like the last few Segall films) again goes beyond "knocking them down, kicking them in the groin, shooting them in the face, getting revenge on the bad guys for offending my sister's cousin Seagal time doing it. Geepers, Stephen started thinking and using his money to make films with real ideas in them. Of course .... there are a lot of actions in this film, but there are also some thoughts and a heart. This is not an Oscar film, but it Worth it, if the viewer is not so keen that he has to think longer than a second Worth renting .. or two !!
