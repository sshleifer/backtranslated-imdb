I waited 9 years to watch this movie, simply because I have never seen it on TV. In the end I caught it, and it was worth the wait. This is much better than your over-screaming or past summer garbage, because all this at a fairly fast pace, without delay, crawls around the house to the cheese music scenes. Only bad dubbing fails a little, but in no way scares. What lies below is excessive advertising and crap. The silent witness is low-budget, not advertised and very good.
