I watched it last night at a local station, because I did not want to look at jokes like “American Idol”. Peter Strauss superbly acts as a convict named Rain Murphy, who keeps to himself. He confesses his crime and does not make any bones, that he is not ashamed of it. There are no amenities in his cell that other prisoners have, such as books and pictures. The only time he feels in another zone is running. He does this often and can run a mile in less than four minutes. When a college coach hears about this, he wants to prepare him for a shot at the Olympics. At first, “Rain” does not want to participate in this, but when his best friend is killed, he shows interest. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, period. Strauss is very good (What did you expect, anything less?), And Michael Mann shows a hint of greatness that will come into bloom after years. This film was a bit realistic (perhaps because it was filmed among convicts). It feels like it was a true story. Extra casting is good. There are many famous names such as Brian Dennehy, Roger E. Mosley and Richard Mall. <br /> <br /> My heart sank when a pompous board of directors did not allow him to escape, because he didn’t feel bad for his crime. His last act made me stand up and cheer up. When they took away his dreams, he brought them back. That was when the television films were really good. The Jericho Mile is the jewel of the film. ESPN Classic, PLEASE SHOW THIS FILM !!!
