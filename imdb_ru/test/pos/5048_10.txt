This is a fantastic movie. Hana is a very old guy with a very young heart. He knows how to live his life every day, teaming up with his friend, joking about almost everything, even his own death. Although his wife cannot cope with his “irresponsible” behavior, she also knows that this is why she loves her husband for almost half a century. I would like to talk with this old man, because he knows how to enjoy life and never be afraid of death. He is joyful, witty, naughty and never boring. Vlastimil Brodsky brilliantly played Khan at the age of 79. Every look of his eyes and every movement of his aging muscles speak so much about the character of the audience. This is a film that leaves a big smile on my face, and it makes me look at my life a little closer. Tomorrow I'll go buy myself a mansion and have some fun. If Hana can, then I can. But I think I'll skip the smoking part.
