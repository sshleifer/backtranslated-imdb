Alex North (John Cassavetes) has a relationship problem with his father, and he runs home to join the army, from where he very soon leaves New York and is about to start a new life, taking advantage of the fact that no one knows about his past. He finds work on the waterfront, where he meets Tommy Tyler (Sidney Poitier), a lively young man who is happily married and is a living contrast with the sad and unhappy character of Cassavetes. They very quickly become good friends, and Tommy is doing everything possible to help his friend. The only problem is that their boss at work, hard worker Charles Malik (Jack Warden), is jealous of their friendship, as well as the constant good nature and success of Tommy in his personal life. He really manages to complicate their lives when he learns the truth about Alexâ€™s past. <br /> <br /> Good drama, skilfully staged by director-producer nominated for Oscar by Martin Ritt (The Hud), and featuring wonderful performances by Sydney Poitier and Jack Warden. 7/10
