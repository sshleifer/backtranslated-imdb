In my opinion, the film can be best rated by the number of “best scenes.” Probably in the entire film, at least 80-90 scenes, which someone or another assesses as "best." <br /> <br /> This film is a masterpiece. Period. I know many who called it ahead of time, probably because it was bombed at the box office. However, I think that any generation can relate to this film and laugh well. <br /> <br /> I am personally glad that Mahmoud also participates in the film. His role is not so “meaty,” but it's nice to see that he starred in the funniest Hindi movie.
