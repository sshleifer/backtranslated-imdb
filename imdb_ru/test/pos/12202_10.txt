I thought it was a very good show, and I would like it to continue. There it really became interesting at the end, and I really want to see where it comes from. Sometimes we need to quickly kill a series without giving it a chance. I think that this requires a chance, and I will definitely wait for him. The ocean is one of those places that man knows so little about, and I think that this is a mystery in itself. What awaits us under the waters of the world. They even say that a person can climb out or slip out of the water many thousands of years ago. Is this a new evolution? Are we going to move down the food chain or fight for our position?
