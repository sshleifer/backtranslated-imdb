This film became an acquaintance for many of us with the works of C. Gordon Murray. This is because it was easy to find. It was on every public domain label in the VHS era, and before that in the late evening. iconic classic double knee thigh. Also, HOW do you resist the name? <br /> <br /> For the latecomers, a brief explanation of his merits: the dealer for Florida Wheeler C. Gordon Murray imported Mexican horror films, dubbed them into English, and then made a mint with them on the road. Mexican ORIGINALS were strange enough to begin with; The American borders and horror film conventions were merrily ignored. Gorgeous, great design decorations and lighting were placed next to strange or funny special effects. NOTHING in Hollywood was as close as it was strange. Now mix social Catholic traditions influenced by Catholics, Mexican folklore, and we are no longer in Kansas. <br /> <br /> Add to this the English scripts in which they were overwritten. Most of them were written by Ruban Huberman, who wanted the words to correspond to the movements of the actors' lips on the screen, rather than a literal translation. As a result, American soundtracks tended to run from overworked to right loops. There is even a fan site for Murray, which prints the best, most of all in the top lines of each movie. For the first time, viewers of the film complain about tempo, purple prose, production values ​​and say that it MUST be such, while people laugh with pleasure at things that are usually considered the fatal flaws of the film. All this should be very confusing, if you have no taste for it. <br /> <br /> This film was made in 1957 along with the two previous films in the series; AZTEKA MUMA AND COURSE AZTEKA MUMIYA. All three are now available on 3 AZTEC MUMMY COLLECTION (BCI) disks, and now is the time. It has a version of K Gordon Murray on the one hand, the original Mexican production on the other. The contrast between them is amazing. In many cases, the original Spanish is not so sensible. <br /> <br /> ROBOT / MUMMY begins with a pleasant long memory in which you quickly pick up speed in previous episodes, something like continuity. Window number two, and from there downwards, is logical. You will not even return the Angel or the mention of him in this last episode. Names, places, even pedigrees switch between movies. After a while you start looking for a change in continuity. <br /> <br /> By now, the villain of the Doc Krupp series is completely mad for a pig, almost a drool of dementia, and STILL wants to steal the Aztec badge. Rosita Arenas goes back in time with another pleasant editor of the AZTEC MUMMY floor show, and wanders in the dark in her nightgown to help her find the battle breastplate again. Mom is not as happy with this as the last time. <br /> <br /> The robot does have a production loan. It was made by 'Viana & Co S.A.'. I mention this because it seems that the pens appeared between takes on a slow day when a real costume was walking. Not. <br /> <br /> This was planned. <br /> <br /> Wait until you see the controller from which it works. X box, where were you when Krupp needed you ??? LOOKS robot finally died, but in fact he returned in two more Mexican films ... he had FAN BAZA .. <br /> <br /> In general, the funny quirky end of a series of three films, Relax and enjoy.
