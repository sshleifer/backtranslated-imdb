Irene Jacob fascinates Krzysztof Keslowsky in this last part of the trilogy, and the story is infinitely satisfying because she manages to link all three films together. I am delighted with the number of talents needed to create one of these stories, not to mention all three. It seems that everything is so exactly the same, all the elements of film production are so eloquently implemented, and the end result is much more than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in character and is included in any list of great cinematic achievements. Just brilliant!
