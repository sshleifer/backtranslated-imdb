This television adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel was made with such love that I could not find the words to appreciate it. Since "Tipping the Velvet" (also strongly recommended), I have not seen such performances from leading actresses, this time from Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy. They acted with their soul, and this is what gets into the audience! Supporting actors were also well chosen, they made up a great ensemble. <br /> <br /> For those who think that the story of a lesbian relationship is not, this is only one part. Another major theme is the betrayal of the person you love. And the plot has a few more amazing twists. So the film should be interesting for ordinary people or guys like me.
