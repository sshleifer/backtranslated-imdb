I recently saw the Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where he attracted a huge crowd and a rather intense discussion. I really admired the story and the visual approach. The action is frightening, and the mood of loneliness that the film project is amazing. There is a lot of beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three losers. Not only in the desert, but also in the city. My best scene was after the boy found his friends in the apartment, and then rode the skateboard through all the wonderful lights of the city. You really love this guy. I had never heard of actors before, but I really liked everything. I think they did an amazing job on the road to self-discovery. All in all, this is an amazingly cool and intense movie. I still carry in myself many images.
