I just started watching the show in July. I found this by mistake, I was surfing the channel during the holidays. This is a great show, I just want it not to be so late at night. It's at 12:30. As a working person it is difficult to watch all the time. <br /> <br /> I read some comments. I did not agree that I did not grow up in the 60s and did not believe that this could happen. <br /> <br /> I grew up in the 60s. I am a Latino, and I had a “white” guy, plus we had black friends in high school. I believe that people get along with each other because of their interests and personalities, and this has nothing to do with being a certain race or skin color. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the show to go on DVD, so I can buy it. So, I see it from the very beginning.
