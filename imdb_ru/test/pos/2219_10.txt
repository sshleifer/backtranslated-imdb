This film explores if it does not create a completely new genre with perfect imperfection - the fun, the truth, the fun, the talent and the circumstances that make for MAGIC. <br /> <br /> From creative musical performances to comedy cuffs, in which the actors are involved at their best, if I had not known this better, I would have thought that there was a complicated scenario. <br /> What you get: a strong wind meets conversations with God, meets something so fresh, new and delightful that it becomes its own essence. <br /> <br /> Peters and Fallen give star performances and immediately call you. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal. there are no small details here ....... only small actors, and everyone who participates here needs to be patted on the back, taken out for dinner and examined at Oscar. <br /> <br /> Well done!
