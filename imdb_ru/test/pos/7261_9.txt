I saw a preview everywhere, before I decided to watch it. And what do you know, I really liked it! It has a new twist of 18th century England. Although the music on the dance scene was clearly modernized, as well as the colors of Liv Tyler's clothes (although she is good!), She is perfect. <br /> <br /> If you just want to have a good time, you should check it out. Very different from other detailed films of the 18th century.
