We just saw this film in Austin, Texas, at Alamo South Lamar yesterday afternoon. It made me laugh many times! The scene of Albert Einstein’s thoughts about humanity hit me again and again, and I couldn’t stop laughing. It is a pity that it is not in many theaters, I know a lot of friends who die to see this movie! "Welcome to Costco, I love you." ... great job for everyone involved! Also, if you see this, remember to stay until the end of the credits! I'm going to take my family to see it again this weekend for sure! If you are a fan of OFFICE SPACE and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, then you need to watch this movie. This is a classic, and no one knows what happened! So if you are in the mood to see something funny this weekend, be sure to check it out.
