This Norwegian film begins with a man jumping over the subway, apparently committing suicide. But the next scene shows his arrival in a lonely bus to the desert. He meets a man and goes to a mysterious city, where he begins working in a modern aseptic office as an accountant. Employees seem to be good, if you guard them, he soon meets a girlfriend, but the city seems completely strange, because the food has no taste, alcohol does not make you drunk, and there are no children around. Is it a dream or is it in heaven or in hell? Although films sometimes look like an extended episode of the Twilight Zone (even after ninety minutes the film seems too long), this is quite provocative. The best scenes are those in which exaggeration is minimal, as, for example, when people engage in trivial conversations about interior design and bounce off discussion of deeper issues. I always thought that in developed capitalist societies there is something inhuman in how they try to suppress the basic impulses of human nature. And this film is the best when it destructively criticizes this lifestyle. Unfortunately, the film ends very long, and the director does not seem to know how to finish it, but most of the work time is very worth seeing.
