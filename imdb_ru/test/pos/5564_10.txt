Other reviewers do not know why the Farscape show was (temporarily) stopped. This has nothing to do with the quality of wiggle shows. In fact, the exact opposite is true. They are getting better and better! :) I saw every episode, and when you just look at them, to really thrill, how cool they become, when they move back and forth, and the stories about the wormhole and Aeryn are really very interesting and give them a GREAT vibration, and not less . It used to be chaotic, slow and rather aimless. They spent the first two seasons running from this type of enemy, but in the second two they were actually trying to do something :) In addition, I had never seen such a funny mix of sex girls and sci-fi relationships. The blue girl, Zahn, was cool, but not sexy. They literally went so far that the girls ran in leather corsets and high heels, blowing up the newcomers - now tell me, what could be cooler than that ??? :)) <br /> <br /> The real reason Farscape went away for a while is that it was too expensive - and this is WELL for the fans, because the show, which was watched from beginning to end, is really it looks like a 60-hour epic film with all the cinematic plots of the blockbuster (well, well, they often use similar sets, but CG is great, and girls are sexxxy). <br /> <br /> Bla-bla - the real reason is because the TV show is about profits. This is BUSINESS, and the channel Sci Fi, or someone else, did not get as much feedback from this expensive Farscape show as they could with junk like Stargate. Lex was really cool, until they got rid of the hot German girl and replaced her with this strange greasy oddity. <br /> <br /> In any case, yes, remember this: Farscape kept getting better and better until everything became a small, real film every week. Then the networks decided that “hey, people will watch any old piece of wood that we broadcast, as long as this is the only science fiction thing at this hour, so why do we spend all this money on Farscape, let's shove low-end cheese “Stargate” interrupts people and calls it “hit series” because it’s like all we play every damn night LOL :)) <br /> <br /> That's how it happens. I must also tell you that Claudia Black is a really cool actress. After she got a facelift (pulled up her baggy eyes), she looked really cool - one of those dynamic types like Judy Davis, and sometimes hot, sometimes ugly - like a rollercoaster ride. I would compare Claudia Black with Lucy Lawless in style and content - and it's VERY fun to watch - not only Crichton :) And yes, you can say that the pregnancy was cheesy, but how many science fiction shows have a LOVELY and DEEP romantic plot that really goes somewhere and progresses ?? It was a really cool romantic story - the actors on the show are great. This is really a shame, the show is still in a suspended state, but I hope that it will soon return in new episodes, as well as in films, because I will definitely buy them! :-D
