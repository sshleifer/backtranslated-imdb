For fans of Chris Farley, this is probably his best film. David Spade plays the perfect cynical, sarcastic yin to Yang Farby "Baby Huey". Farley reaches the comic genius blows in his monologues, such as the bit "Suppose you are on the road with your family ...", "Jo-Jo, a circus idiot boy with a rather new pet" (his possible sale) "speech, or Sale of the brake pad "Fairy with the smell of glue" sale. Juicy moments in the film contrast sharply with the machinations of Farley and Spade. Even after many views, it is still fun to see Farley pouring all that he had into the role. Richard what happens to me?!?! "
