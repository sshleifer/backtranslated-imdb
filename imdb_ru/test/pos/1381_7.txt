The rating of "7" is not necessarily slanderous - this film was shot with a small budget, but it coped well with its limitations. <br /> <br /> The usual plot on the boiler - the ship with the prisoner destroyed in space, people and prisoners run away in pods, land on an unknown planet, where their presence awakens something. Mayhem appears, consumed a lot of ammunition. <br /> <br /> The special effects were spare and done properly, emphasizing future technology with holographic displays and controls instead of relying on bulky, cheap-looking plastic coasters. In addition, the course of history has changed, not allowing the viewer to become bored when they begin to take things apart. <br /> <br /> I think this is an easy Saturday movie. You can get up and hit the refrigerator without stopping it, and it will still be pleasant. Moreover, your girlfriend can talk through it without hurting your pleasure - and she will be happy: in the end, she spoke to you! This is a movie type. <br /> <br /> In any case, there are several holes in the real storyline after they hit the planet, but, hey, this is a guns fighter from Guns 'n' Ammo. Cohesive storylines are not necessarily required if you have beer and chips at your fingertips. So do not get yourself the brains because of the final.
