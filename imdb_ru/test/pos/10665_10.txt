Battleship Potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece. The direction of Eisenstein <br /> <br /> is really a sight to see. The film tells about the ship of disgruntled sailors, <br /> <br />, who are tired of being mistreated by their senior officers. <br /> <br /> In the end, the sailors finally got enough of the abuse and they sent the officer package <br /> <br />. During this period, there were not enough film stocks in the Soviet Union <br /> <br />. The government wanted to convey its message to the people, so they founded the National Film Company, and one of the members <br /> <br /> was Sergei Eisenstein. The films were shot with a minimum budget <br /> <br />, and the lack of film made Eisenstein be careful <br /> <br /> and selectively approached the footage. In the end, Eisenstein had to <br /> <br /> re-use the footage to make a full-length picture. <br /> <br /> The most famous of the action scenes in this film is a lot /> <br /> they talked about the carnage on the steps. This scene was tampered with in Bananas, <br /> <br />, and most recently in Bryan de Palma's The Untouchables. If you want to learn <br /> <br /> to make films, I strongly advise you to watch the Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most important things. <br /> <br /> A +
