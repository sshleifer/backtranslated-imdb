My friend took me to the show of this film in Hollywood, and it was awesome! This film noir with a stunning acting, great script, great music, everything was very well done and entertaining. I donâ€™t know if it will be released in cinemas, but it will be a great date movie or a fun movie to rent if you watch it on Blockbuster. This is the film that I love, with a small budget, but with great style and imagination. I hope that Alexandra Holden will get more important roles, like hers in this, she is fantastic.
