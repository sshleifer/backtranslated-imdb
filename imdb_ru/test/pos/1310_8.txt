I had never heard of Mishima before watching this film, and although some of his parts are a bit tedious, I still feel the urge to watch it when it repeats on the box. At the beginning of the film, we are told about a famous Japanese writer who behaves like a madman and publicly performs seppuku. As the movie progresses, you gently introduce yourself into the perverse logic of Mishima's mind. The stages of his life are presented in four chapters. Each chapter is a mixture of two contrasting narratives, the first one continues the story with scenes from the life of Mishima and is presented in black and white. The second narration is an adaptation of scenes from the novel, which are staged as a play and shot in bright colors. Each chapter has a new novel. Between each chapter, the narrative returns to the present, as Mishima approaches her possible ritual suicide. This means that drama and tension remain until the end. <br /> <br /> I suspect that many will find this film boring, pretentious and art-house. I respect it, this is not a movie for people who want action and a strong storyline. If, on the other hand, you are one of those who enjoy the opportunity to penetrate the consciousness of a strange person, watching the story of his life, told in a collage of beautiful pictures put on music by Philip Glass, you will like it. I like it. <br /> <br />
