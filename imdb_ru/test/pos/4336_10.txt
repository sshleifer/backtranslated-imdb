Although I agree that there is no real essence in this film and should not be taken seriously, it is primarily addressed to fans of the series who are looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Quercy) goes out again (having received a license to kill by the police chief) and moves into his friends' apartment (which you already guessed), was killed by a street gang that took control of a neighborhood that looks like it takes). It's funny that people who communicate with Bronson are in the habit of being killed. Bronson systematically kills them one by one, as the people in the neighborhood are used against him. There is some dynamic between Bronson and Freaker, who heads the street gang, you can say that they both enjoy their work. Once in the film after they quarrel in the city prison, Freiker says: "I am going to kill the little old woman just for you, catch it at 6:00 am." Giggler, a wallet thief who laughs when he commits his crimes, is also a pleasure to watch. The film was shot in 1985, and most people probably could identify with the stereotypical urban gangs that are filmed in the film. It's nice to watch Bronson (Paul Quercy) rid the streets of these thugs. Watch for the emergence of Wildey Magnum, serious equipment that Bronson owns. I also really liked the soundtrack for this film.
