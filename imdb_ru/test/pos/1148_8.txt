<br /> <br /> An ordinary adventure film that took a serious story and "hid it." The effect of watering, made especially in relation to the average scenario, snatched the place of this film as a real classic. Why compose such a wonderful storyline? Probably because it deals with “sensitive” colonial themes, and the producers do not want to create a political stir, just a quick profit, thanks. The directing, the cinematography and the soundtrack and acting was good. average. Connery's charm filled up his wrong Arabic accent, and all the scenes with President T. Roosevelt were masterpieces. The costumes / decorations here were very good. It is a pity that we have not received a more serious historical drama, since this is what history requires. Only for big fans of leading actors or fans of exotic films Romance / Adventure Holywood .....
