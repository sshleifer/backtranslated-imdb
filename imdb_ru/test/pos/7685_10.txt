I was about 20 years old, I was just finishing college when this film appeared. To see that this event had a great influence, not only because of the high quality of the film (as evidenced by its numerous awards), but also because of its place in the historical context of 1959. Due to social progress since then, it is almost impossible to understand that my college began accepting (carefully selected) black students in 1953. The main, high-budget extravaganza with an almost completely black cast was a clear novelty in 1959. <br /> <br /> The film was given a luxurious presentation of a roadshow (reserved space) only in the best cinemas, complete with a souvenir program detailing generous care for lighting and color, multi-channel stereo sound, etc. The knowledge was in the film. Gershwin's music, magnificently performed, and the absolute universality of the story were incredibly touched. <br /> <br /> Recently, I managed to get a faded copy of a two-hour cutting of the film, and repeated views confirmed my opinion. Time has made what seemed to be the sex scenes in 1959 rather dull, but the quality of the music has not diminished. Sammy Davies and Pearl Bailey are skilled in their images. What a crime that young black artists today cannot see these performers at the height of their careers!
