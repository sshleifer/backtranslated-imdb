Although for most of us, sexuality is a variable quality, I cannot remember the film that did for me what this film does. It brought me to a terribly familiar realm of longing and desire. All this obsessive attraction, uncertainty in the outcome, palpable fear and anxiety, so accompanying this state of arousal, were brought to a feverish state by this click. So French and what I consider brave! Regardless of your orientation, I think that the danger of chasing your desire is completely revealed and concentrated here ... much more, say, than with "Dice with closed eyes."
