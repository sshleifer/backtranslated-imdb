This is a charming film, if not more. The main character, Fanda, is an old man who refuses to be among the living dead he surrounds. He and his accomplice walk, joke and make trouble all over the city. Meanwhile, his family went wild about what to do with it. From there you can see Fanda's relationship with his wife, best friend and son. This finally leads to one of the best movie endings I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The characters of this film are rich and deep. They develop well in the course of the film. The film has a wide range of moods. He goes from light and funny to dark and dark. Any slow roles for you in this film will eventually be filled. <br /> <br /> Autumn Spring carries the same message as many other European films - do not forget about the little pleasures in life. If you liked Amelie, Eighth Day or Life is Beautiful (by the way, all the wonderful movies), you will surely like this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
