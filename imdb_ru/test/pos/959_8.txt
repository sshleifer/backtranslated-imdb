Well, it may be a children's film ... maybe, but I will not let my children of 9 watch it! So the one who says that this is a children's film, hmm?!, This is a teenage film, I agree .., but returning to the film, itâ€™s about a boy who knows how to lie very well ... so good that at the end no one will know the truth or a lie. Anyway, this is a good movie to see a good game on the screen, I vote 8 per game on the screen and a story ... I think they, the authors, learn a little lesson from this ... "the truth is never overestimated."
