It was the first publicly available film by Charlie Chaplin. Yes, in his previous film "MODERN TIME" a little sound and speech were inserted, but in fact it was a silent film. Thus, only in 1940, the public heard Chaplin’s speech on film. <br /> <br /> The film is incredibly famous and has a stellar reputation. While I was enjoying the film, I was not so impressed with this as Chaplin's other full-length films from the mid-20s and 30s. This is because I was really annoyed by Chaplin’s obsession when he played Adenoid Hinkel - especially when he was giving his speeches. The silly pseudo-dialogue just seemed like a smaller comedian (for example, Three Puppets). Besides, it's hard for me to play funny Hitler. <br /> <br /> However, when Chaplin played a Jewish hairdresser, he was not particularly funny (he really wasn't going to be a funny character), but he was a terrific voice for intelligence and decency. This film should be remembered not as a comedy (especially since it is not very good there), but for an excellent game and humanity. The final speech of the barber (imitating Hinkel) is brilliant and almost tears in my eyes. Watch the movie for this reason only.
