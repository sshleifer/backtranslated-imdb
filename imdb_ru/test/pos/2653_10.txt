In fact, there is no way to compare this film with any other film, because no one has ever done anything like that and never will. And it really must be seen in the theater in order to be fully appreciated. At least he deserves to be seen with a great sound system. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on its opening day in 1968, when I was in high school. I went because I love science fiction and wanted to watch a “space” film. Remember that this film was made before the first landing on the moon. <br /> <br /> There we sat, waiting for him to start. But, SURPRISE! There was no cartoon or approaching sights. The owner of the theater in the Cooper Theater for some reason decided to play the “Star Banner” with lighted lights, so we all stood, never made it to the cinema before or since, and then sat down again when it was all over. Then the theater became completely dark, and a strange overture began with a barely visible blank screen. <br /> <br /> The overture ended, and my chair began to vibrate when the blue screen with the MGM lion appeared, along with the first deep bass notes, and then my feelings were stunned, for the first time in my life I heard “Also Sprah Zarathustra” . The trip has just begun. <br /> <br /> (I strongly recommend that you watch this debut, this film in the DARK hall with the subwoofer raised as high as possible to get the effect that I felt in this theater.) Of course, it took quite a long time before we were in space, and the film that followed was something other than a science fiction film. TRAVEL came (a good thing, these days, much underestimated and unused), and we all looked at each other in surprise, caught our breath, and then the trip resumed, wilder than before. <br /> <br /> I saw it 7 more times over the next year, always in a real full-size theater, as all theaters were up to multiplexes. Perhaps I was once "tall", but I did not go to him again and again, because I "stumbled." I went because I knew that I was seeing a work of art. It was so damn beautiful; a sound that you could feel in your bones, accompanied by a terrifying silence; attractions unimaginable and unimaginable; love for HAL turns to horror. And, of course, did the WTF really try to get Kubrick to me? After years, years and many more views, I also understand this, I think, as always. Read other people's comments, if you are looking for someone who could explain it to you, or searching the Internet, you will find “explanations”, it is not my goal to write these comments. <br /> <br /> What I hope to encourage you to watch it patiently, enjoy its beauty as you like to watch the sunset, listening to the most beautiful music you know (for example, Gayne Ballet Suite or Blue Danube); Enjoy, as if you were a wonderful meal, sip like good wine; look for and listen to the clues and hidden characters that are there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick wanted to share with you some things that he found wonderful, and wanted you to think about where you are. man, where are you from and where are you going. <br /> <br /> If this is too much work for your brain, and you cannot see, hear and reflect on the beauty and mystery of the Kubrick film, then forgive my dullness, but your life is about as significant as the life of a tapir or monkey to monolith. If you want a mindless escape, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, riddles and sensuality, and you can be unbiased, this film will add something to your life.
