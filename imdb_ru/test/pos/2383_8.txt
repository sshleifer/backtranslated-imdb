Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico were no doubt the weakest of Scooby Doo’s modern animation features. Loch Ness monster - a significant improvement. <br /> <br /> This time, the gang went to Scotland to see the Highland games and visit Blake Castle, the ancestral home of Daphne. And don't you know that the castle is located in the “quaint” fishing village of Dramnadrochit, on the shores of Loch Ness. <br /> <br /> During their stay, they meet several interesting people. First, Fiona Pembroke, a scientist who spent all her money trying to find the Loch Ness monster. <br /> <br /> Sir Ian Locksley, the boss of the Museum of National Heritage of Scotland, he is a staunch non-believer Nessie. <br /> <br /> Haggarts, own cozy hotel on the lake. Sons - a pair of local jokers, always in trouble. <br /> <br /> Del Chilman, a wild paranoid hippie dude who is convinced that the monster will stop at nothing when he finds it. <Br /> <br /> And finally, Duncan McGubbin, the master dock who saw Nessie too many times to count. <br /> <br /> Most of these characters are stereotypes, which is a bit annoying because it teaches young people. load of shit and the wrong impression. However, if you can protect yourself from this, you will be fine. Being from Scotland, I can't help but shudder at the terribly imitated Scottish accents. Fact: we don't sound like that. <br /> <br /> Soon Nessie appears, looking more demonic than “usual”, and this leads to chaos. Looks like the gang has another mystery. This is followed by the usual chase scenes, clues and stupid masks of Shaggy. There is a lot of laughter. The animation is gorgeous, with some atmospheric scenes and locations. And the plot is much better than that of Monster of Mexico. <br /> <br /> This time the only bad thing is music. I miss the goals of Louis Febra, and the songs here are pretty rotten too. Where are the Hex Girls when you need them? <br /> <br /> Region 2 DVD - crystal clear, anamorphic 1.78: 1 widescreen format (region 1 - no) with Dolby 5.0 sound. Some nice additions are included. Definitely worth getting.
