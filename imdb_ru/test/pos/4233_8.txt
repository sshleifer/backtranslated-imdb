Chuckie is back, but this time he's not scary (many) - but he is funny! <br /> <br /> When Chucky returns to life (in the doll, of course) from his old girlfriend from the trailer, Tiffany, he quickly kills her and turns her into a doll too. Tiffany and Chucky are now engaged in two high school graduates - eekkk !! <br /> <br /> Do not miss this movie - it is very fun. Scary, funny, strange, stupid and stupid - all in one! <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10.
