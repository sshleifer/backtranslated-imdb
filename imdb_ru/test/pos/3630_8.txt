Duke - a very stupid movie - a dog becomes a duke! But this is a very funny movie. It has some of the banal pranks many children's films have, but (fortunately!) No bodily function jokes, as many films about animals feel obligated to have! Mostly dogs are dogs and people. well people "Good guys" are nice and attractive. The "bad guys" are ridiculous, and, of course, a pun of many jokes. But in this film there is something worthy, because, despite the fact that it is stupid, it is not suitable for any cheap laugh, like "Home Alone" and others. <br /> <br /> Crockett, Simon and Kopper play well in Black and Tan Hunthound Hubert, who becomes Duke after his beloved owner, the real Duke, dies. For the most part, they simply behave like dogs, without “talking” or human emotions and relationships. However, they make stereotyped poodles, and Hubert falls in love with her only because she is a poodle. Come on! These are dogs - they have a different view of beauty !!! <br /> <br /> Overall, charming, fun and enjoyable.
