I got this film from my BBC "Jane Austen Collection" (5 DVDs with old BBC adaptations) and I didn't like it at first. It is completely different from the others and not in it, or, as it seemed to me, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austin films: funny common sense. Particularly frustrating nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards, apparently, stitches fingers. <br /> <br /> I still don’t like to watch the sewing of my fingers, but I really like to hear Mrs. R. dreamily speak while she sews: “My only friend ... tore up my dress." This film is now my favorite Austin. I watched it 7 or 8 times. The game, in my opinion, is incredible. The way I notice a good game is when I look up from what I do (I sew, but do not squeeze my fingers, I hope, or do not care, or something else) to see how the character says his lines. This is the turn of expression, the composition of the pose that makes words come to life - this is what makes a good game, as far as I can tell. <br /> <br /> Well, I watch almost every part of Northanger Abbey, because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma. Peter Firth is amazing, like Mr. Tilney, the perfect combination of a baty foop and a real male hero - until the end you are not sure whether he wants Catherine money or not. I like his touch (Welsh?) Accent. Mr. and Mrs. Richards are adorable: the combination of their behavior — especially Mr. Richards ’high voice, contrasting his wit and wisdom — makes them so real. General Tilney, like a cruel father who can be a murderer, is also charming. And Captain Tilney, the grinning rake, who so clearly enjoys himself ... and my sister and brother, who are making money, whose names I can't remember right now - they are both so beautiful, both smart and smart. <br /> <br /> Another reason I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all the adaptations of Jane Austen. I know that this was one of the weaknesses of Austin (well, as I understand it): even if all her novels are love stories, it’s hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end. And if they really are not in love, then what's the point? All the other adaptations I have seen (except for early Olivier / Garson) have cute kisses with cold fish in the end, if they kiss at all. I don't like sex at all in movies, but in the end I really need to kiss you from my heart. And the final kiss in Nortanger is a dull one. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, an unnecessary approach to costumes, music and lighting works very well. And the script is very clever - how we learn about the Gothic novel, life in Bata, Katie’s usual upbringing in the country, etc., Very well done, as is usually done in BBC productions. Also, I like the part when the little black page makes the wheels. And Marcioness, I think, was quite a suitable and very smart explanatory device. <br /> <br /> Some people argued that this version was the opposite of what Jane Austen had intended to do at Northanger Abbey — she wanted to make the Gothic novel Fun, not its propaganda. But I don’t think she wanted to put the “Udolfo Secrets”, etc. Down. She simply stressed the need to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this moment is made when Mr. Tilney blames Catherine in his mother's room. In addition, General Tilney was a villain, albeit prosaic. This moment had to be made, of course.
