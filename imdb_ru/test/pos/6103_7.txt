(There are spoilers) Once on a rainy day, driving along a deserted country road, Joanna Kndall, Margaret Colin, is briefly distracted and escapes from a little girl who rides a bicycle on the side of the road. Doing everything possible to make the injured child feel comfortable, Joanna turns for help to the local service station. Before she can give her name, Joan hangs up to go back to the girl and see if she is alright; it is then that Joanna’s nightmare begins. <br /> <br /> Heartbreaking drama that can affect any of us when you try to do the right thing, but influenced by the words and feelings of the people around you. Returning to the scene, Joanna sees that the police cordoned off him. Before she has time to tell them about what happened, and about her participation in this, Joanna begins to think about how to give up. <br /> <br /> What would have been a tragic accident at the beginning is successful. Running with Joanna behind the bars if she is caught. Even worse, she has to live with herself in that she saw almost every day in the family of the little girl she ran, Kelly Corey, Dallas Deremer, who studies at the same school as her two daughters Mindy and Holly, Gretchen Esau and Cyrus Posey. Joanna's life begins to crumble when she tries to hide the truth from her friends and family, not to mention the Eton police, about what she was connected with in the accident of little Kelly. <br /> <br /> You can easily see how the words of her friends and neighbors, as well as her husband Doug, Drew Fillbury, influenced Joanna. It was because of these words that Joanna could not bring herself to admit what she was doing not only for her own care, but also for her two daughters and her husband. Feeling that they will be avoided by people whom they have known both friends and neighbors for many years. <br /> <br /> Joanna, who is on the verge of insanity, is trying to get her friend Nancy Grayson, Sherry Hursey, to be involved in the accidental Kelly accident, trying to land her bastard, whom she lost in Joanna’s house, at the scene. Then she realizes what she is doing, and suddenly stops, not letting her aggravate an already bad situation, not wanting Kelly to have an accident, as well as Nancy’s innocent freedom and reputation on her conscience. <br /> <br /> Margaret Colin shows an amazing game when Joanna Kendall feels guilty and you can really feel that she sees how she is eaten inside and does not know what to do. The desire to first surrender to the police because of a number of failures makes Joanna hide from justice. When she did, Joanna became the most hated and despised man in Eton. <br /> <br /> Without being herself, Joanna’s husband, when she’s free, begins to feel that she has either returned to smoking, or even started a love affair. Never in a million years, Doug would not have thought that Joanna was the man who shot down little Kelly and left her to die on this road soaked in rain! His expression with a shaking mouth, when he found out the truth, said it all. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes of the film made you understand a lot what Joanna went through, rather than downplay the suffering of the wounded Kelly Corey and her parents, and how she now has to deal with the music for what she did, and live with her for the rest of your life.
