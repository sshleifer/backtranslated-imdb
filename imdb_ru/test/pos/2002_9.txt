You have to see it to believe it. Filmed in Hollywood in the middle of the sloppy, everything goes to the 70s, this cheap movie should really fill the theaters in the city center. Again, I bet he had a weekly run. Actually, it's pretty fun. The action is terrible, the direction does not exist, but the hair, clothes, rotten music to the disco and the general untidiness of the story are stunning. Sloppy, very sloppy. Highly recommended (if you can find it)
