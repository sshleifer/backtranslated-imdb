There are a few select cartoons where animals or something “non-human” portrays people, and I think this film is one of them. In addition to several points of the plot and characters - this film could be changed with all people, and not mainly with animals. Although - it is good that someone did not - I feel that cats are very good in this film depicting people! :-) <br /> <br /> This film is also about quite a few adult issues, which is rather strange for a Disney movie. He mentions alcohol *, shows that the dog teaches another dog how to attack "jumping" people, and shows a cat named (Abraham Delas Giuseppe Kazi Thomas) O'Malley, who imagines the cat, in an amazingly human and adult way. br /> <br /> Like a cartoon film - or just a movie as a whole, I feel that it’s pretty good quality - the storyline and characters are especially good. The action of the film (in general) takes place in France, and you will get acquainted with the family of cats - the mother of the duchess and her kittens Maria, Toulouse and Berlioz. You also meet a kind (rich) old woman who adores cats, butler Edgar and an old man (who CLEARLY lost his balls) named George. A kind old woman discusses his will with George, and Edgar overhears what he gets from the will he gets after the cats get it. He is INCREDICATELY indignant at this - and means an evil scheme ... <br /> <br /> A very cute film for any age - enjoy “Aristocats”! <br /> <br /> * Not including "Vasily the Great Mouse Detective" and possibly a few others that I cannot think of at the moment.
