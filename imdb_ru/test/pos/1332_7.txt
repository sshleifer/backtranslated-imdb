Soderbergh is a terrific director, but nothing he could think of could compare with the amazing cast that he assembled for the zenith of sequels. Obviously, he knew this from the very beginning. The term “star vehicle” has traditionally been used to refer to a film that is built around a single star. What makes this film is a pure herd of Hollywood hot pictures and makes them shine even brighter than before. The last scene says everything - all the stars are sitting without ANYTHING happening and nothing is said. We just see them talking like it's a scene from a reality show in which George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Don Cheadle just hang out being themselves. So the story is not important at all - at least, this is not where the greatest pleasures of films come from. If you want an ingenious film about robberies, better stick with 11. But if you are interested in watching the stars, this will make your day.
