I don’t know why all the critics say it’s a bad movie, it’s one of my favorite movies. Tommy (Chris Farley) and Richard (David Spade) are great for each other. Tommy is a stupid man who spent seven years in college and finally passed with D +. Richard is a smart kid who everyone at school hated. How can you not laugh when the two sing The Carpenters' Superstar and passionately blow the hood? In all this great movie, I recommend.
