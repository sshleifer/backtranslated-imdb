FIRE is not only a depiction of a lesbian love story, but also a comic satire of Indian culture of the middle class (?). I believe that this quality, which is little appreciated in the film. These two genres (i.e., a deep meaningful love story for an alternative and a comic satire) usually mix as well as oil and water, but Mehta (somehow) manages to achieve a balance almost to perfection. The behavior of Jatin’s servant, his family’s attitude to him, the constant inevitable presence of his bedridden grandmother, Ashok’s obsession with Swami’s teachings: originating from a culture very similar to that of India, is something I can immediately identify as typical. They shouted to be pointed and ridiculed. Developing the main subject, Mehta skillfully copes with this secondary topic. In fact, much of the humor in the film, which provides significant relief from the heavy themes of forbidden lesbian love and gender issues, flows from this seemingly ordinary satire. The film moves from comic to serious with great subtlety. <br /> <br /> In general, the brilliant use of symbolic devices (Radha compared with the Sita of the legend and the way out of the Fire is unharmed and therefore clean; young Radha's life has finally reached the desire of the ocean when she gains freedom) . Glory to Shabana Azmi (Radha), lighting team and Dipe Mehte; their very non-Hollywood (and not Bollywood!) talents made this film special. One criticism: the first scenes seemed to me rather incoherent in the sense that they didn't merge well with each other. Verdict: 9 to 10. Not less for a movie with scenes that burned in my head like that. ,
