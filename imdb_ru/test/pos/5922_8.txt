Billy Wilder continues the series of films made in the 1950s with a biopic about Charles Lindbergh, a young American pilot who became the first person to make a single flight across the Atlantic in 1927. Jimmy Stewart plays Lindberg, and although he may be a little older on his part, he still brings a sincere need for warmth and confidence, as well as his trademark practicality, which makes him a famous movie star. Wilder is leading firmly, balancing history with humor and drama, to give us a clear description of what Lindberg faced when he decided to accept this challenge. This, of course, is not his best work, nor that of Stewart, but this is the jewel of the film. He cheers you up with the help of an airplane and makes you proud that you are American. Overall, this is just fine.
