I just saw this movie on Showtime in the tiny hours of the night. I watched the beginning with one open eye, but instead of falling asleep, I was carried away by this sly, cruel film. It was very believable and attractive. I could do without such profanity (as with every David Mamet film I see), but I fully enjoyed the experience. I know that teens swear, but I don't need to listen to it. In any case, this story had some interesting surprises that I will not disclose, but if you have the opportunity to watch this movie on Showtime, I think you will like it as much as I do.
