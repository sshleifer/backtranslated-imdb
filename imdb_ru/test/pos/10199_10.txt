After coming to power in 1933, Hitler and his “National Socialist German Workers Party”, which, of course, we all know as Nazis, over time strengthened their power in the country more and more. At the beginning of their rude trampling of the German people, they invited each and every one of the artists, newsmen and cinematographers to their Nazi headquarters so that they could be informed that they had just been declared the “Third Reich” (aka “Empire”). ) expected from them. <br /> <br /> WHEN Mr. Fritz Lang called the chief director of the era of silent impressionism and expressionism of the German cinema, Mr. Fritz Lang; he listened carefully and said nothing. Immediately after leaving the office of the Minister of Propaganda, Herr Lang headed straight for the train station and took the passenger directly to Paris. Even without returning to his residence, Fritz Lang did not return to Germany (at least until many years later. He remained in France; eventually he immigrated to the United States of America. * <br /> <br /> Mr. LANG went to work in America, creating many of the most enjoyable, solid and essentially literate films about the higher echelon over the years. This collection of titles included the happy topic of today, WESTERN UNION (20th Century-Fox, 1941). <br /> In a TYPICAL film about the Day of the Old West and the Days of Pioneers, both quality and quantity were required. WESTERN UNION were qualified by both requisites. We turn to a wonderful set of talents in the lead role, as well as to supporting actors, does every minute and every scene gives pleasure to our feelings. <br /> <br /> Playbill - Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore Other famous characters such as John Carradine (played not as a vampire or another scary guy, but a doctor), Geor ge "Slim" Summerville (veteran-actor-veteran, veteran Silent Film and graduate of Mack Sennett's Keystone Comedies), Chill Wills (always reliable supporting player and the former singer in "The Avalon Boys") and the tough bad guy Burton McLain. Such names as Russell Hicks, Victor Killian, Minor Watson, George Chandler, Addison Richards, Irving Bacon, James Flavin, Francis Ford, Frank McGrath and Kermit Maynard (Ken Maynard's brother) added to this mix. <br /> <br /> Chief American Indians include: Chief Big Three, Chief Thunderstorm Cloud and Mr. Jay Silhilfils. It should also be noted that one of the remarkable representatives of the indigenous peoples of North America is the remarkable, unusually impressive and memorable example of the Red Man, Louisiana-born, Iron Eye Cody (born Esperoy DeCorty from Sicilian immigrant parents). <br /> Shooting beautiful outdoor scenes was made in Arizona and Utah and presented in the highest available technical color. (There is no Monument Valley; but this is Mr. John Ford’s province.) In some respects, this film is a far more surprising achievement than we might have thought; it took something like a pulp magazine that adapted it to the tastes and idioms of pre-war America in the late thirties and early forties. All this is done by a director of German origin, who was in Hollywood and America only for the shortest period of time. <br /> <br /> In its final analysis, the WESTERN UNION, although it may not be the most accurate historical example of the Western genre; we just don't care. He evaluates all the necessary categories needed for a great movie night! So who really cares about small details like “accuracy”? <br /> <br /> We assign Mr. Lang and the 20th Century-Fox **** rating! <br /> <br /> NOTE: * We just saw a special issue at the PBS WTTW station; here, in Chicago, it was all about film actors, directors, and other artisans who were forced to take refuge in America and Hollywood. (It seems that it was cinematographers and scientists who were the biggest export goods for Germany at that time; the scientists who created the atomic bomb, as well as future NASA employees came from Europe at that time.) <br /> <Poodle Schnitz !!
