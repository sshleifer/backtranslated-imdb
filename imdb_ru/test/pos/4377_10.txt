This may be a stretch when you talk about it as a solid Karlin fan, but the material, written and performed in “It's bad for the Self”, is one of the best materials of a later era. At 70, Carlin rebounds from the level of despair (and some misunderstandings in the action itself) from "Life is worth losing" to a special, well-structured, but free and playful - or just like the "old devil" can be obtained - and it is continuous, continuously is ridiculous. And funny, like in the memories of what happened to some of us when we watched "Back to the city" or "We got sick" for the first time. The material, even if it sounds at times with a touch of what was previously done (i.e., it is entirely about children in school and camp, such as “Children” in “The Disease”), is always fresh and with such a bite of truth in everything that stuns the mind. bye (here goes) tickling a funny bone. <br /> <br /> Proceeding from the topic of death (how long to wait to delete a name from a book? six weeks, if only on a computer-planner), facets of communication, glance from heaven, God's spots (naturally), children and just troublesome gestures involving hats in religion, and if people really have “rights”, make up the main part of a special, centered around the premise that what is bad for you, clearly and simply, is BS. Total, a complete BS, which, as we also learn (or, if you really learned it, you, as a child, waiting at the corner of the street for a week after his parents dropped him off completely) keeps the country together. Carlin is not necessarily angry, even if the contempt seems to erupt on most turns, even just to see how terrible children's teeth look. This is skepticism with a touch of feeling that not everything will be "good." <br /> <br /> It comes down to this: Carlin is a dirty, witty, cautious comedy, like Yoda for the Jedi. everywhere that is a small spark of hope thanks to the crystal clear wisdom in a world where it is damn hard to get it. At the very least, we get the classic GC - outrageous lines and excerpts from the 13th (or 14th) special comedy of this man, including so much that it is surprising to people who play Mozart's music during birth!
