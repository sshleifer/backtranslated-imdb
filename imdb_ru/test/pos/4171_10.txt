Wow. We watched this film in the hope that there would be at least some decent climbing scenes. We were disappointed there, but it was still a great movie! It was very nice, it was great! I haven't laughed at the movie for a long time. If you are fond of rock climbing and like raw movies, then this movie is absolutely for you!
