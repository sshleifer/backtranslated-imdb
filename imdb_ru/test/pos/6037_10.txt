Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes) is an orchestra conductor with a secret connection to his pianist. When she threatens to expose him and make a scandal, if he does not leave his wife, he sees that he has no choice but to kill her and create the appearance that she has committed suicide. It is a pity that our battered detective, Lieutenant Colombo (Peter Falk), is engaged in this business. <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochko wrote another episode, razor sharp, after amazing details with amazing details. We watch the villain commit his murder and give him an alibi for about twenty-five minutes, and we are completely absorbed. Then, when Colombo appears on the scene, it becomes even better. <br /> <br /> First we see Colombo after the murder (as usual). This time he is at the vet with his new dog. Scenes of purely comic relief, as a rule, are the weakest in the show (recall the discomfort of Colombo due to the nude model in “Suitable for framing”). Colombo is cheerful when he deliberately staggers or dangles to tangle his quarry; but too many authors make the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when he is with the unsuspecting. Bochco, by contrast, shows Colombo a little awkwardly with his new pet in a handful of inconspicuous scenes that are funny and artfully integrated into the story. (And I am grateful that he did not strain because of the raisin’s desire to give the dog a name. As far as we know, the dog remains nameless.) Bochko gives Colombo some of his best moments in this episode, and Peter Falk does most of them. He is especially good at a monologue, where he expresses disbelief that someone can commit suicide, and even more so this brilliant and beautiful young pianist. And he is even better in his scenes playing cat and mouse with Cassavetis. These two long-time friends and co-workers are expected to play brilliantly with each other; and that's what we get. Notice that Alex Benedict can't help but admire the deceptively blunt Colombo, even though a brilliant detective pulls the noose around his neck. <br /> <br /> In his scenario, Bochko uses all possible situations. When, of course, Colombo wonders about the haughty mechanics of Benedict? of course! ?? he asks a man to look at his battered pile. And when Benedict finds Colombo in the Hollywood ball before the rehearsal, of course ?? of course! ?? he plays the piano "chopsticks". And what our audacious lieutenant should bring with him, besides the victim's typewriter with a fake suicide note, is still in the video. <br /> <br /> Colombo also has nice scenes with the premature little girl (Dawn Frame) and the lovely Blythe Danner. who plays wife Cassavetes. It's nice to see Myrna Loy appear as Danner's mother, although she does little with her secondary role. <br /> <br /> Directed by Nicolas Colasanto (who also played a role, especially as a trainer in “Greetings”) does an excellent job with his work. decent work, although he follows the lead of almost any other Colombo director, adding one or two silly flourishes. Scenes end with focusing and begin focusing. Then there is the moment when Cassavetiz sees the carnation that he fell at the crime scene? and we see an enlarged shot reflected in his sunglasses. There is also one scene with the Peaceful Loy and a group of old nebulae that everyone, beside Cassavetis, is brutally playing. <br /> <br /> Although this is a niggle. This is a wonderfully interesting episode that made me a Colombo fan.
