One of the things I like about PT Anderson is that he has the courage to take on the talent that most people push aside or push aside and makes them stars. An illustrative example, washed ... Bert Reynolds demonstrates a great game in this film. And if you prove that Adam Sander can be a great actor (Punch Drunk Love), it was not enough ... here comes Mark Walburg ... like you have never seen before. <br /> <br /> I think many people go to Boogie Nights because they are anti-porn, or just plain hateful in the porn industry and don't lose sight of that aspect of this film. But under this is a great story about characters losing everything and fighting to restore themselves. There is a beautiful film ... and itâ€™s too bad that enough people see it.
