On March 17, 1974, a man was found dead in the toilets at the Manhattan Penn station. Although he is well known, he cannot be identified because he scratched personal information on his passport, and his body remains unclaimed in the morgue of the city for three days. It turned out to be the body of what many consider to be one of the greatest American architects of the twentieth century, Louis I. Kahn. He died at the age of 73 on the road from India, where one of his greatest projects was completed - the Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. <br /> <br /> One of the most influential post-war American architects. The architectural heritage of Louis Kahn includes the parliament building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, the Yale Art Gallery, the California Salk Institute and a kind of mobile musical boat "designed for concerts in the harbors. various cities around the world. <br /> <br /> Although he was glorified as an architect, very little was known about his personal life. In addition to his wife Esther and their daughters Sue Ann, Kahn was left with two mistresses, Harriet Pattison and Ann Ting, and their two children. All three families lived a few miles apart in the suburbs of Philadelphia, but their paths never crossed paths before the funeral. His son, Nathaniel, the director of this film, was only 11 years old at the time, and he had only a few memories of his father’s weekly visits to Harriet Patterson, Nathaniel’s mother, in Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, he embarks on a journey to confront his father, visiting Cana’s buildings, talking with relatives and colleagues, and visiting places that have played an important role in the life of Louis Cana. <br /> <br /> One of the most touching encounters is when Nathaniel asks his mother, a landscape architect and the mistress of Louis Kahn, why she continued to play second fiddle with his wife and never encountered him. Tears shed eyes, but she has no regrets. "It was worth it." This is such a sad moment. She is obviously broken, considered an outcast at his funeral, at which she was forbidden to attend, almost as if she led an alternative life. It all seems strangely unreal. Another interview with Edward Bacon, an architectural enemy of Kahn, who was responsible for restoring his native Philadelphia in the fifties and sixties, almost immediately suffers a stroke when he is reminded of Canan’s dubious ideas about architecture. His son, Nathaniel, listens awkwardly when a very elder Bacon literally screams with anger when Kahn's name pops up. The final scene is for the greatest creation of Kahn, the Capitol in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It took 23 years to build a huge and unusual building that Bangladeshis are very proud of. It is one of the very few national symbols in this poor country. Some of the interviews with local people caused tears in my eyes, especially when they find out that they are talking - God forbid - with the architect's own son! <br /> <br /> A film is not only a personal journey, but also a personal one. a story about the great architectural heritage of Kahn, and above all about the fruitfulness of the film itself and film production in general. Perhaps Louis I. Kahn faltered as a father, but these flaws in his personal life make the portrait even more interesting in this unusual film. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
