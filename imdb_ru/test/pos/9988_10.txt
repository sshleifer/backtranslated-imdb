The focus of key relationships in the life of a young man, his relationship with his father, was perfectly portrayed in this film, “The greatest game in history.” The film reflects the essence of how important it is for a father to check his son and let him know that he has everything he needs to follow his dream. <br /> <br /> It didn’t matter that the economic and social class mores represented obstacles that both father and son had to overcome. It also did not matter that others greeted their son in a lush celebration. What mattered most was that he saw his father’s hand, and then his approving face. The real challenge for father and son was fulfilled. <br /> <br /> Considering that in real life the hero of this story retained his amateur status and became a businessman, he largely confirms that everything that happened before the match was a testing ground for establishing relations between father and son.
