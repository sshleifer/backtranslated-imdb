Bloody amazing Recommended by a friend who knew that I liked Thomas Kretschmann in "Pianist and the Fall." I liked the flow of the story - how the characters passed from hope and ideals of valor through shock, fear, decay, despair and complete destruction. First-class anti-war film, which probably caused a stir in Germany. This is not a proud moment for anyone, but the study of a lost generation. This film perfectly demonstrated the removal of the command of ground troops and demonstrated the complete futility of attempts to control the untamed nature and the Russian psyche. If I did not know, I would have thought that this is a Russian film, it is so fatalistic. What an uncompromising finale. Pieta
