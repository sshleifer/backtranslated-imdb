Very nice western 50s. I have this in my collection, and I recommend it to Western fans. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film is Victor Metri, and, according to my estimates, he coped well. <br /> <br /> He is a catcher who enters the border post as a scout Red Cloud caught three on their land and seized their property. They all joined as scouts after their loss. <br /> <br /> Victor has his eye on the colonel's wife and lives in this post without much regard to the rules. <br /> <br /> The action is quite convincing, but there is no great depth or special feeling for other characters. <br /> <br /> The Westerns of the 50s are my favorites, and this easily brings satisfaction. A Western of this kind is on the pages of the past and may never be made again. One to enjoy. Gave him 7 ratings. Probably worthy of 6.8, but films like these become more valuable over time. <br /> <br /> For fans of noir ... "The Big Steal", "They live at night", "Side Street" - the most wonderful films enjoyed. Bought and looked. Noir seems a bit like Westerns. Some long and never forever.
