Pink flamingos: a vision of society’s past <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos, a film shot by John Waters in 1972, is a very disturbing reflection of the negative impact of a traumatized childhood on future life. Babs Johnson grew up in a very atypical home. Obviously, you can see the impact it has had on society through its actions right down to the end, where it absorbs dog excrement. Was this film just some kind of sick and perverted perversion of endless heartbreaking events or a symbol of something deeper? To be on the side of the first would be the easiest way out, and on the side of the last one might seem crazy, but perhaps true. The film has some significant similarities with the real events of our public past. Every leader we humans believe is “terrible” demonstrates the same characteristics as Babs Johnson. Ivan the Terrible, Genghis Khan, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Staling had a “disturbing” childhood. Babs Johnson had a hectic childhood, and therefore he was in the same class as all the previous rulers mentioned. That is why most of her actions throughout the film may seem disturbing. However, were her actions her own fault or society for allowing her to grow as she did. In addition, each character in this film represents either the past leader or an event. Another coincidence is Edith's obsession with eggs. With an open mind, this may be associated with genocide and Hitler’s attempt to destroy the Jews. Some consider Hitler to be a genius, others to be crazy. John Waters must have seen him as a madman because Edith’s presentation was really mentally ill. The son of Edith Crackers and companion Cotton are a symbol of what was wrong in our own backyard, in slavery. Both names are slang terms representing a period of time that most of us would prefer to forget. These characters are crucial in terms of the fact that in some cases our society in America was no better than what we often see as terrible acts of social attack in other cultures. The scene with the chicken f ** king is the embodiment of what was wrong in our society at this time and is still mistaken. Chicken is a 1970s jargon for women. It is therefore possible that John Waters attempted to identify the subject of rape through the actions of Cotton and Cracker. The antagonist family, if in this film one can identify a single antagonist, was Marble. Marble is often mentioned in connection with wealth. Therefore, it can be a symbol of the struggle between the poor and the rich, a struggle that continues to this day and will probably continue forever. “Pink Flamingos” is a monumental film because of its disturbing scenes, but its disguised political agenda, which Waters so richly demonstrated throughout its entirety, should also be noted.
