If you like the book, like me, stop watching the video after Jin and Joe meet in Australia. Up to this point, this is a fairly accurate reproduction of the book, and the visual effects are great. 10 out of 10 by this point, and I have enjoyed it many times. After this, the story is seriously rebuilt and revised in such a way that it really destroys a key part of the book, that is, how Jean creates such a city as Alice (Springs). In the beginning, the main change is to make Strachan a 40-year-old bachelor instead of a seventy-year widower. It rather distorts this love story, especially when there are small changes that contribute to making him more selfish and mean, for example: in the book he hints to Joe on the ship that he can find more than a letter waiting for him in Australia, but in the video, he does not give Joe any clue about Jin's whereabouts or intentions. The last hour of the 5-hour video cuts out and cripples the last third of the book. I see no reason why they put up a fight between Joe and Gene - she is completely out of character and, it seems, just an Australian cop on Pommy for telling them what to do. Then they invite Strachan to the wedding (and not after three years) - and let him read the toast !! - very strange, especially in the context of the relationship between Jean and Noel, as shown in the video. The whole wedding scene is the invention of the scriptwriters. These abominations take time at the last hour, which was not enough to pay tribute to the fascinating story of how Jin recreates Willstown as a place where she and Joe can be happy.
