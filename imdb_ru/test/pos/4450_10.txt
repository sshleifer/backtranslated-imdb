I have seen this film five times and never get tired of it. There are traces of the genre "giallo", but also in the vibrant Italian countryside, where ignorance and superstition are more deadly than any serial killer. Great location (sometimes reminiscent of Fellini, sometimes Taviani brothers), good character and some of the best actors of the genre (including the great Thomas Milian and Ida Lupino in an unforgettable role), this is NOT EUROSHA, just a masterpiece it must be open from generation to generation (recently he received high marks in Parisian cinema as a sign of respect for Lucio Fulci)
