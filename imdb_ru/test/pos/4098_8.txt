I saw this film when it first came out in 1973, and I really liked it. Since then I have been looking for a video, but I have not found it so far, 33 years later, when I ordered it from Moviehunter. Sorry I couldn't stand it. This glamor version simply can not rise to the level of production in 1937. I like the musical accompaniment of Bert Baharah, that is, if it listens by itself, and I even bought his CD, but for my taste it is not suitable for this mysterious and convincing story. Just does not fit. Michael York is lost here. Sally Kellerman throws off a beautiful performance, but Olivia Hussey is ridiculous and should not be dragged through the Himalayas. The best performance of Charles Boyer as the head of the Lama.
