This time, the story of hope has highlighted the tragic reality that our young people face. Favela Rising draws people into a scary, insecure and unjust world and, through beautiful color and touching music, shows how one person and his loyal friends decided not to accept this world and change it through action and art. Entertaining, interesting, emotional, aesthetically beautiful film. I also showed this film to numerous high school students who live in areas of poverty and violence with firearms, and they were fascinated by the main character Anderson. I recommend this film to all ages 13 and older (due to subtitles and some images of death) from all walks of life.
