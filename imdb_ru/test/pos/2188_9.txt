On television, filmed in 1982 in Los Angeles, this is probably the best example of a filmed musical you are likely to encounter. Released on DVD in 2004 in a remastered digital format, it looks amazing. Hearn and Lansbury give an idea of ​​their lives, and the rest of the cast is obviously absorbed by the generated electricity. Of course, Sondheim’s music and lyrics make this possible. If someone doubts that he is one of the "great people" of the American musical form, listen to this. The sets are strict, as the plot is supposed to, and are smart in allowing the quick scene changes necessary, and the cameras capture the action without erasing the fact that it is a production. The central, movable and revolving platform is Mrs. Lovett's pastry shop with a hair salon upstairs. Around it are various portals and moving stairs, which allows you to carry out the rest of the action. The cruel story of injustice, leading to revenge, murder and unrest, is generously seasoned with dark humor and comic moments. Sondheim does for hairdressers what Hitchcock did for showers! Important work in the American musical theater is given here with electrification.
