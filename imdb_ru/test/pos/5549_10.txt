This film was just very true to life. I liked the finale, which seemed to resolve naturally without any big moments, but with a lot of little moments coming together. You could say this is an honest love story. No matter what the “sexual orientation” of the main characters is, it’s still a story about love and understanding. <br /> <br /> There were many scenes in which the family participated. Setting over what for some people is a very busy time. Namely "holidays". Christmas to be exact. <br /> <br /> Like most good films, this film deals with issues of love, conformity, expectations, and prejudices that cannot be overcome. In the end, Alexander and Casey make a choice for each other, knowing that love is difficult and about giving. Well done.
