It's fantastic! Everything from the score - until the final role of the role. This film is a masterpiece. He is really creepy and his hysterical situation is enough to cause goosebumps on someone. Obviously, the film was NOT hurried, and that David Schmeller (who would later work with Fullmoon in the Puppet Master series) had a clear and concise picture of what he was trying to direct. The professional aspect of the film is amazing, given its relatively small budget. It relies on fears without consequences (mainly due to budget constraints), but it still creates a tense atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Stephen King claimed that it was one of his favorite films, and I seriously can not blame him! This is one of my favorite horror movies, and always will be. This is my favorite movie Fullmoon, and it has been since I bought it a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Money is well spent! I own versions of VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> 10/10
