I stumbled upon this. I was at my friends' house, and he just started watching him, so I sat down, thinking that we would shoot into the wind while he was playing in the background. However, after a few seconds, I plunged into this documentary drama, and we both spent the rest of the time, fully concentrating on this and not saying a word to each other. <br /> <br /> I never knew the story of the first solo yacht race in the world, not to mention the tragic events of one manâ€™s attempt against all that was his atonement for all his failures in life, but eventually an example of them. Not knowing about this story, I watched it with the same zeal as I imagine those who read about the race at the time when it really happened, absorbed what was happening and craved additional information, hoping that the lonely amateur was I am going to handle the situation and defeating the professionals, making the shocking turns of history even more tragic, I felt like I was living history. <br /> <br /> The story was told with great caution and the respondents clearly had time to think about the tragedy, which gives an excellent understanding, but also nicely contrasts with the archive recordings of interviews during the tragedy, the recordings and photographs of single sailors are also excellently used understanding the thoughts of the sailors and how loneliness influenced them was excellent. <br /> <br /> I am shocked that this story is not so widely known or turned into a film, but also grateful, Thank you for having this dramatic documentary telling the story from those who knew this person, instead of what untidy film adaptation, and grateful that I caught this gem of the film by pure chance. <br /> <br /> Be sure to see if you like documentaries or not.
