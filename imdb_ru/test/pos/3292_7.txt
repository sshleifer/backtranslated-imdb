It was on a strange movie. I liked this adventure, although it seems that it was intended for children. (Spoiler ahead) Ironically, the main character kills a federal official. Then he is a fugitive on the run. Later they blow up his house, and then he finally commits suicide. It looks like they should have made the film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly. <br /> <br /> It was a weird movie.
