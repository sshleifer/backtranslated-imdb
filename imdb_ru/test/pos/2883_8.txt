I liked this film, and after it ended, it still makes you wonder. I believe that Jeremy Brett is great in this role, although his “deadly” game was a bit excellent, but as Jeremy Brett I did not mind. <br /> <br /> This is a good piece and it is very closely watching the novel by Oscar Wilds. If you like this movie, I recommend you also watch “The Perfect Husband” with Jeremy Brett as Lord Goring. <br /> <br /> This film gives a great insight into the mindset of Oscar Wilds. And while watching the viewer, he recalls how Dorian Gray - Lord Alfred "Bosi" Douglas, and Basil Halward - Oscar Wilde.
