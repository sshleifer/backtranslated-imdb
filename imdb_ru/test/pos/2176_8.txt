I suppose this is the first time I watched Roscoe Fat Arbuckle. I really liked him in his (title) role of the boy-butcher. The way he moves, in my opinion, is very funny, for example, how he treats his knife and how he rolls a cigarette. I think he is a good actor; his facial expression truly corresponds to the role he plays, for example, how he winks at the audience at the end. But you can add that it was probably not too difficult. In any case, I think he would have deserved a longer career. As you probably know, he was destroyed by greedy journalists who made money by typing false accusations that said he was involved in a scandal. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very important. In the first half, Fatty and Alum worked in the store and vied for the love of Almondin. After a hard fight for the food, Almondin goes to the girls' school by her father, the store owner. (This is the beginning of the second half). Both Fat and Alum enter the school into a drag, and the struggle for Almondin continues. (Some of the character names are different in the version I saw. It seems that for some reason they replaced the original title cards with new ones.) <br /> <br /> There are a lot of commonplace jokes, such as food fights and dips, but, in my opinion, they are made well. And there are some jokes that I really liked, for example, how they force a dog to run a pepper mill (or is it a coffee grinder?), Or a scene when Fat Man puts on a coat, although this is clearly not necessary, or when Miss Ticham, the headmaster for girls slaps Fatty and slaps her on the back. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is also funny in his first film; Good addition to the cast. In the first half, he is a shopper in the store, in the second half, he supports Alum in his fight for Almondine. I liked his acrobatics, for example, when Fatty pushes him from one room of the school to another, he does not show a simple jumper, but lands on his hands and head and makes a little pirouette. Beware of one scene in the fight for food: alum throws a bag of flour at him, but he misses and hits the store owner instead. This makes Buster laugh, which should be rare, as he usually always shows a neutral expression (which — as you probably already know — was given him the nickname “The Great Stone Face”). (Another note: Al St. John, who plays Alum, was Arbuckle's Fatty's nephew, and later became famous for the role of Fuzzy, which he played in many westerns. <br /> <br /> I don’t like this movie so much , as I like, for example, “One Week” and “Ballonatik” (films that Buster shot later, without Fatty). And this did not make me laugh out loud often, but made me smile a lot, so I gave him eight points .
