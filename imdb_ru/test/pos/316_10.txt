During the last battles of the Witnam war, our central character, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), is sent by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to kill the US Marine commander apostate colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who allegedly left “completely crazy” but successfully wages a private cross-border war from its base in Cambodia, a neutral and, therefore, forbidden country. <br /> <br /> The whole story that Willard sees and does as he is transported up the river Da Nang by the undisciplined and terrorized crew of a navy patrol boat to kill Kurtz is a great metaphor of excess, decline and However, the weaknesses of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: if we do not understand something, and we cannot control it, destroy it. Kurtz eventually found out. <br /> <br /> If you don’t pay close attention to every emotional gesture, every word of dialogue between the main characters, especially in the scene where the two of them remain in the darkness of Kurtz Den, you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible film. Kurtz’s thin deal with the executioner, his one-sided “surrender” in exchange for Willard’s consent (he nodded?) seen in Vietnam are things that expand consciousness. The connection between the two men, while Kurtz cross-examining Willard, intertwines with some of his own horrible stories, an incredible, no, ingenious film. The closing (intermediate) scene of the ritual killing of the sacrificial bull is the most powerful of the characters. Coppolla made, intentionally or not, the final anti-war statement, which should sound through the ages.
