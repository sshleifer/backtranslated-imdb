For the cheese of the late 80s, it's really not that bad. There are a lot of pretty funny one-time odnostrochnikov ("It was a grand theft!" - "Thank you!"), And Madonna gives a great performance; There is nothing worthy of a reward here, but this applies to both Razzy and Oscar. I am curious to know if the film would have been better received if she used her usual (influenced by Britain) voice and not a hypertronic accent. Well. As a note, I met one of the actors who played one of the policemen on a motorcycle through my work; he said it was a fun movie for work, but he gave me the sad news that the actor who played Buck, a UPS delivery worker, died about a year after “Who is this girl?”
