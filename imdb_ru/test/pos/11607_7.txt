Choker Bali ?? The game is passion. <br /> <br /> Based on Rabindranath Tagore’s novel of the same name, this is a classic tale of adultery, adultery and the exploitation of relationships. Recruited in 1900 in Bengal, directed by Rituparno Gauche turned the famous literature of the Nobel laureates into a delightful visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> The story of Tagore tells in detail about Bengali society through her main character, a rebellious widow who wants to live her own life. We are taken to the picturesque part of Bengal, where we meet our heroine, Binodini’s beautiful young widow (Aishwarya Rai). <br /> <br /> Despite her gorgeous looks, two handsome men, rich Mahindra (Prosenjit Chatterjee)) and his friend Behari (Toto Royhovdhuri), denied marrying her. <br /> <br /> Mahindra chooses the naive Ashalatu (Rima Sen) over Binodini and marries her. Leaving behind village life, the freedom-loving Binodini accompanies Mahindra's mother to Calcutta as a caretaker. Soon her friendship with Ashalata flourishes. It seems that these two, referring to each other as the “Choker Bali” (sand in the eyes), have a strong connection. English-speaking Binodini has a special place in the house. But soon she exposes her real face. By controlling the good-natured Ashlatoy, Binodini draws closer to Mahindra and fulfills her sexual desires. <br /> <br /> When the furious mother of Mahindra throws her out, Binodini seeks consolation from reluctant Behari. The rest of the story shows how the life of these four characters intersects and culminates into unimaginable climax. Aishwarya goes through the role — a manipulative, rebellious lady, still gaining the sympathy of the viewer — with the elegance of a ballerina. Other leading artists - Prosenjit Chatterjee, Raima Sen and Toto Roychowdhury - are equally brilliant in the performance of their characters. <br /> <br /> While Tagore wrote this “mold-breaking” story at the turn of the 20th century. The very idea of ​​a widow’s marriage was taboo, even among the upper class! In parallel, talking about the movement for the freedom of nations, the author argues the importance of individual freedom from life in a cell. Kudos to the artistic director, who gave life at the beginning of the 20th century in Bengal, and to the applause of the cinematographer for capturing these scenes with enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> This “game of passion” by Tagore has been hotly transformed into a Screen from the most capable director, without losing its originality.
