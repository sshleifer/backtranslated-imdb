A real masterpiece of Soviet cinematography. It's a shame for the Soviet Union that Samoilova was never allowed to play in Western films - but again, she probably never will be there. In "The Cranes Are Flying" it is unforgettable. It was one of the few films in which I cried ... <br /> <br /> In addition to Samoilova, Batalov and Merkuryev, which are first-class, it was a brilliant work of the director and cameraman who made this classic film of all time worldwide. Just remember scenes of piano music and sentences under heavy German bombardment or the death of Boris with a twisted sky above his head, and his last visions seemed blurred in this sky. Very simple tool - but great technique added emotional weight ... Keep in mind, 20 years before Star Wars, 41 years before Titanic, and with the Soviet budget.
