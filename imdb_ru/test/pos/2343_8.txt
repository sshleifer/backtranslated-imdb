Agree that this film and its talented director do not receive the praise they deserve. We hope that the DVD will be very successful and attract the attention of a wide audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. The film may be a bit long in general, but Mae Miles Thomas seems to enjoy his actors when they give strong performances, and therefore sometimes keeps them in bigger plans than necessary. I'm sure this is good for the actors, but sometimes, as spectators, you are ready to move on, so to speak, with the plot. Mae Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the movie business as one of our top digital directors,
