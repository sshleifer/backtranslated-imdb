“DOA” is a fascinating and interesting little picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid at his best; and Quaid, unfortunately, is one of the most underrated talents in Hollywood. His then-beautiful Meg Ryan also appears with him, but, as is usually the case, doesn’t really have much impact. <br /> <br /> The film looks stylish everywhere, attracting a lot of influences from its “wrong” feeling. Would you believe that in fact two people are the director? The answer is no. All this is great, from its innovative camera work to the uncompromising use of black and white photography. All these elements help to keep the process up to date. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the greatest pleasure here is the dialogue, it is lively, but complex, does not lose a word and still manages to be interesting. The script for this is similar to a pocket masterpiece. <br /> <br /> It wasn’t noticed by me for ages before I finally caught it late at night. If you heard about it for the first time, do not leave it the way I do! Catch it soon, it's really top-notch ...! <br /> <br /> If you are tuned to a solid genre that surprises at every turn, it really meets all the requirements. <Br /> <br />
