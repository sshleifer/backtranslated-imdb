What can be said about the anti-institutional film that was filmed at the time of such colorless emptiness, social indifference and authoritarian satisfaction. Cassevetta's first major independent film did not have an instant box office success and so far has not received the critical attention it deserves. I compare this wave of American independent projects consisting of such directors as Beat, such as Robert Frank and Harry Smith, with a burgeoning scene that arose in Paris in the late 1950s, known as the French New Wave. <br /> <br /> They discussed poetry, philosophy, and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with the discovery of American cultural excellence; even at this stage this peculiar, very spontaneous brand of film production fought against the creation of such political lexicons and fanatics who held back the development of art in the middle of the twentieth century. <br /> <br /> The Cassevett film treats racial relationships and portrays a person weak in the face of love because we, as a culture, are blinded by our own race and prejudice. A big element of most of Kassevettâ€™s works is that his films have an almost opposite minimalist effect; mental reaction is caused through subtle relationships of character, and not through images. That is why his work seems to be delayed, because he uses a more intimate approach to the definition of characters, which rely less on explicit actions, and more on interpretation. <br /> <br /> Although my favorite Cassevett film is Husbands, this one is his most important.
