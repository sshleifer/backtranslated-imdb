The battleship Potemkin is now the oldest film I have seen, and it is also the first silent film I have seen. I heard a lot of good things about this film, so I took out the tape at home and watched it. When it ended, I just thought it was a classic masterpiece. The story is based on the real Russian battleship Potemkin. You would not think, but something was sad and disgusting. Sadly, the mother dies, and the stroller rolls down the stairs, and it's disgusting because they have to eat rotten meat with larvae. <br /> <br /> Today he is still considered one of the best dumb and Russian films ever made. I think everyone should see it (if they can find it). You will be surprised at how good it is. This is a must see classic. 5/5.
