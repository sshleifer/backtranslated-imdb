If you like movies that make you think, this is one of the best. I always liked David Lynch and Cronenberg. They always shot high-quality films. <br /> <br /> Ian Softly brilliantly starred in K-PAX. The film breaks the feelings and philosophy of the mind and the world. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges both provide excellent acting skills. It caught me, I did not take my eyes off the screen during the movie. On the other hand, if you are looking for a science fiction film with a special effect, this is not for you. The story drags on a bit, which can be a bit boring, but it also helps to create a movie theme. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this movie, I did so ..
