Recently I was lucky to see the name Ingrid Bergman in a film that I had never seen (or even heard) on AMC. What a luck. <br /> <br /> Surprising her impeccable and flawless performance is not the only reason to stay up late and watch this movie. The letter is surprisingly comical, and the performances are excellent. <br /> <br /> Walter Mathau (not my favorite) was almost perfect, and Goldie Hawn (amazingly) incredible. Sometimes gentle, demanding, then just stupid. There are moments in a movie when even the most avid movie viewer goes down in history and forgets that this is a movie. <br /> <br /> Bergman can steal the dance scene among a 20-year-old crowd. Olds was amazing to watch. She easily returns to the screen (at the age of 54). The cast was great, and the lines ... the lines are elegant. <br /> <br /> Top 5 romantic comedy of all time.
