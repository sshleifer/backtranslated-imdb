This is a funny movie, there are not many of them. Well, the plot is a bit disturbing, but very original. The teenager tries to come to terms with his father, because he was not around and almost sent him to prison, because she lies to impress the older boy, how can this be funny? Plus it's not a typical teen movie. The first remake that I saw is better than the original, the only problem with both: Gerard Depardieu. With another actor, it would be a perfect dozen, because he plays all the rolls equally, sucks. Another problem - all women melt over him, this is implausible, he is not attractive! You had a rubber troll that was better than him, come on!
