A very disturbing gyallo from the director of "L'Anticristo" (1974), this one begins with a brilliantly crafted sequence that includes a priest, a little girl and a broken doll. However, the main story of a maniac (David Warbeck) to marry an injured cripple to kill her for her money. The plot, although not original, is really stressful, the game is good, and there are several skillful and bloody murders. Francesco de Massi's assessment is quite effective, some of which can also be heard in Lucio Fulciâ€™s Better New York (1982). Highly recommended for fans of Italian cinema!
