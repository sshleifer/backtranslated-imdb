Many films try to take universal themes and make a comedy; but few will approach the occasion as "Departure." The film is great. The dialogue is well written and true to form. Acting is absolutely prima. Peter Falk gave a really great performance - like an actor; as an actor. He is able to carry gypsum to greatness. Another great performance is Laura San Giacomo. She is such an intriguing actress. Her performances are taken by surprise. She copes no matter what role she is offered - from fools in Stephen King’s “Stand” to her television appearances. However, "Check Out" allows it to shine. This is the role she is meant to play. The film is brilliantly shot by Jeff Hare. He was able to bring out the best in his line-up, and his leadership - in all aspects - made the film a wonderful treasure. Jeff Hare managed to make a complex topic funny and deep at the same time. He gives us a detailed and personal look at why indie films should be made. The knowledge of directors about his cast and scripts apply to the finished film. The results are excellent. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that it will be available to a wide audience, because this is one that you don’t want to miss. He can be a 2005 hit in the style of “My Big Greek Wedding”.
