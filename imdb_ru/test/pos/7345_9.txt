This film touches on the themes of loss, personal struggle and transformation in such a clever, cunning, sensitive and visually stunning manner that I was fully tolerated. This is a rare gem of the film in the way she honors the beauty and women. You should see everything yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) masterfully portrays the subtleties of a wonderful, if not somewhat broken personality, so that every woman will relate to her. I found that the honesty of the emotional interactions between the characters is very refreshing and deeply appealing. There was nothing in this film that would tell me about a “low budget” in terms of quality. Nothing. The fact that this is a low-budget film is a tribute to the creators of the film. The final sequence during credits will also knock out your socks. This is a brilliant celebration of Jane's choice. Suddenly and inspiring.
