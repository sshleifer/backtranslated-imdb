I saw this film when it was released for small cinemas in the UK about 50 years ago; and the memory remained of the magnificent musical accompaniment and tragedy of the plot. I saw it again on video recently. The sound track was bad and the image was grainy; but this is one of two films that I watched again the next day, the other one is “Gladiator”. The theme of music is extremely tragic, and from the very beginning it is known that it proclaims failure or death. Of course, one of the best performances of George Sanders; as a person working on the black market to get compensation for what he lost in the war, but Nemesis is waiting; Patricia Rock plays an Eastern European refugee who is eaten in desperation. He attracts her, selflessly wants to help her, and then falls in love with her, but she is too proud and wounded to accept help. Their love destroys him and inevitably the girl and the doctor (Herbert Marshall), who brought Nemesis. The storyline has complex intertwining fates, where the secondary characters are not what they seem. It's like a movie that disappointed critics and fought at the box office; but for the teenager who saw it, and the retired gentleman who saw it again, this is one of the greatest films (given his age), whose story is more like an opera.
