This film is great, it has the same low-budget first film as Pi and Clerks, but it has Memento style (also screenwriter / director Christopher Nolan). The score, sound effects, photography and editing are almost prototypes of Memento, and history shows that Christopher Nolan is best suited for writing and directing. Do not despair because of the low-budget view and action, or even a short film, but just watch!
