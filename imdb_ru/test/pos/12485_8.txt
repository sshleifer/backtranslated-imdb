Is this the secret of murder? Is this a police process? Is this a behind the scenes look at dirty French music halls? Quai des Orfevres is all that, but more than anything else, this is a funny comedy about infidelity, jealousy and love that takes place in Paris after the Second World War. It may be surprising that the director of this film is Henry Georges Clouzot, the director of such dark films as Le Corbo, or such mean nails like Diabolique and The Wages of Fear. Clouzot, however, was an astute director. “In the secret of murder,” he tells us, “there is an element of playfulness. It is never completely realistic. In this, I share the point of view of Hitchcock, which says: "The secret of murder is a piece of cake with raisins and candied fruits, and if you yourself refuse it, you can also make a documentary film." “Quai des Orfevres is a wonderful film, and this is not a documentary. <br /> <br /> Jenny Martino (Susie Delaire) is an ambitious singer in music halls and clubs for dinners. She flirts, she sees nothing wrong with using a little sex, and also a talent to get a contract. Her stage name is Jenny Latour. And she really loves her husband Maurice Martino (Bernard Blier). Martino is a bit of a sad bag. He is her accompanist and arranger. He is a little balding, a bit plump and jealous of Bug. Then we have their neighbor, the photographer Dora Monnier (Simone Renan). She is blonde, gorgeous (remember Rita Hayworth) and capable. She and Martino were friends since they were children together. Dora, however, is definitely not thinking only about friendship when she looks at Jenny. Then comes George s Brignon (Charles Dullin), an exhausted, rich and dirty old man who often makes Doura take “artistic” photos of his young women protégés whom he imagines. He offers a contract for the film Jenny and offers dinner at his house to discuss the details. Jenny is more than ready. Maurice is furious and forbids it. Jenny shouts back: “You are jealous of the rich! Well, I want my share of their test. I’m all for royalties! ”“ Your father was a worker, ”cries Maurice in response. "So what? Under Louis XV, I would be Madame Pompadour! I would heat their tights! ”<br /> <br /> And after Brignon was found dead with a broken bottle of champagne next to a bleeding skull, Dora tries to protect Jenny. But wait. Inspector Antoine gets the case. Antoine (Louis Jouvete) is a middle-aged, tall, tired bachelor with sore feet. He saw it all. He served in the “colonies” with the Foreign Legion and returned with a foster child and malaria. The child is now about eight years old, and Antoine is obsessed with him. One of the first things Antoine discovers is that someone removes Brignon's brains from a bottle, someone shot him in the heart. Who did this? Soon, Jenny, Maurice and Dora make an alibi, lie and at one time or another are recognized. How does Antoine detect the killer? Will we have a chance to see some great songs in the music hall performed by Jenny Latour? Everything becomes clear, but only with the time and persistence of detective Antoine. There are many kinds of love that lead to different motives: from envy to hair to passionate eyes ... and it all plays with a pleasant mixture of Gallic entertainment. <br /> <br /> Clouzot sends us to Paris, where an itchy, but not threatening atmosphere reigns, to the oppressed music publishers, where buyers play melodies on the piano, to restaurants with private dining rooms. Most of all he takes us to the music hall, where Jenny Latour often performs. We see Jenny as she sings, with couples in the seats and single men in coats and hats in a standing room. And everyone smokes. The first third of the film, in fact, occurs mainly in this environment. With Jenny singing about “Her miniature tra-la-la, her sweet tra-la-la”, we follow her from trying out a song in a publishing house to rehearsing for a daring performance with Jenny in a feathered hat, corset, stockings with garters and much another. <br /> <br /> Delaire, Bleyer and Renant all do an excellent job, but this is Louis Jouve, who holds everything together. He was a marvelous actor who didn’t like to act in films. The scene was his world, and he acted in films only if he liked the director and he earned money to finance his stage work. Jouve was tall with a long face and wide cheekbones. He was not traditionally handsome, but he had everything he needed to dominate the stage. To see how skillfully he could play a comedy, watch him in Drola de Drama. He is an exciting actor. At one point, he says: “I loved you, Miss Dora Monnier.” "To me?" she asks. "Yes. Because we are two of a kind. When it comes to women, we will never have a chance. ” Jouve introduces all sorts of nuances to this line: from sad regret to light fun.
