I was involved in this series just as much as the sea captured me in its arms. Although it all started slowly, I found that the realistic image of the ship, the variety of characters and lively dialogue make me watch. The main character was destined to challenge, grow and change on this journey, and I wanted to be there for him. I was not disappointed. The series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in between, often in one scene, in one breath. There were many emotional overlaps, interactions and expressions - inexorable and irresistible to watch. The movement of the ship added an almost whimsical component to many scenes, making the heroes sick at one moment and adding humor to the next. <br /> <br /> Edmund Talbot is a complex character, the like of which we donâ€™t see often. We may know where the captain or Mr. Prettiman is standing, but they are old people, set up in their own way. Talbot was young and arrogant, still studying, testing himself and being tested. He struggled to get along with others and made mistakes, as a real person would do, but he had a heart that could be touched, which grew with every difficult experience. I appreciate the excellent characterization; this is too rare in movies and on television.
