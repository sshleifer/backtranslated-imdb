This film precedes the Australian films Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is obvious: in dialogs, locations, photography, directing and political philosophy. Photography is especially self-confident. The direction is stylish and for the most part well done. If you liked the early Australian films of Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller, then you will like Oz. The direction also reminds the reviewer of the modern work of Edgar Wright. This similarity suggests that Oz was well ahead of its time. The critics of 1967 hated him, and the public was left behind - Australia of the 1960s, like the US of the 40s, was in some way the place where conformity was important, while this film is very different from what they expected viewers, especially after reading posters. This film is likely to be more attractive to the modern audience: it is still strangely awkward and shy, but in a modern European rather than Australian style of the 1960s. Joy Dunstan (who later appeared on the Australian TV series "The Prisoner") plays its role with less brutal passion than its contemporaries Jackie Weaver could do; instead, the Dunstan character in this film conveys some of the rather bizarre Australian women Kylie Minogue played Charlene Mitchell in the Australian TV series “Neighbors” and was further developed in subsequent roles in her career. Men will also like this film, in which various male problems are presented differently than in most other films of the mid-sixties from the USA or even Australia. In particular, Bruce Spence (who later played Tion Medona in Star Wars III, Teaching in The Matrix films and the pilot of the helicopter in Road Warrior and Thunder Strike) play the main role and starring role. a sustainable role that strongly supports the rest of the cast. This film is worth watching just for Bruce Spens. 7/10 for some minor issues with continuity.
