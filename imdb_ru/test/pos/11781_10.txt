Hysterical hardware wars are finally released on DVD. HW has found its niche among parody classics and is not only a wild little 20-minute short film, but also a staple in low-budget film-making classes, from which most of the cult status of the film originates and lives. With the DVD, we will not only get a chance to return to the original parody (4Q2, Cinnamon-Bun Head, Ballistic Toast, etc.), which Ernie F. did in 1978, but there are many additional materials that demonstrate the wit of Foselia, Antique Sideshow - this is a parody a game that is very funny, but at the same time makes a statement about the merging of ignorance and greed. The director's comment is also hysterical, as is the Creature feature, which parodies the filming of a talk show and is actually based on the HW output on a talk show, albeit in a publicly available scheme. I would really like Ernie, Michael Wiese and his team to take on some of the other, modern, bloated and overwhelmed goals to parody them - like almost any movie that Hollywood releases today $ 100 million apiece - not so many tricky movies like Spiderman or Men in Black (they actually parody themselves!), but any number of bloated, overloaded, overloaded and overvalued functions. <br /> <br />
