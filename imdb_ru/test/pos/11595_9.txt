Hello from the dark again. Director Alejandro Amenabar creates life against all odds, based on the real version of the story of one man’s struggle to control his fate. The great Javier Bardem is fascinating in the role of Ramon. His movements of the eyes and head leave no doubt about what is happening in his head. Sequences of dreams and fantasies are not used too often, so they very effectively explain why he wants what he wants. Instead of forcing us to answer the question of euthanasia, the real question is what is love? At every step, we see people in love, looking for love or dying to be loved. The script is dense and makes the film move, despite the fact that it is shot mostly in the same room. The cast is wonderful, and we really feel their pain and how each family member makes Ramon’s decision. It is a gem and deserves to be seen.
