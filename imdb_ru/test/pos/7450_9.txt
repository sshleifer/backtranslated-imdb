Yes, I'm a fan of FF7, but how many people who will watch this movie WILL NOT? So, I view this film from the point of view of FF7 fans and without regret. (I wouldn’t know how to adequately watch a movie for someone who didn’t play FF7.) <br /> <br /> Visuals - 10/10 I liked Advent Children. This sensual pleasure is a complete overload of audio-video. The visual effects were fascinating: some exploits were accomplished, and I simply would not have thought that this was possible thanks to the animated function. When action scenes appeared, for lack of a more precise word, they were a roller coaster. With an impressive range-to-range camera movement, smoothly integrated bullet time effects at critical moments, with a clear level of detail — all this is hard to go wrong. The animation looks great on a budget, the style and images are awesome, and at times the effects make me forget that I watch animation, not shots from live action. I could wander around for hours, repeating myself with fantastic image quality, but that just wouldn't justify it. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 The sound was awesome. The voices of all the characters did not disappoint (no one sounded silly), and the sound effects were bold and sharp. Music - from the game, which (in my opinion) had the best gaming soundtrack ever, beautifully transferred to the film. Most of the unforgettable themes from the game are present in the film, although they often use different tools to better fit what is happening. From time to time some really bold rock and light thrash-metal music took place on really intense scenes, but it all matched well with the situation in the film at the appropriate time. <br /> <br /> History - 7/10 story and characters will be the main drawbacks of the film. Both aspects simply did not fit the game - but, again, the game could have spent more than 40 hours developing these points - the film has only about 90 minutes. As for the story, the plot was not bad or anything else, but not as ambitious as expected from the one who played the game to the end. In fact, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. The game was so extravagant with intricate plot twists and plot development that the film never had a chance to compete in the same league. Instead, a more sensible approach was used in the film - to expand the action and try to put as many jokes and themes inside as possible, instead of trying to recreate the massive plot factor that was originally the driving force in the game. The lack of use of Materia also caused me some controversy - the story of the film decided to use a small (but not zero) Materia, but instead a multitude of supernatural fighting abilities and skills. I would hope that, if the sequel were done, it would include Matter much more extravagant and important in the film. The film also had a lot of holes in the plot - all that can be forgiven if you think of Advent Children as a random anime, but it seems ridiculous when you understand how it was based on a game in which the plot turned out very well. br /> Characters - 7/10 Characters, although they are all present in one form or another, do not necessarily reflect their true potential. Just not enough time to watch a movie with all of them. And so, all their stories and skills are not fully disclosed, and in some cases they are not at all (The Reds and Kate Sith leave absolutely no real impressions) Even Cloud, who is the focus of the film, I feel, does not use enough of his familiar abilities. from the game. The materia problem is a good reason for this. With that said, it's nice to see that the actors are back in action, even if they play such a role that they do not fully use them. The new characters were the ones who caused me most of the strife - the trio of the bad guy and the guy dude Denzel - there was a huge lack of explanation for any of them. Anyone who wants to use their imagination can probably fill in the gaps with something sensible and be done with it, but, objectively speaking, the question has yet to be commented on, and therefore it is a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> Value - 10/10 Reproduction of this film is excellent - I personally want to watch it even more and louder - the screen is bigger, the volume. <br /> <br /> Enjoyment - 10/10 Whatever the shortcomings of the movie, they were just not big enough to stop me from enjoying it, and I honestly think it will be the same for most people. I really enjoyed Advent Children, and I encourage other FF7 fans to watch it.
