I watch a lot of movies, but currently my number one genre is Asian horror. I just bought this DVD, and I first found "Janghwa, Hongryeon" an intriguing, but confusing film, since I didn't understand many parts of the story. But in IMDb Board I saw a message titled “Explanation of the masterpiece (all the answers to your questions)“ Quick Download ”), written by opiemar, and I was struck by the high quality of the explanations that this user gave to viewers like me, who missed history points. I would like to thank opiemar for his excellent work and invite him to write the correct summary of this film in IMDb to help and direct other viewers. <br /> <br /> At the end, I agree that “Jangkhwa, Hongrion” is an excellent Korean film, but I don’t give ten votes, because very few people can afford to watch the same movie more than once, as this film requires, and without much support for opiemar, I could not understand the story as a whole. I intend to see this film again soon. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Medo" ("Fear")
