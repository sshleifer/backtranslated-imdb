I came across this site when I was looking for a 1959 Porgy & Bess video or DVD with Sammy Davis as Sportin 'Life. If anyone finds it in a home movie format, please let me know. I talk to my daughters all the time about things that they consider new, which have actually already been done. A couple of years ago we went to a live theater version, and all I could talk about was a movie. Unfortunately, my daughters cannot remember seeing Sammy Davis Jr. in any industry, even though they heard about it. Needless to say, they are not familiar with the other great actors in the film. This is a big understatement - do not shoot this classic film (because of the cast) in the format of home cinema for collectors and future generations. In any case, in my opinion, this version was the best!
