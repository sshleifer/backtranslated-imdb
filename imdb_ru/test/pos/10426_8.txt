I loved this movie well, I liked the romantic part with Colby and the girl ... Rachel (?) I got her name ... I, frankly, was only interested in them. I loved them in the film, I want to see more such films. but please no longer sad endings where they can not be together! = (it made me cry! but the love affair between them. The plot of the injury was great. =) I was just more interested in Colby and Rachel. haha =) everything in this movie was exciting to keep you glued to your place. because I was sure. Honestly, my only personal need would be more focused between a couple (Colby and Rachel) and at least a worthy ending. I hated the final, it was better to come up with more, and not the fact of forcing Colby to his death and Rachel, who gave birth to a son. The ending would kill the movie.
