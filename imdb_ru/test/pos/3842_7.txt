After the release of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937), Walt Disney Productions continued to produce a high-quality animated full-length children's film, many of which I still have not had the pleasure to see. AristoCats (1970), directed by Wolfgang Reiterman, was the twentieth film in the official Disney canon and is a romantic musical comedy revolving around a family of aristocratic cats living in Paris, France, in 1910. In the mansion of an elderly Madame Adelaide Bonfamil (voiced by Hermione Baddeley), her loving cat pets ?? including the duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three young kittens ?? are the most important inhabitants. When the awkward butler, Edgar (Roddy Maud-Roxby), discovers that cats can inherit all the wealth of an old woman, he begins to get rid of domestic animals, throwing them out in the countryside away from the big city. Lost and bewildered, the Duchess and her children make acquaintance with the cute lane cat Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who agrees to show them their way home. <br /> <br /> Animation, “AristoCats” is not particularly remarkable, with much earlier Disney films such as Snow White. and Fantasia (1940), demonstrating a similar or even superior visual style. However, the story is interesting and exciting ?? especially for younger audiences, I will put ?? and the musical numbers {which I would like to be more numerous} are awesome. For the sake of trivia, I’ll call my two favorite songs "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and "Ev'rybody Wants to a Cat", the last of which is a psychedelic return to the late 60s, with an oscillating jazz band and crazy flashing colors led by Fashionable feline called Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers). The return of the family to Paris is an eventful adventure, and we meet such friendly characters as Amelia and Abigail Gabble (two chatty geese), Uncle Waldo (a drunken relative of the couple), Georges Hautekur (an ancient but vigorous lawyer, Madame Bonfamil) and Napoleon Lafayette { two stupid hounds dogs with hunger for butler's priest}.
