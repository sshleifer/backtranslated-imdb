I saw the original rough screen showing 4 times in Gencon a couple of years ago. I was glad I did it, my daughter in the film. <br /> <br /> I stood in the back of the room, watching the young fans sit on the edge of the seats, dead silence, not wanting to miss the line. Constant applause is like watching the fans when the USA hockey team beat the Russians at the Olympics in Montreal. <br /> <br /> I like great comedies and shows. Taxi, Barney Miller, Cheers, Frasier and Married with Chilren are my favorite comedy shows. Little shows I won't even watch. <br /> <br /> This film will help gamers do the same as Animal House during college days, and Dodge Ball for strange sports. Forget about the lack of a mega-budget that supports production. This is pure art, it is so good. <br /> <br /> I could not be happier for the entire film crew and production company.
