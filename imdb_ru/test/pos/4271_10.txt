I saw this movie on a small preview. Even though he had a low budget, the creative leadership and intelligence of the cast helped to make it a small decoration of the film. This is April 8, 1994, each of the characters is about 20 years old and has some artistic ambitions (acting, music, movies, writing) when he learns about the suicide of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain. They quickly get inspiration to go from San Francisco to Seattle and visit Cobain's Vigil. It is here that the film really brings up and shows a series of funny and emotional scenes. Highlights include a visit to the tomb of Jimi Hendirks, the original childhood home of Kurt Cobain and a campfire. Honest and original work.
