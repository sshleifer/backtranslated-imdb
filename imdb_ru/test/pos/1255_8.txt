When I watched the first trailer of this film, I was curious at what angle the storyline narrates. In the end, the plot of how to get yourself back to childhood leaves many possibilities. Bruce Willis, however, does an excellent job with the role he was given. I was surprised to see how well he can act in this part. This is also a good career move, as many others said, but after seeing it, I now agree. Basically, this film tells how to remember the child you were before and that you realize that you are not the same adult that you planned to be. This is a wonderful story and an exciting story that makes us all think. We usually despise the "What if ..." films. For example, Waterworld tried to answer the question "What if the world is covered with water and ...?" But, frankly, nobody cared. This film, however, affects everyone in the theater. True, young children may not fully understand the idea of ​​growing up and destroying all your dreams, but this has a great influence on the adults and parents of these children. This movie is definitely worth seeing. Although, it will be better the second time, because you will not think so much (about how the child got there, and why, and the like) Just relax and have fun. And take something with you when you get out of this cinema. Take that part of your childhood that you forgot and enjoy it.
