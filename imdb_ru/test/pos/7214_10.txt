I think it was Francois Truffaut, who said that the best films are associated either with the joy of making films or with the flour of making films. This film is definitely of the first type. Thromo and Juliet are nice to watch from start to finish. The mad zeal that feeds this Shakespearean Shenanigan is infectious. I don’t think I’ve laughed so hard since I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It's so great!
