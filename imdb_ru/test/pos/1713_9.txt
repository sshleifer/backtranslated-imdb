I enjoyed the old Doctor Who many years ago, so when the new one came out, I just needed to check it out. I was SO pleased - with the characters, storylines, updated look I caught! From the 1st season (27 for old fans) to the 2nd (28th) season, it just continues to improve. It fits well with old TV shows, although you don’t need to know old shows to enjoy this new version. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there was a change in the composition, I highly recommend “Doctor Who” - with Chris Eccleston and David Tennant. <br /> <br /> I like the fact that they give the characters so much depth. The doctor seems more vulnerable in this series, perhaps because he is the last Timeord. The range of emotions that Chris and David show is truly wonderful, and I felt their pain, anger and sense of adventure along with them. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper (Rose) brings a very human element to each episode, although she is much bolder than me. With her talent, Billy will go far into the industry.
