This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! The way someone can tear down this film just blows my mind! First of all, the performances of Gooding and Harris were just spectacular, especially Gooding. This is the only way to describe acting: spectacular! You have to imagine how difficult it would be to play such a character and implement it; then you see Gooding, and his performance was magical. As for the plot, since it is based on a real person, it goes where the characters' lives go. For all fans of action, it may be a little slow, but then it is not an action movie. I definitely put this movie on 10. It deserves no less!
