Jeff Garlin's film is filled with heart and laughter. As in “Curbing Your Enthusiasm,” his screen persona is funny; but in addition, we see both warmth and a sense of emotional vulnerability, which makes history universal. Although the film tells about his character’s dreams of love, success and weight loss, everyone who dreams of a better life will love it. Auxiliary actor brings fun and heartbreaking disappointments and the joys of his life on the screen. The simple joys of food, friendship, and trying again when life has disappointed us are all topics. Using music is creative and adds a lot of pleasure from this movie. Any fan of Jeff Garlin’s television shows should see this!
