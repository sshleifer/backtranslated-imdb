This is another one of those rare films for which I want to meet instead of the usual Hollywood joke. This is indeed a rollercoaster ride, as we watch the effects of a fake 500 euro note for many people. Someone constantly asks "what if," but this is definitely a butterfly effect captured on film. It makes you laugh, cry and bite your lip. I loved every minute of it! And thanks to SBS Australia for showing films that are really interesting and even worth the effort to read the subtitles. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that I will not book a vacation on Iceland - they all seem too depressed - everything must be in such cold weather. In any case, look - it costs every second.
