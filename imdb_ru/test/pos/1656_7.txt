Rififi is a terrific robbery film, from which subsequent robbery films have been shot since then. Jules Dassin has experienced the seedy underworld in which these thieves live - you will not find here the Hollywood glamor of the Ocean of the Eleven. Robbers in Rififi do not rob from thrills, and they do not play the game. They rob to survive, to pay for the upbringing of their children, to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world. The vaunted scene of a robbery is a nail shot in virtual silence. I had a feeling that the plot lasted a little longer than necessary, but the speed race to deliver the child to his mother, which ends the film, is classic. <br /> <br /> Be careful-- -This film is very dull. But it is also very good. <br /> <br /> Rating: A-
