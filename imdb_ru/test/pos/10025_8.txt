Errol Flynn's fraudulent charm really shines through this fascinating and exciting, but historically bankrupt biopic about the famous (and some may say scandalously) General Custer, who follows his career from his first day at West Point, the civil war and the west before the battle in Little Big Horn, at the same time beating his head with rival Arthur Kennedy and the romantic beauty Olivia de Havilland. <br /> <br /> Some may say that Flynn, who is showing a great, brilliant performance as a general, is mainly playing Caster himself! <br /> <br /> Rich performance (which was supposed to be in “Technicolor”), well directed by Raoul Walsh, “They died with their shoes”, contains some really well thought out fighting sequences. It’s also very nice to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse. <br /> <br /> Last year, Flynn played Jeb Stewart along with George Custer Ronald Reagan in “Santa Fe Trail” (also with de Havilland), another exciting game. Warner Brothers products are designed for you to fail a history lesson!
