* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t care what anyone says, this movie is pretty darn cheerful. This is a sequel to the Jack Frost movie about the killer snowman. A snowman is created when a convicted serial killer who is about to be executed is delivered to the execution chamber, but the truck crashes into a truck carrying chemicals for DNA manipulation that bind human DNA to dirt, or in this case snow. The first film was just boring, and ultimately destroy the snowman, filling it with antifreeze. <br /> <br /> Or so they thought. <br /> <br /> This film takes place about a year after the second. Some scientists resurrect Jack Frost by mixing antifreeze with chemicals. No explanation is given to why they do it, they just do it. Meanwhile, the sheriff who arrested Frost first goes to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman goes with him. <br /> <br /> This film has it all. It has a talking carrot that can stand up, ice cubes that explode when you put them in your mouth, and killer snowballs. Yes, killer snowballs. They even say "Dada!" like children. I have to give the creators of this loan. Snowballs - one of the cutest little things in history. I would get one as a pet. Frost finally freezes the island, as if the snowman killer is able to influence the basic weather conditions. <br /> <br /> Then there are the actors. There is Manners, the FBI agent from the first film, except for the fact that here he wears a blindfold. YARR MATEYS, KEEP ME, I WILL BE FBI AGENT! Yarrr! And there is a stereotypical British adventurer and a stereotypical black Jamaican with dreadlocks. And finally, Captain Fan. A prolific man on the planet, without exception. <br /> <br /> This film is not scary, but fun. I laughed until the end, and I recommend this to anyone who loves a good "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> *** out ****
