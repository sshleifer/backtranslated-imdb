"Student Nurse" is a great film, which tells about four women connected by friendship and career. For the first time, you can see a realistic image of relationships within the workplace, outside the workplace, the risks of these relationships and the consequences. This film also provides a rare opportunity to see theater veterans and actress Catherine "Scotty" MacGregor as instructor for the nursing "Miss Boswell". Ms. MacGregor is best known for her performance as Mrs. Oleson on the television series Little House on the Prairie. The direction, music and print color are very good, as well as the opening theme of the song performed by Clancy B. Grass, III. This film offers a rare opportunity for those who love themes related to the late 1960s and early 1970s, which offers a “softer side of life,” appreciating the beauty of a female.
