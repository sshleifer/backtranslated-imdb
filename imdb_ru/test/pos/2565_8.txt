Reading the comments, I was surprised to find that this film is “not very deep.” I have to disagree - it must be one of the most profound and thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes, the game and the music were excellent; they have been praised again and again in reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the film. It resonates with deep meaning and feeling - this is the story of redemption. This is about two very different and very spoiled characters, broken by life, but too strong to lie down and die. We are talking about a man who sees in a girl more value than in himself. It reminded me a lot of the book "The Atonement Love," by Francine Rivers, which has a similar story of redemption. Yes, images and themes are dirty and sometimes shocking, but if you look close enough, you can just see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the real things in life are not beautiful, but they are real.
