Never mind what this socially backward person says above, this show is fun. This shows how many single men are in the atmosphere of the bar, and also shows that women are not as gullible as men think. <br /> <br /> Competitive aspect of how really cool and original. This is not the standard reality show we are all used to. <br /> <br /> Give everyone a chance, we have only one episode, finally, we have Canadian programming, which is not absolute nonsense. Like Canadians, what we usually get is Bon Cop, Bad Cop or Corner Gas. Come on, people, show that we are all not as cunning as the previous reviewer. <br /> <br /> The path to the Comedy Network, giving a chance to a new show. The panel is fun, and the participants are still pretty good.
