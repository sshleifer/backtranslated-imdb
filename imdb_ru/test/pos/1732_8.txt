I just watched the second season finale of Doctor Who, and besides a couple of boring episodes, this show is fantastic. <br /> <br /> This is a sad loss when we say goodbye to the main character again this season. final, but the show continues. <br /> <br /> BBC needs to increase the budget for the show, in London and its surroundings so many things can happen. In addition, some of the special effects, although mostly very good, should be a bit more polished in the odd case. <br /> <br /> For the BBC, it was a huge gamble to return a lost show to him a long time ago, and they need to be congratulated on this. <br /> <br /> Go to the special Christmas edition of 2006, the Christmas special edition of 2005, of course, was the best on television.
