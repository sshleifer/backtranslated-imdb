I had never seen any of the League’s works before the beginning of last year — although when one night they jumped through the canals, I caught the end of one series of three episodes. But last winter I fell in love with the show and its dark, eccentric, and sometimes completely sinister characters. Therefore, when I learned that they had shot a film in which the cute creators of the series met their own characters, I could not order the DVD quickly enough and almost tore it from the hands of my postman when he delivered it. I was so excited to see what the Gents did and how they did it. <br /> <br /> And it was excellent! From the very beginning, when Jeremy (Michael Sheen) is terrorized by Edward, Tubbs and Dad (Dyson, why didn't you play yourself? He is perfectly capable, as viewers of the infamous Highgate House of Horrors know!), Bernice scolds another one? her flocks to Jeff, Herr Lipp and Hilary found that THEY are characters, and this is a great scene. The scenes shot in 1690 are very pleasant: the Gents are turning their hands to even more characters and a completely new plot. The line of David Warner in the role of Doctor Pi is fantastic, a little hiking and very funny. <br /> <br /> The League has always brilliantly combined humor with sadness and emotions - and the culmination of this film, in which Herr Lipp struggles with the idea that he and other residents of Vasya are simply fictional people who can never change who they are or their goal - and to see how it breaks it is really sad and beautiful to watch at the same time, and it really shows the talent of the Ghentz - something for which they still don’t pay attention. <br /> <br /> And you have a pretty clever end - where you sit in wonder - when Joby Talbot plays the beautiful themed music. And you know that you liked a very clever and funny movie.
