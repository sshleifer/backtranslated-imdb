This movie is based on a series of games: Final Fantasy. This one is especially about FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I liked the game, and I was very happy to see it turned into a movie, I liked computer graphics, it was awesome. Lots of great battle scenes, action and characters to make a movie unforgettable. If you're a fan of the game, you'll love this movie. Personally, I'm not a devoted fan of games, but I'm starting to become one. <br /> <br /> My favorite character from Final Fantasy VII, besides Cloud, must be Sid. I love Sid, I think he's cute. I was amazed at how real the images of computer graphics were, it was amazing, this is a game in 3D. I had a great time watching the film, and by the way, I love eons, especially Bahamut, it's great!
