I am so happy that I recorded it on a VHS tape when it was shown in Master Piece Theater. This is a movie that I can watch again and again. Just as living in England in the early 1800s is not hard enough, Prue is born with a “cleft lip” and an outcast from birth. People in her village take her a little, but they always fear that she is “from the forge of the devil” and will turn her on quickly. Especially when a lot of bad luck happens to her family. She is strong and brave, but shies away from Kester Woods, traveling weaver, which catches the eye. Partly because she is afraid of rejection, and also because she thinks he is so manly that he must have a wife, as beautiful as a lily. Kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of that time, and he speaks with his mind and follows his heart. The film remains true to the original story of Mary Webb and fascinating from start to finish.
