Okay, I'm a history buff, and well, I'm an action movie addict, so of course this movie is in my top ten of all time. I really like action movies and unique weapons of that period. I kind of have doubts about fighting a two-handed sword from a horse, and Raisuliâ€™s sword seems more like a katana than a scimitar ... oh well, I also never fought a horse. <Br /> <br /> I also like the attempts of philosophical proverbs. A typical desert dweller probably could not read the Quran, so they would take his word for it. Several authors criticized Connery's judgment, well, on vacation as Young People, I met a South African family in our west, the National Dinosaur Monument, and although they spoke Africans among themselves (yes, second-generation Germans hear the difference) accent. It seems that the one who teaches you, influences your pronunciation. Scottish missionary?
