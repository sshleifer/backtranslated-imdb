* Location of Al Capone <br /> <br /> * Who shot John F. Kennedy? <br /> <br /> * Cynthia Gibb plays the role of "Gypsy" in a television remake of <br /> <br /> some of the great unresolved mysteries of the 20th century. How else can I say this, except that I thought she was terribly awful. Mannequin manners, a bad reactionary game (that is: this empty, stoic look, while he is acting in one of the scenes) and a singing voice that most voice trainers would rate as "mediocre." But she is stunningly gorgeous, and after all, isn't that the character of the gypsy? Sharing their views because she didn't cut mustard in the talent department? <br /> <br /> As for the rest ... Bette is fantastic. Whether she plays herself or Mom Rose plays, it works anyway, and I thought Rosalind Russell was as exciting as the drywall in the original. Herbie's Peter Rigarth is the perfect understated foil for the unsurpassed mother of Bette, and he is the medium-temperature porridge between Midler's hot dish and Gibb's cold stone mash. Rigart is right. <br /> <br /> One of the last cries of the man responsible for Cher's jokes for decades: Bob Maki. Transvestites would kill for the brilliance and glamor exhibited here. Everything comes with sparkles and beads! <br /> <br />
