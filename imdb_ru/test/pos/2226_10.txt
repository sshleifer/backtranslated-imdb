I saw this movie in the theater while on vacation in Pablo, California. I just quit my biomedical hospital work. I consider the script an exaggeration of what is happening in hospitals. <br /> <br /> Idiots, who estimate the cost of production, do not understand the point and probably have never been hospitalized. And never worked in one for sure. Billy Jack (of the same era) was very poorly prepared, but had a significant social comment and was a very good film with a real social message. <br /> <br /> Since then I have been looking for this film, this is the first site I found where it is mentioned.
