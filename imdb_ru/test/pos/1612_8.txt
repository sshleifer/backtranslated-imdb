The controversial novel by Thomas Mann is the basis for the film Death in Venice. Although in the book the hero is the author, in the film director Lucino Visconti, who also wrote the script, turns him into a composer. Thus, the Author / Composer, Gustav von Ashebach (Dirk Bogard), on the verge of mental exhaustion, is a burnt artisan. After a long and successful career, now looking for peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. He decides to go on vacation to Venice, where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambitions. However, staying at the picturesque seaside resort, he attracts the attention of a handsome young teenager, Tadzio (Bjorn Andresen), who looks at him with curiosity and immediately amazes him. Although Gustav is fascinated by wonderful youth, he nevertheless must spend some time away from the boyâ€™s governess (Nora Ricci), while at the same time dealing with the plague of invasion, which seems to have flooded the city. The dialogue of the film, like the novel, remains subtle, as well as several brief meetings between the boy and the artist. In the end. the audience, in contrast to the book, is hampered by insinuations and creative flights of fantasy. Their case is never given a wing, content or opportunity, and if not for the brief permission in the book, the film allows only the possibility of "what if." Nevertheless, one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment of peace to get what is forbidden, subtly but unequivocally criticized by curious eyes. Great story and bogarde classic. ****
