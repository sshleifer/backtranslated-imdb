Better than the average “who the hell” of the Second World War era, in which Warner Baxter was a former gangster who had suffered amnesia and was reborn as a psychiatrist, now known as Robert Ordway, who helps the police and criminals who want to go straight . Dr Kriminal’s bravery is the fourth in a row of ten and also includes a victim who may have some mental problems. The reference to “courage” is not particularly clear. <br /> <br /> This entry is related to the death of Fortunate Hunter Gordon Carson, whose two previous wives are under mysterious circumstances and who, in turn, dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide, but Dr. Ordway calls murder . Hillary Brooke plays the role of the widow Kathleen Carson, who is associated with Anthony Caruso - a mysterious Spanish dancer, whose role includes his sister, who disappears on stage. Being a mysterious novelist, Jerome Cowan is a good supporting actor, as is Lloyd Corrigan as a connoisseur of crime. <br /> <br /> Creepy houses with creaking doors, caskets in the basement and suspects who are never seen in daylight add uncertainty to the air. The set for the dance sequence is quite complicated, and the ballet music is very good. Direction, production design and photos stand out. External shots and costumes suggest greater abundance than is usually found in the usual thriller "B". <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
