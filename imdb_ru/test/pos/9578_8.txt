I admit that I have never seen Waiting for Guffman, a 1997 comedy film about a small town that puts on a theatrical performance. When the “Best in Show” ad had the slogan “From the team that made you wait for Guffman,” a significant number of critics in their reviews meant that only people who are familiar with the film or its directors and actors will have a good time after seeing this film. Shame, critics, shame two times! Any critic who implies something like this with any film probably does not want to share the richness of the film with the rest of the world, but this is one film that I hope people will see now that this is a video / DVD. Best in Show is without a doubt the best comedy of the year 2000. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an extraordinary style, talking about the main competitors (not to mention the chatter) of the annual Mayflower "Best In". Show “competition” where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see which one is the best. We have a nice and amiable Harry Pepper (Guest) with his bloodhound, simple Jerry and Flekom Cookies (Levy and O'Hara) with their terrior, yuppie with nuts Hamilton and Meg Swan (Hitchcock and Posey), groomers, gay men Scott Dolan and Stefan Wanderhoof (Higgins and McKean), as well as millionaire Cherie Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) and her trainer Christy Cummings (Lynch). All of them are focused on one simple object: Blue ribbon, which will be presented to the best dog. And ... should I tell you everything else? <br /> <br /> Director / screenwriter / star The idea of ​​humor Guest is what assures me that there are comedies to laugh at and that the idiocy of films such as American Pie or other nonsensical “teenage” movies, after all, won't take over the world. His idea is simple: make your comedy not just funny, but SMART funny. But instead of following the brilliant tracks of such films as “Zero Effect” and “High Accuracy”, he used a rather unusual approach (and, as I understand it, he also used this approach for “Guffman”). Regardless of whether you notice it or not, a very large part of the film is improvisation. In other words, what the actors say and do was probably not written in the script, it may not even have been dreamed of by Gest and the co-author / star Levi. But with a gentle hand from the Guest, he and the actors carried out a cheerful theatrical feat, which probably would have failed if it had managed to cope with other, less experienced actors. Now it is clever! <br /> <br /> Of course, the cast is what makes improvisation most effective. They are all (comedic) miracles, especially Guest, like Pepper. But the real outstanding must be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin, an ignorant announcer at a competition who can unleash the most incredibly funny stories and comments that even the announcer would not have dreamed ... that is, if the announcer tried funny. Williard can move from talking about a dog to a sudden continuation of a conversation about how much he can bench press. There is even a part where he puts forward an idea for a new marketing strategy: let sexy women pose in tight shirts and shorts with dogs and imply something like a “doggy style of time”. This is priceless, as is his presentation. <br /> <br /> I hope that people will participate in this 90-minute "dogmatic". The film deserves so much recognition. He was nominated for Best Comedy on Golden Globes, but did not win. I do not understand why. I mean, in the comedy department, he is the best in the show. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A
