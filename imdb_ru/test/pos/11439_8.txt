"The Gig" is a tough, funny and poignant little film about a group of friends who regularly get together to play Dixieland for fun. The group unexpectedly gets a real high-paying job, in the language of a musician; "concert". <br /> <br /> They are going to upstate New York for a two-week concert at a summer resort without a single participant who dodges because of cancer. At the last minute they hire a professional to take his place. Everything becomes bad when a Frankie Valley type tries to return to the resort and use the group as his group. <br /> <br /> The attitude of the professional bass player to the guys sounded believable. By signing up for a two-week concert, they took bread from their mouths to someone who needed work to feed his or her family. While pop, rock, rap, country and western, as well as R & B stars make money on albums. Jazz musicians have to travel abroad to earn a living. Almost no one gets rich. Guys who live their dreams also cost the other income. <br /> <br /> I believe that almost everyone who knows how to play a musical instrument with some kind of skill dreams of playing a paid "concert", Woody Allen Kevin Bacon - two popular examples of this crossover from an amateur to a professional. I especially recommend this film to anyone who has ever played music professionally. My mother, who was a musician, loved it.
