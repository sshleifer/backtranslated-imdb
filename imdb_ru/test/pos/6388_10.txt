Super original. Really great movie! James Franco and Sienna Miller look really good on screen together. I really hope that this will be released soon. I first saw this movie on the show. Because of my age and gender, I was asked to stay on "conversation." We all have to comment on the film, and many people did not like it. I really loved it, and I don't know why so many people didn't think it was so good. See when it comes out and decide for yourself! If you are going to watch this movie, you may want to do it without knowing it. When I went to the show, I did not know anything except what was called "Camilla." It is really worth seeing.
