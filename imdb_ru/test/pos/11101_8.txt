John Shelezinger's career as a director was extraordinary. We watched this movie when it first came out, but wanted to see it again when it was recently shown on cable. The film looks faded, as it is watched today, but, nevertheless, it is interesting because of the intense performances of two directors. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, please do not read further. <br /> <br /> Chris and Donton were two childhood friends who came from the upper middle class. Chris went to seminary to become a priest, but he gives up. Dalton became a little drug addict and drug dealer. It seems that these two lives run in parallel, as the couple are involved in illegal activities that prove their short-sightedness. In fact, it shows how both young men miscalculated in their attempt to deceive the CIA and the Soviet Union. These two, in some ways, were so naive, thinking that they could pull out something more, and better prepared people could not even imagine that it could be done. <br /> <br /> Chris’s motivation is legitimate, as he feels outraged at discovering the behind-the-scenes role of the agency in which he works in dealing with other nations, in this case Australia, something he finds pure chance. When he engages Dalton, we know that everything is doomed, because no one who uses drugs like him will ever be worth anything. In fact, Chris and Donton did not have the slightest idea of ​​the scale of what they were trying to do, or of its consequences. <br /> <br /> During this period of his career, Timothy Hutton was an actor who was going to different places. He proved that he has a talent for working in other films, so Mr. Schlesinger chose him naturally, and this choice pays off. Sean Penn was also a young actor who showed intensity like no one had seen before. In fact, from time to time, Mr. Penn reminded us of the young Robert Mitchum in the making. The contribution of both actors to the film is incredible. No one can think who could play this duet except them. <br /> <br /> “The Falcon and the Snowman”, although not at the same level as the other films of the great John Schlesinger, is an interesting look for our too distant past
