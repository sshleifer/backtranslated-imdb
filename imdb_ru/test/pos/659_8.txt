In fact, I was about 13 years old at a campsite near the McCloud River, near Shasta, when this film was shot. My family was paid to leave our camp this afternoon, when they were shooting Vincent, floating on the river. A small trifle ... the scene where he was dragged out was actually where he began his voyage on the river. And if the stunt man missed the grid, then about 1/4 of a mile down there was a waterfall 20 feet long. <br /> <br /> In any case ... I watched it at the time and did not understand. Only a few years later, when I saw the film and understood its meaning. This is quite a powerful film and, of course, Yana's wonderful work at such a young age. His film career never developed as expected, but, of course, he later achieved success on television. I would like this movie to be available, because I would like to see it again.
