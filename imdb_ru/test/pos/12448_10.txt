Slipknot is a hardcore rock band from Des Moines, Iowa. Nine members of the group, who all wear individual suits and individual homemade masks (for example, clown mask No. 6, various gas masks No. 0, torn and torn mask dummy No. 8 with dreadlocks). It seems that the music itself passes a fine line between the sensible and the rest, but it is performed so brilliantly and psychotic. <br /> <br /> “Welcome to Our Neighborhood” sounds more like a common name, but the video itself is something else. Interviews with the band, sound bites from their latest album with their own titles, 2 live performances and one music video banned by MTV (a brilliant tribute to Kubrick's classic movie “The Shining”), the film does not even show half an hour, but definitely worth it. It is perfect for presenting any metal / hardcore fan in Slipknot.
