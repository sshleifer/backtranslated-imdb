This is very good, considering all the circumstances. A must for anyone who is puzzled by the opposite sex (that is, for all of us!). The trailer does not reveal the plot for a good reason. <br /> <br /> The premise is absurd, so it's nice to see that she does not take herself seriously. As if someone from the children's department of the BBC decided to make a film for adults. This is nice, IMO. <br /> <br /> 7/10
