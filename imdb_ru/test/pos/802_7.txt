The film was very good. I am an avid fan of secrets, and I usually find out who is killed and who is killed. While I found out who will be killed, I did not understand who did it. I was not happy with the image of the hero Gerda, but given the year in which the film was to take place, it is quite possible that a woman would be such a “cover”. Please know that although these films by Poirot are good, they simply have no such dynamics as in the series, because they do not have Jupp, Miss Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I saw every actor who played him. The worst was Peter Ustinov!
