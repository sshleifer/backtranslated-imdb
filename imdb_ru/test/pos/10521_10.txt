Another one that escaped the radar of most people. This little gem, created in the B genre, is so full of new ideas in the old genre and so refreshing and inventive that a terrible feeling of lack of related products in a modern cinema slowly covers your body. The latest set is so innovative in its setting and style that it anticipates everyone from Tarantino to John Woo. Oh, and if you think that the "dying lines" are all cliches, wait for the dying line FF. The part of the dialogue that could break you laughing will capture your heart. A real pleasure. Look and see it. You will not regret.
