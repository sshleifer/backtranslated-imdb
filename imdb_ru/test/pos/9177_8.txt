- It is difficult to love in this fast-food society in which we live, so a man named Hitch commits to helping men find love with women in whom they are madly in love. his rules are that he only helps you find love, not just casual sex, which seems very useful, but soon rumors begin to spread, and people begin to misunderstand what he is doing, which begins to complicate the relationship with the woman he just found out he is madly in love. <br /> <br /> - I must say, it's very nice to see Will Smith in a film in which he is not trying to save the world from aliens or robots. There are no jaw effects, and he does not brag about his inflated body. He is just a normal person in this film who was really good. He doesn't necessarily stretch his acting muscles in this film, but again, the story does not require it, but it was still nice to see him relaxed and not showing off his torn body to make those of us without six packs envy, His character here is such the same as all his characters, cute, witty and very charming, which seems to be shared by almost all the characters of this strange love story. Kevin James's character is a regular guy who needs help to get acquainted with the girl of his dreams, which really makes you feel the guy and cheer for him at every step. the only character that was a sore point for me was Mendez's character, because she is so cold and calculated that it is hard to believe that Smith can fall in love with her. He must love the challenge, I think. <br /> <br /> - this is now part of a review, in which I joked that I would never need Hitch, because I am such a player, but I just wrote about 16 reviews for another website, and I’ve all I'm still working on a small project, so now I'm a little exhausted. While the film is filled with a sufficient amount of charm and pleasant characters with funny lines, it slowly but surely plunges into a sea of ​​patterned romantic films, in which, after a big scene where a terrible secret is revealed, everything is forgiven, and relationships become even better . But, hey, there are about 4,000 films about losers overcoming disasters, so I think that another film with a predictable ending made almost to death will not do much harm. I really like the idea of ​​the movie, because in the end, you don’t need a formula to find the right girl, just be yourself, and everything gets into the game, which is the theme of the movie and why it works so well. I am sure that if it turned out that the character of James gets the girl after all that the character of Smith said, then it would be a rather empty film, but in its current form it works very well. <br /> <br /> Despite predictability, this is the perfect movie about the date. It's cute, funny and romantic, so anyone who watches this movie on a date should get a bit after it ends. and by some I mean sex
