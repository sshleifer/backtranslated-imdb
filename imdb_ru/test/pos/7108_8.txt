“House of Dracula” is a good continuation of “House of Frankenstein”. There are not many actions there, but the game is just as good. Onslow Stevens is a benevolent Doctor who becomes ill after receiving blood from Dracula through a transfusion (Dracula actually received a transfusion to overcome his “misfortune,” but he casts a spell on the hunchback nurse and then transfuses his blood into the Doctor.) It turns out that Dracula didn’t really come to look for a cure, but instead he drained blood from a beautiful nurse. Dracula is destroyed, and Wolfman is next in line for the cure (which is successful). At the same time, the monster of Frankenstein was discovered and restored for a short time before being burned to death (do not worry, the same trio returned to Abbott and Costello, meet Frankenstein). John Carradine plays the sinister Dracula again (Baron Latos is his pseudonym at the beginning of the film and in "House of Frankenstein"). Lon Cheney is a handsome Wolfman, and Glenn Strange returns as Frankenstein's monster. Lionel Atville plays Inspector again, which he often does in monster movies at Universal Studios.
