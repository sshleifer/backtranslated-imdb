I'm not sure that the discussion of a television series is exactly the place to which comments should be addressed, but it was on television that the Lone Ranger really made a name for itself. I don't even mean the original radio shows of this rider in a mask. on the plains, I mean the point where in a little boy, about 9 or 10 years old, I had to watch the movie "The Lone Ranger" and never forgot it. I can remember that I was on the line or we were moving towards the Paramount Theater - the theater was located in the theater district, if I remember correctly. He was right across the road, heading east to the west of the building, which contains a ball falling on New Year's Eve - this, of course, if someone I don’t know, New York. High above the street, there was time on the roof, and maybe even today huge billboards advertised what they were showing, and so on. At that moment, I looked up and was never as impressed as when I looked at the Lone Ranger billboard over the roof - It was great - It made an impression and was never forgotten. That day we went to see the Lone Ranger. It was a story about how the Lone Ranger was born. Awful Ambush in Texas. The Rangers invaded and the subsequent revival of one of his fallen heroes. In this film, we learn that the Lone Ranger will shoot, not to kill, but to hurt the law to be the judge. This type of thinking is worth the fact that it may be useful for us to learn something from history. It is here that we learn that Tonto discovers the fallen ranger and, seeing the symbol of childhood friendship, which the Lone Ranger established many years ago, when he, as a young man, came to the aid of a wounded young man in Tonto. For his assistant, Tonto handed his faithful friend the symbol of his thanks, which was now part of a necklace that Tonto recognized. Tonto said: "You are Kemosabe." The lone ranger said, “Kemo Sabe, is this familiar? Then Tonto tells the story of this "r" rusty scout "(in the meaning of Kemosabe). I think the Lone Ranger is one of the true heroes of the movie screen and one of the great heroes of television. It should also be noted that these very respected people Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels sought to live there according to the legend of the “Lone Ranger.” It is quite possible that there is an inspiring story in the history of the “Lone Ranger” and its faithful companion Tonto. I myself was very happy to be able to find and buy DVDs that I did not sleep all saturday morning and looked set of episodes that are now available. Long live the Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto-Hee-ho Silver-
