** SPOILERS ** A beautifully photographed piece of life telling the love story of World War II with Norman Rockwell’s pictures at the beginning and end of the film that the “war hero” is not just the one who kills for his country, but also the one he thinks for himself and is not corrupted by military propaganda, which is constantly driven into his head. Marion Marine Hedge Hedgepet, Jan Michael-Vincent, was expelled from training camp after five weeks and forced to wear a Baby Blue Marine uniform, which shows that he simply did not have to make a hull. Humiliated and despised, wherever he goes when he goes home to St. Louis, he was horrified that his family, whom his father served in the Marine Corps in World War I, thought of him because he could not " Cut Mustard "as a US Marine. <br /> <br /> Hedg, stopping at a bar and finding a marine in it, next to him, is a fearless and deadly marine, Richard Gere, whom Hedge admires buys beer. The conversation with Richard Hedge is shocked when he learns that he is not only sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the battles in which he fought and the medals he received, but also completely gray hair and the look of thirty-year-old Richard will be 21 next month ! That's what he did in the Marine Corps and World War II! Buying Hedge a few drinks, Richard takes the drunken Baby Blue to the street and knocks him out, taking his Blues Blues, and leaves his impressive US Marine uniform with some money for Hedge. <br /> <br /> As soon as Hedge puts on Richard's uniform that suits him, he comes across this big drunk American paratrooper who calls himself Cementhead wishing to have a fistfight with the Marine raider. Hedge, doing everything possible to avoid trouble, forces Cement-Head to fasten it, after he broke two bottles of beer over his cement-head, to warm up for the big fight between Marina, Hedge, and Parachutist, Cement. Head. Hedge is incredibly large cement slabs floors, knocking him out with a single blow! “I think the trick is not to hit him on the crown of the head,” says stunned Hedge, his Cement-Heads, comrades G.I. <br /> <br /> Hitchhiking to this small town, Bidwell Hedge, notices this American military camp for Japanese-Americans who are there because they are considered to be a threat to US security. Later in the film, Hedge shows everyone what a real hero he is, and not what the city dwellers consider him, risking his life to save one of the hated "Japs" who, mindlessly along with two of their friends, escaped from the burial camp, where take them think they go anyway? Hedge risked his life, saving a scared-to-death Japanese-American from drowning in the dangerous rapids outside the city. Hedge in his actions taught the Bidwell people that not all “Japs”, even those who are American citizens, are bad and insidious banzai screaming suicidal kamikaze, as they thought in the newspaper magazines and films of the time, to think that they were . <br /> <br /> Hedge starts a conversation with a very nice and sweet waitress at the local diner Rose Hadkins, Glynnis O'Connor, who is just crazy about him, that even Hedge first thinks that this is his form and not he impressed her. Later, when Hedge confesses to Rose, that he is not what she and her parents, the American marine raider, think, that he is Rose, by that time had so well recognized the sweet and caring, washed-out marine, that it didn’t matter to her. all he had to be, a marine or a post office worker, that was what was in his heart really matters. <br /> <br /> There are several touching and beautiful scenes between Hedge and Rose in the film, which show how films were made many years ago without all the sex and profanity that we see and hear in today's films that feature two people in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Like the film is not exactly fake talk, it shows the true feelings of ordinary Americans, then in 1943, about the war in general and Japanese in particular, could not be made in a more authentic and accurate, as well as good taste . “Baby Blur Marine” is doing everything possible not to be too politically correct, not to show the same feelings and ideas to the heroes or leading actors and actresses in the film during World War II, which most people have that seem to be false as a three-dollar bill for those people who watch the film, who lived in those historical and significant times when the film was to take place.
