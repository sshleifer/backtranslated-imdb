Meryl Streep may be the greatest actor working today. Her chameleonic image never ceases to amaze; she seems to be actually the characters she displays on the screen. In The One True Thing, she gives life to a deceptively direct, very difficult woman who tries her best to play the hand that life has given her. Surviving with cancer is not an easy task, and not just surviving, but actually continuing to live your life is even more difficult - and this is exactly what Kate Gulden (Strip) wants to do. Renee Zellweger ("Jerry Maguire") not only keeps himself in this exalted company, but also shines like the daughter of the Strip, who is learning to see in the new light the lives of her parents, as well as her own. Streep is a powerhouse and deservedly received an Oscar nomination for its work here; her dialogue “I am going to say it only once” will leave you empty. Zellweger, however, is a true revelation — her face conveys every emotion, every conflict, when she begins to learn many truths about the strengths and weaknesses of her parents. Directed by Karl Franklin (“The Devil in a Blue Dress”) handles extremely complex story material with confidence and delicacy.
