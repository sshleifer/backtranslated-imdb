This film is hard to knock. This follows from the tradition of Pulp Fiction, but succeeds in stamping out its own unique style. The cast is great, the script is great - and things like a strange (Pulp Fiction-esque) timing sequence are brilliantly done. I especially like how the images presented in flash memory vary greatly depending on who tells the story at the time. When this is one of the criminals found to be fraud, everything looks luxurious and cool, but when this is a memory of a hero, everything becomes disgusting and disgusting. <br /> <br /> This is a terrific movie - and therefore I am extremely annoyed to find that I cannot buy it anywhere!
