It is fun and fast, as one lie leads to another, and the other to the inevitable, surprising conclusion. Waiting separates this Holiday Click from all others. You wonder how the pieces will fit, both during the film and in the future. <br /> <br /> Character actors laid the foundation and entertained us in the process. Sinkevich (Frank Jenks) shows us what manipulation can get ... and, ultimately, what kind of manipulation can cost! Uncle Felix (SZ Sakall) evaluates each person for us, trying to protect "Lishka" (Barbara Stenvik), and this helps us decide who we will end up with in the end. <br /> <br /> If we ever reach the ideal world, imperfect people may have to go through a series of similar events. <br /> <br /> A clear disadvantage is that the fake child cries after he allegedly swallowed Uncle Felixâ€™s watch. I heard more real crying from a doll in a toy store. <br /> <br /> Take a look, and you will really feel that you have been somewhere!
