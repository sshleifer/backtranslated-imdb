Best short I've ever seen. Some commentators suggest that it could be lengthened due to the density of the presentations that it offers. In this comment there is irony and a little merit. It all depends on Noonan, and he perfectly tolerates his ungrateful character. I might prefer the narrator to be less “recognizable,” but the gravity provided was completely perfect. This reduction is for people who read, for those whose bar is set high, and for those who admit that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can fake opposing and bitter advocates of beauty. Beautiful short film. FWIW: I was pleased with the reference to Picasso, because once I believed that Picasso was just another artistic whore with a little talent; like, I suppose, most people - until the day when I saw a few drawings that he did when he was 12 years old. Picasso was an excellent draftsman and a brilliant artist at this age than many artists will ever become in life. I immediately understood why he had to make art, which he became famous.
