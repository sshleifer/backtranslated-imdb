Christopher Nolan’s first film is a black and white “no budget” film about an unemployed writer who begins to stalk strangers, which in turn leads to looting and violence. It is very good. <br /> <br /> As in his later film “Souvenirs”, he does not present history linearly. Instead, he hesitates a bit, so you end up not cope with trying to put the pieces together, and early, apparently random shots take on meaning as the movie progresses. This style also means that turns are much more effective. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing if you have a chance (especially if you like his later work and / or film Noir)
