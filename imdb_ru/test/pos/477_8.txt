The actors in this dark film are really believable and well played. The quality of the camera makes you feel that you are here. The script is intense and does not ferment. The plot that makes you want to watch it a second time, from a new point of view, obtained in the final. We showed this film to a small group of patrons at the Gadsden Cultural Arts Center. After the film, the regular patron really wanted to discuss the film, and one person called me the next day to say that they were still "concerned." While we impose an age limit of 18 years and older on a film, I watch a film with a youth group, as this is a very real depiction of an ugly situation and sets the stage for a good conversation.
