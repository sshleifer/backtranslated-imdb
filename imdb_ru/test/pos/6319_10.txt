Although this film may not be the next “Evil Dead” (damn it, who knows, maybe it will be released just a year ago) Worth seeing. Do not wait for the movie for 10 million dollars. Because you will be disappointed. REALLY expect you to have fun, laugh and have fun. Everything in this entire film is MUCH better than many, if not all low-budget horror films. I saw films that spent 10 or 20 times more than it was worth making this film, and turned out to be 100,000,000 times worse. The efforts that have been made to this film away weigh the controversies he faces with a limited budget. Films are meant to be fun, and this film certainly does. In fact, this film may even open new doors for you in watching a movie. It is available on Netflix, if not at the local video rental store. So look, then decide.
