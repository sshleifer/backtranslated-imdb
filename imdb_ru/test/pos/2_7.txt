My criterion for measuring the ability to watch a movie is if I get tortuous. If I start to change positions and notice that my ass hurts, the film is too long. This movie didn't even get boring. Predictable in some parts, of course, but never boring. <br /> <br /> Love notes about them were written in all the other military departments, and they saw their recruitment level rising, why did the Coast Guard also? They are definitely undervalued until the day comes when your boat sinks. <br /> <br /> The film was very enjoyable and fun. Kevin Costner is as beautiful as an aging macho who doesn't know when to quit. Nevertheless, I was most impressed by the performance of Ashton Kutcher. I never loved him, never watched any of his TV shows and always considered him immature ... well, punk. In this film, it works great! He is already on his way to being a leading man. I think that the film that was shown to us was supposed to be a draft or something like that, because approximately 2/3 of the way the film became very grainy, the sound level fell, and microphones fell everywhere. Also on the show were representatives of the film who were looking for feedback from the audience, especially those parts of the film that we did not like. <br /> <br /> ***** POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I gave was on aa. a couple of lines at the beginning. Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife, Sela Ward, collects things and leaves. He says: "Maybe I should be the one who leaves." And she replies: â€œNo, you do not know where something is in this house; I have to go there. " It does not make sense: if she knows the layout so well, Costner is right, he must leave.
