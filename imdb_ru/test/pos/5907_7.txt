I saw Jimmy Stewart in all the usual roles, but as reported, "The Spirit of St. Louis" was one of his favorites. A bad box office when released, today this film has been largely forgotten. Telling the well-known story of the famous flight of Lindberg in 1927, Stuart at first seems very unfortunately abandoned, and his well-known voice never lets you forget who you are watching; looks like George Bailey over and over. But Stewart obviously worked diligently on the role, and he does everything right, so soon you donâ€™t care that Stewart was 20 years older than the man he portrays. Lindberg Stewart is so damn all-American, pleasant-tasting apple pie that you get into the story, and you realize that Stewart intended to portray Lindberg with all the amazing things, Yankee know-how, which he could put up. Lindberg was almost a mythical hero in the United States, and Stuart seems determined to keep up with his appearance. <br /> <br /> Flashback is cleverly used to promote a rather boring story, and I was struck by the subtle references to Vera, which were scattered throughout the film; Lindberg tries to teach a hopeless priest to fly, but he has to confront his convictions, or Lindberg refuses to wear the proposed medal of St. Christopher to save weight on the plane, only to find the medal hidden in his breakfast bag. after he crossed the atlantic. For me, this film is not about the epic journey of a man into the unknown, but about the fact that he realizes that this life is much more than what we can see and feel.
