This is one of the best "Bloke" films of the early 90s, and although it is a bit out of date, it is one of those films that will never be released today, which makes it special! In fact, a very similar film was shot in the 90s under the title “Masterminds”, and it was a variation of PG on the same theme, but it was not so much fun and realistic. <br /> <br /> What's so special about this movie? This is a companion between the main characters and the theme of the film. Sean Astin is very cute and starred in some of the most memorable films of the 80s / 90s, in particular in Guni. He also went on more with the trilogy "Rudi" and "The Lord of the Rings", but "Man Encino" is a good journey through the memory lane. Will Wheaton from Stand by Me provides good support for the film, and Andrew Divoff is a terrific villain. Louis Gossett Jr. is moaning in his role, but he adds a bit of shortness to the film, especially his relationship with the rebellious character Astin. <br /> <br /> So how are you? By today's standards, it looks rather tedious and cheap, almost like a television film, but production values ​​are good, and violence is actually quite unpleasant for a film involving schoolchildren. However, the director compensates for a limited budget with some pleasant moments and a good position of humor. <br /> <br /> So leave your brain at the door and enjoy this fondly memorable fighter, but don't expect Oscar stuff!
