Many people say that the end does not make sense, but this was the case. After the death of the vampire woman, the connection with the earth was broken, and the ship flew away, taking a lot of life force from hundreds of thousands of souls. Enough to recharge these hexagonal cells and create new bats. It seems they have no carnal sex, like the legendary vampires. <br /> <br /> Vampire bats from space can be ridiculous, but killing them in the center of power below the heart is quite logical. All you can ask for is consistency. The viewer must suspend disbelief, even for scifi. <br /> <br /> The only problem is to be a sword or stake, not bullets. This makes a supernatural twist that doesn’t fit science fiction. So this is the problem. <br /> <br /> The only serious discrepancy that I discovered is the killing of male vampires with a sword, but the soul of the girl and Carlsen rise onto the ship. I assume that the souls of the men also went up to the ship, but they were not shown. <br /> <br /> How about all the dead people? Do their forces of power ("souls") move on the ship as separate entities, do all the life force come together for use as needed? In other words, all human souls who came to the ship could be reincarnated as bats. <br /> <br /> The basic concept is no more ridiculous than “Strength” or even the reincarnation of “Star Wars”. <br /> <br /> This movie was overtime, the kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead meets Alien meets Dracula), but in many ways deep. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and the end were unearthly. It all started (“what happens to me”) and ended in a love story. <br /> <br /> Much of the criticism of the film about its quirkiness. So that? Bizarre is an art form. How funny it all fits. The concept of the plague is much more interesting and thinner than aliens, just killing people. Perhaps they do not need the blood of Patrick Steward to form the image of a girl, but it was a very distant, surreal scene. <br /> <br /> Another reason the movie hates is the end. But the end fits perfectly in the beginning. People are so immersed in the naked girl that they miss the essence of the film. This is a love story, from start to finish. It all starts with Carlsen and the girls on the alien ship and ends the same way. So perfect. Most people are fixated on a hero who kills a monster, and this film is not over, and that's why I love him. <br /> <br /> Instead, he has a happy ending: two of them return to the ship to be reborn. Much cooler than a hero kills a monster, but that is why he is bombed. It was not a direct horror or even fantasy / horror in general, but a love story with a beautiful beginning and end. All these souls flicker on the ship. And the crystal room is pulsing with new life. <br /> <br /> Most people cannot cope with a love story in which the Alien meets the Dawn of the Dead and Dracula.
