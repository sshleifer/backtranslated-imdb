Black Castle is one of those films that are included in the Boris Karloff collection, and it is mistakenly expected to be a frank horror film. Despite the fact that some elements of horror are present in the Nathan Juran film, this is truly a multi-genre piece that has been carefully thought out and effectively depicted. Karloff, who plays a small but important role, was joined by Richard Green, Stephen McNally, Lon Cheney, Jr., Rita Corday, John Hoyt and Michael Pate. Not surprisingly, it is made from Universal International Pictures. The plot shows how the English gentleman Green goes to the castle to the house of the ominous Count von Bruno {McNally}. He is following the investigation into the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that is fraught with dangers and surprises at every turn. <br /> <br /> There is everything that fans of the old subgenre of a dark house / castle can wish for. , Genuine good and bad guys, a beautiful girl, dark corners for committing dark deeds, devilish traps, a finale with a ticking clock, and we even get good old-fashioned nonsense in a deal. All the actors play spectacular roles, especially Green and the wonderfully mocking McNally. While Jerry Sackheim writes poorly and devoid of meaningless filler, which is so often tied up in such films of this kind. A highly recommended movie, provided that Karloff fans understand that this is not really Karloff's film, and perhaps more importantly, horror fans do not expect blood to become commonplace of the day. A wonderful atmospheric story with a feeling of fear everywhere, the Black Castle is a wonderful viewing experience. 7/10
