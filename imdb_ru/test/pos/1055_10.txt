I met this film in the mid-eighties, when he was a teenager, and he immediately became one of my favorite holiday and non-holiday films. As you can see from other reviews, this movie has a very good storyline, and great actors are signed to it. <br /> <br /> Stanvik is gorgeous, like a bride who thinks second. Dennis Morgan's game is also strong. He goes unnoticed in most films, but was a very capable actor, watch Kitty Foyle. In this film, he plays a guest sailor who removes Stanwick from her husband. <br /> <br /> This is a Christmas classic. Settings and story make a great Christmas romance
