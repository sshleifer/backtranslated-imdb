This is an amazingly tough drama telling about various aspects of the international heroin drug trade - from the hills of northern Pakistan, where silently allowed cultivation of opium poppy occurs on a huge scale; on Eurotrachs in Germany and England, which organize the import of processed heroin in smuggled goods of several kilograms; end users who are on the network of addiction and crime necessary to support their growing habit; and finally, all levels of corruption and hypocrisy on the part of the international government associated with the police’s efforts to control the “drug problem” - this drama is drafted with a wide range of comprehensively developed characters, a fully developed plot and an excellent game of characters. and shooting from the spot. <br /> <br /> This is put in their place by Hollywood epics such as French Connection. <br /> <br /> Traffic is a deeply provocative and disturbing story about modern drug-related espionage and the international efforts of many people to eliminate it. <br /> <br /> In contrast to many drug-related “crime dramas,” Traffic focuses on identifying the social * reasons * that people fall into addiction .. As one character says: “... for now we, as a society, cannot build a world in which people want to participate, instead of fleeing from it, we cannot prevent people from taking drugs ... ”" <br /> <br /> This is an exciting and completely exciting drama. I highly recommend it!
