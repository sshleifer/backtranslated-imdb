It is difficult to judge the "Imaginary Heroes", not referring to the fact that the director and screenwriter Dan Harris is only 25 years old. You are unlikely to believe, seeing this film, which is not only a mature work, professional and deep, but also some of the shortcomings of the routine are characteristic of older directors. <br /> <br /> The scene is an American suburb, too familiar with “American Beauty” or “Desperate Housewives.” As in American Beauty, the film unfolds around suicide, but here it happens at the beginning of the film, and we can only observe how the middle-class family copes with the death of the gifted athlete, brother and son. Emil Hirsch plays a younger brother, Sigourney Weaver is a mother, both are great at trying to cope with the loss, find the cause and the motivation for survival. Harris manages his actors with a confident hand, and the first two sections of the film (four seasons in total, like the seasons of the year) create excellent tension with authentic dilemmas and real issues. This is the second part of the film, which is a bit disappointing, it looks too tired and ordinary, and I suspect that the producers may have interfered with the work of the young scriptwriter and director, trying to bring it closer to the Hollywood convention. That is why this film is not a dismal version of The Beauty of America with a different focus. However, I am sure that in the coming years we will hear a lot about Dan Harris.
