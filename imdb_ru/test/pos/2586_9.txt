Just returned with a moan of the Black Snake. I spent time reading reviews ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... "skinny white girl chained to a black man's emitter" ... I hate it when "critics" miss the point of the film. Now I suppose it helps me that I live in Memphis ... and I also lived in Mississippi a couple of times. It may also help that I’m the former director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get this film. Brewer's simple “story of redemption” is easy to follow, and she could have different themes to tell the story ... but I think it’s very effective as a “blues”. I hope people don’t read all the hype ... and / or various reviews ... and miss a really good movie. Overcome various things like skinny girls in white panties ... pass by Justin Timberlake, accept his character Ronnis (in which he plays very well) ... pass by "Snake on an airplane" and see what mercurik Samuel L. Jackson is. .. how it turned into a very believable blues from the Middle South. If you know little about the culture of the Middle South, much of what is happening may seem cartoony ... but accept the fact that Craig Brewer KNOWS how to draw a canvas and allow the actors to tell a story and you will like this movie. Not one who talks about endings ... so go watch this movie ... and yes, I agree with one thing that the critics correctly understood ... the music is beautiful!
