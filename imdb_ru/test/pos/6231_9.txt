I really liked this one. I know that this is rampant with what is now a cliché and replays a lot, but it was a hell of a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> In our pursuit of the horror cheese of the 70s and 80s, we are faced with many clicks that are so bad, they are good. We also have such "good" that they suck, and then we have such bad that they are just bad. This is definitely so bad, this is good. <br /> <br /> Some teenagers traveling face an “oasis” in the middle of nowhere, a forgotten part of roadside America, and decide to “test it.” They cross every line of inappropriate, until it is absurd, and they pay for it. They pay dearly. <br /> <br /> I usually would not put a film like this on 9, but the girls in this film are the type that we miss since the 1970s: vile, poorly dressed and FIT. This is not an anorexic from today's terrible horror; They look great in shorts with booty. <br /> <br /> I give it 9 out of 10 children.
