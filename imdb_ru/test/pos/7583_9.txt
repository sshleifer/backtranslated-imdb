In the history of cinema, every great director had to create the first film. Many times, if you look after they become successful, a light bulb lights up in our heads. Communication is established, and we see a solid foundation from which they began. So it is with HORSE ON MARS. It is a subtle humor, woven around a seemingly direct narrative, which tells a great story, but allows you to simultaneously enjoy the visual effects. In the images, I found a great attention to detail and polishing production, which is rarely seen in any student film. <br /> <br /> A young director should always make improvements. But if Mr. Anderson continues on this path, I think we will someday recall this film as the beginning of a great career. <br /> <br /> You should definitely watch this movie. Nothing beats the grandeur of a big screen.
