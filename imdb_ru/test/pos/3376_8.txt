The package is quite original and thoughtful, but, unfortunately, a good story is very scarce, which does not even allow to get decent special effects. Jeff Fahey is doing her best among the bad ones, as is always the beautiful Linda Hoffman. They should make more films together. The film, although not deserving of great praise, deserves at least one viewing.
