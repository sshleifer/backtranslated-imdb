People who thought that The Chronicles of Riddick sucked harder than the black hole that swallowed the EVENT HORIZON probably didn't see the movie that spawned Vin Diesel's skin-killer from the start, and probably weren't going to do it. Too bad, because PITCH BLACK is actually tearing a big ass. <br /> <br /> Veterinary director David Touie (WARLOCK and excellent, but underestimated below) and written by brothers and sisters Jim and Ken Whit (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), PITCH BLACK begins with the prologue of Alien. When a combined cargo / passenger ship is badly damaged due to a strange meteor shower (in which the captain is also killed), the co-pilot, Caroline Fry (Radha Mitchell SILENT HILL'S), makes the important decision: to drop the cargo or the passengers? Close to mining ore passengers, an emergency landing disrupts its final course of action. <br /> <br /> It doesn’t matter, because the catastrophic landing was made on a premonitory rock that once contained a mining colony. Among the survivors are a couple of settlers, Shazz (Claudia Black of FARSCAPE) and Zeke (John Moore); Imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say “red shirts”, boys and girls?); an antiques dealer named Paris Ogilvy (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); The "young man" named Jack (Rihanna Griffith) and the most controversial members of the group: a marshal named Jones (the superbly slimy Cole Hauser) and his prisoner ... a dangerous killer named Riddick (Diesel). <br /> <br /> The way the group dynamics are shocking creates a lot of dramatic tension, especially with regard to Riddick and how many people he can cut and cut into cubes if he ever manages to leave. But no one here comes out alive, as they say, and the biggest bends have less to do with how they get along than with how they survive when they discover the unthinkable. They are not alone on the planetoid. Things that are hungry, clawed and fast, glide around the place where they cannot be seen, living in darkness, where they can survive and thrive. They want the flesh of the new arrivals to satisfy their appetites, but they cannot go out into the burning daylight to gather food. <br /> <br /> Does the phrase “total eclipse” make things a bit more interesting? ? Still would. From here and more than the relevant name. <br /> <br /> With Wine, more monosyllabic than Clint Eastwood's “Dirty Harry”, on his most ill-tempered day, he drank more testosterone than sweat, here is a field day with a character that really seems worth a sequel or two and Hauser, a sympathetic threat and bile, is no worse than his dad Wings in misdeeds on the screen. Surprisingly, Mitchell keeps himself in hand and manages to be as strong and responsive as Fry. You expect at least a strong show from Black, “She, who was once“ Irene Sun ”, and she does not disappoint. (It is a pity that her role was no longer, but that’s all I’ll say about it.) And David makes his indelible impression as a holy man, whose faith will indeed be tested in the very pit of Hell itself. <br /> <br /> The paces move faster than Riddick, slipping behind his victim with a handle in his teeth, and as soon as darkness sets in, terror and tension never cease, almost like other classic science fiction / horrible films that it imitates. But if imitation is indeed the most sincere form of flattery, Dave Tui and Wheat deserve serious mistakes for correcting their revenge, and for giving us an ending, as anti-Hollywood as possible. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to spoil the surprises, so I’m not going to say much more, except that if you first saw the CHRONICLES and you weren’t too happy, give PITCH BLACK a chance anyway. And if you have not seen one, be sure to start with this. <br /> <br /> I don’t know what Win is doing now, but he certainly could have done worse than calling these guys again. I would like to see what they will dream next ...
