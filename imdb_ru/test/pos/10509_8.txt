I do not understand why everyone is bombing so much. I thought it was a wonderful fun time, which, unfortunately, was not popular enough to be so famous. Believe me, I have seen much worse than that. If you want a bad movie, watch a bloody hut or an alien, a dead one or something. So this is a normal payment for a slasher, but better than most. And it is watchable. This film also has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. Part of the music is very tense. And the death scenes are great too. We see a very bloody body in the bath with the words SOLD written in blood on the mirror, and we also get a cool double-beating toilet bowl! with razors attached to it! It was a fun 80s slasher that is definitely worth your time, despite what others are saying about it.
