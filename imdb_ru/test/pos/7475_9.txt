I went to this movie in the middle of the night and almost missed it. Just because there was nothing else, I decided to watch it. In the end, I thought it was great. <br /> <br /> An interesting storyline, good characters, a clever script and brilliant direction make this film wonderful to sit down and watch. In fact, it was the first time I heard about this film, but I would be happy to pay money to see it at the cinema. <br /> <br /> My IMDB rating: 8 out of 10 <br />
