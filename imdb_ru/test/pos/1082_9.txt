This may seem self-evident, but if the viewer forgets the context, he risks missing the opportunity to have fun. <br /> <br /> From the high heights of the 21st century it is easy to find fault, in styles and prices, the Years of the Great Depression; but an intelligent viewer will remember this magic word “context”, understand it better, and thus enjoy “accidents”. <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Ronald Reagan again showed himself as a handsome and personable guy, and again gave an excellent presentation. <br /> <br /> Earlier, the reviewer said that Gloria Blondel played a nasty wife, but this was not so: she plays a clerk who is madly in love with Reagan's character, Eric Gregg, but holds hands while he is married. <br /> <br /> Gloria was cute. Not as beautiful as her sister, Joan, she was still an attractive and good actress. Perhaps she looked like Joan, and this prevented her from making a more successful career, and this is definitely our loss. <br /> <br /> Sheila Bromley was Mrs. Gregg, and played it well. <br /> <br /> Among the other actors was Dick Purcell, and the great Count Dwair played something besides the villainous cowboy. <br /> <br /> Again, most players never achieved the status of “housewife”, which many of them deserved, but damn it, they gave good insights here in a story that is still relevant.
