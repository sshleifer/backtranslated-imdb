I'm a big fan of the spy genre, and this is one of the best movies. The task is based on a real story, which was somewhat embellished for a large screen, and it really gives you the pleasure of traveling. The film is a great cast, starring Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. <br /> <br /> Naval officer Quinn reluctantly recruited by Sutherland after a chance meeting with Kingsley, who considers Quinn a famous terrorist Carlos Jackal. Since Quinn is very similar to Carlos, Sutherland stops at nothing to recruit him, because Sutherland is obsessed with the capture or death of a terrorist. <br /> <br /> Teaching sequences are awesome. Quinn and Sutherland actually tested Quinn, who has to withstand attacks from remote-controlled snowmobiles, from daily consumption of the same food before the introduction of a hallucinogen. He even needs to learn how to make love to a woman the way Carlos would have done. <br /> <br /> There are some great action movies in the film that Quinn avoids allies because they believe that he is Carlos, and in his last mission, when he kill the jackal. Throughout the film, Quinn must contend with a new personality that he has achieved compared to his own. Will he remain as ruthless and free as Carlos, or will he again return to the life of a good husband and father? <br /> <br /> If you like the spy genre, this is a must see. The action is only used to move the history of this thriller forward; no unreasonable explosions or battle scenes. Rated 10 out of 10 stars.
