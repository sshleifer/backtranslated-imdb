This is one of my favorite series, all categories, all the time. <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to master the entire series on VHS a few years ago. I liked it when I saw it at -91 -92 when I was about 12. I like it or more, today, which is great, given my (hopefully) improved film assessment and criticism skills. Most of the films that I liked then, I do not really like today, except for the factor of nostalgia. This factor is also present here, but Robin of Sherwood is much more than nostalgia. <br /> <br /> There are only a few bad things in this series. First, the quality of the image and sound is so-so, at least in the first couple of episodes. Fortunately, it gets better. Secondly, you could wish for a little more blood and realism in the battle scenes, although I know that in this case this is not the way out. <br /> <br /> So, to good things! And a lot of them. First of all, Michael Praid - Robin Hood. I do not think that I have seen him in the same role since then, which only strengthens this fact for me. He provides a believable view like Robin. Jason Connery had an impossible task to replace him. The fact that Michael Praed did not become better known as an actor is incredible. Or, perhaps, such was his fate - to play this role alone perfectly, and then to disappear. <br /> <br /> I love Nicholas Grace, the sheriff of Nottingham. He really is not a complicated character, but completely rotten. The relationship between him and Gisburne is ridiculous. In fact, just looking at de Reynau, sitting on the throne, bored, violently, I laugh even before he said something. Another actor who deserves more praise is Ray Winston as Will Scarlet. You can really feel the sadness inside of him, as well as his hatred of the soldiers who killed his wife. Winston is the actor who finally received his well-deserved Hollywood breakthrough (in the films The Departed and Beowulf). There are also many other great actors. <br /> <br /> I like being in the Robin gang. They are having fun, playing, laughing, you really feel the camaraderie between them, the closeness that comes from such a closely related group like this. These scenes are very important. <br /> <br /> I think that what was filmed in the UK with British actors really improved the situation, compared to, for example, the movie -92 with Kevin Costner, who simply seems to be fake, fake, not real. (Christian Slater, like Will Scarlet, come on ...) The cast that speaks English with a British accent makes it more believable, and I get the feeling that the actors, as well as the director and writers of the series, can put themselves much more the skin of the gang of Robin Hood, than the American team could have. The music is great, Clannad is perfect for the feel of the series. Music is another of the things they just nailed. <br /> <br /> Another exciting addition is a fantastic and magical seasoning. This is not excessive, but true and only makes it all better and more interesting. I also like the great combination of comedy, adventure and drama. <br /> <br /> Here are a few things that make this show so lively and so authentic. This is the best version of Robin Hood I have ever seen. I will not end with the quote "Nothing is forgotten." But one thing that will never be forgotten, for me, is a fantastic retelling of Robin Hood. See it.
