There are questions that sometimes hang over us and have no answer. The two women are gradually caught in each otherâ€™s arms (as trite as the phrase sounds, this is exactly what happens) and believe that they cannot answer their own question about what determines their relationship when their own society does not have a name for that that they are. The slightly incorrectly named FIRE Deepa Mehta is the first of the loosely connected trilogies, the elements of which are connected here and more symbolic than consuming. Fire as an uncontrollable erotic passion is not manifested here, as women - the older and more feminine Radha (Shabana Azmi) and younger, more courageous Sita (Nandita das) come to understand that they are united much more than common ideas and affection for each other and upholding what they consider their passion for each other, despite the resistance that their very traditional husbands and families face. As in WATER, FIRE is deeply spiritual, even if technically it falls into a lot of sentimental melodrama (where WATER, like the weight of a word, carries a stronger meaning that ultimately goes beyond its definition). However, this is a very beautiful picture and a strong voice from a strong director.
