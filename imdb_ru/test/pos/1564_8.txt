Great performance by Emily Grace! I stumbled upon this film, looking through my satellite lists, and I was curious how the plot provided by my satellite service provider looks. I was very entertained and felt great compassion for the character “Alice” played by Emily Grace. The story made me guess what would happen to Alice, and was not predictable. The overall story was refreshing and had some great turns with the characters supporting it. The final of the story ended fairly fairly. I will buy this DVD to add to my library. I'm a new fan of Emily Grace, and I look forward to seeing more from her performances.
