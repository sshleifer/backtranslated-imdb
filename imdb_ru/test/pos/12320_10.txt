The latest film by John Houston, a great American director of Irish descent, is a film adaptation of the latest story in the early compilation Dubliners, the greatest writer ever to be born in Ireland. The film is a family affair. The dying director did this on the basis of a script adapted by his son Tony Houston from one of the sharpest, most beautiful and deepest stories ever written in this language and considered by many of the BEST English-language stories. John directed his daughter Angelica to the best screen. The film is short, only 83 minutes. He has no sequences of actions, plot, he almost does not contain events and may seem slow. Guests, friends and relatives come to the party, which takes place in Dublin during the Epiphany week in January 1904, in the home of two elderly sisters, who arrange dinner with music and dancing every year. What the audience sees during the first hour is part of the ensemble's conversation. Guests talk, listen to music, discuss the latest opera premieres and joke, sometimes embarrassingly. Gradually, the conversation turns to long-dead friends or relatives, the memory of which never disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is the movie you need to stay with, let it delay you, listen to what and how the guests at the party say how they communicate. Pay attention to body languages, the views on their faces when they walk away from the light, laughter and music of the present to the past, but not really left the most precious memories, where the Dead of the name is not dead, but forever young and so alive. If you do this, you will be rewarded with a final scene of such emotional strength and impact that it will always be with you. This will break your heart into pieces, bring them together and close them again. The film as well as the story of Joyce tells about Gabriel Conroy (Donal McCann as the alter ego of James Joyce gave a very touching understated performance) as one of the guests of the party who comes with his wife Gretta (Angelica Houston). Gabriel is still in love, feels intimate and fascinated by her. It is after the party that he discovers that even after many years of intimacy, he does not know everything about her past, her pains, her regrets and unforgettable emotions and losses she experienced in her youth, and he is not a part. For the first time, he looks at her and thinks about her not as an indelible part of his existence, but as another person with her own inner world, her own loneliness and sadness and, for the first time, "strange, friendly pity." because she entered his soul. It is he who tells the last most powerful and deep lines of the story: â€œSnow everywhere in Ireland ... falls weakly through the universe and falls weakly, like the descent of their last end, on all the living and the dead." <br /> <br /> you have not seen the film yet, and you have not read the story of Joyce, do it, these are truly works of art that leave an indelible impression and can change something in you for the better.
