Amazingly wonderful cartoon in the same league as Batman: TAS and the like, I enjoyed it in my youth and recently I was able to watch them again, a great voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Mall, Tony Jay and Maurice Lamarch. The only concern I had was that Rob Paulson's voice seemed too old for the title character, but it didn't matter much because the stories were great and the fact that it all had a great time loop end. Some people say this was an excuse, but I found it refreshing compared to many series that just leave things hanging. I hope they once released this series on DVD, unfortunately, it came out at a time when DVDs were not yet distributed, and the cartoon probably served only to sell certain types of toys that I never found attractive, despite the animated cartoon .
