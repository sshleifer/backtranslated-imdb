“Footprints on the Moon” is almost certainly the strangest, most sophisticated and most atypical Giallo ever made. This may be a deterrent to some fans of the subgenre, but this film does not have many of the usual Giallo brands, such as bloody knife kills (preferably committed by a masked killer in black gloves), admiration for poorly dressed beauties and unpredictable red herring. However, to compensate for all this ?? and much more ?? "Tracks" benefits from the most indescribable mysterious and incessant irresistible atmosphere that I have ever experienced in this type of film. The level of mystery in this film is so high and unbearable that it literally makes you feel embarrassed and scared. Like the heroine Alice Cespi herself, you absolutely have no idea what is happening and why, and this feeling of complete helplessness is undoubtedly the main strong point of the film. As a spectator, you are eager to help this poor woman understand what overcomes her, but you just cannot. Alice has a successful career as a translator, but her quiet and peaceful life is brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and gradually begins to realize that she absolutely does not remember the previous three days. She finds a torn photograph of a hotel located on the resort island of Gama, and decides to go there to find out what happened. Several people on the island, including a lonely little girl, seem to recognize Alice, only she used the fictitious name Nicole, wore a red wig and acted as if she came to the island to hide from an unknown danger. Meanwhile, even the nights of a poor girl are restless, because she often had dreams about astronauts jumping on the surface of the Moon and a strange scientist named Dr. Blackman. The “Footprints” plot is really freaky and slowly thinking, and especially the space subtitle is really difficult to associate with the rest. Alice assumes that these are just images from a science fiction film that she has seen for a long time, and this sounds like a reasonable enough explanation, but you feel that there is a deeper meaning and factual connection with all other events. Fans of intense and stylish Italian cinema can not afford to miss this movie, really. This is a psychological trip directed by Luigi Bazzoni with stunningly beautiful photography and consciousness-altering music. Despite the absence of violence (or, perhaps, only because of it), the film is really disturbing, and the mental agony experienced by Alice sincerely affects the viewer emotionally. As it is, unfortunately, too often in Gialli-cinema, the climax suddenly comes rather suddenly and almost does not give a waterproof explanation of all the awkward events that you have just seen in the last hour and a half. However, the content of “Footprints” will keep you thinking long after the film is completed, and its powerful impact will only increase. Florinda Bolkan is exalted as a tormented leading lady and receives excellent feedback from a limited supply of support, including young Nicoletta Elmi. The outstanding star of the Eurovision Klaus Kinsky also receives top billing, but his role is just an extended cameo. This film is actually much better than the more famous (and much more accessible) director Buzzoni Jallo “The Fifth Cord”, so it’s worth hoping that “Footprints” will soon get a chic DVD release.
