> This show is the only greatest thing that appeared in America after the Simpsons. Not only does he have thousands of new ideas, but this is actually> controversial (see Jewish joke, Season 1, Episode 1) and is not afraid of> “cheating” on people. However, Fox's great minds canceled it along with Greg Rabbit and Futurama, so make sure you buy the box set for season 1 while you can. It will be the best money you will ever spend. This is definitely a show that gets better, the more you watch it, because at first permanent memories can be a little annoying and do not always correspond to the story. However, after several episodes, you realize how great it is and how well it compares with any other show that is currently on the air.
