Forget the overrated “Batman Begins,” this is the best Batman movie you don’t want to miss. This film has it all, and it completely surpasses the first megahit of 1989. It may not be as good as first at the box office, but this is definitely a much better movie. The visual effects are awesome, Burton does his magic like he always does in his films again. The city of Gotham, Batman's hunting ground, is an amazing sight. The story itself is actually pretty good, and the 2 villains in this are VERY interesting, actually much more interesting than their comic colleagues. Tim Burton and screenwriter Daniel Walters take another step to bring you a truly emotional connection with these characters. Penguin, played by Danny DeVito to perfection, is a type of tragic character that parents abandoned at birth, and at a later age he craves. revenge on the world he was denied. It is very disgusting to watch from time to time, but it has some of the most classic features that a villain could utter in one movie. the other villain is Catwoman, who was so brilliantly played by Michelle Pfiffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time, she plays the role of WOW and fully plays with the show if it’s about any of Batman's past and present villains. she also has a tragic background. her name is Selina Kyle, and she is a very obsessive secretary of an astute businessman named Max Shrek, who later kills her by pushing her out the window. somehow she survives and "awakens" cats, and decides to become a legendary catwoman right there, and not before, of course, an amazing sequence in which she completely lets go and destroys her whole apartment in one of the most Oscars. Worthy representation of rage and the anger I've ever seen in an actress. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton again puts on a raincoat and a hood in the role of Batman, as well as in the role of Bruce Wayne and THIS time when it is much darker. there's nothing more to say here, except that Keaton is simply the best actor to ever play Batman. he's just awesome, and he has some sort of Clint Eastwood approach to Batman, and he's very dark. he doesn't say much, and when he does, he sounds very cool, and he doesn't make his voice sound too silly, and the fake IE bails Batman starts Batman. he spreads around Gotham like a man possessed by his inner demons. he has psychological problems and you know that. on this tour, he takes 2 of the most famous villains to ever adorn the world of Batman comics. <br /> <br /> I have to say, despite the awesomeness of the action scenes, how the scenes with the coolest Batmobile EVER rushes down the street, knocking the thugs to the ground, and Batman slips along Gotham, this is the romantic corner between Pfiffer and Keaton which really makes this movie a classic best choice for anyone who wants to see the REAL Batman in action, I rate it 10 would give more if I could.
