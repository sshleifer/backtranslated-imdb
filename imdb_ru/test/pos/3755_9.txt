Thanks to the support of another IMDb member, I just managed to watch this movie for the second time in almost twenty years, and I can honestly say that he has not lost a single blow. I cannot believe that Channel 4 allowed it to disappear without a trace, as it is an extremely powerful, touching and moralistic approach to the consequences of inappropriate loyalty. <br /> <br /> The focus is on a group of friends for ten years and their relationship with two outsiders from the school; in particular, how they use the one and cruelly torture the other. As the events of the past and present unfold, tensions gradually increase, which is no different from Shane Meadows' excellent shoes of the Dead Man. Acting, writing and directing are very brave for 1983 and still fill the hoop, despite the accents of the upper crust of the central characters. Yes, it can be installed in a public school, but these are worlds different from everything that Merchant Ivory graduates; I received a public education and can still draw countless parables from history. <br /> <br /> This is a film that you will remember for a long time if you see it, except that you probably won't see it, because Channel 4 (or FilmFour) decided to bury it. On their official website, they describe it as "an inexplicably missed gem from the first days of the 4th channel." It was one of the very first films of the 4th channel (which would later become FilmFour due to the success of films such as Trainspotting), so that someone else must have a master imprint. Nowadays, when you can get extended DVDs with collectible releases, more or less, it is a bit capricious that they cannot give the film such good advertising that it deserves. <br /> <br /> So, if one of the producers of channel 4 is reading this, stop creating programs that show people humiliate themselves in the hope of making a deal with a tabloid newspaper, pursue this film and arrange a special anniversary. Release the disc or something please!
