Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is being harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a suicide bomber who literally believes he will not be caught. In the debut of the present, the beloved modern serial killer “John Kramer” (Tobin Bell) from the Saw series. Thanks to thoughtful planning and influence, Frank can arrest Mendoza (Bella). <br /> <br /> After this begins a series of persecutions of cats and mice. Malkovich is a terrific actor and incredibly versatile. Once again showing another role in this film, he amazes me with his ability to share his characters with the next film. <br /> <br /> I see Malkovich playing in Con Air as the formidable insanely intelligent Cyrus, In Of Mice and Men, as the tragically challenged rabbit lover Lenny, to name a few. He plays a very intelligent terrorist bomber who is very sensible, but he is mistaken in thinking that he can avoid his captures. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood is not someone special me. He is too old to truly make films, so the only thing that can truly surprise you is his ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he plays are simple and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> René Rousseau plays Eastwood's love interest in the film and fascinates me with his support, which is actually more important to me than Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Although it may seem like a fighter, it is relatively slow and plays on hold. You have to wait for build-up and finish, and it will pay off at the end. Along the way, you'll be mesmerized by the chemistry of Malkovich and Eastwood and their cat-and-mouse scenes.
