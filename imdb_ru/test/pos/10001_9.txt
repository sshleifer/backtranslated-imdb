As a golfer with some knowledge of the history of sports, I was pleased with Disney’s sensitivity to class golf problems in the early twentieth century. The film well reflects the psychological battles in which Harry Vardon fought inside himself, starting with an injury in childhood when he was evicted, and ending with his own inability to break this glass ceiling, which prevents him from being accepted as equal in English golf society. Similarly, young Uimet goes through his class struggle, being a simple Claddy in the eyes of Americans from the top of the bark, who laugh at his attempts to rise above his position. <br /> <br /> What I liked the most was the way this class theme manifests itself in the characters of Wime’s parents. His father is a drone of the working class, who sees the value of hard work, but is intimidated by the upper class; his mother, however, recognizes his son’s talent and desire and encourages him to fulfill his dream of fighting those who think he is inferior. <br /> <br /> Finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. Although the course used in the film was not the actual site of a historic tournament, the little liberties taken by Disney do not detract from the beauty of the film. There is one small Disney moment at the pool table; otherwise, the viewer does not actually consider Disney. The end, as in “The Miracle,” is not some Disney creation, but something that only human history could write.
