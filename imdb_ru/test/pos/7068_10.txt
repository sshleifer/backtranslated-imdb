Some people have the ability to use only 3 neurons, one for food, one for breathing, and the other for evil ... This is not a movie for them ... <br /> <br /> But for those who like to use the brain. .. the whole film is a metaphor, everything for a purpose, every detail, a coffee mug, a red couch, everything ... an underestimated masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> It's fun, raw and absolutely realistic, how we actually interact ... this is a royal comedy ... total causality ... Just hold on, no need not to let the first scene shock you ..... hold on ... and enjoy the show ....
