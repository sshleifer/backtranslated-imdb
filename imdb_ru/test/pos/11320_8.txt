It's pretty well done for the what-if television movie. For example, what if the terrorists detonated a “dirty bomb” in a big city, in this case in London. Many people who say: “We are all ready in case of an emergency” show that they do not quite tell the whole story. And is anyone ready for something like this? You can not argue. It shows material for smuggling bombs into the country, making bombs, secrecy and double life, led by the people behind it, etc. It also shows that civil servants (that is, firefighters) give everything to save people when they receive no help when the government does not want to send anyone else to the affected area. It also shows how terribly inadequate the “preparations” for any such event is, as the government discusses everything, but then stands there with open mouths when the tragedy unfolds. And could this happen right here in the good old USA? Well, if you have not lived in caves for the past 20 years, something has already taken place, and do not bet that someone would be ready for something like that. It's pretty realistic and yes, even scary. Worth a look, but just hope that nothing like this happens. 8 out of 10.
