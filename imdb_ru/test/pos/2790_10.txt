My favorite movie this year. Gorgeous characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful and interesting. <br /> <br /> A scene from the film “Barcelona” tells about the life of six foreign graduate students and many others. Cultures and languages ​​collide, but hearts and lives intertwine. The main role would never have been played in Hollywood, but he coped well with this role. The characters were well developed, and their interaction was honest and precise. There were two particularly noteworthy scenes, the culmination of which was truly inspired. The film is sentimental, and the last ten minutes could be cut, but it was surprisingly interesting. <br /> <br /> I hardly watched it, but just saw Audrey Toth. Her role, despite the fact that she had a second or third role, was minor and was eclipsed by several other characters. I would like more films to be made. It reminded the Big Cold or the Breakfast Club. Do not start this film late if you plan to go to bed halfway.
