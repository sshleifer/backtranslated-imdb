These guys are great and everything they release to the public is first class. The musicality of this group is amazing, and we should all be very grateful that we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never be able to see such skills live and in person. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it completely !! Recently, I was able to see how these incredible musicians play in Houston, Texas, and was shocked. I did not miss the show with the windows, and I must say that they are better than ever. Everyone should hug these guys and teach others what real musicality is! In our life there will never be such a close and well-built trio. Let's just hope and pray that they won't retire soon!
