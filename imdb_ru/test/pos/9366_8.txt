Edward Dmitrik's Crossfire is a rare Hollywood film from the 1940s. It was an innovative ground for Mr. Dmitry and the studio, which is why the director and his adapter, John Paxton, decided to do it with the novel on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> If you didn’t see the movie, please stop reading. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks’s novel was about killing a gay soldier. In the film, the subject was changed to prejudice against the Jews, a topic that was taboo at the time in American cinema. To the credit of Mr. Dmitry, I had the courage to take part in this film project. <br /> <br /> The film is an outstanding part of filmmaking because the director represents it. Obviously, influenced by the film noir style, we ended up in Washington after the war. The opening scene of the brutal murder of Samuels shows that such an unusual cruelty was inflicted on a decent man whom we still do not know or why he was killed, but who did not deserve such a horrible death. <Br /> <br /> Basis of murder is prejudice, pure and simple. We understand how the very fact of success and difference in the mind of an ignorant person plays in the mind of a murderer. Samuel acts as a sacrificial lamb, just like a gay soldier is a victim in the novel. The parallels are well drawn. <br /> <br /> This film makes a compelling viewing thanks to the brilliant turn of the star Robert Ryan in the role of Montgomery. Mr. Ryan was an actor who always played interesting roles, but never as well as in Crossfire. In addition, Gloria Graham looks great like Ginny, a prostitute with a heart in the right place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast plays the role of an ensemble. Robert Young, as an investigative police detective, is a decent man who personally knows the prejudices in his family and loudly opposes him. Robert Mitchum plays a cool sergeant. Kili, who is deeply moved by the crime, when one of his men is accused of committing this crime. Sam Leven is superb in his little role as Samuels. <br /> <br /> This film is worth seeing, because it is probably the first to speak out against ignorance.
