A poetic study of the human condition is conducted without dialogue. Antihero, Man builds a trick to escape from a group of marauders from the desert of what was once a civilization, to the ruins of a city, to collect it for survival. There he crosses paths with The Brute, brilliantly played by Jean Reno, with the fame of “Professional” and “Mission Impossible”. The man is saved by a crazy old genius who lives in the fortress of his design. Using his wit, the Man and the old genius are able to keep Brutus and his loved ones at bay, but they understand that it is only a matter of time when their protection will be undermined, so they take a break for this. This is a very understated story of a desperate struggle for life with superb action films and clever humor. Of all the films of this kind, such as “Warrior of the Road”, “Omega Man” and even “Warrior without Limits” (featuring Yul Brenner as a knife lover), “Le Dernier Combat” is the most skillfully created. Copies of the video are hard to find, I would give one ball to the left eye for one. If your local art home has ever experienced a renaissance of this film, I sincerely recommend that you end any commitment in order to be able to see it on a large scale.
