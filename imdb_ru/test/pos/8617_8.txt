This film was very interesting for me, in fact, the film in the film, which tells about a very bizarre director who deftly convinces the actress and actor (who do not like each other) to create sexual chemistry in the film. The director faces many obstacles as she tries to get two people to perform beautifully on film. Sex comedy is much more than comedy, packed with uncomfortable quirky moments. The film also considers the psychological and innate instinctive behavior of men and women in relation to the sometimes controversial sexual intercourse. I really liked this film, the character Jeanne performed by the beautiful Anna Pario performs beautifully on the screen when you participate in her struggle to create an artwork from the movie.
