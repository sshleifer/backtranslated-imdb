I watched it because a friend told me that it was damn good and I watched the video on it, so I really wanted to watch it. I watched it, and damn it, the fighting scenes are really good. If guys can't fight like that in real life, they probably fooled me. I must say that the battles are not as many as we would like, but the fights in the film are quite spectacular. They do not show much, but you can say that it is cruel and cool. But there is also a story that runs around a love triangle between the main characters, although it is a bit distorted. Te-sung is a carefree guy who seems to enjoy getting into trouble and fighting. He is the leader of his school and the rival of He-Won, who is the leader of his school - a little playboy, hot and rich boy. Then there is Han-kyun, a girl who doesnâ€™t really want much for her - her father just passed away, and she came back with her mother, the boyfriend she loved meets her old friend - and then she meets Hi-won, who goes to her school, and Tae-Sung, who calls her "Nuna" (older sister). In the end, she discovers that Tae-sun is her brother, the fruit of one of her father's affairs, and he loves her, despite their close relationship. Meanwhile, Hi-Won falls in love with her and takes her for her boyfriend. But she is torn between her boyfriend and her younger brother, who confesses his love for her. In general, this is a wonderful film, but if I really fell into depression after the end, and I just could not help but think, Damn, are all the Korean films that I watch devoted to battle / death / depression / incest ?? Because it certainly was the case with the "Old Man" and "The Temptation of Wolves." This is a very good movie, but people should be ready to cry at the end.
