Emilio is a successful businessman, a beautiful father and a good husband. Or this is what everyone thinks. The ideal storyline, which he carefully built all these years, will suddenly begin to draw closer to him. Can he keep up with his own lies? <br /> <br /> This is a very well-thought drama with great action and steady leadership. Despite the fact that the plot is brought to the limit to increase tension, the film reveals some of our worst fears ... Do we really know the people we are dealing with? Can we be so sure? <br /> <br /> The story is evolving at a faster pace as it reaches a point where Emilio no longer controls his lies. Many Spanish films have interesting stories, but they are far from technical mastery. Perfect rhythm and well-made scenes make the actors so trustworthy that we get inside Emilio, hate him and suffer for him, as his situation becomes more and more desperate. There is no need for any Spanish folklore, nor is it an attempt to create a Hollywood-style film. This is the real Spain, 2002, and, despite the apparent unlikely life of Emilio, which exists in reality, there are good chances that someone we know is not quite like the person he considers himself to be. This is not just a great commercial product, it will allow you to think about where lies can lead us. Can we keep up? <br /> <br /> Great.
