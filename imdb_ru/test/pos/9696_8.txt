I have always been a fan of Jackass, as well as Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And when you are a fan of something, your expectations are high regarding what your “heroes” can play. And if I learned something about what to expect from people you just love to watch and listen to, then it never expect much, because 99 out of 100 times you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although when I heard about the approach of Jackass 2, I thought: “Even I cannot disprove my expectations regarding this film,” and as a result I sat down today, ready to laugh, but at the end say : "Well, everything was in order, but I'm a little disappointed." How I was wrong! Each member of the Jackass team talks about this film first and foremost, showing you one crazy trick after another, forcing the whole world to see that they will not do anything to try to harm themselves - and this is what we love! I cried with laughter from the first minute to the very last second of the film, sometimes even screamed with laughter, unable to control myself! A trick after a trick, a joke after a joke, and hilarious comments about the stream - it may just not get better than this! Amazing from start to finish, guaranteed to make you laugh at your ass. I have two things to say; WATCH IT, and PLEASE, God, let Jackass 3 be - these guys obviously have something to offer!
