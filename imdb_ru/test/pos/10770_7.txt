Mas Oyama was the most successful master of karate in the late 20th century. He rejected the "training" of the karate clubs of that time, focusing on intense training without rules. In the end, he built his system into a huge business empire with hundreds of schools around the world, without jeopardizing his teaching. Testing in Kyokushin schools is still one of the most difficult physical tests that any martial arts school requires. One of the non-physical difficulties Oyama faced was prejudice because of his Korean origin, and he spent time proving that loyalty belongs to Japan and Japanese karate. This series of films was part of this effort, although anyone who had the opportunity to meet with Oyama (I did) would never have doubted his loyalty to Japan. In this series, Oyamaâ€™s most famous student, Sonny Chiba, is called to portray his teacher. <br /> <br /> Oyama comes from the countryside, where he trains alone. He challenges and makes short work of the established karate schools he encounters. Disgusted by the state of karate, Oyama returns to his lonely training session. In the end, he selects a student, falls in love and interferes with gangsters who are associated with existing karate schools. In the midst of this is the legendary bullfight with a rabid bull. How true is most of the movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that Oyama could kill a bull with his bare hands is true. He was called to repeat this feat many times. There are cases when Oyama did this, although sometimes the bulls seemed to be tied up, as Oyama admired for years. Sonny Chiba convincingly portrays his master, and karate is pretty good. Chiba may not have been the best practitioner of karate, but at the moment he was definitely above average. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is good, much better than most martial arts films in the dramatic department. I always wondered why this is not so well known. Perhaps these are very realistic images of martial arts. People are shown fatigue and pain, unlike 99% of the militants, where the hero is a limitless source of energy, and every blow instantly sends the enemy to death. Chiba seems so exhausted at some point that it hurts to watch. Perhaps the audience does not want their entertainment to reflect reality so closely. <br /> <br /> Especially recommended for martial arts masters.
