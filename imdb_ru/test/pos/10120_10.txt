I just got home after watching Radio. I have not seen such an inspiring story for a long time. My children are 8 and 5 years old, and I would like to accept them so that they “feel” the message, like me — you should strive to find the best in people and love them as they are, and not judge them for their differences, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris both deserve an Oscar for this film. I do not know why we can not have more of these films than the garbage that is served daily in cinemas.
