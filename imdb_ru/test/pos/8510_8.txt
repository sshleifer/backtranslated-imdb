I'm tired of people complaining that “Never say never” is a weak remake of Thunderball. Yes, the influence of this film is unmistakable, but the huge and almost universal inferiority of the reworked films is reserved for such thoughtless and unreasonable films as the rethinking of the 1998 Psycho. While it is true that the opening theme of the twelfth (and last) Bond Connery film is one of the worst of the entire series, the film itself still manages to perform on its own, despite many other flaws. In addition, even the weak title song is made so that it goes well with the final dialogue in the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sean Connery grew up a little when this movie was shot (at least, James Bond Standards), but there is a lot of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that it was not exactly unknown to the creators of the film. James Bond is close to retiring before he gets his appointment, spending most of his recent teaching time, and not even talking on M's cheek that he pays more attention to his health, diets, trains and gets more exercises . and that "no. Also, this is James Bond, remember? This guy must be something superhuman, and all his fans get upset because he has gray hair. When this guy retires at the end of the movie, M sends to the poor" Little Fawcett "(in a funny cameo from Rowan Atkinson) to tell Bond that without him he is worried about the safety of the free world and all of you people. I cannot accept the fact that he is no longer a vigorous young man. Come on, Sean Connery could still play James Bond as well as he could, or at least she does better than anyone else could. <br /> <br /> Most films tell you about a carefully thought-out plan to steal nuclear missiles and keep the world hostage (as Dr. Evil would say, "Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do? "), so there is obviously not so much new, but this is one of the Bond films, which had better one liner. Is there a funny scene where Bond asks for a urine sample?" If you could just fill this glass for me ?? "` From here? “There are a lot of good odnostrochnikov, but sexual hints aimed at Mr. Bond, especially common in this issue. But then he accidentally throws that same urine sample into the villain’s face, making him scream as if his face is going out. Not a good attempt to relieve comics, especially since this guy kicked Bond with his ass with the help of some kind of super-spring device that could cut through almost anything. And, of course, Kim Basinger starred in this film as one of the best Bond girls in the entire series. <br /> <br /> It's no secret that “Never say never again,” and this is one of the things that is outdated. worst is the special effects ?? with one exception, flying missiles that were clearly fake, but still impressive for 1982. The color contact lenses at the beginning of the film were completely inconclusive, and the laser watches were one of the worst things in the whole film, the second only to those damned sharks. Obviously, Fatima Blash put on an aquarium with an aquarium that attracted sharks (of course, they had their own strange control mechanisms) in the scene, which most likely inspired the classic line: “I have one simple request. And that means sharks with FRICKIN laser beams are attached to their heads! And then, of course, there is the exploding scene of a hotel room, which was redone in the episode of The Simpsons, and which was obviously followed by another mandatory and overly random single from James. <br /> <br /> The dominance of the video game created by Largo, the villain of the film, is a particularly memorable scene, and the film also boasts that it is probably the best race on motorcycles in the entire series (far superior to the ridiculous will die "). But despite many strengths, the film’s weaknesses remain clearer in the audience’s mindset at the end of the film, largely due to the anti-climatic underwater conclusion (one of the most obvious parts is borrowed from Thunderball and recreated worse). Never mind the fact that Largo revealed some important information for Bond when he left him alive in the tower (the brilliance of Dr. Evil, once again: "I will just leave him there without witnessing his death, and just assume that went according to plan. ”What?”) The climax of what is expected from a fast-paced action movie should never occur in a muffled underwater atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In general, “Never Say Never” is very highly rated on the James Bond scale, and Connery winked at the end of the film (and also in the two final lines) suggested while he can still come back for another turn like Bond. It is clear that this is not very likely, so we can only hope.
