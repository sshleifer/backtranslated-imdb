In my opinion, National Velvet is one of the best classics of the family of all time. Mickey Rooney (Mi Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor (Velvet Brown) participate in it. <br /> <br /> Velvet is won by a racehorse named (Pie) in the lottery. She falls in love with it right away. With the help of Mi, a former jockey, they train him in Grand National's races. After the jockey, who was supposed to participate in the Pai race at the last moment, retreats, Mi convinces Velvet to take his place. <br /> <br /> It was a well-made film. Great storyline and top quality game. The inner game between Elizabeth and Mickey was magical. This is a wonderful family picture, masterfully filmed by director Clarence Brown. The photo is amazing. This is a movie that you enjoy for years to come. <br /> <br /> It was this photo that made Elizabeth Taylor a household name. Both Mickey and Elizabeth remained close after the film. They still send postcards to each other after all these many years. <br /> <br /> Note on one side. Elizabeth loved the Pie Horse so much that the studio gave it to her.
