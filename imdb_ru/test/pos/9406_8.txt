This great television film told of the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1975 by Ethel Kennedy's nephew. Using Martha’s “ghost” to provide some of the details was very effective and added a heart story. Christopher Meloni seemed very well aware of Mark Furman’s identity. Furhman, who received so little underrated advertising in O.J. The Simpson trial, of course, confirmed itself with its contribution to bringing the killer to justice after 27 years.
