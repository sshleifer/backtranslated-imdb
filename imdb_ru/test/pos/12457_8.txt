I thought it was a very bold presentation of the old hockey concept of “Tarzan”, so popular in Hollywood, Weissmüller and others. <br /> <br /> Yes; there are a lot of nonsense. But then the idea is stupid. It is almost incredible that chimpanzees could give birth to an adult. I am tempted to say that this is incredible, but this concept has never been tested. And, of course, too much anthropomorphism for comfort. Although in the circumstances, I see how this would be very difficult to avoid. Now we have a lot more understanding of acculturation issues, and we know that a person who grew up from infancy without human behavioral impulses will ultimately never recognize them in adulthood. <br /> <br /> However, if you can get your head Around this place there is a lot of admiration that is both creative and bold. Lambert makes a monster with tremendous aplomb. I am tempted to say that this is the most convincing and sympathetic role that I have seen in his performance. There are also many other great performances. Last but not least Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm. <br /> <br /> What is particularly disturbing, and rightly so, is the human perception of monkeys. We see ourselves almost from the point of view of the poor, stupid, helpless little animals that we usually lead. And it demonstrates well how the false “civilization” and “morality” with which we hide and justify our behavior are nothing more than an expression of our own egoism and arrogance. Sometimes this may seem a bit exaggerated, especially in the disgusting halls of the museum, but we see not only the truth about Victorians; it's true about how we are today. This is one that must be stated and cannot be stated often enough. Hill’s obsession with the ray of dawn as a sign of civilization — as if having facial hair was a primitive condition for contempt — is a great example. Primitive bearded readers take note. <br /> <br /> The story is depressing. Ultimately this is a tragedy. Because, despite the fact that he is returning to the jungle and free from moral tyranny, this is truly human "civilization"; we know that he is doomed. Before the third millennium turns 50, wild monkeys will be exterminated as bush meat, and their habitat will be developed for agriculture and mining to meet the insatiable surplus of people. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is a fairy tale about yourself. The path to extinction, which is followed by other monkeys, must ultimately be passed by humans. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended for his ethical perception, despite the tricky moments.
