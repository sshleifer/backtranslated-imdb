"Four Daughters" introduced the audience to John Garfield, and this is what I remember most about this film today. Unlike some actors who are shot in several films in front of their gel images on the screen, Garfield installed it immediately, with a cigarette from his mouth and talking about the fate against him. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is the story of four girls, their widowed musician father (Claude Raines) and their various suitors, one of whom, Felix, is played by handsome Jeffrey Lynn. He is the one they are all in love with, but he is in love with Buff (Priscilla Lane). Then she meets the bad Mickey Borden, who also falls in love with her. When Buff realizes that one of her sisters is in love with Felix, she leaves him at the altar and marries Mickey. <br /> <br /> This is a rather formal story that life (and continuation) is played by an acting game. Garfield was already mentioned, but Priscilla Lane was certainly the strongest of the daughters, the most interesting and the best actress. Jeffrey Lynn was a fresh and good-looking lead man, and this film helped him cope with Warners. However, there should be no real glory. Like many other epochs, he went to work, and when he came out, he had a bronze star, but not a great career. Later he took up television and real estate. Claude Raines, as patriarch, is very warm and wonderful. <br /> <br /> “Four daughters” were so popular that they inspired “Four wives” and “Four mothers”, and also reunited most of the cast in “Daughters” Bold, where the actors played different characters. /> <br /> A very pleasant, pleasant memory of simpler and probably happier times, and the opportunity to see John Garfield in his first film.
