I just watched it on a DVD three times - once in a “normal” way, once with scenes in a sequential order (in this stupid film noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story are intertwined), and once with the working commentary of the director. The bare story, told with greater sensitivity, energy and thoughtfulness than most of the big-budget bloated functions released today. <br /> <br /> I think this is an even more perfect film than the subsequent Memento, which first of all attracted me to Nolan. I can’t wait to see what he does with a big budget (and big box office stars) in his next film, Insomnia.
