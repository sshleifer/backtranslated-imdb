I watched this interesting film along with the 2046 Chinese-French film at the recent Dubai Film Festival. Both were intellectual works made in the same year (2004/2005). Both were the main characters living in the "hotel". In both films, the hotel is a metaphor of exile rather than location. Both dealt with love between a man and a woman. Both had great music and exciting performances. What a coincidence, and yet, how two films differ in the interpretation of the subject! Somewhere at the beginning of the film, a man walking on asphalt turns to look at a woman, and at the same time ends up in a lamppost. The audience turns into a laughter volcano innocently. But doesn't this short snapshot of the movie entertain you for 2 hours? While the film is an excellent blend of black comedy (for example, using a stethoscope to listen to a neighbor’s conversation), the film is based on what Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati introduced to the cinema earlier - the stoic faces that lead to the comedy are quite contrasted with no less intelligent world of Robin Williams or the heartbreaking Danny Kay. The sudden insanity of activity transforms another value character, while moving money from hotel to bank is reminiscent of Tati's work. <br /> <br /> But the film is not just a comedy. Statement on counteracting automation (counting cash and the reaction of bank employees to related statements, a fictitious maneuver that acts as an ineffective warning for an accelerating lady, a reference to Mulimix as a fictional "company" for which he works), etc. .) - a few tips that the director invites the viewer to download the downloaded comedy. Laugh, yes, but think about it and enjoy further .. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film is that it is short, staccato (directed by Paul Sorrentino), which offers comedy mixed with philosophy (“The truth is boring”, "Dad is dead, but no one told him," "There is no failure - it is an invention of losers and poor people." Then the director continues to read an exciting lecture from the main character about Insomnia. You will not sleep during this lecture. <br /> <br /> Sorrentino offers entertainment related to the theme that Italians know best of all - the Mafia. a potential film about the mafia. <br /> <br /> “The truth is boring”, the director offers dessert as an excellent meal: great acting (Tony Servillo), good music, smart camera work (Luca Bigazzi), beautiful, mysterious actress ( Magnani, Grand-daughter Grand Anna) and a powerful script. Dessert for the viewer to find out if what preceded the film was true.It would be boring if I were, wouldn’t it?
