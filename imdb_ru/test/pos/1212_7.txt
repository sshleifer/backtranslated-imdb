WrestleMania 6 was held on April 1, 1990 at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. <br /> <br /> Match 1: Rick Martel vs. Coco B. Ware - Actually, a very solid starting match. Coco has always been quite popular among fans, and at that moment Martel was still gaining the upper hand. In the end, Martel managed to get a victory in a rather unforgettable match. <br /> <br /> Match 2: Colossal connection (Andre The Giant & Haku) (c) (with Bobby “Brain” Hinan) vs Demolition (Ax & Smash) for the WWF Team Championship. At this point, Andre's health was really terrible, so his performance was not something special. The crowd is 100% for demolition in this match. In the end, Haku is enshrined, and we have new tag team champions. After the match, Andre lays out Haku and Hinan and turns to face what will be his last Wrestlemania. <br /> <br /> Match 3: Earthquake vs. Hercules - Very short match. Large dominant heels were really popular at the time. REST IN PEACE. both men in the match. John Tenta (Earthquake) passed not so long ago and also with Hercules. In the end, the Earthquake takes Hercules to victory. <br /> <br /> Match 4: Mr. Perfect vs Brutus Barber Beefcake is the first really good match of the night. REST IN PEACE. Kurt Henning (Mr. Perfect). Really hard movement back and forth from both these talented guys. In the end, Brutus gets the victory due to the big support of his fans during the match. <br /> <br /> Match 5: Roadie, Roddy Piper and Brown's Bad News are not a technical classic, but a pretty decent fight for Wrestlemania. Piper comes out half black / half white, which is a classic moment. In the end, both guys are fighting in a double countdown without a clear winner. <br /> <br /> Match 6: Hart vs Bolshevik Foundation - Complete a squash match. The Hart Foundation wins easily. Surprisingly, WWE used to have a command unit. <br /> <br /> Match 7: “The Barbarian” vs. Tito Santana - “Hin Family” Bobby Hinana is better in this match, since “The Barbarian” beats Tito Santana. Not memorable, but good, to go back and see years later. <br /> <br /> Match 8: Randy Savage and Sensational Sherry - Dusty Rhodes and Sapphire - Great team match between the sexes. Dusty Rhodes wears an uncomfortable polka dot outfit in the ring. In the end, Rhodes and Sapphire defeated the "Macho King" and the Sensational Queen Sherry. <br /> <br /> Match 9: "Rockers" and "Orient Express" - surprisingly the next match of the team. During this period, the tag fight was much better. Young Sean Michaels and his partner Marty Jannetti lose in this match, counting with Orient Express. <br /> <br /> Match 10: Dino Bravo - Jim Duggan - Duggan gets a decent reaction, despite his American Patriot trick. Bravo, a member of the Jimmy Hart band, enters the ring with Hart and Earthquake. Despite the support, Duggan won. <br /> <br /> Match 11: “A Man for a Million Dollars” Ted DiBias (c) vs. Jake Robert “Snake” for a Million Dollar Championship - the first major main event of the night. Roberts has done away with the fans. The match was significantly good for what it was. DiBiase can pick up Roberts with the countdown win. But in the end, Roberts will get hold of Dibias money and give it away. <br /> <br /> Match 12: The big boss against Akim (with Slick) is a sad attempt by a gang of one person to become an African dream named Akim. A very short match that took longer to develop like a match. Boss Man wins with a bang. <br /> <br /> Match 13: Jimmy Snook v Superflues vs. Rick Rude - Heann enters the ring with Ore in this match. Snook, Wrestlemania never worked. He always seemed a loser. After 5 minutes, Ruud defeated Snooka. <br /> <br /> Match 14: WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior - dubbed "The Ultimate Challenge", we get some interesting promo from both men earlier at night. The match was actually very good, considering that people tend to think that Hogan cannot fight. Many waterfalls that really attract the crowd and people who watch at home. In the end, the Warrior gains victory over Hogan and wins both titles. A dazed crowd watches Hulk Hogan suffer his first loss at WrestleMania.
