Well, I'm not a film critic or something like that. But I have my own opinion about this film. I think that the best in this film was Amanda Bynes, she played her role very well, I watched her films a lot, I liked that the most! When you watch this movie, you can just relax, go down and watch it. You do not need to try to look for subtext or something like that. You just watch it. The film is really great. Maybe I liked it for the actress, maybe for all the landscapes, but I liked it. All created atmosphere. In an instant, I just felt like I was in that university, in this room. This is not another dramatic film that is made to win an Oscar, it is just a good film to watch in your free time.
