I decided that I needed to extend my review of my favorite movie. Unlike other military films dedicated to this event, Apocalypse Now leads the viewer to a psychological state. Pure surrealism makes the body uncomfortable, but you can't take your eyes off it. Based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now, slowly lowers its protagonist Willard (Martin Sheen) into insanity, most likely, just like Kurtz plunged into insanity. The production of this film is notorious for his delays, secured by the monsoon season and Brando's unprepared performance (he read his lines from cues-cues). There is a documentary called “The Apocalypse Now”: “The Apocalypse of Directors”, which tells how everyone went through the creation of this. <br /> <br /> The introductory part is one of the most famous and popular in any film. Since the blades of helicopters are heard in slow motion, and napalm falls on the trees, you can hear the song “The End” of the Doors. The next shot is Willard in his bed with the fan turned on, so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the noise of the fan. We were told that he performs special missions for the military, mostly murders. When he is given the next mission, he is confused. "Charging a person for killing here is like giving a speeding ticket to the Indy 500." The man he must kill was a respected colonel who went insane and isolated himself from the people of the tribes. Kurtz orders the atrocities committed by these people, and he must stop me. Willard does not go alone however. He is carried on a boat with several soldiers, and they face several battles. On the way, they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore “Hurray” about the war. Willard speculates that if Kilgore is crazy, what Kurtz might be like. There are many scenes in which Willards plunges into insanity: the attack of a tiger, the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese people, the unceasing rain, scattered corpses scattered around, and the death of members of his team. When he reaches the Kurtz complex, he is met by villagers and a hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of killing Kurtz right away, Willard starts talking to him, and his conscience starts to doubt what he should do. Kurtz, on the other hand, wants to die. He is tired of war and wants to be a soldier. Willard kills his machete, while in unison people sacrifice a buffalo with several machetes. As soon as they realize that their leader was killed, instead of killing Willard, they welcome him as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply breathtaking. Colors without grain, which is rare in older films. I can watch him muffled and admire the beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> The acting ensemble is amazing, everyone plays their roles well. Many criticize Brando for some reason, but I think he plays his part as a depressed lunatic who was beaten by the war. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack and score pursue and create the mood for the film. I wonder what instrument they used in that guitar sound when the credits roll? There was a lot of parody on this film, but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer why a character with the same name in a police show behaves like an idiot: "Your character provides comic relief for the show, like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse now". Those who have seen the movie know why this is fun.
