Sharkey's car - one of the best achievements of Bert Reynolds. He is also considered one of the best modern crime dramas. Erotic and brutal film is different in that it tells the story in Atlanta and presents you (the viewer) with a chaotic detective story on a silver platter. Devoted and determined, Sharkey should stop the killing of Domino, a lovely night lady whose clientele is not ordinary. Soon, Sharkey's crime-fighting machine uncovers a conspiracy of the highest order that threatens to corrupt the interior of Atlanta. As a resident of Metro Atlanta, I recall the excitement in the city during the production of the film. Sharkey's car goes to great lengths to give an accurate idea of ​​Atlanta. Twenty years later and 2,000,000 people are filmed, the film stands the test of time. Believe me, Atlanta has not changed. One of the highlights of the picture is the daring trick Dar Robinson (classic symbolic finale). It was even shown on This Incredible, ABC reality show of the period. It's just too bad Hollywood doesn't make enough films like this. Lie back, every popcorn, and watch the pure silver cinema.
