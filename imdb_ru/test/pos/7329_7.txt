I was quite shocked to see the low rating that this film received here, personally considering it to be a funny family fare. He revolves around a young teenager, Sandy Ricks, whom his mother sends to Coral Key to spend the summer with her uncle Porter. There he became friends with a dolphin named Flipper. A lot of adventures begin against the background of a predictable nephew / uncle connection, as well as a little novel for Sandy with a local girl. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m a big fan of Crocodile Dundee, so I loved Paul Hogan in his role as a crisp and funny Uncle Porter. To begin with, he keeps an endless supply of spaghetti-o in his house, so that he can serve as his usual meal, with a heated blowtorch! Elijah Wood, Frodo of The Lord of the Rings, seemed quite competent playing young Sandy, a boy who at first did not really like his places of forced summer holidays. <br /> <br /> Of course the dolphin is great and there are some great underwater scenes. Filmed in the Florida Keys, it was apparently filmed in the Bahamas. This adaptation of Flipper makes an excellent family entertainment, sweet, sentimental and fun movie, which today infinitely surpasses many cinematic proposals for young people.
