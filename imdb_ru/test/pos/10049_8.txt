This is a wonderful film like a film - it gets 8 out of 10. Like a shot of a precise story ... I want to be more loving, but this is 5 out of 10. And I think that is actually very merciful. <br /> <br /> How was he - this man with a horse and a saber who was the youngest "boy" general in the Union army in the American Civil War and ended up dying with his entire team in the greatest military victory of the North American Indian tribes? Opinions, militant, pompous, bloody, ambitious, clever, too clever, enemy-indian, friend-indian (?) And national hero. His death in 1876 was perceived as a national tragedy and pushed him to a position of glory equal to Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, Grant / Lee, and Sherman / Jackson. Only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career — an overly ambitious “hot spur,” has his reputation declined. Nevertheless, to this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the most memorable figure in the military annals of our history in order to lose his last battle (I cannot recall a similar battle - maybe General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, forced to stay with his people on Bataan Marsh deaths - but Wainwright survived March and World War II). <br /> <br /> Caster appeared in more films than the much better generals, because of western adventures and the Little Big Horn. It is a pity that the details of this career have never been handled with such love as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn in this film. But even in 1941, the legend was still powerful. Olivia De Haviland portrayed Libby Custer, which was recently pointed out in another film review on the subject, surviving George until 1933, so her effective treatment of the story was still in place eight years later. Caster was seen as our lost, but brave knight, wandering, and with the approaching shadow of the Second World War, we had to preserve the myth and bury the truth. John Ford would understand this completely and approve of it. <br /> <br /> So we get the opinion that he was hot, but was patriotic. Although Custer was almost driven out of West Point by flaws (which was true), he was in the 1861 class, and it would be very foolish to be picky about such a fighter this year. You see, much of the so-called military talent from West Point (from Robert E. Lee) was southern and joined the Confederation. The union needed every northern “point” person they could find. <br /> <br /> Custer’s career in the Civil War should be carefully examined - he was seconded to the headquarters of Major General George B. McClellan and distinguished himself. Himself in the peninsula of Campania and other military actions on the eastern front. But he was a cavalryman - and he would have stood under the watchful eyes of Grant and friend Sherman Phil Sheridan in the latter parts of the war. In particular, he served in a big way and with distinction in the battle of Cedar Creek, which put an end to the threat of the Confederation in the Shenandoah Valley. It also hit Caster strongly on a personal level (his close friend from West Point, Stephen Ramser, joined the Confederation and rose to a position similar to Caster - mortally wounded, Caster sat with Ramser all last night alive last. <Br / > <br /> After the war, everything fell apart. He wanted to make his brevet - a major general (it wasn’t the way it was on the battlefield). They only had a lieutenant colonel to give him to an abbreviated army along the border. He tried to play politics by making a mistake by supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political trip in 1866, and found that most northerners hated Johnson as an inept idiot. He allegedly admired the Indians (he certainly eloquently wrote about them and the West), but in 1868 he caused a real military slaughter of Indian of women and children ending in a military tribunal. Later, during the 1870s, he supported India’s claims against a group of politicians (who approached the Secretary of War, William Belknap), who bought and sold Indian trading posts with a view to profit. This ruined Belknap and left a black eye on administration of grants. This put him in a doghouse with Grant and Sherman (who was the former commander of Belknap), and Sheridan barely saved his career. Then he was sent to the final campaign of the Big Horn. And immortality came. <br /> <br /> This career is worth a real movie, but will it be too critical? Should we stick to a man of 1850 - 1876 by the standards of 2007? Would we like to do it in a hundred years? Of course, this could happen, but I'm not sure that we would like it. <br /> <br /> Caster (1941 style) approaches Flynn as a glove, as he comes closest to the dance performance in any of his major films. His latest film with Olivia De Haviland is underlined by melancholy because of the fate of the hero’s hero. In support, actors such as Sydney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn performed well in the role of friends, enemies, or even insidious meanness (Kennedy). As an interesting example of myth-making, it remains high, but as a study of a complex military hero, this is not what it should be.
