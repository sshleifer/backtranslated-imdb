Since this cartoon was made in the old days, Felix says, using cartoon bubbles, and the animation style is very rough compared to today. However, compared to his contemporaries, this is a pretty good cartoon and still holds well. This is because, despite his age, the cartoon is very creative and funny. <br /> <br /> Felix meets a guy whose shoe activities are taking shape because he cannot sell shoes. Well, Felix needs money so he can go to Hollywood, so he tells the guy at the store that he will sell every shoe. Felix distributed chewing gum all over the city, and soon people got stuck and left their shoes, hurrying to buy new ones at a shoe store. In gratitude, the guy gives Felix $ 500! However, the owner of Felix wants to take the money and go it alone, so Felix comes up with a way to sneak up. <br /> <br /> Once there, Felix bursts into the studio and annoys himself a little. On the way, he meets the cartoon versions of the comics Ben Turpin and Charlie Chaplin. In the end, thanks to luck, Felix discovered and offered a contract for the film. Hooray!
