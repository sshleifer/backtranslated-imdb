First of all, let it be known that I did not come to this film for music; in fact, I find it disgusting. I was really interested in the psychology of the punk subculture. At this point, the documentary coped pretty well. One unpleasant aspect was the numerous scenes in which the songs are played, and the promoted group and the militant crowd demonstrate frenzy. If you saw the first such scene, you saw them all. This overkill is a party compensated by printing lyrics of some songs. With their help, the public can mentally connect with the group. Lyrics are much more interesting than the confusion of sounds emanating from the speakers. I do not know why all the texts were not printed. Scenes without lyrics are slow (ironic, yes, given the numerous references to the speed of music) the flow of the film. Interviews with fans and groups were also insightful, although there is disappointment when the interviews of the latter group are not as exciting or humorous as the first two. All in all, a good movie that I'm glad I saw. I will check the next steps if I ever get a chance. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote: he tried to hide the fact that he could not play, rubbing peanut butter on himself and breaking the glass. <br /> <br /> A broad punk generalization: although their shamefulness, lack of vocabulary and hygiene, and narcotic oblivion are often ridiculous, in the end, they understand that punks are just pathetic minors who rebel just for the sake of an uprising, which can be seen through sofomorian lyrics and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize (not taking into account the black flag, which is somewhat less misinformed than its peers).
