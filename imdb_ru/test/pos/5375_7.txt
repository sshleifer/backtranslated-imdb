This completely strange feature is a typical and striking example of the satanic horror shock of the 70s. The events are completely confusing, and it will take quite a long time before you realize what the hell is happening, but the brooding atmosphere draws you in right away. Right from the indescribably strange introduction, showing a couple of creepy children who turn toys into real military equipment, you just know that this is an uncompromising and rude shocker. The Brotherhood of Satan will soon become another episode in the supposed and unofficial subgenre of the "creepy little town hiding a dark secret." A young widower, traveling with his new delicious girlfriend and 8-year-old daughter, stops in a remote small town to report a traffic accident that they observed on a nearby highway. Residents are very hostile and insist that visitors leave immediately. The city is clearly bathed in an atmosphere of fear and panic, as local children disappear inexplicably disappeared, and unnatural forces hold everyone within the city. Hillsboro is in the grip of a satanic cult, which is apparently ruled by older members of the community. I really liked the “Brotherhood of Satan”. The story reminded me of a novel written by John Saul, but I can't remember the title. It also related to the cult of the elderly, insulting young rural residents for their greedy services. The film is mainly based on creepy decorations (such as dolls and witchcraft relics), but a slightly more exciting and consistent script would be nice. The theme often raises many questions and questions, and director Bernard McEvity cannot always give us the answers. The climax is awesome, very seventies (shocking) and unforgettable. Beautifully filmed movie too.
