Although this film ruined the career of director and screenwriter Michael Cimino and bankrupted United Artists, it still remains one of the best films of all time. There are many reasons to close this film prematurely for sure. Among them: its length, technical problems, the tremendous mistreatment of animals on the set - this list goes on and on. And yet, despite all this, it remains a film that captures something. This is a classic example of naturalistic storytelling on a par with Strindberg - his moments last as long as they could in reality, without being taken aback for good cinematic time. He feels real in moments of anger, love and war (and hopelessness). This movie should be watched by any person who appreciates the film and storytelling.
