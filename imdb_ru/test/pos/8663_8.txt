The bus landed a nameless man near the dilapidated Standard Oil gas station in the middle of nowhere. We will never know where the bus came from, why it is on it or who it is. Why is he the only passenger? Is he a prisoner? Is he the "annoying person" mentioned in the title of the film? He died and went to heaven or hell? Like our man, we do not have the opportunity to stop and think. He was met by a kind of gatekeeper and sent to an indescribable city. From the first day all the choices are made for him. The apartment is rented, work is found, the office is appointed. In fact, his life is not quite different from the life in the virtual reality of corporate cabins and suburban apartments. Women are heartless, dinner parties - a brake, office work - sucks. But some pieces are not suitable for the puzzle. Silently working gray rogues roam the streets. Are these some kind of paramedics or secret police? And why are there no children? Does the story even unfold in the real world? Whenever we think we can get some answers, new secrets are revealed. "The Bothersome Man" leaves you half relieved that it's all over, half wants more I hope they turn into a computer game soon.
