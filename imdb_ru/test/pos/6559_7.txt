<br /> <br /> Japanese-style horror time. Uzumaki / Spiral was a complete freak from start to finish. It was funny, but sometimes it was too dependent on kitsch, and not on horror. It is difficult to summarize the story: a carefree, normal teenage girl begins to face extremely disturbing events, since the small town in which she lives seems to be under the control of spirals. Spirals everywhere, in the air, clouds, dirt and household items. Spirals take control of people, and bad things will happen to them. Oh, another thing, people accidentally turn into snails. What for? Who knows or cares, people turn into snails, that's enough for me. It was not as scary as it was simply terrible, because there were not many unknown or sharp attacks in it, as horror films often do. Uzumaki prefers to crawl and crawl (like a snail!), And do not shake. Favorite scene: a woman sleeps in the hospital room when this long, many-legged creature with a thousand legs sneaks into the room and slowly rises to the bed, through sheets, over the pillow and into the sleeping ear. I squeezed and squeezed my toes. Uzumaki has several scenes, really cruel, but at the same time funny. For example, a person is obsessed with spirals, he falls into his washer, because he sees a spiral, when it rotates, he commits a spiral suicide inside the washer. The last picture we see about him is his body, completely folded and rubber, a human spiral of flesh, and in the middle of the puck a single eye flashes. Strange image. Uzumaki has a clear psychedelic bias that adds to his charm and fun. I love horror movies like this. This is not about murder, a la slasher films, but about the power of evil (helix!), Which captures you and tries to kill you, causes you to kill others. Films like Uzumaki prove that there are many ways to make a horror movie, and thanks for that.
