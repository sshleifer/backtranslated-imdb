This film reminds me of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The State of the Garden, not because of the content, but because it is one of those films that you donâ€™t hear about except from word of mouth, or you are reading a DVD in a video store and think "why not." Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised (like the aforementioned films) by how good he was and how much I liked it. <br /> <br /> It is best to see it without knowing about the film, and only the intrigue that prompts you to actually watch it. It is also best to look with someone else, or if you know someone who has seen it - you will want to talk about it !! This is a wonderful movie that looks good with you after watching. It is also a smart watch, which does not require much effort for self-determination of details. <br /> <br /> Just enjoy :)
