In England, we often feel very attached to British films that we like, because we are so used to the usual American settings and accents. Being from London, where virtual sexuality is established, I felt a strong emotional attachment to her. The characters of “Virtual Sexuality”, especially women, are just British teenagers, I felt almost in the film. I immediately contacted Alex’s character from the film, his shyness is quite common in most British teenagers, especially around girls. Virtual sexuality made me feel really good, as it is one of the few British films that is dedicated not to gangsters or the middle class, but to people who watch the movie, ordinary teenagers. Americans don't really feel emotional attachments, but every British teenager should look at that. Anyone from London will recognize parts of the city from the film; this has definitely taken a special place in my video box!
