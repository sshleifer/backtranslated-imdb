It is a pity that this series was not remastered and filmed by Warner or any other professional cinema. <br /> <br /> Copies of most episodes are available, but usually they are of poor quality and are copies of copies. <br /> <br /> As far as I understand, 92 episodes were produced during its launch, but only 15 are marked here. <br /> <br /> Some of the authors of the series, such as Richard Mateson, have become famous authors. <br /> <br /> An excellent series, well written, well set and well prepared. <br /> <br /> Michael Weldon, <br /> <br /> Udon Thani, Thailand
