This is one of the best movies about well-being in 1999, in which Kate Capshaw starred in a movie about a small town and a love letter. First of all, the landscape is beautiful, and anyone who watches this movie and does not want to move to this place goes crazy! For the cast, Capshaw is amazing as the main actress who captivates the emotional role of the roller coaster. Tom Everett Scott is fascinating as the “author” of the notes throughout the film, and always the delightful Ellen Degenéres is hilarious! Blyth Danner and the actress who plays the bookseller is also amazing. Despite the setback, the film is great because it is short and sweet, and also very romantic. 10/10
