As a fan of Bills, I initially found it annoying that they made a film about Bills and the loss of four super-cups. But as soon as I started to look, I felt really connected. It was actually nice to see how the Bills won the Super Bowl, and I must say that for a television movie this was actually very well done. Gil Bellows as QB, and Jon Voight as the old school coach did a very good job. 8 out of 10
