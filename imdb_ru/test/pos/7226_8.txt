Who else, except Tromy, can take the classic tragedy and change it to today's standards ???? No one .... in my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio sucks. "Thromion and Juliet" is a certain part of the original Shakespearean tragedy, but it holds well. His sick, crazy, perverted, but still insanely funny and filled. For the most part, this follows the true story of Romeo and Juliet, but many Troma elements have been added. Will Keenan is great in the role of Thromeo. The game is solid, and the story is gorgeous. Many people look past these films, not only the films of Kaufman Trome, but all those that they distribute. Of course, the films of Troma have acquired a taste, but you should see some of them. This is the renegade of filmmaking at its best.
