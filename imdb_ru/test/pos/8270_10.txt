Hi, I am John, and I would like to tell you all that my dog ​​was in this movie on the bait screen, he was a pit, like the one who was going to bite a man chained. My dogs were named Colin, and he starred in this film for a week. he was also in other things, such as the UK Watchdog and some other small details. he won several dog shows, but he passed away, now I miss him, he was a great, loyal and faithful dog, and we had a great time together, but he had cancer that is not treatable, so I had to fire him what was the worst day of my life, I hope that it will give you something to look for in the film if you watch it again. <br /> <br /> thanks everyone
