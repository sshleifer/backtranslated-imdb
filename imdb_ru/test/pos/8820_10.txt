Michael Sheen shines like the noonday sun in this brilliant depiction of a comic genius. If you are familiar with the manners and diaries of Kenneth Williams, then this drama perfectly reflects their essence. When I read about how Kenneth vacuuming in his swimming trunks, I laughed and then it came to life on the screen, but this time I did not laugh, because it was perceived as the actions of a depressed and tortured person. It must have been such a lonely existence in Kennethâ€™s skin, eager for attention, but avoiding him when it DOES MUCH! The last 20 minutes are heartbreaking, as you see how Kenneth gradually sinks into the abyss of despair and sees suicide as the only alternative. I have seen it a dozen times and still crying uncontrollably in the place where he wishes Goodnight Louis. I can not recommend this drama enough. Frankly sexy, but this suggests that Kenneth could not allow anyone to invade his world, and this is the sadness of man. For a genius who brought happiness to so many, it is such a shame that his personal life was filled with such despair and sadness. Pauly.
