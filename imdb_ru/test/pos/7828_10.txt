Without a doubt, an excellent all-round show, which, if shown today, would have attracted a huge number of fans. The bodyguards had only 6 episodes and a trailer, but they deserved a few more episodes to really bring it to speed. Shaun Pertwee and dynamic Louise Lombard, she really came to terms with professionals such as Sweeney and Thief. Diplomatic protection services are used in the plot lines, with excellent shots, plot lines and plot scenes. I don’t think it was shown on terrestrial channels such as Sky or Freeview, because it’s a shame, as if it was being shown now, I’m sure that one day the guys from Carlton TV will decide to release it on DVD, hooray .
