This short film, which won an Oscar, spawned two sequels and a series of television cartoons, has minimal animation, but a delightful script (by Theodore Geisel or Dr. Suze) and an even more memorable and charming main character. UPA pioneered the animation style that even influenced Disney in the mid-1950s and produced the best animated shorts made in the late 1940s and 1950s. This is one of the best. God to have it in print. Highly recommended.
