This is one wonderful, exciting movie that you remember for a long time. This is history, America, the change of time, Teddy Roosevelt, Morocco, the abducted American and her children, as well as the leader of the Berbers, with the blood of the Prophet in his veins. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on a true story - like Jesse James was a banker. The American was abducted in Morocco, and the marines set off halfway to the shores of Tripoli to save him. So much for that. You know Hollywood. Sean Connery is a Berber leader and Muslim leader. Candace Bergan - a guy who was abducted along with his two children; son - Rex Harrison's grandson, Simon, no less. John Houston is the Secretary of State, with a big straight line in the style of John-Houston at a state dinner, watch this. Brian Keith I.S. Teddy Roosevelt, an All-American, fully male character, an interesting and modern commentary to date. <br /> <br /> The scope and beauty of the desert and Morocco perfectly show in the cinema this film, which stays with you, haunts and remembers the memory. The score is as wide and exotic as the images. <br /> <br /> This is a story about two cultures, both with great ideas and with historical events that fight for the future, without even knowing about each other. In any case, the struggle is reduced to force against ingenuity. <br /> <br /> Finally there is a little boy - remember the little boy? What do you think he thinks?
