The terrible genius Dario Argento is one of my favorite directors, and his films Suspiria, Phenomena and Profondo Rosso are on my personal favorites list of all time. The 1987 Opera is another fascinating and brilliant film that no horror-lover can afford to miss, and it will keep you on the edge of the chair from the very beginning to the end. This stunning and ultra-brutal Djallo could well be described as the master's most disgusting film, and this is quite, given that the Argento films are not quite known for their rudeness. Violence is extreme and highly stylized, which makes Opera a nightmare of censorship. <br /> <br /> - Attention! Spoilers ahead! - <br /> <br /> Just when Betty (Cristina Marsillah), a young opera singer, becomes successful, a murderous and incredibly sadistic psychopath begins to pursue her ... The murders are really cruel and have a particularly sadistic character. The killer attaches needles to Betty's bound eyelids, so she has to keep them open and watch him brutally kill people close to her in a disgusting way. After the slaughter is over, the killer frees Betty and leaves, just to return for her other friends ... <br /> <br /> As usual in the Argento films, the violence is extremely visual and very stylized. “Opera” is a truly brutal film, and what a stylish and atmospheric film it is. This film is absolutely seductive and clean, tense from beginning to end. The performances are very good, especially Christina Marsillah brilliantly plays a leading role. A stunning beauty and gorgeous actress, Marsillach fits perfectly into her role as a talented singer, whose fear and terrible experiences gradually drive her crazy. Other great performances include Ian Charleston as the director of the horror film, who directs the opera, and the real girlfriend of the director Argento, Daria Nicolodi, who plays a role in many of his films. The filming work is gorgeous, like in all the films of Argento, and the huge opera house is a great setting that makes a great contribution both to the beauty of the film and to its constantly eerie atmosphere. The score, partly classical music and partly heavy metal, is also great, although I missed Goblin's brilliant soundtracks to Progressive Rock, which are such a distinctive feature of most other Argento films. “Opera” is a truly terrifying and absolutely addictive game Giallo. This is absolutely necessary for any horror lover, and I highly recommend it for any other film fan who is not too sensitive when it comes to extreme violence. Excellent and absolutely tempting!
