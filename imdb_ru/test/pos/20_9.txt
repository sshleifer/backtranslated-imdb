Many other comments about the film speak for themselves - I just want to add that we showed it last week, about 30 in our Community Cinema, and its overall average score was 8.6. Thus, we would 100% recommend this for today's audience, especially if they can see it on a real movie screen and then can talk about it with others, as our audience did. <br /> <br /> In itself, the strength of the acting performances of the whole troupe was incredible and quite fascinating. Of course, Finney and Courtney were really stars. but all were carefully chosen. For our afternoon audience, most of whom are “older people,” the fact that the plot could be so easily tracked because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non-technical use of camera and sound made a big impact. > <br /> How amazing, as many have said, to see a truly great British film: still not dated twenty years later: not full of blood and courage: not confusing because of bob-pro-everywhere and forward through the storyline of time: no sinister sex scenes. Such views were even expressed by some who were younger.
