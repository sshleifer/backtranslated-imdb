Wallace and Gromit have been around for a while, but this was their first foray into the silver screen. Fans of the British television series, like me, really wanted to see them, and the film was well shown in cinemas. In many ways, the reason is that the film is funny and quite original. In the world of CG-films, such as SHREK and TOY STORY, this movie-stop-roller is a good alternative to the trend in children's films, and also does not look like a cartoon. In addition, compared with much earlier films made in the stop-roller mode (such as KING-KONG and Ray Harrihausen, such as SINBAD), the quality and movement of the characters are several years better. Look very smooth, natural and alive. > <br /> In addition to the quality of the animation, this film also deserves praise on any other level. First, the actors sound great work. Secondly, the script is very simple, but also very cute and pleasant - with several doubles, which probably should pass over the heads of children. Thirdly, they manage to make this film not only for children, but also for people of all ages, since the film is neither sugar, nor targeted only at young people. In particular, I was fascinated by the incredibly cute movie - and especially the charming bunnies. I especially liked them in the closing credits - which made me very happy that I stayed to watch the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that if you are not really mixed in the dirt, you will love this movie. It is fresh, funny and surprisingly clever. I hope that we will see a sequel - and that says something, as I usually hate sequels.
