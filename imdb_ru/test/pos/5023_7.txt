A warm hearted film depicting Michael the Archangel as an overweight cigarette-smoking smoker who loves to dance and jump with the opposite sex. He, however, has a good side, as he seeks to rectify the situation in the lives of several burnt losers before being called back to heaven. A funny, well-played movie; very pleasant, although somewhat disrespectful.
