(ATTENTION: SPOILERS!) Five young people ignore the warnings of forester George Kennedy and ascend into the misty mountains of Oregon, where they are followed and torn by a pair of huge, deformed, thoroughbred village twins. When only two remain, Warren and his girlfriend Connie, they return to their animal instincts to stay alive. The film ends with Connie shoving half her hands into the killer’s throat, strangling him to death. A very powerful, albeit somewhat overvalued, slasher film off the beaten path, effectively using lighting, sound and photographs, makes it a step above the usual “FIFTEENTH 13th”. Led by an attractive, pretty cast, especially Deborah Benson (where is she now?) And Gregg Henry, this elegant companion for SQUIRM director Jeff Lieberman (1976) and BLUE SUNSHINE (1977) should not be missed.
