“Remote” is an episode of Turkish life that follows the worldly activities of two adult cousins; one photographer and another unemployed minor. There is no doubt that the author Nuri Bilge Ceylan is in the development stage and has considerable talent. Nevertheless, this little foreign minimalistic art drama is so full of empty filler and so devoid of history or something fascinating or provocative that it will probably please only the most avid film fans and the general public. Personally, I quickly became bored because of the slow pace of the film, and I quickly stepped over the empty spaces - and there are many of them - between the dialogue, the development of the plot and the outcome. “Remote” is a very well-made esoteric.
