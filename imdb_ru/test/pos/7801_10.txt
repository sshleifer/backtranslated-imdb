Andaz Apna Apna is a film that I value, and his one film, which I don’t mind looking at any time ... well, almost any time! This film is simply amazing and, in my opinion, the funniest film I've ever seen! And yes, I put it on top of Gera Feri ... reasons? Gera Fery has scenes that you’ll watch, but Andaz Apna Apna? Impossible! Just because every scene is a scene you need to follow! Amir and Salman share excellent chemistry and are flawless in their places, but I will put the characters in order of favoritism: <br /> <br /> Rank # 1. Criminal Master Gogo (the best performance of Shakti Kapoor today, and yes, it happened before couches): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to the well-known Mogambo family (Mr. India’s fame). The criminal master Gogo is actually Mogambo's nephew, but for Mogambo he is more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son. Gogo, makes the biggest mistake in life, borrowing 36,000 Tejd rupees (which, as Balla once said: “Fraud and deception!”). Now Gogo's sole purpose is to return what belongs to him, and in his way of recovering his lost money, Gogo realizes that he needs to reach more than 36,000, and thus begins ... Gogo's struggle against the world of sinners. /> <br /> Level # 2. Teja (Main Teja, Mark Idhar Khai!): Teja is an evil character, the twin of Rama Gopal Badzhaya. Originally named Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja decides to change his name to suit his personality. Teja, being a child, always envied his brother, and once everything changed for the worse when his father gave all his wealth to Rama Bahaj. Teja decided to kill his father, but in the darkness of the night, instead, he killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Ravina's father), although Teja does not regret his actions. Now Teji’s only mission is to somehow return his property and open his own poultry factory and bakery. Teja must also return Gogo's loan (but does not intend to do this). To achieve his evil goals, Teja hires two people: Roberta (Vijay Hot, who is very good at aiming) and Vallu (Shahzad Khan, a clone of Ajit’s son ... who is a very very smart boy!) No. 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): He wants to marry the rich heiress Ravina, so he sells his father’s cheap sedan and heads for Mumbai. Amar, without any problems, cares about big business, which Ravina's father will give him after their wedding, and is ready to sacrifice his happiness and move to London if necessary. <br /> <br /> Rank # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, the Premier is the second most innocent character who appears in the film, and the way Amar tries to use him in a friend’s mask is tragic. <br /> <br /> I won "do not reveal more characters, because Jesus Christ! I just would not stop typing! The film is just awesome! Go and get a DVD right now and watch out for these cheap VCDs, because they’ve missed a lot of good movie scenes. <br /> <br /> The background music is gorgeous, and the action is better than that of the Matrix, especially in the final. Between Prem and the Criminal Master of Gogo (watch this), he appears at the climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters that teaches us a lot about life, values ​​and ethics. This teaches us courage (why else would Amara ask Prema to stay when they went to meet the kidnapper, although Prem complained that he needed to go to the toilet ???). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially in scenes where Salman becomes Amir’s target and gets an overdose of indigestion pills, the part where Teja reveals his sad feelings about why he cannot go to London, and the part where Gogo is arrested in the final, without even returning his 36 thousand. Andas Apna Apna as a whole is a complete package .... sit back and enjoy the ride! I bet that after this there will be a second trip ... and then a third one! <br /> <br /> Then the film was considered a failure, and, I bet, nobody liked it, but guys! This movie was a hit! Even if there were not enough people in cinemas, this film is one of the best-selling home DVDs and one of the most popular films on most channels, so the producers have long laughed at their banks!
