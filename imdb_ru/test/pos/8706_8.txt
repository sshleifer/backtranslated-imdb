I watched it on Sky late night as I am a vampire fan. I have to admit that I almost expected it to be a B-Movie crash, but I was pleasantly wrong. <br /> <br /> A subspecies is a family of vampires. When the Vampire Lord dies, his two sons, the handsome and the Noble Stephen, and his brother, Evil, disgusting Rada, start a war with each other because of their birthright, the Bloodstone. The bloodstone is a kind of holy grail for vampires, and it bleeds with the blood of saints, which gives the vampire who drinks it, the highest level. <br /> <br /> The fight for the Bloodstone takes an unexpected turn when 3 college students find themselves on the territory of their brothers on a school trip, and Stefan must protect them from his Lusts brothers. <br /> <br /> As I said, I went into this film without expecting much, but it was one of the best low-budget films I've ever seen. The scenes and locations (I think Romania has been around for a long time since I saw it) are very good, and the music has justified the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was adequate, but it was Anders Howe. like an evil raid that steals a movie (and all subsequent sequels). Hove's performance, like a perverted vamp, is truly breathtaking and raises the film from zero to pretty good!
