After watching Meredith in Beyond the Prairie, I had to buy another film in which she was watching. I can't believe how she allowed herself this teen movie. It is best to watch it with the sound turned off, but just focus on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network releases the Beyond the Prairie DVD. It is worth it at all costs, you have to pay for it. <br /> <br /> This beauty needs someone to include her in a script that can use her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman. Perhaps some of her last will do, but I have not seen them. She has Catherine Bell smile and Dana Delaney eyes with a much younger body. <br /> <br />
