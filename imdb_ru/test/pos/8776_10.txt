This film is a masterpiece of brilliant acting and a timely patriotic sense of pride in America. Nazi saboteurs 40s replace today's Middle Eastern terrorists. The goal is the same: to terrorize, destroy lives, destroy property and kill Americans! We see the unfairly accused Barry (Bob Cummings) on Lamma trying to uncover the plot of real Nazi terrorists, meeting the beautiful Pat (Priscilla Lane), and together they go to New York, pursuing the treacherous and evil saboteur Fry, who skillfully plays Norman Lloyd. Along the way, they also meet a very sinister Otto Kruger, who plays the leader of a Nazi saboteur, but disguised as an outstanding model citizen, where Barry, searching for Fry's saboteur, trusts him only to pass him on to local law enforcement agencies. He runs away, meets a kind-hearted blind gentleman and his niece, enters Priscilla Lane. From there, Barry and Pat head off to Sod City, California, and face a gang of saboteurs on the east coast heading east. They end up in the mansion of an unlikely New York civilian. The situation gets tough when the bad guys kidnap Pat from Barry, and he follows her with reckless energy. The culmination of the film is the famous scene of the Statue of Liberty, which is sustained in many collections. This is a real, blue patriotic performance with flags waving at its best, and what’s wrong with that! Watch this movie if you don’t see another Hitchcock movie. You will be caught up in a patriotic sensation, and the love interest between Cummings and Lane will make you want to be filmed in other films. She is a beautiful, perfect girl next door, she is often underestimated, her talent is shown in this film. Look at this and go bless America!
