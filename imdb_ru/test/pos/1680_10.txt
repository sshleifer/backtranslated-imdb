Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) at first glance can be described as a French variation of John Houston's original film Asphalt Jungle (1950). The difference between these two films is that Riffi (1955) pays a little more attention to the sequence of robberies. In addition, the police are not so much involved in the consequences of the robbery in Rifi, but in the Asphalt jungle. In the end, Riffifi (1955), in my opinion, is slightly better than Asphalt Jungle (1950). Wonderful Noir painting, which defines the French cinema of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Spartak (1960) may have destroyed the notorious blacklist, but in my opinion, Riffi (1955) began to destroy the indestructible Hollywood blacklist. The first film in five years for Jules Dassin, who was the victim of a communist hunt McCarthy in the late 40s - early 50s. He received some kind of retribution when Riffifi (1955) became successful in France and Europe. Thus, challenging the poisonous Hollywood blacklist mainly, which probably inspired others to do the same. Riefife (1955) is the most important film in Dassin's career, because he not only restored his name, but also gave him a second chance to star in films. <br /> <br /> Jules Dassin gave the cinema world and its ever-growing viewers a masterpiece of influential proportions. His handling of the material is exceptional, and the leadership of the cast is impeccable. Creates tense situations with precise craftsmanship. Dassin went full circle in the film Noir genre, directing his best and last Noir, Riffi (1955). Marked the end of the Dassin period in filmmaking, when he was involved in the creation of Noir paintings. <br /> <br /> Riffifi (1955) is the number one film in the arsenal of more than thirty films for director Jules Dassin. A masterpiece of acting, cinematography, directing, editing and writing. Not a film to leave your place for one minute, because something memorable always happens. Brilliant, like everyone, Jean Pierre Melville, who was a master of this type of film. Masterpieces, such as Rififi (1955), are relatively small compared to probably billions of films made in cinema history. <br /> <br /> One of the interesting aspects of Rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of the robbery, which most of the 118 minutes require. The main characters plan and execute the robbery of the gemstone in the same way as the director prepares the film for the pre-production, production and post-production of the film. Shows how difficult it is to commit a Jewel robbery, as in Rififi (1955), and why very few will do something like that. The fact that the scene hardly contains confusion, as in other movie robberies, turns this scene into something more. Close to how you can get the perfect sequence in a movie. <br /> <br /> The absence of unnatural sound in the landmark trit-minute sequence of robbery puts him in the realm of absolute realism. Any dialogue and / or music will destroy any tension and tension that the director is trying to create. Using natural sound makes the robbery sequence a rewarding experience of watching movies. Now, filmmakers and producers will use the dialogue and music in a similar scene because of the uncertainty of patience of the main movie fan. Maintains a level of consistency that never fails. <br /> <br /> Maintaining a high level of uncertainty is what makes a sequence of robberies perfect. The director achieves uncertainty in the robbery episode, which is rarely seen in most robbery scenes from robbery films. Jean Servays and the other protagonists contribute to the intense game. Getting uncertainty on stage is a task that few are capable of. The rififi robbery sequence (1955) reaches the Hitchcock level of tension and tension. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers of the years following Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) were influenced, if not inspired by it. One of the creators of the film was influenced by Jean-Pierre Melville (the original choice for director Riffi), who used the variants of the robbery sequence in Le Doulos (1961) and Le Circle Rouge (1970). Another director who was influenced by the film is Stanley Kubrick, who made a similar film in the movie "Murder" (1956). In addition, Quentin Tarantino, whose debut film, Reservoir Dogs (1992) was inspired by this film. Other influential directors are John Woo, Michael Mann, Paul Schrader, Ringo Lam, etc. Du / Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) is in many ways comparable to Bob le Flambert (1955). One of them, Jules Dassin and Jean Pierre Melville, shot innovative films in Riffi (1955) and Bob le Flamber (1955). Secondly, in each film an aging criminal participates, who plans and commits a daring robbery. Three, Bob le Flamber and Riffi finish fatally. Fourthly, in each film there are many motives and situations that classify them as great cinematographers. <br /> <br /> A part of Riffiâ€™s charm are the bold characters that surround the story, such as Tony le Stefanua, Jo le Suedua, Mario Farrati, and Cesar le Milan. Much of the violence is covert, but in reality cruel. The main characters, led by Tony le Stefanua, follow a strict outdated code of honor, reminiscent of Sam Pekingpach and John Woo. Jean Serva becomes the role of Toni le Stefanua with his cynical gaze and tired appearance. Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) became my favorite at the moment when I saw him on the big screen from beginning to end.
