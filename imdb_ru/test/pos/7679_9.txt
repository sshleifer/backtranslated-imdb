I saw the film in its original theater release in Austin, Texas. Old Paramount Theater (I donâ€™t know if it still exists.) Fully laid out, the speakers around the walls were accurately connected to all six channels. At 15 I was blown away. At that time, the concept of surround sound was completely alien to music and movies. <br /> <br /> I remember well at least three outstanding scenes in which surround sound had a huge impact. (Although, please forgive me if time distorted my memories due to inaccuracies.) The first was a camera trip along the Somovy Series, full of places and sounds of daily activities. At first you saw each of them, for example, a blacksmith, and then, when the camera transmitted them by sound, they continued to hear, moving left or right along the side of the theater back. The second was a marching orchestra, which was seen first from the front, and then passed by the camera, divided into left and right. Not only did the sound of each instrument follow its own directional path, it also changed in timbre when it played to you, to the side of you, and then from you. And if this was not enough, they also took into account the Doppler effect for each instrument as it passes. The third scene was near the end of the film, when Porgy was leaving Catfish Row for New York in search of Bess. He and about half of the actors walk past the chamber, leaving the village with the same sound effects as the orchestra. The other half of the cast / choir sings along with them, as well as waving and saying goodbye to Porgy and their other friends. Answers of friends can be heard from the sides and from behind. <br /> <br /> Surround sound was used in the film with great effects. It seems I remember a stone or something thrown from a pier, and heard it fall into the water behind me. Such trifles were obvious to viewers who were lucky enough to have as many as six channels - without them, it would seem commonplace in theaters. <br /> <br /> I stayed in the theater for several sessions. You could do it then. And I came back a few more times before he left the city. I have never seen the movie again. It literally BEGINS to release on DVD with restored image quality and surround sound. I hope someone saved it somewhere. Please, the Gershwin family, allow him to be liberated before it is lost to other generations.
