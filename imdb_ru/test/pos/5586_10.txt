This film seems to have been ignored by all. Someone has to show it on VHS and DVD. This is a great movie, a much superior movie with Brooke Shields, which was terrible. <br /> <br /> Gene Simmons deserves more respect than he does now. It would be nice if all of her films were offered on VHS or DVD. Gene Simmons was and remains a very good actress. She certainly was beautiful. In fact, she is still beautiful. She also played very well on T.V. She is much better than many actors today.
