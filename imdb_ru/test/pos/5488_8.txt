Here is another interesting action movie with Clint Eastwood. I am not particularly his fan, but I have to tell him: he knows how to make entertaining films. This is another example. It also did not prevent John Malkovich from being his film colleague. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays the murderer, and it is interesting for him to watch him, thanks to his various disguises and the terrific dialogue he was given. He also has an interesting voice. <br /> <br /> René Rousseau is quite discreet (for her), but this is normal, and Eastwood plays the usual role of a lonely policeman, his superiors do not appreciate, but show everyone at the end. I think he couldn’t stop playing Dirty Harry pieces, but he played them well. <br /> <br /> However, there were some flaws in this film, namely, confidence in the details, like a couple of times, if it were in real life, the killer would end Eastwood. In particular, there were too many holes in the climate scene. There have also been too many abuses in the name of the Lord. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good escapist rate.
