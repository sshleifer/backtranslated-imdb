Quit mom never met, now she is as funny as when she was released. A truly eccentric comedy that doesnâ€™t try too hard to be loved, and so much the better, is full of unforgettable laughing loud lines. Even the little characters are well-written and beautifully played, like the girlfriend of Billy Crystal's best friend, and Rob Reiner's beautiful cameo as agent Crystal. A little crazy and very funny.
