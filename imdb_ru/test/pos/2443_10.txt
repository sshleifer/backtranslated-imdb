Great atmosphere, the best script and good performances make it a candidate for a DVD release. <br /> <br /> This is an original tour of the history of Australian television, in which there is an unforgettable soundtrack to the class period with Doug Parkinson's gravel and wet voice, spewing Australia of the 70s throughout your cathode ray box as a surprisingly long camera reducing image. reveals the religion of the open road in all its antipodal glory. This is a souvenir from another, not too distant era, and a proud sign of the land, the mighty Down-Under from the beginning to the end in all its unbridled freedom and gloomy majesty. <br /> <br /> Come on ABC! Take part in the program and release this cool cult child of the 70s so that everyone can enjoy - or have fun again if you are lucky that you lived the dream at that time.
