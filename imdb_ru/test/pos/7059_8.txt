Camp North Star and its extraordinary camp consultant, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray) would certainly like to put an end to the long-term series of defeats to rival Camp Mohawks, an ivy league type of place in which only rich children can participate. In the meantime, we are seeing Tripper try his hand at love when he flirts aimlessly with another female counselor, Roxanne (Kate Lynch), while other teenage counselors mate and fall on their heads. The film begins at the Camp Olympiad, when rivals compete in sports athletics competitions, and Tripper almost realizes that they are doomed to fail for another year. The film also shows the growing connection between Tripper and the quietly lonely puppy-eyed Rudy (Chris Makepeace of Vamp fame), whose father is often absent all the time. It seems that Rudy is not suitable for other children of his age, and he seems to spend most of his time running in the mornings with Tripper or taking peanuts in Blackjack. The film is mainly about how friendly teen camp guides cut and mess around. <br /> <br /> You have beauty consultants, a complete nerd Spaz (Jack Bloom) with his taped glasses and bad acne with a beak nose Hardware ”(Matt Craven) who likes to blow things up, fat guy Fink (Keith Knight), who often stuffs her face, among others in the film. There is a basketball game in which poor Spaz can barely bounce off a rival Camp Mohawk, much less make an accurate kick, and poor Fink throws up boarded balls between his knees, which fly over the back board. There is a camp fire connection (with Tripper's lively scary story about the killer with hooks) and the boys drooling on beautiful ladies. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that sometimes desperately trying to squeeze out every laugh, it can and sometimes indulges in the mistakes of sentimentality (for example, scenes with sad McPee and Murray), but just like this recent viewing, I discovered that giggle. I am licked and just can not help but love it. This is a film about a summer camp that just wants to entertain you. I can not explain or reinforce that immense joy is coming, when I see Murray’s sleepy hand pulling an alarm clock out from under the blanket, which shrilly loudly says a film about the summer camp, is about to begin. His intercom jokes are especially funny. But honestly, the film is a series of comic vignettes with Murray's endless panning ... it's not that something is wrong with that. The film, however, could not survive without it, right? It's hard to even think about this movie without Murray at the head. This is a happier time, and I think that nostalgia for this summer camp plays a big role in why we, adults, still warmly communicate with “Meatballs”. And, poor Morty (Harvey Atkin), the head of the camp, who so much wants everything to go smoothly and to defeat Camp Mohawk, is a constant source of Tripper and gang entertainment, as they often play jokes with him ... especially when he sleeps on his bed! An excellent enthusiastic cast, who seems to have as much as we do.
