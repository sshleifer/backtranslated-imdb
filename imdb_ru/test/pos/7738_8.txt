I like this movie, despite the fact that it just misses the magnificence. It is an entertainment for adults, full of problems that an adult can face. The game is great. It's funny to watch John Cassavetes and Jena Rowlands as a middle-aged warring couple. Who knows how much of this comes from their own marriage? Susan Sarandon has never been more sexual or attractive than her free character Areta. Raul Julia - scream like a lustful shepherd. The landscape in Greece is spectacular; New York settings make me squirm because of the many shots of the World Trade Center. Fantastic account Stomu Yamashta. So much is happening, why is this not a great movie? It is a bit incoherent and excessively long, unfocused and awkwardly unbalanced between humor and drama. Nevertheless, it is fascinating, interesting and deeply thought out.
