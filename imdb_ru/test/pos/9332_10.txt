I'm not a big fan of music videos. I think the music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song. Any song. In other words, creative thinking goes to the window. In addition, personal feelings away from MJ, cast aside. It was the best music video of all time. Just wonderful. It was a movie. Yes, guys, it was. Brilliant! You had an amazing acting, an amazing choreography and an amazing singing. It was wonderful. Just the storyline of a beautiful young lady dating a man, but whether he was a man or something sinister. Vincent Price did his thing, adding to the song and video. MJ was MJ, enough is said about it. This song was for the video that jaguars for cars. Top of the line, PERFECTO. What was even better is that we got a real MJ without a thousand facelifts. Although ironically, cosmetics and costumes were more than enough. People go to Youtube. Take 14 minutes. Come out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful piece of art this video really is.
