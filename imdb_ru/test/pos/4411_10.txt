"Flesh" is difficult to describe with a brief summary, because, well, in principle, there is no plot. The film largely shows the day in the life of a fraudster named Joe (Joe Dullesandro, who is depicted in Louis Malla's underrated picture of "Black Moon") when he does his rounds, sleeps and models to earn money to pay for his wife's lover's abortion . <br /> <br /> A bit, and since the film takes a rather long eighty-nine minutes, you might think that “Flesh” will be a slow and boring hour and a half. You think wrong. The film is composed of improvisations, without a script, and the angles of the film are also quite in place, but under each frame there is some truth that gives the film its insanely entertaining vibration. Everything makes sense and serves a purpose in what is happening with Joe on this one day. He meets an ordinary John, who obviously lies when he says that he wants to see Joe again, a photographer who says so much that Joe is up to tears, two drag ladies who read from tabloid magazines when Joe gets his head from a drug addict with a musky voice that mumbles later about how she wants to raise her breasts, an old friend of Joe who reads stories about rape of men and men to him, and then a final scene with his wife and her lover who echoes eerily with the scene at the beginning of the film (one of best film discoveries that I saw for a long time) and fully talks about what the film as a whole is philosophical. <br /> <br /> It’s amazing how the messages and styles of the film feel almost timeless, even though it was installed in the 1960s in New York, in real time, in the real world, and filmed as an obvious independent film from that era. This, of course, is not the film that can be made today, which complements his amazing mysticism. <br /> <br /> Recharged by unexpected leaps; and there is no score to promote your images ?? "Flesh" is about as rough as the film about the male prostitution of the 60s.
