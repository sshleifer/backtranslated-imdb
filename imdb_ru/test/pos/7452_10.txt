I have nothing to say, than this is a wonderful conclusion to the story. Most people said that the plot is not enough, and it's just eye candy. But think about it, everything was explained in FFVII, you cannot add more plot to such a grandiose story that it will destroy it. They did everything they could, and I think it should be taken as A Final FMV ... the last fight. <br /> <br /> Graphics - 10/10, absolutely amazing <br /> <br /> History 8.5 / 10 - I don’t think they could expand it much more. And the things they could put in there were smart enough, I thought. <br /> <br /> Characters 9/10 - Well, most of them were already explained during the game, but still could not fit in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The sound is 10/10, since I am a metal fan, I really liked fight music ... and the piano immediately comes to me ... This is a great ST, and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Tilt / Replay 10/10 - Enjoyable every time. <br /> <br /> Overall - 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) <br /> <br /> I personally feel that this is what was needed, the struggle to end it all. The plot was already in place. The action was needed as much as people complained. I loved every second of this film. It was nice to visit the FFVII world just for the last time. <br /> <br /> Just remember this ... most of the movies that were made from the game were made by directors, I think it’s very cool for a team of game directors .. I don’t think I’ve seen the best game for the movie .. <br /> <br /> Thank you, square, I think you did everything right!
