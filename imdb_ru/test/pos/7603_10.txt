This film may seem superficial for fans. It seems to be a stereotypical high school film. But in fact, it requires an honest and touching look at the experience of high school. It does not offer some kind of unreal end, where geeks and popular children reconcile. This does not change what happened during adolescence; he is just trying to deal with it. This is really a wonderful, funny, soulful film, suitable for teenagers and for those who still remember that he is alone.
