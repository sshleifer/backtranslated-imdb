MY is not bad. I was expecting another movie based on women's issues, but was pleasantly surprised by the element of expectation. Of course, parts of the plot were pretty funny, but for the most part the film made me guess. Was the nut bar connected to the ex-husband, someone in the tavern, or was it the guy (man) she turned off? Daniel Magder was superb. I saw him in “Mom on strike” and “The fault of the association”, as in “My business”, and he deserves praise, especially for the fact that he challenges his mother as a minor usually does. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton also played the typical mother (ex-wife), which can include both men and women. She was upset enough to seem real. <br /> <br /> See if you missed it. It's worth it.
