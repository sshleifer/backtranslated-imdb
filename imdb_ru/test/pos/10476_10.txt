This film tells everything that can be said about religion - I would like all fanatics and potential clerics to watch it. <br /> <br /> The history of Danish villages at the turn of the century was about two very religious sisters, whose late father was a tough priest who abandoned all their dreams of love and learning about the world and its beauty. They are now old and their lives and beauty are spent. Their new quiet help — which they “teach” to cook — is Babette (played by the beautiful Stefan Odran, who has decorated so many films of her husband Claude Chabrol). Life in the village is simple, and this is reflected in the stern leadership. <br /> <br /> When Babette wins the lottery, she asks for a chance to make a feast - a real labor of love. The course of the holiday and its main guest show messages of love and spirituality and how there are many ways to love God and life. <br /> <br /> This is an indispensable condition for the devotion with which Babetta prepares the feast for the speech that the General gives at the end. Perhaps the best international film of the 1980s.
