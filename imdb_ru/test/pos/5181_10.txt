I just watched the movie tonight and found it great. He has no special effects that hit you, and he is not cruel and not bloody, not a terrorist and not aliens, but he is great. It's just sweet, sweet, and it led me to a completely different time, much easier when people could walk slowly along the street and look at the ocean. I think it was beautiful, and I, for one, would recommend it. Nick was a great character, and his friendship with Harry was one of the highlights of the film. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I believe that everyone should watch it, mainly when he feels depressed or when he wants to share something pleasant with his friends.
