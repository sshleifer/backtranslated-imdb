I am really impressed. I expected a stupid gamer humor and nothing more. <br /> <br /> Well, there is a ton of ingenious humor. But the film is so well made. The acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Dialogue, although it seems playful from time to time, I think it pleases the crowd of gamers, is not bad at all. Sometimes it is even, I dare say, great. <br /> <br /> When a female gamer who built this unconventional character like a fighter, not the usual (min / max) type, gets all these extra attacks (it seems right), I didn’t check the rules, it was cool . <br /> <br /> Shooting is amazing for what should be a fairly low production film. <br /> <br /> History moves forward. Transitions from the game world to the real world are made well. A man who plays a female character sometimes plays a female and sometimes himself. Pretty clever, I thought. <br /> <br /> The guy who decided to play a woman, but all the time forgot that he was a woman, was good for a lot of laughter. He even said the tag at some point, and the woman went on to play the role (sorry, I did not find her name, although she did an excellent job). The guy who always tried to “get something” got a bit tiring, but I think it was a more amusing gamer. <br /> <br /> There were so many things in the film that I liked. Carefree. Fun! Very well done, and I say that as a movie fan, not a gamer (and I'm not a D & D player.) As I said, I expected a lot less. <br /> <br /> Movies often do not hold my attention, I listen to them while working on a computer. This one caught my attention. I can not give the film much higher praise.
