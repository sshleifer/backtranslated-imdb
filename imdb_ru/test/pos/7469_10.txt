Very densely written, filmed and filmed. Cruel, but not too much. Whoever edited it, he knew exactly what he wanted to portray. There is no wasted scene in this movie. The “ordinary suspects” were an excellent ensemble game; This is a collection of outstanding individual performances. I rarely buy films, but this one is worth buying.
