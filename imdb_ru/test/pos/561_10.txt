Art imitates life, imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated in DA in this tragic and tense exciting documentary film that looks more like who did it and how it happened. Authenticity, and sometimes reluctant honesty of people make this story exciting in many layers. Although racism is one of the topics, there are other elements, such as work ethic, honesty, and overcoming grief, which return me to watching and reviewing this film again and again. The music is moving, but not intrusive; the pace and visual effects are such that it is impossible to err in the fact that these are real people going through authentic experience.
