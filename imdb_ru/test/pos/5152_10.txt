Roy Andersson "Du Levande" is not quite original, as it is the opposite of Andersson's previous film "Sånger från andra våningen". Nevertheless, the film has an aura of complete originality. Some conventions of making a film are still thrown away: most of the actors are not like what you would expect in a film, and filming takes a lot of time. Most of the time the camera does not move, but people move around it. Shooting starts from somewhere and the landscape develops in amazing proportions many times. VG Sebald recalls the same technique in the literature. Because of the time spent on each shot, the suspension is really high in many scenes. There is a story, but it is not - the viewer can create it in his mind. This film is positive. He is determined not to see all this in a negative light and at the same time he will not pass through social injustice. One of the messages I received from this was that, perhaps, all the failures and accidents are not fatal in the end. A great movie.
