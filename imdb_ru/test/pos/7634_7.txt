Italian soft clone of Exorcist X. <br /> <br /> A woman will buy a statue of a crucified thief. Said thief comes to life and turns out to be a devil with raped fantasies. <br /> <br /> Ivan Rassimov brilliantly plays the Devil. Mostly because of his bad looks. And because he was never above nudity. Well done. <br /> <br /> The actress in the lead role did a decent job. Her innocence with wide eyes and the fact that she looked beautifully nude helped. <br /> <br /> This storyline is similar to most Italian horror films. The girl's parents are dirty rich and corrupt. Check it out for details. <br /> <br /> Laura Gemser’s husband, Gabriel Tinty, also looks like a random stallion. His role is mostly telephoned, but, like cheap beer, he coped with his work. <br /> <br /> Director’s inconvenience due to its shortcomings It could be a horror / sex classic.
