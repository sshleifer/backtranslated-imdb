One thing I really can't forget about this film is its beginning: a classic comedy, brilliantly created. I like it. See for yourself (there are no spoilers here! :-). The sparring between DeVito and Crystal also glows in this film, with DeVito as the ideal oppressed son. One of my favorite. Highly recommended for Crystal lovers.
