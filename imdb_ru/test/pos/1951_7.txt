Teenage film about longing, friendship, loyalty and maturity ?? but this is not a happy way out because of the circumstances and life-changing dilemmas surrounding the premise. What is happening is rather numb, intrusive and completely cold. Nevertheless, I expected something more powerful and effective, and, although it was exciting and unforgettable, it didn’t evoke much emotion. The performances are quite mixed, but for all of them this is harsh honesty. Dennis Hopper and especially Daniel Roebuck are amazing ?? Crispin Glover does this eccentrically, and Keanu Reeves, dead as wood, seems to pay off in his usual role as a slacker. Joshua John Millar is pretty good, as is Aion Sky. Jim Metzler comes in with a short but very attractive job. The story is dramatically disgusting, imbued with character and painful in its possible breakdown, where it deals a heavy and painful blow. Jurgen Knieper’s whirling musical accompaniment is filled with anxiety, tension and surprise, as morality and obligations are tested and studied.
