Recovery is a well-designed and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that does not cause sentimentality in the main characters. David Tennant and Sarah Parish bring to the fore the complex and contradictory emotions of a couple in love, struggling to put up with the personality changes that they both endure, and must survive a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> Tennant, like Alan, brings humor and dangerous depravity as an engineer recovering from a memory loss caused by a traffic accident. Alan is portrayed not just as a victim, but as a person with feelings, doing everything possible to make sense of his new life. Trisha Sarah Parish - not an ordinary housewife, standing next to her man, who will do everything to support her husband. She struggles to stop loving Alan, because the person she once knew and loved is now a completely different person - a stranger to her. <br /> <br /> Contrary to opinion, this, in my opinion, makes the perfect Sunday evening viewing. Too often, we are shown soft family dramas or detective series, such as Heartbeat, that rot and decompose the brain. Commissioners of the program seem to believe that the traditional day of rest is also the day when our minds fall asleep. A more complex and thought-provoking drama, such as Restoration, will seriously change the situation.
