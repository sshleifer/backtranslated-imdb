Three pairs of crazy, all SIX KIND, entangled in a mad search for stolen bank loot. <br /> <br /> This is a fun, fun six-star comedy - Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, WC Fields & Alison Skipworth, George Burns and Gracie Allen - all from the bottom of their hearts are trying to do what they do best: laugh. <br /> <br /> Ruggles & Boland are starring again in films as husbands and wives - this time rather lovingly than usual. They were the perfect team - she is a bright lioness, he is a nervous rabbit - and they dominate here most of the time on the screen. From start to finish, they delight. <br /> <br /> Burns and Allen continue the patterns that they created in Vaudeville, improve themselves on the radio and eventually go on television, with George - the permanent man and Gracie - the eternal fool. From time to time in the film she tends to go a little higher, but it is hard not to love her. Her heart was obviously made of pure gold. <br /> <br /> While Skipworth is given a rather short care - only fragments of her formidable personality flash - Fields in his element as an unworthy sheriff of Nuggetville, Nevada. Explaining how he earned the nickname “Honest John,” or walking at night in search of a missing mule, he is never less beautiful. Best of all, he performs all his classic exercises in the pool, saving them forever for grateful offspring. Finally, he performs almost a miracle - he makes Gracie shut up. <br /> <br /> Paramount was so pleased with the success of SIX OF A KIND that they wanted to hurry the main players to another comedy. Only Fields objected. He felt that now he had reached the point where he no longer needed to share the film with other celebrity comics. The studio finally agreed and began preparing the first solo role of Fields “You Tell Me” (1934).
