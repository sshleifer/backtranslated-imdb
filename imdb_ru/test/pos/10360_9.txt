I first saw him at 5 am on January 1, 2009, and a day later I looked at him again and want to look again. I love everything (well, almost 9 stars) about it. No color, beautiful naive stories, funny gangsters, Anna, camera work, music. Well, sometimes you just want to listen a little longer, and the music just stops. But this is not a musical after all. I like the acting skills of Anna, this naive gangster girl, as she says, holds a gun, everything makes me smile. No, this is not so funny, although at some moments I laughed a little, it is just so elusive. Excellent work by Samuel Benchetrit. Although 3d nouvelle seems weaker, they are also gangsters, maybe even worse because they steal ideas. And the last scene is my favorite. I'm so warm and ... romantic. Yes, I would recommend this film to romantic souls who love such feature films. And I do not agree with those who compare it with reading. This is not about action and perverted history, although all the vignettes intersect. This is a calm and perhaps too slow movie for most people. It is about the characters, their feelings, very subtle. In any case, probably this review will not help anyone (my first), just wanted to express my appreciation. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: In this film there is no “Goofs” section. Interestingly, no one noticed this hand in the second part, when the kidnappers decided to go home? Looks like part of the crew, hehe. I know that I’d better post on the forums, but I don’t agree with some politicians here.
