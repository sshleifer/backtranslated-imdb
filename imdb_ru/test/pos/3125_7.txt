This film is about two horse traders who agree to accompany a small group of Mormons across the desert. Along the way, they encounter a murderous family of thugs who threaten peaceful people and put them at risk of pilgrimage. <br /> <br /> “Master Car” is what I would call John Ford’s “little” film, as he obviously doesn’t have the budget or scope of some of his other westerns. In particular, there are no celebrities in this film, such as John Wayne, but it allows some ordinary characters to play a major role. Longtime actors in Ford films Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr. and Ward Bond were assigned to the main roles, and perhaps the one who became the “lead” probably had Johnson, although the other two had an almost identical screen. time and attention. This is not bad, since the film worked without a big star, and it is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Can't say that I liked the movie. It was very good, but certainly not perfect. In particular, as far as music is concerned, you probably either love it or hate it. At times, the music “Sons of the Pioneers” seemed a little strange to me. It caused a good mood, but sometimes it seemed to dominate the scenes. I think I would work a little better. In addition, with their continuous singing in the background, I continued to expect Roy Rogers to jump out at any moment. Another small problem is that the plot was surprisingly simple, and the ending was largely predetermined. <br /> <br /> However, and I am glad to say that there is “however,” despite the fact that it is rather formal and sentimental. The film still worked well. This was due primarily to the good, as usual, leadership of John Ford, as well as to the exceptional characteristics of Ben Johnson. He was able to provide excellent support for the film. Another plus for me is that I saw it the same week as BRIGHAM YOUNG, another film about Mormon migration. While BRIGHAM YOUNG was a bit stupid and overly “holy” in its images, here the Mormons were less “ideal” and looked more like real people with disabilities and personalities. Oh, and speaking of BRIGHAM YOUNG, it seems that Jane Darwell was a girl from the "morgue" in the films on Mormon themes in this era, as she was the main character in both films. Considering that she died in BRIGHAM YOUNG, and that was 20 years before WAGON MASTER, this is a trick! <br /> <br /> In addition, if you want to take a look at the famous Jim Thorpe, he is in a tiny role where he plays passionless Indian dance next to Jane Darwell by the fire.
