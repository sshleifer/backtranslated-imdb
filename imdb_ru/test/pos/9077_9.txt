* Flat Spoilers * <br /> <br /> Five medical students, Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), David Labrachio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) and Randy Glass (Oliver Platt) decide to try an experiment; dies exactly 5 minutes (this is the maximum amount of time during which someone can do this before risking damage to the brain). <br /> <br /> Virtually everyone is doing this experiment, Randy is the only exception, but they are beginning to experience unwanted visitors; David sees a little black girl shouting rude insults at him, Joe sees all the women with whom he had sex (and which he recorded on video) asking him why Rachel experiences suicide from his father on the TV screen, and Nelson faces a little boy with murderous intentions. <br /> <br /> Why are they here? And how will they get rid of them? This intense and interesting film, shot in a hallucinatory city and part of the Gothic high school, is a real experience, both for the story and for the characters played by novice stars such as Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon and William Baldwin. <br /> <br /> Directed by Joel Schumacher, who had already worked with Sutherland in Lost Boys, and this second collaboration is even better than the first. <br /> <br /> A compulsory for horror psychology thrillers and metaphor lovers (this story is about forgiveness and correcting past mistakes), this is one of the minor classic things of the 80s that earn respect even today as mentioning Rebecca Gayheart in “The Scream” 2 'or the episode of Tru Calling, which used the premise of the film. <br /> <br /> Flatliners: 9/10.
