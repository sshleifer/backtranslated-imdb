Sometimes you wake up late at night, looking through the stations, you're bored, and you want a light and fluffy romantic comedy that doesn't make you feel bipolar. And this film is right for this. Undoubtedly, the plot was ripped right in the 1930s ... a script as crappy as the legendary poetry of the Hallmark Greeting Card, and one-dimensional characters played by actors plucked straight from Central Casting - but it was CUTE, and I needed last night. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly and Kostas Mandilor have excellent chemistry - I liked it in “Picket Fences”, and I am pleased to report that they still have them in 10 years. Kostas Mandilor, 41, is still perhaps one of the most handsome men who has been decorating screens since Rudy Valentino started 80 years ago. RRROWRR! Bonus points for the participation of this funny man, who once was on the rollers in this show about the cartoon lady. I always thought he was something straight from the Hepburn-Grant comedy. Bravo! <br /> <br /> Some people will probably say that it was the worst film ever made, and I probably should have agreed - but come on! This is on the Hallmark channel. What did you expect? Just sit back, relax, eat some sesame sticks and watch a sweet little movie with two lovely people and drink a bottle of Zinfandel. Believe me, you will love and take Schmalz much more, and then you can fall asleep, dreaming about Kostas Mandilor floating in a sea of ​​hardened chocolate, feeding you with fours with mint fresh chocolate icing. Yummo! (PS. Now I have a passion for the small fours. THANKS A LOT, HOLMARK!) <br /> <br /> I really want an evil girl to be thrown with Rachel Ray, and maybe this dirty nerd Alton Brown in announcer instead of a creepy dude with a beard Van Duc. Shudder! <br /> <br /> That would make my night. But hey, check out "Just Desserts."
