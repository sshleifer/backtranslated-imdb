I saw this film many years ago (along with another one from Shepitko’s films, Wings) as part of a Soviet TV series in a local film archive. But none of Shepitko’s films, as far as I can tell, have been on video or DVD in the United States. Ascent is a great movie by any standard, with stunning black and white photography, hypnotic direction and actors so deeply involved in their roles that you can’t even imagine that they just give an idea. Although the details of the period of resistance to Russia (and cooperation with) the German occupation are very revealing, history is not subject to time. Two Russian partisans captured by the Germans, and the interrogation checks their honesty and courage. I suspect that the reason why he was not released on DVD by the Russians (the spoiler goes here) is that the Jewish intellectual (and not the hard Russian peasant) is a partisan who resists threats and temptations, serenely goes to his death, and shows a heroic example for the villagers.
