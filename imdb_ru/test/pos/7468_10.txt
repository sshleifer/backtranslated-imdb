This film is outstanding! On this date April 8, 2007, it was on demand from the time of the show. Much time has passed since I saw it, but in the first role in which I saw him, Thomas Jane is present. First you see a normal guy who looks like a henpecked, with his wife, who seems to be on his way. The director's production, which I just watched, has an opening scene that is cool. Paulina Porizkova is dressed like a cheerleader, looks very fresh and hot. Trying to buy coffee late in the evening without small bills, quickly turns into violence, Polina shows that her name on her brand jacket is a real bargain. At first it was great to meet my old friend Nick, who was played by Aaron Eckhart, and he even lent him his car to go into business. Then he notices the nickname in the silver briefcase, and the day changes to strange and brutal. There is a collection of real characters that pass through the next series of scenes. But Pollasa Dallas steals the show, I think. She tells Casey's story to a doctor who must undergo a personal interview in an adoption statement, outrageous. As a rule, I never thought that tall women are so sexy, but, as in any rule, there are exceptions. Polina is like no one has ever seen her in a movie. Sexually and deadly, as in the same film with Tom Sellek, but with a malevolence that has never been seen before. If you are looking for a movie to add to your collection, this one is worth its price. Polina in the nude is worth one price, but this story has everything you can hope for. Love, friendship, sex and violence in a terrific mix. When I first saw him many years ago, he blew my mind, and I know that you will feel the same.
