David Lynch shot his first Erasurehead film in several years, adding new scenes every time he managed to raise a little more money. Kevin Smith did “clerks” at work, working as a clerk, and Robert Rodriguez boasted that “From Dusk Till Dawn” costs exactly $ 30,000. But $ 30,000 is still a hell of a lot of money that can be collected if you work as a cleaner at a cemetery. And what if the novice director not only had such a job, but also had all the ambitions of such luminaries and Smith’s all the folly, but absolutely none of the talents. Such a figure is Marc Borchardt, the subject of this funny documentary, which tells about his attempt to make a couple of films over the years. Borchardt combines his crazy dreams with flights of depression and a fatal inability to call it a day; one feels that he almost prefers the endless efforts of the search for impossible perfection to an agreement with reality, which he simply (according to the testimony presented in American Cinema) is not very good. And as Ed Wood is like a modern day, he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of losers, his sincere affection for him is his greatest redemptive trait. The collection includes his warring parents, his best friends (one criminal, another reformed addict), his own unhappy children and, best of all, his old uncle Bill. Bill may live in a trailer park, and he has almost given up on life, but he is the owner of a small fortune (more precisely, $ 280,000), and the touching, but potentially exploitative relations between the two men lie at the heart of the film. Borchardt manages to enlist the support of several actors (along with himself, of course), but basically he is completely dependent on friends and family to complete his work (even Bill is filming). On British television, the BBC brilliantly planned to show "American Cinema" in conjunction with "Lost in La Mancha," the story of Terry Gilliam's unsuccessful attempt to shoot the film "Don Quixote." In this film, one person was impressed by the huge professionalism demonstrated (inadequate to the task) and how damn difficult it is for even the millions of experts to spend on making the film; while Borschadt is not only penniless, but also such a clown that he cannot even correctly pronounce the name of his work (“Coven”). Ultimately, Borschad is human enough for you to want him to succeed, but terrible enough that the viewer can laugh at his failures. If this film were fantastic, you would have rejected it as unbelievable; but in reality it’s one of the funniest documentaries you’ll probably see.
