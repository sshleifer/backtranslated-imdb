If you really read this review, I am very grateful to you. You care enough to watch this movie, which most people have forgotten, and then they wanted to read after the first review! So for your pleasure ... <br /> <br /> I assume that you already know the storyline, so I will not waste time on its conclusion. I will mention that Sandra Bullock did an amazing job with this movie. She really sympathized with the role of the programmer, which was often difficult to do. I can say this because I am a programmer. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought the main story was very good. You can easily build ancillary scenes on his mainframe and turn it into a very nice movie. The premise is also very realistic in the sense that all of this can really happen if the correct precautions are not taken. <br /> <br /> To make a long review short ... oops! Late! If you like when Sandra Bullock makes his role come true, and you want to watch a very well-made film, look at this little gem. You will not be disappointed. :-)
