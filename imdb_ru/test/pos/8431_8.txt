It was frighteningly close, but the “Syndrome of China” got the worst publicity when the accident at the Three Mile Island NPP occurred on the eve of the theatrical release. I still remember how the attention of the whole country was riveted on the hourly bulletins coming out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. And don't you know, a scientist from China Syndrome describes the worst-case scenario in which the territory of the state of Pennsylvania becomes uninhabited. <br /> <br /> In less than a decade in the Ukraine at Chernobyl, the Soviet Union in recent days faced a crisis that did not recover at the very last moment. China syndrome has become a topical film again. <br /> <br /> The film talks more about security than about being anti-nuclear. Jack Lemmon - a man who lived all his life with nuclear energy as the captain of a nuclear submarine. What makes him angry and makes him create a confrontation that culminated in the film is the stupidity and greed of the leaders of energy companies. Stupidity and greed are products that can be found every day. The problem with them is that in human society there are places where it is less tolerable. <br /> <br /> Lemmon shares the stars with a pair of famous Hollywood kids Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. Jane is a television news reporter who is constantly assigned to publish stories, and she happens to be at a nuclear power plant in the event of an accident. Hiding her own station and her later meeting with Lemmon led to a chain of events depicted in Syndrome of China. <br /> <br /> Best Scene Funds, I think, however, was with Peter Donat, the news head of her station. Look at her expression when Donat reflects on the importance of this story and patronizingly tells her that her very beauty requires so she stuck to lush figures. Fonda knows that she has something, and sticks to it. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays his iconoclast cameraman, this was for him a typical part of that time. In his tribute to TCM to his father, Kirk Douglas, Michael said that he chose roles that show sensitivity. However, I might see young Kirk Douglas in this part. <br /> <br /> What to do with energy for industrial and post-industrial countries is an unpleasant problem that will puzzle our government for a couple of generations ahead. This film shows what can happen with dependence on nuclear energy. Our current geopolitical problems in the world partly stem from dependence on fossil fuels, especially oil. Everything we use leads to unintended consequences. <br /> <br /> The real hero of the film, in my opinion, is Wilford Brimley, Lemmon's colleague at the nuclear power plant. In the end, Brimley really comes up to the plate. <br /> <br /> Take a look at China Syndrome to see what I'm talking about.
