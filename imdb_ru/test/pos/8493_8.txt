Let's remove the flaw from the very beginning - the film should have been much longer. Ray Charles was a brilliant, charming man who led a difficult, complex life. There was simply no way to fit all this - or even touch everything - in a film of standard length. Given this, the creators of this film did a wonderful (and, I am sure, very painful) work on creating a film that could not tell the whole story, but managed to portray a representative sample of a person and his music. Ray Charles’s strengths were evident throughout the film, and his weaknesses were neither strengthened nor covered in sugar. We could wish for another hour telling about his life after 1980, but I believe that this could turn the film into a tribute and, although it would also allow some things that were left at the end to be resolved, I think It was better as presented. <br /> <br /> Now for the big question: what are the criteria for an Oscar? My wife and I watched an innumerable number of films in our years, but we immediately agreed that we had never seen a play like that of Jamie Foxx. The border between the actor and the character was not blurred - rather, it completely disappeared. We heard a lot about the hype before watching the movie, but it was weird. Fox was Ray Charles. You did not watch the movie with the feeling that you were watching Fox do an outstanding job of depicting Ray Charles - you looked like he somehow believed or understood that you were watching Ray Charles himself. I do not know how else to express it. We were completely blown up. I admit that we haven't seen all the other Oscar shows this year, but it really doesn't matter. Foxx has raised this level to a completely different level, which we have never seen before, and we doubt that we will ever see it again. I can’t recall any other film in which I have ever seen a film in which the person who plays the role so fully and convincingly became the person depicted. We welcome you, Mr. Fox. We understand that the Oscar award is not only connected with the performance, but regardless of whether you win or not, we want you to know that you did something that is in the class itself, and you should be proud of your unprecedented achievement. <br /> <br /> PS The music was naturally gorgeous. I noticed to my wife that if there was a moment in the history of music that I would like to witness, this would be the origin (in Kansas City, wouldn’t it)? What did I say? The film did a wonderful job with it - just wanted to be there!
