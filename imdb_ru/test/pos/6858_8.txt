This is a great German slasher, he is often quite intense and creative, with a funny story and solid performances. All the characters are cool, and Benno Furman is great as a psycho-killer, plus Frank Potente gives a fantastic performance as the main character. It took a little time to get started, but it was never boring, and there were some good death scenes, plus the music is wonderfully creepy. I was lucky to get a version with subtitles instead of dubbed, and I thought that all the characters are pretty cute, plus it is very well done and written. He also has some really nice plot twists, and the effects are very well done, plus the finale is great. The finale is especially tense, and in my opinion, Frank Potente was the ideal choice for casting, and I would like Arndt Schwering-Sonri (David) not to be killed so soon, because he was a really cool character. There were several moments when I felt uncomfortable, but in a good sense of the word, and I must say that this film deserves all the praises, plus, although there are holes in the plot in it, this is not enough to prevent the film. This is a great German slasher, he is often quite tense and creative, with a fun story and solid performances, I highly recommend this one! The direction is excellent! Stefan Ruzowicki well done! Work here with great camera work, very good angles, great close-ups (see the introductory sex scene), do an excellent job of adding a creepy atmosphere and just keep the movie at a very fast pace. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of blood and blood here. We are cut into corpses, a lot of bloody surgical scenes, a lot of bloody stab wounds, people are dissected while they are conscious, a severed finger, self-justification, gutting, a bloody chopped throat, a lot of evil-looking frozen corpses, a lot of blood and more. <br /> <br /> The acting is very solid! Franca Potente had a fantastic main role, she was very pretty, remained calm under pressure, was vulnerable, light on the eyes, and we can take care of her character, the only time when she seemed to suffer was when she had to break out here and there some bad dialogue, but it was not very often, it was beautiful! Benno Furman is excellent as a psycho-killer, he is just frightening, and, fortunately, OTT, he really made me jump and was one of the effective killers! Anna Loos played her role very well, like a smart whore, I dug her up. Sebastian Blomberg was great here as Caspar, he was very cute, and he had a mysterious character, his chemistry with Potent was also included, and at the end there were big turns involving him. Holger Spekhan was good as an idiot Phil and did a good job. Traugott Bure is good as Professor Grombek. Arndt Schwering-Sonri was great, like David, he had a really cool character, and I would like him not to be killed so quickly. With the rest of the actors everything is in order. <br /> <br /> In general, I highly recommend this great German slasher! *** 1/2 of 5
