At first I didn’t like the director to constantly switch from the past (Gulliver’s travels) to the present (Gulliver in a mad haven). But this is really the best way to make history, although you need to get used to it. Danson is an outstanding hero, and Edward Fox is a great villain. The worst part is Mary Steenbergen as Gulliver's wife. She has never been a Hollywood beauty, and in this film for some reason they make her look completely scruffy. I will never understand why directors make a woman ugly when it adds nothing to the story! Besides, you want to strangle her for being so damn stupid for believing in a lie that Bates continues to tell her. Even her son can see that bastard. Still a good show, and I rate it B +.
