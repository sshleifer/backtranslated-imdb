It was a great movie! I saw it at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic, and there he received an award. This is the first film I've ever seen from Jan (director), and I was impressed. This is a great story about love and family. The film has a great balance of comedy, romance, drama and tension. I will not distribute the plot, but this is a well-made film, and I would watch it again if I had such an opportunity! The cinematography / editing is great, the movie just flows, and the characters are warm, and they are of the type to which you can relate. I hope you can enjoy this movie just like me. If anyone knows where I can find it in the United States, or if they plan to release it on DVD soon, please let me know !!
