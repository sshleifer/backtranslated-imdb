I knew little about this movie when I entered the theater for the preview. From the advertisement, I learned that it was a thriller. <br /> <br /> What we have is similar to Coercion and Matlock. Two teenagers decide to commit the murder. The victim is chosen randomly and then carefully executed so that no traces of actual killers are detected. Then put a bunch of false leashes pointing to an innocent bystander. (In any case, innocent of the murder) <br /> <br /> Introduce Sondra Bullock as an investigator. (IMDB says she is the FBI, but I don’t remember. I thought she was an ordinary cop.) She’s disappointed with the killer’s inconsistency profile (“Profile doesn’t match profile!”) And the power and influence of the father of one of the boys. <br /> <br /> She also has her own demons, which play an important role in her decision to become a cop. But this is the only character that is really more than one-dimensional. All the others are pretty flat. <br /> <br /> For thriller there really isn’t a big thrill. Basically, this is a cat-and-mouse game, similar to the episode "Matlock" (which she watches in one place of the film). The bottom line is that two are involved in the murder. Who is the real killer, Justin or Richard? It will cost you eight bucks to find out.
