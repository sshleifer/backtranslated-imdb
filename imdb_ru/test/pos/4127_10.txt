This is one of those films where I just want to move my legs and dance around the house. This is a very positive and happy type of music. There are some sad moments in the film, but mostly the music makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job like Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly went even to his pastor, his parents and producer from Nashville said no to him. Buddy Holly did not give up what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I watched this movie. I was in Surf Ballroom, where he played the last time, but didnâ€™t pay much attention to it until I watched this movie. This is an incredible movie with lots of fun, so stand up and watch this movie.
