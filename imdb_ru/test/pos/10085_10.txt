This is one of the best films I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> There are so many details in it, and every time you see it, you find new things ... Like when father in the shower, but only one voice is heard, and when the girls are fluttering, they cannot do it at the same time, because then there will be two girls, but there are none. <br /> <br /> I’m having trouble finding out that in the middle of the movie their “uncle” is visiting them, but why is his wife frantic ?! The rest is a fantastic movie. !!! Best Asian movie. <br /> <br /> I hope people enjoy it. There were a lot of films where the main character is a skit-tak (Machinist, Secret Window and so on), but this film is much better than them !!!
