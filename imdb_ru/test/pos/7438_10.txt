I play Final Fantasy 7, and this film is EXCELLENT as the game, all Final Fantasy fans will love this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, the story is good, but the best of this film is the amazing visual effects. Characters are equal to the game, and these details are good for fans. <br /> <br /> You do not need to play the game to love this movie, all people can enjoy this movie because the story is a little different and easy to understand. I buy a DVD because it is GREAT, 100% RECOMMENDED, if you donâ€™t see this movie, what are you waiting for? believe me you will fascinate like me
