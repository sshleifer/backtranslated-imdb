I do not know if I will go so far as to say that this film belongs to a heap of Australian rubbish, but it is fair to say that there are no Oscar nominees here. What should be borne in mind is that most of the actors in this film were not really actors as such, but simply children who had nothing to do at that time. There were many others who were offered roles in the film, but abandoned them in order to surf up the coast; All things considered, it really was a good film for its time. In some respects, this is really not much different from today, when peer pressure is still alive and frantic, simply without mobile phones, computers and other similar devices, without which children lived, unlike this generation. In any case, I must evaluate this film as an old favorite, which I watch once in the blue moon and never take it too seriously ...
