It's been almost 25 years since I watched this movie. I would consider this film a classic of all time in a dramatic category. Anthony Quinn gives one of the most remarkable speeches in history. In a matter of minutes, he leads you from laughing to tears. This film is a great picture of how humankind has changed since the Second World War. As a great part of that generation and the future, lost its innocence. It took me a long time to find this movie called “the 25th hour”. This type of film does not make money, but for some it is certainly a treasure. I am very surprised why this film is not used for the media in a broader sense so that more people can enjoy this picture.
