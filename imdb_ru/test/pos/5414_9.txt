This film is full of little surprises, many of them are funny. The fact that it is written and directed by a 24-year-old amazes me. In some scenes where schoolchildren use Ecstasy, I was very embarrassed because I have a child of this age, and I could imagine her using this. As a parent of a teenager, I found that the descriptions of the interactions between parents and children are completely accurate. <br /> <br /> I liked many of the little jokes of the film, and I enjoyed the fact that not everything makes sense and not all issues were resolved by the end. To paraphrase Mark Twain, the truth is stranger than fiction, because fiction is bound to adhere to what is possible, but the truth is not. <br /> <br /> This is a film that plays with the viewer, which allows us to believe that people are what others think about, only so that later we understand that people who we thought were right, completely unaware of the real situation. One of the filmâ€™s strongest scenes, a scene about which we feel a lot of relief and sympathy for what the character is doing, turns out to be based on a completely wrong assumption, and the character, while delightful, is completely wrong. I think it is very subtle. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> I really liked the score - I thought that it really helped the film, really helped create the mood - there are a couple of dizzying moments in the film, and the background music helps to establish that. <br /> <br /> Speech about parting - screaming and a half - it turned out a big laugh! The film is really in my head right now - I saw it this morning. I will try to see it again, time permitting. Dozens of hard to find, but a whole nine in my book.
