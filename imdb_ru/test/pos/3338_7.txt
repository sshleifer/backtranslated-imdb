George Sanders, who plays Saint in the penultimate time, does a good job from a good script - with the usual good RKO. It is also a non-charter story, full of murders and good pure entertainment. <br /> <br /> Topic 1: In New York, Police Inspector Farnac, a friend of the Templar, is accused of a corruption scandal and dishonored - ST comes from London to try to rectify the situation. So far, everything is beautiful and simple - but is there really more than $ 90,000 in the world? Topic 2: Another story that a woman takes revenge on people who killed her brother, Wendy Barry succeeds in slaying some dirty men and making the saint fall in love with her. Including the villain who was under their immediate protection and in Fernac's basement - his creepy shot (dead and gaze) and them in the car when they take him to where he was taken. Paul Gilfoyle, like Purley Gates, was supposed to be a homosexual in this - witness the robe at the beginning and the subsequent seductive commentary of ST that he thought about keeping him as a pet - and did the same for Palm Springs "! Johnny Hale played Fernac as usual, but this time with such a broken, bloated attitude that he really needed to strike the Templar in order to revive him. <br /> <br /> The “hay office” also made sure that you get it right, all the threads are connected without any problems. It is worth looking at all of us who love such things, but if the version of Val Kilmer is your criterion, do not worry.
