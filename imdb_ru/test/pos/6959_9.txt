I first saw this film on a hospital day about ten years ago. Compared to the lifelong films I usually watched, it has become an instant, albeit little-known favorite. <br /> <br /> Since then, I have seen him, maybe twice. I think some parts are a little bit stupid, maybe more action could be used in the plot. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it reflects the fantasies and realities of children with uniqueness and warmth. Magical realism is on par with Amelia, and the heart - with miracles. Despite a certain development of my tastes, I still find the subtle magic of this film, the attractive characters and its simplicity fascinating.
