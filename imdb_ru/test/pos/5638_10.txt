This documentary is the most hypnotizing film I've ever seen. It must have been all day. The selected material included in the play flows surprisingly well and develops three characters that cannot be forgotten. The various layers of these people lean back to make a strangely touching film about perseverance, loyalty and determination. These characters turned out to be amazingly exciting, and the film is unforgettable.
