My cousins ​​and I have watched this movie since we were little. I don’t know exactly what kind of film it is, but we stopped at this charming film, and it became a special part of the memories of our family. <br /> <br /> I fully and absolutely recommend this film to anyone who loves good, useful family films, because this is exactly what it is. Things that four children end up in are absolutely fun to watch. This is an old film, but don't let it fool you. This is one of the best films showing such a strong brotherly bond with each other.
