Nostalgia is not always the best reason to watch a movie. Most often, films that you loved as a child disappoint you as an adult. Although there are exceptions to this rule, it is difficult to justify owning a Krull DVD, no matter how astute the director's comment can be. But be careful, Gen X / Y'ers, because the dozens of disappointments that dominate your journey through the memory lane can prevent you from stumble upon one worthwhile review. <br /> <br /> One unexpected film worthy of another look is Joel Schumacher's Flatliners Supernatural thriller with 80s popcorn heavyweights Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Julia Roberts and Billie Baldwin. You might think that the stew consisting of this cast, the bright flair of Schumacher and the incredibly sharp eyes of the cinematographer Jan de Bont will lead to something disgustingly heavy, but besides the calories ... Flat liners are not so bad. Even though its production design is inexplicably exorbitant, and the photo is too stylized (replete with neon soaked streets, spewing endless streams of steam), Flatliners still manages to become a truly dark and compelling thriller. If there is an explanation of why the Flatliners were forgotten, then this may be because in 1990 another much more supernatural thriller was released - "Jacob's Ladder". <br /> <br /> If “Flatliners” were released a year or two after “Jacob’s Ladder”, it’s probably Schumacher’s luxury thriller would have been rejected as the sinking commercial robbery of Adrian Line’s nightmarish masterpiece. But with these films released the same year, the Flatliners suffered a different fate, tripling the JL double at the box office, despite the fact that they were a diluted version of this kind of room. Over time, he was not so kind to the Flatliners, he was lost on an outdated heap of trivialities from the 80s Brat Pack, while JL reinforced its reputation as timeless classics. Fate aside, JL smoothly terrifies, and he manages to get viewers to guess right up to the last frame, while the Flatliners fall victim to oversimplification and Hollywood comforts that drag out the final act into a predictably neat denouement. The comparison between these two films is unfair, and ultimately overlooks the Flatliners ability to present the 80s at its best. Released at the end of the decade of a slight excess, Flatliners will always be dated for their hairstyles and clothing styles, but, frankly, it should also be remembered as a well-executed film in (or at least close) to the top of its particular pile of garbage. For intents and purposes, this is an entertaining walk through a memory lane.
