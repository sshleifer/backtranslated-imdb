As an adult, I'm glad I accidentally got into this movie when I was a teenager. I had family problems at the time. This particular film was able to capture what I saw from the closed world. How much peer pressure is too much? I really had to buy this film because it reached me at the level, unlike most films that try to reach the audience. How far can a person go for social acceptance? Who is the "bad" crowd? Teenagers are struggling to find answers to these questions, but ultimately ... who is the "pack leader" if there should be one? Is it strong? Nice? Maybe the person we all just like? Could this be a moral character? As for the film, the cast worked together, as if it were predetermined. I only hope that more and more directors and producers will try to create a piece that will reach us all, as this film has reached me. I would like to vote above ten, because this particular title deserves much more.
