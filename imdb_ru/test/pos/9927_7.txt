No matter how painful it is for me to say this, the film is not as good as it could be. Perhaps I was confused by countless exaggerated reviews on IMDb, but I expected much more ... <br /> <Of course, the idea is good, the scenes of violence and camera work are outstanding, the imagination of the genius Dario is breathtaking, but the film is “tainted” with a couple of mistakes which I find unpardonable. First of all, I am one of the few people who believe that heavy metal music, played in the most intense scenes, just breaks the atmosphere ??? With different music (Goblin ????) during the “needle” scenes, it would be soOOOO intense! ... Instead, the soundtrack destroys any chance of tension ... Secondly, the final scene of the murder and the last few moments of the film are just stupid and boring. I do not want to say "amateurish" because I like the films of Argento. Because of the finale, I felt drained. Talk about the final impression! This is unlikely to happen in most Dario films! Although admittedly, Suspiria also suffers from a hasty finale (even if most of it is brilliant) .... <br /> <br /> In short, watch this movie, try to make the most of its good moments, but be prepared for bad . This is NOT a perfect movie by ANY means.
