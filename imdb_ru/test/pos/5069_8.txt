I am Egyptian. I have a green card. I live in the USA since 1991. I have a very common Arabic name. I am married (non-American, but not Egyptian, non-Arab wife). I have children who were born in the USA. I have a PhD in cell biology from the USA, and I travel to conferences. I earn 6 digits and I have a home in Washington DC. I pay my taxes, and for 1 or 2 parking tickets I have not had any flaws since I came to this country in 1991. I look more like an Egyptian than Ibrahimiâ€™s character, but my spoken English is as good as his. <br /> A couple of months ago, I was returning from a company conference / business in Spain through Munich, Germany, to Washington DC. At the airport in Munich, I was picked up by a German officer as soon as I got off the Madrid plane. He was waiting for me. He was going to start interrogating me, until I just told him: "I do not have a business in Germany, I just go through." He let me go with extreme disappointment. It was nothing compared to what happened in Washington, Dulles Airport (which was not as bad as what happened with Ibrahimi in the film). The customs officer asked me a couple of questions about the duration and purpose of my trip. Then he wrote the letter C in my special declaration and let me go. After I picked up my checked bag, I was stopped at the last exit point (Some National Security crap). I sat there for 3 hours with different people of different nationalities. I was not told the reason for my detention. I was not allowed to use my phone or any other phone. At first, I was angry and asked to tell about the reason or let me go, but I decided to come to terms with this and just wait and see. I asked if I could call my wife to tell her that I was going to be late, but they said no. When I tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said hello, the officer snatched the phone out of control and threatened to confiscate me. When I asked about the need to call home because my family was waiting, they replied: "Three hours is nothing, we will contact in 5 hours." When I asked to use the bathroom, an officer accompanied me. The toilet was funny; I guess it was a prison-style toilet, completely metal, without a seat. Finally, they called my name and gave me my passport / green card and said you could go. I asked what the problem was, they said "nothing" !! I know that it was only 3 hours, but I was very tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and children. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it was very well done. Unlike most films in which Arabs participate and who use non-Arab actors who simply speak gibberish, this film in Arabic was 100% correct. I assume that the country is Morocco (North Africa).
