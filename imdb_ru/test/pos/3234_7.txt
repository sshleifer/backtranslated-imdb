I think this version of the film NORTHANGER ABBEY is really good. This is of course fun. Well, this is not a masterpiece, like PRIDE & PREJUDICE ('95), but there are some very good things in it ... especially around the city of Bath !!! ... Royal Crescent, Roman baths, fascinating Georgian atmosphere. It is excellent. If you're a fan of Bata, like me, you'll love watching this movie! The performances may seem too "melodramatic", but I got the impression that this film, like the novel itself, purposely ridicules popular tales about the novel and terror, as well as about the society of that time. The only drawback is probably the lead woman, since I personally have another idea about the appearance of Catherine Morland. The music is also a bit "unusual" ... but I strangely find it acceptable, although it has nothing to do with the historical period depicted. I wonder what dear old Jane would think ... :)
