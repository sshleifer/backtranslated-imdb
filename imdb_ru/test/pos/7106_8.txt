Dracula (John Carradine) visits Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), who believes that everything can be cured by science. He wants Edelamn to cure his vampirism - Edelman agrees. Then Lawrence Talbot (Lon Cheney, Jr.) appears, looking for a cure for his transformation into a werewolf. Frankenstein's monster is also discovered, but does nothing. <br /> <br /> A very ambitious plot for the universal horror movie of the 1940s. Trying to cure monsters with science is actually an interesting idea. In addition, this film has beautiful scenery (LOVE for the castle, in which the doctor lives), tons of atmosphere, a very clear focus (excellent use of shadows) and pretty good special effects. <br /> <br /> The game is all good, except for Carradine - he tries, but I can never mistake him for Dracula. Lionel Atteville also appears in the role (as always) of the police chief. This is largely forgotten and ridiculed as a silly film, but I think it is very good. Also the last time universal monsters were made seriously - the next film was in 1948 in "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein". This is a great movie, but the focus is more on comedy. <br /> <br /> The only real flaw is that the plot is 67 minutes LOTS and some gaps in logic: why is Dracula trying to bite beautiful Miliza (Martha? O'Driscoll) when he is cured? And why (and how) does the doctor deliver Frankenstein to his castle? However, these are minor complaints. Featured.
