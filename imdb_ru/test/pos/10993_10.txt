In the wastelands that Hollywood Productions have recently turned into, this film - in itself - is truly "MANNA FROM HEAVEN" !!! <br /> <br /> In what can best be called a “cute” film, about 350 years of experience in the cinema (it's all right - give or take 100 years!) happily lights up the screen to tell the story of deception, repentance and the atonement of a catholic family in Buffalo, NY. <br /> <br /> This silent, independent film, created by FIVE SISTS PRODUCTIONS COMPANY of Burton Sisters, truly well-located in the “feel good” genre, will leave a smile on your face and a joy in your heart, renewing your faith. in humanity. <br /> <br /> The film manages to tell a fairy tale that could be told about any family, anywhere, from the impressive first scenes filmed in Buffalo, New York, to the final credits. However, somehow this particular meeting of the family and the “family by association” in a small, indescribable house in Buffalo more than meets all the requirements. If you have never been to Buffalo, you will leave the theater with thoughts of “leaving” for a visit! Snapshots of city sights and surroundings help to bring a fancy, mundane tone to the film - which is quite suitable. The quiet beauty of the “city of the Queen of the Great Lakes” rather complements than diminishes the tale in question. If only more films had taken advantage of the natural beauty of the “second cities” of this country, instead of running somewhere on the sound stage, the end results would have been much more believable. <br /> <br /> Magnificent performances by Shirley Jones, Frank Gorshin, Wendy Malik, Jill Eikenberry and the rest of the ensemble actors once again prove that real talent is experiencing the Hollywood “taste of the week” at any moment! <br /> <br /> WATCH THIS MOVIE! <br /> <br /> You have wandered around the Hollywood desert for too long!
