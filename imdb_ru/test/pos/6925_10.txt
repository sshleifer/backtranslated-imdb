Although the plot of this film is a bit contrived, it is worth looking only at the performances of Michael Kane and Gambon. The latter provides a truly wonderful Dublin accent. Kane fakes it ... that is what the character he plays should do. Interesting and fun, this is an hour and a half of easy viewing.
