I saw this film in the Galway film Fleadh in the year he won the best short film. I have to say that I thought the direction was fantastic and the keynote speeches were very memorable. Both main compositions are definitely names to pay attention to. <br /> <br /> The last shot over the cliff is fascinating, and I, for example, would like to be there if I waited for the end of the world to happen. The kiss was definitely a great reward, made with great enthusiasm !! <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the film was filmed, and I heard that the DOP received an award at the Tribeca Film Festival for its work on this film, and I must say ... well deserved. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who was a teenager in the 1980s. It brought back some beautiful memories and some scary ones.
