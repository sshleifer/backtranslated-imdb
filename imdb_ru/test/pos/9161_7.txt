Well, the film is mainly about the last days of a certain Russian regiment deployed in Afghanistan, before the withdrawal of the main forces in 1985. The film accurately reflects the grim realities of the Russian army, which made it notorious: “hazing” (officers and sergeants physical persecution, beating and humiliation of junior recruits), mixed nature of the war (you can trade with your enemy in one day and kill him the next) , women's life on the front line, documentary stories about attacks on helicopters, as well as soldering and sending coffins at home into the C-130 Hercules class trades Russian cargo planes with a tracer for jamming Stinger missiles, fatigue, boredom, anti-war mood of the emotional side, to put it simply. There are some battle scenes, but they are poorly made, and often illogical, like Major Pandora’s suicidal walk and turning his back to a 10-year-old child armed with AK-47, whose father he had just killed. In addition, the fact that in the middle of a shootout in the mountains a heavy grenade launcher jumps out of nowhere (and any half white person knows that practically no one can shoot a 40-50 liter grenade launcher on the march). But at the same time, films show that war is a dirty business, where killing is sometimes justified, the senseless destruction of entire villages for a small or unjustified reason is the norm, the indiscriminate killing of civilians is ignored as collateral damage that is inevitable during a war ... Some food for thinking about why the Afghan war is lost. Not the best film about the war, but deep enough and smart enough to be worth watching.
