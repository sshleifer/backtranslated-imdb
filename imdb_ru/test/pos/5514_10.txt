It seems that Strangeland has a love / hate relationship with many viewers. I personally liked the film, and everything connected with it. <br /> <br /> In some places, acting can be improved, but filming adds an atmosphere in which acting cannot. In some areas, the dialogue is a bit silly and dramatic, but in fact, what do you expect from the late 90s? In general, Dee did an amazing job of writing what I consider to be one of the most terrible thrillers I've ever seen. He plays on the fears of many age groups - adults, parents and children. Every parent is afraid that their children will be too passionate about chat rooms and will meet with strangers from the Internet. And this * happens * in the real world. And every child and adult is afraid of being kidnapped and tortured against their will; it happens in the real world. That is what makes this film such a sensitive subject for many. <br /> <br /> My only warning is that if you * know * that you are sensitive to such things as violent violence, visible torture and blood, then you * do not want to watch this movie. If you are not sure that this movie will entertain you, read as many reviews as possible, ask the people you have seen, who have watched this movie, and be ready to turn off the movie at any time if you are disturbed.
