You don't have to be a football fan of Notre Dame to enjoy it, because I don’t .... but as a football fan in general, it was fun to watch. It almost makes me a martial Irish devotee. If you can’t be carried away by the emotions in this film, a fan of Gridiron or not, you better check your pulse, because this is an emotional film with some very touching scenes. <br /> <br /> As a sports fan, I enjoyed watching classic shots of early college games. They then had pretty wild plays with lots of side elements. They interspersed these shots with Pat O'Brien as head coach Knut Rockn and some players, such as George Gipp (Ronald Reagan). <br /> <br /> Reagan gets a pretty good score in this film, but his role is really small. O'Brien is the only actor with a big role here. The rest - all playing good characters - include Gale Page as the wife of Rockney "Bonnie"; Donald Crisp, as "Father John Callahan" by Notre Dame; Albert Bassermann, as a chemistry professor at Father Newland, and Reagan, as Hipp, is arguably the most talented and famous player of Notre Dame in history. <br /> <br /> The film combines personal history with football well. No angle is exaggerated. Here are all the characters for whom you can be sick, because there are no villains. In my last opinion, it was interesting to find Johnny Sheffield - son of Tarzan - playing Rockn at the age of seven and see George Reeves, Superman TV, as one of the players. <br /> <br /> For some reason, very few football films have been made in Hollywood, and very few good ones. This is one of them.
