River's Edge, largely based on real events, is a film, largely in the style of David Lynch, about a group of teenagers who know about the murder committed by one of their friends, but no one for a long time does anything with it. With a first-class cast, Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper, we can forgive the average actor for everyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a young boy Tim (Joshua John Miller), throwing a doll from the bridge (murder number 1). Then Tim hears someone screaming when he looks up, he sees Samson (Daniel Roebuck) standing on the bank of the river with his girlfriend’s dead naked body behind him (murder number 2). Samson eventually shows the body to his friends. They are all terrified not only because of the murder, but also because the victim, Jamie (Dani Dits), was their friend. Despite all this, no one goes to the police. You may think that this is unrealistic, but this is what happened in the real story. If you are familiar with the story of Alpha Dog (2006), you will know that the same thing happened there. Because of all this, Lane (Crispin Glover) is working to ensure the safety of Samson, although no one (including Samson) seems to care to prevent his harm. Over time, we learn that Feck (Dennis Hopper), a middle-aged prisoner who distributes drugs to local teenagers, also killed a woman before (murder number 3). From here, everything begins to come closer to Samson and his friends, and in the end everything is revealed, but not in the way you would expect. <br /> <br /> In the film, we learn about three murders, each of which has a different reason, a different reaction and a different influence on those who participate. When Tim throws his younger sister's doll from the bridge, we will never know about his motive. However, we see the reaction of the younger sister. She cries and screams while her mother comforts her. Later, her older brother Matt (Keanu Reeves) helps her put a cross in the yard in memory of his doll. Jamie’s murder terrifies everyone (except Samson, who is indifferent to the whole situation, and when Lane asks why he did this, Samson replies: “She said shit”), but they don’t cry or scream, run and continue their lives trying to forget what happened. In the situation of Feck, he did not kill his girlfriend out of hate. We never know why he killed her, but we see that Fek is not proud of what he did. He even mentions that he is sorry, and that she loves her. From this we see how death can affect us. In the film, it’s easy for us to identify with teens, because they don’t know how they feel, or how they should relate to the death of their friend. In much the same way, we viewers do not know how to feel, because we do not know Jamie. We are obviously saddened by death and understand that Samson should be arrested, but we are not very worried about Jamie as a person. <br /> <br /> There are several similarities between River Edge and Twin Peaks (1990-1991), especially in the overall sensation of the film. I wonder if Mark Frost and David Lynch thought about River's Edge when they were creating their series. In the end, Tim Hunter shot three episodes of Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover’s performance as a hyperactive insane Lane is a worthy Oscar performance. Lane is always in a hurry and always worries about not letting Samson catch him, and he seems to be a very fast character. If you saw Crispin Glover in a movie, you know that he can put a line like no other. It is always a pleasure to see his performance. Another great performance at River's Edge is Dennis Hopper. His image of Feck, a drug dealer, who has one leg and an inflatable sex doll with whom he talks by the name of Ally, reminded me of a more muted and more humorous version of Frank Booth, Hopper's character in David Lynch's Blue Velvet movie (1986 ). <br /> <br /> River's Edge is a great movie, and I believe that it shows us how easy it is to be apathetic when in fact we need to step up and speak out against the evil in the world.
