I try to be diverse in watching my movies. I can get into Pride and Prejudice as easily as I do in Disappearing Acts. “Love Jones” is my all-time favorite, this is the standard by which I rate any modern urban romantic comedy. Taken very well, a picture of Nii and Darius riding a motorcycle along Lakeshore Drive is one of the classic 3-second videos of all time. Of course, no one will ever remember. When it came out, I thought it would be a new paradigm for modern urban filmmaking, good actors, unarmed, and so on. The film industry has disappointed me to some extent, from time to time you will have Drumline, or Roll Bounce, or “Why I got married” by Tyler Perry. Therefore, when I need “my people” to be presented on the screen very professionally and stylishly, I look at Love Jones. There is no better movie ever made for many people and opinions on this. But this is my personal record. My favorite line is from Love Jones "Baby, I just want to come up and talk !!"
