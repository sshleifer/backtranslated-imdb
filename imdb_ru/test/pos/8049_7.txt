It is hard to imagine that “The Battle of the Elderbush Gorge”, directed by the legendary D.V. Griffith was created in 1914. This is a showcase for the new Griffith style. <br /> <br /> The story tells about a group of settlers called Cameron Brothers and their families that have a young homeless child (May Marsh). ) sent from the east to live with her uncles and young wife (Lilian Gish), who had just given birth. A group of Indians are trying to catch pet waffles and are driven off by humans. During the confrontation, the son of the Indian leader (Henry B. Whethall) was killed. The Indian leader is preparing to take revenge and begins an attack on a small community of the Elderbush Gorge. <br /> <br /> It is this attack, which is quite brutal and visual for this or any other time, is the core of the picture. Indians kill the inhabitants of the city, women and children, and drive them out of the city to Cameron's estate. The newborn becomes separated from its mother, and all hell is released. Someone turns for help and returns at the very last moment with Calvary. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes contain some graphic violence. For example, we see a woman who scalps alive, and there is also a sequence in which we see a horse being knocked down. I have never seen an animal being killed so convincingly on the screen. Mr. Griffith became a master of staging large-scale battle scenes, a talent that he will use extensively in his epic drama of the Civil War, The Birth of a Nation, released next year. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that “The Battle for the Bay of Elderbush” takes only 29 minutes, but, nevertheless, this is an exciting and historic film. See if you can see Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey in parts.
