Every guy Liv Tyler meets loses his head over her, of course, without a little support from Liv. Liv is at his best, with Matt Dillon's tops among lovers. An interesting initial premise, telling the story from the point of view of every fool, degenerates into the final in the style of a comedy series (not unlike Blame It On Rio, with which it has more similarities). Nevertheless, it is worth seeing.
