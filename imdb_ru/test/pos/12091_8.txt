“Crossing the bridge: the sound of Istanbul” is one of the best musical documentaries I have seen lately, and this is more than a movie about music. It is also a musical declaration of love about a fairytale city, one of the greatest cities in Europe and the world, one of the most important cities for the history of Europe and Islam, a city that can become a bridge in the future Europe and the Middle East or can mean again already happened in history, the gulf between the two worlds. <br /> <br /> Then there is music. An interesting film approach to music is that it starts with modern music, and we hear a lot of (good) rock and rap in the first third of the film. Then, as a movement back in time, the soundtrack leads us to the origins, to Turkish traditional music, to commercial novels and to exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of Turkish music. In such a complex and conflicting country like Turkey, the film does not avoid certain political aspects, such as the censorship imposed by the military regime in the 1980s, or the relevance of minority songs, especially Kurdish. One of the best musical moments is actually given by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice, singing in the hamam in the form of a cathedral (Turkish bath). <br /> <br /> By the end of watching and listening to this movie. I have never been to Istanbul, but after watching this movie, I’m sure I want to visit this place soon.
