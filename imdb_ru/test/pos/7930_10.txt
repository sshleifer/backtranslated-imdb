Eisenstein was not just one of the greatest Soviet, Russian film directors, but one of the great masters of cinema among Griffith, Murnau, Ford, Hitchcock, Wells and others. One of the greatest things in all his films was the publication, very personal, and an exception in this film. It was his first sound film, and the use of the musical score of the great Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev in the battle sequence is the perfect contrast between music and image. Watching this movie is like taking a lesson or a lesson in a movie, something that many directors cannot afford. I never get tired of watching a REAL CLASSIC like this movie. I hope that in the near future more and more people will recognize the great work of art.
