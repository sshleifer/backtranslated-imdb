I was able to see a preview of this film through a pre-screening program at the University of California, and let me tell you: THIS CINEMA IS INCREDIBLE GOOD !!!! I've seen a lot of movies, but few have made me laugh so sincerely or talk about the movie as much as this one. I had respect for Tenacious D before I watched the movie, and now I'm going crazy about them. I will definitely buy their album when it comes out on the 14th, and watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> If you watched this movie on the fence, GO AND SEE IT !! It costs very expensive movie tickets these days, since you will surely sneak laughter during all this. <br /> <br /> In addition to the comedy, the magnificent and divine music that flows from the KG guitar and the voice of JB inspires fear. The audience is in a stupor that such beautiful harmonies and amazing riffs can be created in combination with such ridiculous (and funny) lyrics. If only for the music itself, this film is worth its price. <br /> <br /> With an amazingly consistent storyline linking almost all aspects of the traditional "D" story and distinctive features, wonderful new songs, a funny comedy, and some pretty amazing cameos, this film is rated there with the best! Go look !!
