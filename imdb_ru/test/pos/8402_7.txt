I'm a big fan of Gone with the Wind, and I read Scarlett before it was a mini-series, and I really liked it. This is a continuation of the race. As if you didn’t expect it with this “Honestly, I don’t care.” Timothy Dalton was great as Rhett, although no one would ever replace Clark Gable. Joanne Wailey-Kilmer, on the other hand, could have let Vivien Lea fight for her money (although I feel almost guilty, even saying that). Her attitude and presence in the film fit the hero to a T-shirt, forcing you to love and hate her at the same time, this is how most relate to the image of Miss Lee. The film moves slowly, mainly because it follows the book very closely and was not released as a feature film. Excellent choice from the manufacturer. I think that this film deserves some recognition for the magnificent storyline, the revival of characters who have not been almost 50 years, and for the fact that they could be proud even of Margaret Mitchell.
