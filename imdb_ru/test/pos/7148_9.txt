This is a wonderful film ... it is funny, gloomy, sharp, thought-provoking, innocently mischievous and generally interesting from all sides. I don’t know that I’ve seen something like this before ... Delight, or maybe one of Todd Solond’s comedy films, or even the recent Teeth, come to mind ... but these are all bitter, dirty little gems. "Franklins", despite the darkness around the edges, manages to have a completely sincere and pure heart. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to John Waters's “Low Dirty Shame”, only this film is different in that it actually has a story and something to say besides Waters youthful message “Sex is not dirty (chuckles, nudges) ". A conservative, repressed family undergoes radical changes as a result of a car accident and suddenly ceases to be so conservative ... in fact, they are finally really happy, perhaps the only people in their city (or maybe the whole world)) who. To say why this is so is to spoil the film; Simply put, everyone should see it, although, of course, only people who are already sold out on the fact that the film will have an optimistic, encouraging philosophy. <br /> <br /> The acting is great - only this side is realistic enough not to let the process get too heavy ... Theresa Willis gives a particularly memorable and bold performance like an anxious mother who appears like a butterfly when she free up Both she and Robertson Dean are commendable for their unwaveringly sincere performances (not to mention the frequent and massive nude and sex scenes); they transform what could be an obscene joke, including “deviant sexual practices,” at a touching, believable and charming moment. As a daughter, Aviva is an outstanding person to look at, perfectly capturing the attitude, anxiety and speech peculiarities of a girl of her age. Vince Pavia, like a Himbo brother with a secret, looks good and functional, although his plot and how everyone reacts to him is more useful than his acting game. Marie Blackwell, as the conflicting best friend of Franklin's mother, is surprisingly cold, confused and even compassionate in a role that could be incredible. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie looks fantastic, all the colors are bright and wide -Open locales ... it looks like it might have been filmed Hi-def ... if so, the line has become very thin, it is very similar on the film. There are a lot of talk, and many of them are philosophical, which are becoming a bit preaching (moreover, I imagine the viewer who does not agree with the film’s policy), but this film says a lot of things to say .. If people were not afraid to listen and think . The arguments that take place are smart and well thought out, and in the first place refuse to demonize either religious or non-religious parties. <br /> <br /> The end is on an ambiguous side, which I found a little bit disappointing ... I think it would work better if the author (like Jay Floyd, since he produced, wrote and sent) would give a more feasible outcome, some kind of solution, but again, probably there is no one when it comes to opposing people with different convictions. Nevertheless, it was a touching, memorable final image that made me suffocate - success. Meanwhile, I am very pleased that Mr. Floyd made this film, and I look forward to sharing it with as many people as possible. Check this.
