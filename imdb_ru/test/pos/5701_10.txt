An amazingly good documentary. My surprise was due to the fact that I was puzzled by the name. I assumed that it was about the influence of the drug culture on film making, but no, this is a much more far-reaching and clever film than could be expected. Demme did a great job of encapsulating the period from the end of the 60s to the end of the 70s. From “Easy Rider” and the collapse of the studio's influence through all these introspective films about “real life”, where brilliant young directors tried to express themselves politically, sexually and artistically, right up to the beginning of the blockbuster and the return of the reign to the money of the men and their studios. As a person who watched “real” films about Britain and the rest of Europe in the sixties, and then about the revolutionary American films of the 70s and regrets that the sequel's continuation became such a common thing of the day, it was the Most Exciting movie. The interview clips are measured (thanks to the DVD, the full interviews are available as extra!), And the movie clips are well reviewed. In addition, as the person who just caught up with “Joe,” I am impressed that this important short film has received a well-deserved recognition here.
