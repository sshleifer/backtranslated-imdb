The mystery of the 1930s comedy about "The Crooked Circle" - a group of hooded crooks who set about preparing to kill someone who vowed to resist them. A nice, but really unremarkable little film, the film works simply because the actors are led by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both of whom will later appear together in a pair of Hildegard Withers films after Edna May Oliver left this series ) and maintained an excellent cast and actresses you know, but may not know their names (hence the lack of names). A crazy noisy movie, a movie does not make much sense with an erroneous personality, secret passages, ghostly music and people, not as they seem. This is the ideal thing for a dark and stormy night or late night viewing, when someone feels nostalgia for a late late show.
