My family and I do not usually watch local films for the simple reason that they are poorly made, they lack depth, and they are simply not worth our time. <br /> <br /> The trailer for the film “Nasaan ka Man” caught my attention, my sister-in-law and daughter, so we took the time to watch it this afternoon. The film exceeded our expectations. The cinematography was very good, the story is beautiful and the acting is amazing. Jericho Rosales was really very good, as was Claudine Barretto. The fact that I despised Dieter Ocampo proves that he was effective in his role. I have never been so touched, touched and touched by a local film before. Imagine a cynic like me wiping my eyes at the end of a movie? Congratulations Star Cinema! Way, Jericho and Claudine !!
