As a Wallace and Gromit fan, I was looking forward to this feature film. Surprisingly, I saw it at the world premiere in Vlissingen (the Netherlands), at the festival “Film by the Sea”. Great feeling to be one of the first to see this very funny and funny movie. We are talking about Wallace and Gromit (who, I suppose, we don’t need to meet) who have their own pest control company in the city, which in a few days holds a giant vegetable contest. Everyone, including the eccentric baroness, hopes that his or her giant carrot or melon will win the Golden carrot. Unfortunately, there are many hungry rabbits in the city. This is where W & G. comes. They have their own cunning tricks to control these cute creatures humanly. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny and colorful story. Anyone who likes the three ongoing W & G short films (which are more than gorgeous!) Will love this feature film. Nick Park really gave a wonderful and original result with a great sense of humor. As in Chicken Run, it really amazes me how it can capture so much history and emotion in just a few frames. "Well done work, man" ;-) Oh yes: the music was fantastic! This really completes the trip. Enjoy!
