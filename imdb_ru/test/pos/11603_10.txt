What are you doing, if you are Aishwarya Rai, starring in a blockbuster like “Devdas”, with some skeptical critics who are still tirelessly unhappy with your amazing game or convinced by their strong presence on the screen and starry acting skills, what do you do? Go home, sit down and sulk? Not. If you are Aishwarya Rai, you subscribe to the next strong play of the period and continue to prove that you deserve all the praise, praise, wonderful scripts and equally great roles. And this is exactly what she did with “Choker Bali - a play of passion,” where she plays the main role and shines like Binodini, a young widow who causes controversy much earlier than her time. Directed Rituparno Goshem {who later continues to direct her in the equally stellar 'Cloak'}, Prasenjit Chatterjee {Devdas in Bengali} costumes.
