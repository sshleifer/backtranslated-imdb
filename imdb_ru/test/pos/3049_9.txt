This film fascinated me this evening. Thank you to Fox Movie Classics for the constant demonstration. John Voight, this actor from obscure black actresses and, above all, children, did this in a worthy way to spend Sunday evening. How wonderful to see the early work of this experienced actor, as well as the beautiful image of Paul Winfield in the movie "Mad Billy." I can not understand why someone would say that Hume Cronin was wrong in the role of manager. Who would they choose? Scary character actor, Charles Lane? Although his career is commendable, an actor like Lane would make the role cheaper. Cronyn was a great choice for the part. I will consider this film a real treasure to be remembered.
