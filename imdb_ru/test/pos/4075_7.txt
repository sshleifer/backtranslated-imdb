I can't understand why so many people dislike this movie. Robert De Niro was at the top of his game, supplying his lines with such aplomb, one must assume that this is his everyday behavior. Of course, the film seemed to take on many agreements on friendly films, trying to ridicule the concept, it goes without saying that this film was really funny. From a police dog to the fact that Eddie Murphy did not annoy me, this film is a real keeper. Ren√© Rousseau also perfectly aligned the rest of the actors, asserting her role so that it does not interfere with the relationship between De Niro and Murphy.
