Halloween 666 (1995) Director Review! <br /> <br /> Halloween 666 begins with a terrible fifth story narration. If you thought the last chapter was dark, this one will really amaze you. The mysterious "Man in Black" raided the Heddonfield police station, freeing Michel Myers. At the same time, poor Jamie Lloyd was abducted by strange cultists. What do they want with her? Who knows, but let's just say that her long suffering will end soon. Dr. Loomis again spends the rest of his twilight years trying to stop Michael Myers from killing more innocents (good luck). A friend of Loomis, Dr. Winn returns after a break in four sequels to help a good doctor. Another old face from the first part of the guest stars. <br /> <br /> This dark and dreary sequel was filmed during post-production editing. For some reason, distributors felt that the end product was not worth the time of the average horror movie viewer. So they decided to drown it out. Then, after the film had been sitting on the shelf for several months, she laid the egg at the box office. No matter what they did with the film, they made it worse. They should have left quite well alone. Hey, the film company knows better than the directors now ... right? <br /> <br /> Production version: Highly recommended <br /> <br /> Released version: Not recommended
