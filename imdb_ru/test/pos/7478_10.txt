I loved this movie! Fantastically original and different! Solid, intense, intense and intense film, in which there is only the right shade (dark?) Humor. If you are tired of the typical, exaggerated, ridiculous Hollywood B.S. movies, how many big explosions and horrible and unrealistic shootings that offend your intellect, can we take, then this film is for you. Fantastic characters that are surprisingly original and believable, and solid actions of all the actors, and not a weak character or performance in the film. Skip Woods film is a breath of fresh air, and I welcome his originality and effort, his film resembles a cross between a Quentin Tarantino film and a Coen Brothers film (in my opinion, this is not a bad mix). This movie captures you by the throat and does not let go; there is nothing boring or chewing gum in this movie. The only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about this, everyone I recommended him, thanked me and shared their opinions on this. This film is a welcome change / alternative to the canned Hollywood junk being made today, even with their famous actors, big explosions, special effects and huge budgets. This is a terribly wild, intense, cruel, graphic, humorous and rough (I mean, in a good way, no fake Hollywood lacquer here) ride. Thanks to everyone who contributed to this movie, you did an incredible job!
