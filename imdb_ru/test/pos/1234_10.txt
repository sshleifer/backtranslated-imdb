Hey Denver fans! The animation is a classic cartoon and one of my favorites (yes, it was also broadcast in Europe. Including my tiny Central European country, Slovenia! = :) Oh, how I miss the 80s cartoon! Honestly, they were much better than today's children's shows. More creative, creative, full of fun with good morality, more content, a great storyline and great voices of characters. Computer animation shows today lack all of these functions. So, all of you who agree and want to return all the performances, so that the children of today's generation can see the entertainment that these cartoons brought to us, please go to the page below and sign the petition to restart the 80s best cartoons! <br /> <br /> http://www.thepetitionsite.com / 1 / we-want-an-80-s-child-cartoon-kids-show-channel <br /> <br /> Denver Carpet! =) <br /> <br /> Leila
