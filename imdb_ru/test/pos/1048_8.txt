This film very much reminds me of the later film Rock Hudson “MEN'S FAVORITE SPORTS” - about a fisher writer who has NEVER fished and is forced to participate in a fishing tournament. In this case, Barbara Stanwick is a writer who looks like Martha Stewart, who does not know how to cook and does not have an ideal family, which she describes in her articles — in fact, she has no family at all. Well, like Rock, she maneuvers in execution — in this case she creates a huge festive dinner, resting in the countryside. Since there is no family, she takes a veteran and several friends home and desperately tries NOT to “let the cat out of her bag” so that she cannot do anything she knows. Cute little comedy and welcome film at the annual film distribution.
