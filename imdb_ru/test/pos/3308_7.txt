An extremely pleasant adaptation of the best-selling book by Rona Jaffe about the trials and tribulations (and, of course, love) of a group of women who are somehow involved in the New York publishing business. Directed by Jean Negulesko, quite fresh from the success of "Three coins in the fountain" and the prototype for "Sex and the City", except for the fact that sex here is off-screen. <br /> Bright young female talents of the day (Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Susie Parker, Martha Heer) are all beautifully played, while Joan Crawford appears as the queen of the Bitch editor, who could probably eat Miranda Priestley Meryl Streep and spit it out; effortlessly she steals the movie. Among them are Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan (if it was not Rossano Brazzi, it must be Louis Jourdan), Robert Evans (before he wisely decided to follow the camera) and Brian Ahern. More foam is shown here than in a regular self-service laundry, but if, like me, you like Desperate Housewives, not to mention Carrie Bradshaw and company, then you will probably like it. Very guilty pleasure.
