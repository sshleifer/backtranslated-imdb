“Two Soldiers,” based on the story by William Falkner, is a first-class short film, a film that has enough plot, emotion and great cinema for a feature film, and which definitely leaves much to be desired at the end. Two dirty poor Mississippi brothers are involved in this story, one child only and the other adult old enough to volunteer to participate in military actions soon after the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor. The younger brother, who is brilliantly played by rookie Jonathan Ferr, does not want to let go of his older brother, and he goes in search to join the army. Ron Perlman speaks rudely, but touchingly, like a colonel in the army who decided to help a child. <br /> <br /> Since this stone is only 39 minutes long, it will be difficult to find (most likely it will be limited on the festival scheme for now), but remember the name of Aaron Schneider - this picture marks him as a director for viewing.
