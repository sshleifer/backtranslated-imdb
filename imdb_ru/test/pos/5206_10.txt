Just the best and most realistic WWII film I've ever seen. Not only because German soldiers speak German, but also Russian soldiers speak Russian (without English in German or Russian dialect), and also because of the realistic situation in which the film was made. The game is outstanding. No Hollywood mood at all, even no love story ... Stalingrad was supposed to be one of the worst battles during the war, and in this context there is no place for sentimental or romantic scenes. What you get is a movie that makes you worry to the bone, and in which there is one of the best unfortunate endings that a movie can have.
