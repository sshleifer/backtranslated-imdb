This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. 14-year-old boy Jason Shepard wrote an English newspaper called “Big Fat Liar”. When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike in time to get to college, and he hit a limousine. When he entered the limousine, he met a famous Hollywood producer, Marty Wolf. When he left the limo, he forgot one thing: his newspaper! So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English newspaper into a movie! When Jason admitted that he left his newspaper in a limousine, and Marty took it, his parents and his English teacher did not believe him! So Jason and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood so that Marty would admit that he stole his story from Jason's parents. When Jason told Marty to call his father that Marty stole the paper, Marty lied to him and burned his paper! Jason was so pissed off that Marty burned this paper, and Marty called security to get Jason off his site! Jason and Kayle understood that Marty was not going to accept the truth. To defeat Marty in Phase 2: “Destruction,” Jason and Kayleigh put a permanent blue dye into the pool, and when Marty jumps up, his body turns blue and it does not come off! Then they put permanent orange dye in Marty's shampoo, and when he uses it, his hair turns orange, and they also do not come off! Finally, they stuck a lot of glue on Marty's headset to call Jason's father, and when Marty uses him, he sticks to his ear! It was funny when Marty's hair and body turn blue-orange and his headset is glued to his ear! After that, they deceived Marty by telling Monty, Marty's assistant, that Duncan had moved to the house where the party was taking place. When Marty came to visit Duncan, he was in the wrong house, and all the children at the party beat him up! When Marty was in the house, Jason and Kayleigh switched control of their car. When Marty drove his car, he knew that all controls were switched, and he did not know which button to press. He is stupid enough to fall in love with it. When Marty hit the back of the car, the car crashed his car! It was so funny. So Marty starts calling Jason's father and deceives him again! He was on the phone, but it was not his father, he called the security service! After the guards brought Jason and Kaylee from the Marty site, they suggested they go home. Monty was going to be on the side of Jason and Kaylee because she knew that Marty was a liar and a jerk, so she told Rocco, one of the guards, that she would take care of the children. Jason told his father the truth about what he had been doing for the last 2 days, and when his parents came to Los Angeles. When Monty came to the children, she will help the children go to Phase 4: Payback. Jason divides the team into 3 teams for Phase 4. One team will distract and deceive Marty until Jason's parents get to the set. Marty first went with Frank Jackson, but his car broke down, so he drove with Jalil, but he drove him to the desert and left him there. When Marty was in the desert, he was saved by a helicopter. After that, one of the blades stuck, so Marty and the pilot came down from the helicopter. After that, he was on his way to the set, and when Jason saw him, Marty stopped and saw that Jason had: his monkey! So Marty followed Jason and Kaylee, and when they saw Lester, he released water, and when the water came, she pushed Marty away. Marty was still watching the children, and when Kaylee went the other way, Jason led Marty to the top of the apartment building. At the top, Jason challenged Marty, forcing him to admit the truth, and Marty would never tell the truth. When the team took Marty by surprise, everyone, including Jason's parents, who were on the set, knew what Marty was doing. Marty was going to kill Jason, but the only way out for Jason is to jump from the top! After that, his parents believed him that Marty took his story. When the people who were on the set left, this is the end of Marty. At the end of Jason's story “Big Fat Liar” became a film. I can't get enough of it.
