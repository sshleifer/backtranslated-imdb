For a television movie, it was definitely worth watching. All actions were very well done, and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I did not read / saw the original and, as a rule, I can not stand Shakespeare, but I liked this film (the situation of the civil war was also very well done). Do not expect to see an epic, but you must find it moving enough to enjoy it. By the way (on the side note) do not compare this (or any other film for that matter) with the original work. Films should not carry the book to the screen, but rather use the general idea, and then adapt the story from it. When people say that “the book was much better” (they are usually wrong anyway), what they are really trying to say is that the book was completely different.
