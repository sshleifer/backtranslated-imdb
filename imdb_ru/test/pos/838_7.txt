This is a hell of a fee when you cross Nami Matsushima (Meiko Kaji), the Female Scorpion and a dangerous group of thugs (including their sadistic pimp and his equally repulsive woman) who run the prostitution ring with an iron fist that does just that, Hell has no rage like Scorpio, and decisive detective Gondo (Mikio Narita), eager for revenge for beheading his hand after handcuffing her, will do everything possible (... and this includes bullying anyone who may know her whereabouts) to catch us. , We find an ally in prostitute Yuki (Yayoi Watanabe), who provides her temporary asylum. Yuuki has a retarded brother who suffered a brain injury during work and must take care of him (... in an anxious revelation concerning incest, she also provides for his sexual needs!) .. she actually keeps him locked up in a room while working on the streets! Meanwhile, We become a target for a dastardly neighbor when she finds her own place (.. she works as a sewer), and he threatens to turn her into power (.. We escaped from prison, escaped from the underground cops) if she does not give him sexual services. His wife throws a kettle of boiling water all over her face and body, which leads to death, and the prostitution clan is looking for Us to pay the debt of losing a very important member of their organization. It was then that Katsu (Reisen Lee), the lover and confidant of a pimp, realizes that the culprit for the loss of their faithful member is her former prisoner, Scorpio. Suppressing her injection of liquid narcotic, placing her in a bird cage (!), Katsu adorns her with imprisonment. What ultimately infuriates Nami is the observation of how the prostitute dies near her cell, the victim of a forced abortion in the later periods left to bleed to death. Having found the scalpel clamped in her hand (... from the operating room), We will break out of the cage and hunt each member of the clan responsible for the death of the prostitute. A series of murders with a scalpel gives Gondo the opportunity to catch us, and he will catch her in the underground sewer pipes under the city, but can he catch or kill her? Especially if Yuuki comes to her rescue? <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say that there was no link between director Shun Ito or his film crew, because "WOMAN SCORPIO": "STABLE OF THE BEAST" is another perverted, irresponsible and ultra-brutal recording in a very entertaining series. Possessing excellent production qualities and a visually stylistic talent to capture all the madness in a creative way, Ito draws you directly (... or he made me) into the perverted drama that always exists when Nami Matsushima appears on the screen. When you have a long sequence of initial credits, when your anti-heroine runs through the crowded city streets with a man's hand cut off on it, the viewer should know what they are for! The incestuous plot is just bizarre ((and removed in a gentle way when the mentally retarded brother gawns his numb, cold sister with dead eyes looking ahead!), And the entire abortion sequence is rather difficult to survive. But the angle of abortion, no matter how anxious, is motivation for revenge on us. Despite the imperfect ways of us and its criminal nature, you would prefer her to take out these cretins, and not vice versa. An interesting perspective with detective Gondo. Gondo is ready to break the rules and he becomes a force of nature about anyone who stands in his way of capturing his mortal enemy.His fate at the end, visiting another enemy by Us, in an isolated cell, while she watches, perfectly reflects what makes these films so ridiculous, but At the same time, an interesting murder with a scalpel is a montage of falling scumbags, in different places, the blades stick out of the flesh, and Us leaves the crime scenes, trying very hard to destroy the entire clan in memory of the fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances. While the film is essentially a comic book adventure, there is a sadness that pervades and few characters leave without flaws. I suppose that many will get away from this mockery of how unrealistic SCORPIO FOR WOMEN SCORPIOES are: A STABLE BEAST (in particular, how We are able to avoid catching again and again, achieving our revenge goals, paying the price to everyone who offended her), but I looked at it as a violent action film, very similar to the films of the late 80s, and enjoyed what it was. As always, this film depicts beautiful Asian actresses and colorful heroes. Meiko Kaji, almost always restrained / quiet, but at the same time coldly looking at her enemies with violent intent, is in great shape (... in many ways), and Reisen Lee, like her cross-eyed, nasty opponent, escapes with a picture of how perfectly aware a contemptible and insulting enemy, worthy of psychological torment (... when both are in prison, the ways Nami tortures her are sweet). My favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot, but, oddly enough, wrong, it has a dog who discovers Gondoâ€™s decaying hand that goes down the street, eventually finding a place to rest to chew on it!
