I say sadly, because if you watch this film now, you will understand how much our media have gone down - all the signs of this film. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, I think the last wonderful film about James Brooks, but others may disagree. He has rich characters (and this is also plausible), great acting, great writing, and although the music has become a bit silly, I even liked it. <br /> <br /> William Hurt has never been better. Holly Hunter is awesome. And Albert Brooks leaves every scene he is in - this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and irresistible, and made the entire film fly over the vital and important topic of the News, and how it is slowly compromised in our country. <br /> <br /> Watch this with NETWORK for a really fun and frightening evening.
