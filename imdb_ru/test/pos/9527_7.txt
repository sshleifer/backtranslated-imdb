In Victorian times, the father is separated from his family when he is falsely accused of treason and sent to live in the country. Children adapt to their new situation, make friends and enlist the support of a good old man, whom they wave in the train to help reunite their family. <br /> <br /> Actors who make films are often not very good at it. Jeffreys, however, the great veteran of dozens of British comedy classics, is one of the few exceptions. His brilliant concept (he also wrote the script from the novel by E. Nesbit) of the classic British children's story - this is what raises this film to art. While the story can be highly idealized, the beautiful performances and fabulously memorable settings of the Yorkshire Valleys are combined into a truly memorable film. The photo of Arthur Ibbetson is the definition of good cinema: not a single shot is wasted on the story, but at the same time the images are combined to create a fabulously romantic atmosphere. Agutter is simply beautiful, because the kindhearted Bobby (well, I fell in love with her at an early age, but I defy anyone who disagrees) and Cribbins, whose comic acting pedigree is on a par with Jeffreys, unforgettable because a modest but proud railway porter. This film is timeless; romantic, charming, insanely pleasant and with a beautiful naive sense of kindness towards all.
