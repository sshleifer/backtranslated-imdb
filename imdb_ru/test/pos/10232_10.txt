Why didn't the critics like this movie? I don't understand. This is easily my favorite Clive Barker effort. Hellraiser is a bit rude (the film just never leaves this stupid house), and let's face it, Lord of Illusions does not move at all !!! I have enjoyed writing Barker for many years, especially his “Book of Blood”. Amazingly entertaining. He has a vicious side that is completely different from Stephen King. He freely mixes his own homosexuality and strange religious and occult elements. I love, love, love, love it. However, I also understand that Barker is a dark fantasy writer just like a horror writer. And the fantasy is just not my bag. Puts me to sleep. Always has. I also think that Barker works best with short stories. His novels tend to roam a little. It was my experience when I tried to read The Damnation Game. It all started well. Then 100 pages, I thought "where is it going?" because it has not gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> I read "Cabal" (the book on which Nightbreed is based) and thought it was good. I especially like Decker's character development. The way the mask spoke to him and controlled him. I like the way Barker just presents it. Black and white. Here it is He gives him simplicity, attractive and believable. When asked why Decker is killing, he says (simply) "Because I like it." Perhaps something said Jeffrey Dahmer at some point. <br /> <br /> But I liked Nightbreed more than Cabal. I adore the visual attention to detail that Barker devotes to his films. I love it. I think it's just beautiful. The Lord of Illusions also had this. Some of the drawings are at the beginning, during the Nightbreed credit cycle. It’s like the whole vocabulary that Barker invented only for the world of Nightbreed. I would be curious to know how much its pure design costs. I know that he is an AWESOME artist, his own style and language as an artist. <br /> <br /> Nightbreed is also (I think) the most interesting BArker film. Moves very fast. Well edited. It does not pull, as Lord of Illusions a little. Very fast. Everything in it is just perfect. It also works like a fantastic and scary little slasher. The fact that the killer first killed the family, and then tormented the old man in the store, was really scary. This mask is frightening. I would be interested to know if Barker developed this too. This is not just a sneaky Jason or Scream mask. Something in this really worries. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a great movie. Be sure to look if you have not seen. Highly recommended. One of my favorite horror movies of all time. In my opinion, Clive Barker is the best. It's scary and cruel, though, be careful
