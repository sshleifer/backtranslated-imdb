I think that this film is really interesting, although it lacks some of the features necessary for this kind of films. First of all, when Doug and Chappy begin their mission, they take off from the F-16B, and during the fighting scenes they are piloting the F-16A. The second thing that I donâ€™t like in this film is the ever-recurring F-16, rotating to the right to get away from the rockets ... why haven't the flashlight and flash been shown in any film? Thirdly, when you see an F-16, almost empty of ammunition, a lot of missiles reappear ... the models used to simulate a destroyed aircraft are also no good. Nevertheless, I think that using IAI Kfir as enemy planes was really good, much better than the F-5 shown in Top Gun (but this film is not as good as this masterpiece). The film, I love airplanes, and I saw it more than 3 times.
