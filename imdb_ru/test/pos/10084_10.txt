We open up in some room of doctors. The girl is escorted to the place opposite the doctor. He asks her questions. Silence follows. He continues to ask questions, ignoring the obvious traumatized atmosphere of the girls. <br /> <br /> A story about two girls who are taken home after spending some time in an insane asylum after the “incident” that occurred earlier. Upon arrival, they are greeted by their diligent, too difficult to be sweet, but so completely evil stepmother, for which the girls are clearly indignant. At home, time is running out, and an evil stepmother finds new ways to torment girls. And to top it all, there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping girls recover ... <br /> <br /> This movie is awesome. It has twists, turns and definitely makes you think a lot without meaning. The relationship between the two girls is so emotional that they sometimes make you cry (I know, I had two tearful moments, especially the “scene in the closet”). But what I love most about this film is a complete sense of fear throughout the entire time before the rolling captions. The soundtrack is impeccable, the decor in the house and the use of colors are fantastic. Pure joy for the eyes. This is definitely a must see for all Asian movie fans. Or ANY movie fan! Easy 10/10.
