From the first to the last scene, this film is made very realistic, even too realistic, so sometimes we cannot see the details in the night scenes (dark as real night), in the desert (the sunlight is so strong as in the real desert), <br /> <br /> Scenario and acting is also very realistic. Frames and episodes are edited to not show things and events “effectively”, “explain” them or, as many Hollywood films do, “entertain” the audience. To edit here is to present the events as if they really happened in Afghanistan. The camera is sometimes installed far from dying soldiers, even at the moment when the main character, Major Bandura, is shot dead. <br /> <br /> This method reminds me of the masterpieces of Italian neo-realism. And the construction of this story is based on the same principles as “Paisà”, or “The Bicycle Thief” - a chronological series of episodes of the “true life” and several pathetic moments that at first glance seem sudden and illogical, but there are internal reasons . <br /> <br /> I think that the internal cause of Major Bandura’s suicidal death is religious emotion - repentance for the death of innocent people (not only his accidental killing of a family in a village, but also the death of soldiers under his command). He is not depicted as an impatient believer, on the contrary, he is depicted as a tactful and responsible officer. It is for this reason that his last decisions (to return to the ruined village and turn his back on the armed boy whose family he killed) seem to be an act of repentance. <br /> <br /> The Russian Orthodox choral sound, which sounds at the end (“Evening sacrifice”), is another context by which the entire film can be seen from this point of view.
