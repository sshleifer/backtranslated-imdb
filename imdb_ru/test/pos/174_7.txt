I can’t believe that I rarely ever saw this title, mentioned by all of you to the terrible fans of the eighties, and I definitely don’t join all my fellow reviewers, saying “Bloody Birthday” is a terrible view. On the contrary, I really liked it, and I was pleasantly surprised by the genius and unexpected turns that it offers. Do not just call this film “another slasher of the 80s”, because the victims are unlikely here, like the killers. We meet three cherubim-looking young people who were all born during a solar eclipse. At that moment, when they were delivered, the planet Saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon, and because of this, children are deprived of emotions and seem to be without conscience. It really begins to manifest around their tenth birthday, when they go to a merciless murder. <br /> <br /> Of course, this thing is incredibly contrived and even a bit offensive, but seriously, who cares? Unlike many other horror films from this period, he at least tries to bring something original and creative. This time, the children's play is good, and the whole movie has a terrible atmosphere and grizzly music. The sequences of murders are dark and tense, and it is always terrible to see them as perfect children with an angelic face. I don't know who hired 3 kids, but they did a good job. Especially memorable girl and baby with glasses. The grim images of a heartless trio are reminiscent of classic plots such as Village of the Damned, Bad Seed and Children of the Damned. This film is not so memorable as these milestones, but very funny, and no horror-lover will regret seeing this. <br /> <br /> The bloody birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not particularly the greatest genius in the movie, but a pleasantly crazy guy who also brought us incredibly interesting cheese festivals, such as Brain and Star Invasion. If all this is still not enough to convince you, there is a lot of nudity in Bloody Birthday. And not just nudity, but Julie Brown, topless dance act from MTV-VJ. Oh, and keep your eyes open for the completely unnecessary cameo Joe Penny, later the stars of the television series "Jake and the Fat." Check this !!
