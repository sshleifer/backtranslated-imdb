Yes!! They finally brought it to perfection. What a great idea, a refreshing epic about exploitation for Generation X, whether they know it or not. After disasters like a sergeant. Kabukiman NYPD, and blockbuster sensational, our hero, Lloyd Kaufman just decided to go for it, stop treating distributors, and let Troma be all Troma, what could be. Lloyd would make this film the most disgusting, outlandish and frankly funny movie about Trom. This time, Lloyd takes Shakespeare's love story, turns it inside out, trots and adds the long, lost, entertaining value she always lacked. Entertainment value, such as Lemmy Kilmister (narrator), Debbie Rochon (cook), Joe Fleischaker (fat man) and, of course, cruel injuries and toilet humor. "Tromao and Juliet" - the final edition of a rather dull history and the pearl of the universe Troma. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, in Tromaville, New Jersey's business partners Monty Q and Cap Kapulet created a film company called Silky Films, which would produce tastefully soft films. Monty regards Cap as his friend, but Cap does not want to pull the poor sucker out of his stake in the company. On paper and in books, it seems that Monty gave up his life's work for free. Fast forward to Manhattan mid-90s, we have two families who are extremely dissatisfied with each other, and the fact is that they are just looking for a reason to end their lives, or, preferably, their lives. Monty has a son, Thromeo, a nephew, Benny, and he and his friend Murray Martini, who is too agitated by this whole massacre, is at war with incestuous capsules, except for Monty, he is too drunk to care. As in the original, a tangled situation arises, as a result of which Tromeo falls in love with Cap's daughter, whom he never met or did not even know. Unfortunately, Cap is a sadistic pervert who, unlike Thromo's father, has something for the bottle, and this would certainly have caused the dad's little melon chenshaw to be physically abused, emotionally abused, harassed and kept in a plexiglass cage. from time to time, depending on how bad the mood is in Cap. Cap also forces his vegetarian daughter to marry London Arbuckle, a billionaire butcher who can make anyone worry, with a bun with or without raisins. With all these inconveniences, young lovers feel that escape will be the best solution, but how will this affect greater hostility? It may or may not be something similar to the original, but to find out how it ends, it just does not happen, you will never see it happen. <br /> <br /> with Leo "just causes drowsiness compared to Tromeo & Juliet, but if you are full, redirected, with a big budget, in Hollywood, Garbage is what you were programmed for, then by all means do it but if you are in the mood for something more colorful, something that is truly impressive, and does not fit the “normal” pattern of the film, and if you have a rather abnormal sense of humor, then you may not hate this film. Tromao and Juliet give preference to everything that is mainstream. Exceptional exploitation with the same vile humor as the young John Waters. Along with some terrible game, Thromo and Juliet flaunt the thunder, which includes the legendary Motorhead, and not to mention the great contribution of James Gunn, who really reduced put it together. For more information from James Gunn, see Lollilove, and for more perfection from Lloyd Kaufman, check out his next vision, Terror Firmer. Thromo and Juliet is a tremendously priceless Operation of the 90s, which was brought to us by the only king of Bi-films. Thanks, Lloyd. 10/10
