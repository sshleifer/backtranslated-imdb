With "The Return of Batman," Tim Burton gave way to an important priority in American cinema: to give a continuation to the blockbuster. Three years later, after the most successful film of the year “Batman” (1989), the hero Gotham City again comes here to the delight of many viewers. Like its predecessor, "The Return of Batman" was a huge commercial success. Tim Burton forced Batman back again, because you have to believe that the latter’s victory over his enemy Joker did little to improve the image of Gotham City. Indeed, violence and corruption still exist, and here, the second word is embodied by Max Shrek (Christopher Walken) and the penguin (Danny De Vito). These two crooks who want to take control of Gotham City will make Batman’s life difficult. His task will be harder with the advent of the cat woman ... <br /> <br /> Tim Burton still did a lot of work on the scenery, and he seemed to be trying to correct the mistakes of the first film. This means that the director has given way to battles that are better mastered than in the first Batman. But at the same time, he did not neglect the psychology of his main characters. If in the 1989 film, Burton focused on the psychology of Bruce Wayne / Batman, here, obviously, he was interested in the penguin. The director tried to make him, very well-acting De Vito, ambiguous. On the one hand, he is full of bad intentions (previously quoted), but on the other hand, he is looking for his past and would like to be considered a real man. <br /> <br /> “The Return of Batman” also looks like crazier than its predecessor, especially with the actors. I think of Michèle Pfeiffer, who offers a bold and powerful performance as Catwoman. In addition, at the time when I am writing this review, I recall that a new version of Catwoman is currently appearing in the cinema. But, given the bad reviews (3 out of 10 on IMDb!), She is confident that her performer, Halley Berry, should be void next to Pfeifer. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this film is one of the best sequels of 1992 and this allows you to develop a special style of Tim Burton. We also still find his taste for the strange and the gothic. As for the other adaptations of Batman for the screen, you can skip them. “Batman forever” (1995) and “Batman and Robin” (1997) are no good. I heard that Christopher Nolan was filming the beginning of the story about Batman, and she was due out next year. Will this fit the work of Tim Burton?
