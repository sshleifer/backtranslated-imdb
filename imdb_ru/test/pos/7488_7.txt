Strongly cynical, sarcastic and intense film, teasing and imitating the style of "Pulp Fiction" and stylized gangster films, Thursday is an exciting, exciting and fun trip to the thrill. Surprisingly eclectic mix of naughty characters and strangely interesting situations, this day in the life of an action movie trying to go straight turns out to be a worthy addition to a series of films that try to imitate Tarantino’s genius The Dark Humorous Masterpiece Fiction <br /> <br /> Nick (Aaron Eckhardt) stops at Casey's house (Thomas Jane) to catch up. Casey was a former fighter for drug dealers who has since reformed, become an architect, married a successful business woman (Paula Marshall) and is now considering the possibility of adopting a child. Nick, who is still connected to the gangster underworld, leaves a bag full of drugs at Casey's house while he borrows his car to complete several assignments ?? unfinished business Feeling disgust and anger from introducing drugs into his home, Casey lowers them all into the kitchen sink. Then, one at a time, two-time accomplices of Nick, banging on the Rastafarian drug envoys and exhausted cops, are enraged for the unsuspecting Casey, who is going to spend an incredible Thursday. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a fun sequence at a gas station, in which Nick looks for the best deal for a cup of coffee. After thinking about what cup size to get, the cashier’s fiasco begins when he demands a free snack cake and uses a $ 50 bill to pay. As a result of the comically brilliant bloodshed, the situation worsens when the policeman intervenes and gets into the most unusual circumstances. This introductory segment sets the perfect mood for the rest of the film, which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters who seem to be aware of their existence in this meaningless gangster movie. <br /> <br /> The film is broken up into segments based on different events and times in one day. This effect is in many ways similar to Pulp Fiction, which is similarly presented in chapters, although Thursday does not spoil the chronological order, with the exception of random recollection. Like Tarantino, the music perfectly represents each scene and each character. Strangely humorous creatures, such as the Jamaican pizza delivery worker who knocks on the phone and shares his hashish, and the narcissist Dallas Polina Porizkova, who tries to rape Casey, add humor to every event no matter how terrifying and unnerving some of the coincidences are . When calm, screaming, crooked policeman Mickey Rourke Kasarov comes into play, a careful staging and a tangled staging are fully assembled, and Casey’s sticky situation becomes even more impudent and commendable. <br /> <br /> Of course, “Pulp Fiction” with a lot of violence, ingenious dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists, Thursday does some things right, but other attempts at reverence can go far enough to suggest robbery. The memory of how Casey shoots villains and does her hair in a style exactly the same as what John Travolta does in Pulp Fiction is too far away. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie, www.MoviePulse.net
