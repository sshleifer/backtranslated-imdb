MY JIMI'S DINNER - a glimpse of Howard Kaylan's frivolous and dizzying journey to fame with his 60's folk-rock band The Turtles. The turtles were a sort of “second tier” in the sixties, but the film clearly demonstrates that they could eat, drink and have fun with the Titans of Hippie Culture. And, not only that, they had musical scum to back it up. Many stellar acts of that era are visible when they interact with a group at work and in the game. This provides my only film complaint. Almost from the very beginning of the film it is clear that it is almost impossible to find actors who can convincingly impersonate such recognizable stars. Too often during the movie, I felt that I was watching a fascinating exhibition of fake wigs and mustaches. But, if you're a fan of The Turtles or The Swinging 60's music, in general, this could be a movie for you. And do not forget to view additional. The band members, Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, very funny (and informatively) talk about their disastrous experience of working with managers and agents.
