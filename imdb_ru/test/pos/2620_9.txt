This episode of Charmed has changed everything! The show ends in the third season, and in this episode, all hell fails. Enchanted bring Innocent named Dr. Griffiths to the estate to protect him from Shaks, the Killer of the Sources. When Shaks attacks, he bursts in like a tornado, and then penetrates his demon skin. He explodes, Prue threw the wall, which completely knocks her out and almost kills. Then the explosions Piper threw what was left of the wall. Phoebe comes from the attic and recites a victory spell until Shaks has killed the doctor. But, being the Power of One, it only hurts him. Leo heals the other sisters, and Prue wants to find Shaks and destroy him for real. Phoebe, meanwhile, is in the Underworld trying to find Cole. When Prue and Piper go outside to find the demon, the demon finds them. After the battle, the witches realize that the camera caught everything! When they return to the Manor, trying to fight the media, and after they defeat Shaks, the departed witch, like a bull, shoots Piper. Prue uses her telekinesis to get people out of the way so she can get to the hospital. But they are late, and Piper dies. And as soon as Prue is about to shoot herself, time rewinds to the place where they bring Dr. Griffiths to the Manor. Sheks blows and blows up Prue and Piper. But Phoebe is still in the Underworld, so Shaks kills the doctor and flies out of the Manor. When Leo finally arrives, he cannot heal Prue. Prue is dead, as is the Power of the Three. Now. Personally. This episode was sad. Prue was the strength of all of them. I would like to have her telekinesis power. I really do not think that Phoebe should have gone to the Underworld, because if she had not done this, Shex would not have killed Prue. But Paige unites the Power of Three again, and I'm pleased with the progress of the show.
