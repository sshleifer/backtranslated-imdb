When I saw Lon Chaney Jr. and Boris Karloff in the cast, I expected to find a typical “horrible” 1950s-style horror film. The initial scene (a cemetery with a wolf howling in the background) seemed to confirm this. As soon as I started watching him, what I discovered was an exquisite little mystery about an Englishman (Richard Green) trying to find out what happened to two of his friends who disappeared in the Black Forest, and, if necessary, take revenge on an evil earl McNally), who ruled the territory. Cheney, like deaf Gargon, played a rather limited role (in fact, reminded me of Hunchback Notre Dame), and Karloff was a slightly more significant role of Dr. Meissen. In fact, Meissen was one of the most interesting characters in the film, and until the very end it was difficult to know if he would be a good or a bad guy! The castle set was magnificent, and even the limited image of the Black Forest was quite real. This, of course, did not seem low-budget compared to other films that I saw anyway. I thought that the only disappointment was the performance of Rita Corday in the role of the Countess. She seemed somewhat dry and did not seem to invest in her special passion. <br /> <br /> In addition, I discovered that this film caught my attention everywhere, and there was enough uncertainty about how all this would happen. It turns out to be worth it to watch. Definitely recommended, with a rating of 7/10.
