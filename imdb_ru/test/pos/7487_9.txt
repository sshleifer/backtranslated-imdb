Well, so she owes Pulp Fiction, but in my opinion, she has her own voice and personality, mainly because of the style of the direction of the music video, the plot narration and great performances. Thomas Jane copes with his task very well (a fight with drug dealers is extraordinary), Aaron Eckhart too. James LeGros has a short and effervescent appearance - great humor - “they got Wong's house.” The scene of interrogation and rape Porzikova is remembered, as is the occasional role of Mickey Rourke - “take a peak”. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous Hollywood popcorn B-products with strong performances by contenders and renegade level A (Rourke). <br /> <br /> Well, take the peak, it's worth it.
