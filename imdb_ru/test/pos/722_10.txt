I watched this movie without knowing anything about it. I assumed it was a science fiction movie. How wrong I was. The plot is fascinating and intelligent, the actors are charismatic, and the whole film just makes you think about the changes. Some puzzles puzzled me completely, but in the end the answers were pretty simple. I am very puzzled by the low score of this film, as I thought it was rather unusual. If you liked the movie Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pete or The Matrix, then you will like it. There are no serious special effects or fancy tricks here. It's all about the plot, the creation of characters and the creation of the atmosphere. This film, however, ultimately does not provide answers that may annoy some people, but I thought the ending was great. I'm still not sure if the film is based on a true story or not .......
