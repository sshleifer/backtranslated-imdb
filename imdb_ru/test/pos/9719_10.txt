I remember my father hiring these episodes on video. My whole family loved them, and now that I moved from home and had my own life, I try to share these fabulous creations of Jim Henson with my husband and stepchild, but as I begin to understand, not all are fans of Henson. Unfortunately, this means that they just have to come to terms with me in the search for this series. But even if they do not find it interesting, I highly recommend to anyone who takes possession of the Narrator. You will be lost in the world of fairy tales from a time when people could only talk about unexplained situations through stories and how people need to be taken care of if they have ever been confronted with these situations.
