Excellent performance. There are still good actors around! Also great direction and photography. Very true for Shakespeare and a must for all fans of Shakespeare. Macbeth (Jason Connery) brought me to tears with his last monologue (from a short candle, from). He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it more interesting. Helen Baksendale is a very trustworthy lady Macbeth who can sometimes be very funny, and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste of blood and evil. If you love death and decay, and the texts of Shakespeare ... this is one.
