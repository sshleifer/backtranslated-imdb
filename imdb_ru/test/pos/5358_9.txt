Wallace and Gromit are the main characters of some of the best cartoons ever created. An excellent combination of visual humor and clay makes Great Day, Wrong Pants, and Shaving one of the best animations ever shown on television. Having received several Oscars, as well as many other awards, Nick Park became quite a popular man in the UK, but his influence on the United States was not great. After the third short film, Wallace and Gromit, there were rumors about the feature film Wallace and Gromit, but for years nothing happened. Then, in 2000, instead of the full-length film by Wallace and Gromit, we received another brilliant film about glination from Nick Park, called The Running Chicken, which was almost nominated for the best picture in the Oscar. Perhaps it was the success of this film that eventually led Park to finally work on the Wallace and Gromit project. <br /> <br /> 5 years later (such films take a lot of time, as you know) and many expectations, Wallace and Gromit are finally on the big screen. Despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this film shows many possibilities. This film will delight both children and parents. Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the few films that is perfect for children and adults, with tons of adult humor. This rather complicated technique is the one that only Pixar has already perfected, and DreamWorks has lately experienced many difficulties. Despite the fact that the DreamWorks logo was attached to the poster, this film was mainly created by a very creative team of Aardman Animations. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit were first seen in running a business that protects the citizens ’harvest from being destroyed by rabbits, who apparently had recently run in the wild and in large numbers. Their business received great respect from other residents of the city, because a giant vegetable competition was fast approaching, and the crops needed protection. Complications arise when Wallace tries to manipulate rabbits to dislike vegetables, and then a great food machine is released in this area. It depends on Wallace and Gromit to find a giant animal and stop him from eating in the gardens, as well as their approval of the townspeople. To add to this, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, who also attracted the attention of a snob lover named Victor. A simple plot, yes, but it’s more than it seems at first glance, be prepared for a few funny surprises, like in other Wallace and Gromit cartoons. <br /> <br /> In animated films with a small dialogue, it is the animation that should set the pace and mood of the film. Although it took 5 years to produce just 85 minutes of video, the return was fantastic. There is a huge amount of detail that requires more than one view to really notice. Even more incredible than the detailed and almost flawless animation - this is really an incredible amount of visual humor embedded in the film. Whether it is a creatively taken picture or ordinary labels placed in the most ridiculous of possible positions, or these are very cute rabbits that are constantly shown in the film, most of the curses of the werewolf rabbit come solely from simply watching the movie. He himself catches all the links until it becomes too late. Just imagine the movie “Madagascar”, with the exception of a ridiculous, much smaller number of references in pop culture and better animation. <br /> <br /> The casting was great, although in a movie with a small amount of dialogue it was not so important. Peter Sallis is doing a great job with Wallace again, although this film didn’t have any outstanding quotes that could be used at any time (“Wrong pants”: “These are wrong pants, Gromit, and they went wrong!”). Ralph Fiennes copes with the role of the main villain Victor, as well as Helena Bonham Carter (known as the crazy leading woman in the cult hit "Fight Club"), gives her a wonderful voice when she plays Wallace's love interest. Despite the fact that nothing could surpass the final chase in “Wrong trousers”, in “The Curse of the Rabbit Object” there were indeed many action scenes, including one fantastically complex chase scene between Gromit and the evil dog of Victor. Last but not least, bunnies really steal the show at some points. Whether it is their cute expressions, funny movements or howling, the rabbits in the film even remove the glory of the main stars. The funniest rabbit in the movie is the damn rabbit itself, until the very end of the movie the audience rode with laughter. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: despite the fact that it is not as memorable as “Wrong pants” “This film is as good and interesting as Chicken Run. Unlike almost all the films that will be released this year, the film does not drag out at all, its duration is only 85 minutes, but at the same time it contains so much joy and fun that will make everyone watch it, asking for more. There is little bad in the film; It was pure delight to watch. This film is the exact opposite of decent, but vulgar, uncircumcised, unprocessed films that earned an amazing amount of money earlier this year (the 40-year-old Theotokos, Wedding Crushers and Sin City) for families and those who want harmless entertainment; This is a good thing. Highly recommended, this is the best animated film that will be released this year and one of the best we have seen in this decade. Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the werewolf rabbit: absolutely harmless fun from second 1 to second 5 100.
