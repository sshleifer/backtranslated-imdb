Main cast: <br /> <br /> Vlastimil Brodsky .... Frantisek Khan Stella Zazvorkova .... Emilia Khanova Stanislav Zindulka .... Eda <br /> <br /> Director Vladimir Mikhalek tells this charming story of older people, enchanting twists that make the characters attractive, truly universal. <br /> <br /> Frantishek Khan retired and retired, his previous occupation is unknown. He lives in a very nice apartment with his wife of forty-four, Emily. His son Jara yearns for a spacious apartment as a problem solver, since he needs to place one of his former wives and several of their children. The son is not an evil intriguer, just a boy who has too much of one ex-spouse, and he closes his eyes to his father’s affection for the apartment (to which he moved after giving up his former residence with his son). <br /> <br /> Khan and his elderly friend Ed spend more free time there, doing little fraudulent work not for money, but for the pleasure of overcoming such easily deceived people as real estate agents. Hana's favorite trick is to play the role of the retired marvel of the New York Metropolitan Opera, returning home in need of an extensive mansion. Ed is his companion, as the gullible realtors fall for themselves, offering chauffeured limousines and fine French cuisine in the hope of a bargain sale. <br /> <br /> When the duo does not engage in well-planned frauds, he quickly arranges tricks pretending to be railway security agents to snatch kisses from lifeless and ticketless teenagers trying to get into trains. Chaste kisses, that is: there is no debauchery. <br /> <br /> Khana’s long-suffering wife is obsessed with accumulating enough money to ensure that the couple, individually and together, arrange a grand funeral, a lifetime event. Loving Frantisek not in a hurry to experience. <br /> <br /> Disagreements over money and the indiscriminate disposition of Frantisek family funds lead to a crisis, the solution of which sounds both real and sweet. Michalek fishes for the sake of the spectator's emotions, but he does it openly, honestly and effectively. <br /> <br /> “Autumn Spring”, of course, with subtitles, is the product of an increasingly dynamic Czech cinema. This has not been widely shown in the United States, but its availability on DVD will hopefully bring this spectacular film to a wide audience. Unfortunately, Brodsky recently died of cancer, so this film is a farewell to a good actor who filled his hero with a passion for life's pleasures that should reflect his own values. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
