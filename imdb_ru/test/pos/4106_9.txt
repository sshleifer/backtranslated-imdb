I went to the cinema in 1973, when the film was released, I was then 11 years old. I remember how I enjoyed it and wanted to live in Shangri-la, for how naive and young I was. I recently stumbled upon a video of a movie I filmed on television several years ago. I looked at it again, and I am not ashamed to admit that I still enjoy it just as I did 29 years ago. I also like to listen to the words of the songs, because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sounds of guns do not beat in our ears, and if we look at our reflection, we should be happy with what we see. what I call the movie “I feel good” because I feel happy after watching it. Maybe I'm still naive, but it makes me happy, and I am sure that it will make you happy if you look at it openly and enjoy what it is - a good family movie. I must be one of the few who have this film on a VHS PAL video - and on a DVD (made by myself). I burned it to DVD, as the video from the TV began to wear out. I still watch it from time to time.
