This film turned out to be better than I expected. I don't think this deserves an R rating, though. I have seen PG-13 films with worse language and violence. I found this movie interesting and I liked it. If you are a person who makes out everything, you may find something wrong with this, but if you take it for face value, I think you will find it interesting.
