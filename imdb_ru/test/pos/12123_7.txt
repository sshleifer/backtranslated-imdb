I do not know if it is fair for me to consider this. I am not a fan of irrational violence. I never understood that the film industry makes heroes from members of the mafia and cold-blooded killers. When “The Godfather” came out, I thought they broke the template, but for decades they created a series of well-played films about mobs with the participation of major stars and directors. This one is obviously low-budget, but certainly well-made. At some point in all this, I feel I want to take a shower. If such characters really exist, it is hard for the soul. I always intellectualize that humanity will rise above such things. This kind of dirt must be stopped. I hope that people who go to these films are more voyeur and less vicarious. I feel the same about slasher movies. Why are we fascinated by death and dismemberment? For the sake of fairness, I appreciate it in acting and directing, and for some reason it seems to work pretty well.
