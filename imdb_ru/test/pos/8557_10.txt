We don’t know why this unusual film has never been officially released on DVD ... The Anthony Quinn performance alone makes it a must-see. There are relatively few films in which an actor so deeply identifies himself with his character, a phenomenon that is always unique to us, movie lovers. <br /> <br /> But Quinn's powerful image of an innocent Romanian is literally pulled out of his house every day. a life that he cannot comprehend is only a part of what makes this film great. The script is based on a book published in Paris by a Romanian priest who fled from the communist seizure of power in his own country, and the film successfully goes deep into a little-known area of ​​Eastern European history. Spoken as a series of Kafka twists of fate, the misfortunes of Johann Moritz (narrated openly and honestly, without any political correctness that is so valuable at present in Hollywood) are in fact a praise of the lost innocence of the Romanian people. ... It’s damn ironic that this praise was signed by a French director working for American money from an Italian producer and controlling a multinational cast under the guidance of an extraordinary Mexican tespian. <br /> <br /> I have seen mentions of the VCDs of this film in various Asian online stores, and I was lucky to get a digital recording of this film, broadcast in the British version of TCM. But it's a shame that “The 25th Hour” is nowhere on the future DVD card of MGM studios.
