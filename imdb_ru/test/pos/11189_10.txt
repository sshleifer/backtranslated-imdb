This movie refers to entertainment. This is the funniest movie I've ever seen. Lines acting. And the clothes, wow, talked about the 70s. If you ever see this little gem, buy it. It is worth every penny. By the way, the introductory song is awesome. If anyone knows where I can find it. Please send me an email.
