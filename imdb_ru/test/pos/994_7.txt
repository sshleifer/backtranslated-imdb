This film failed miserably in the UK, and he did not deserve it. The trailer for this film is a little misleading, and I guess it misleads critics and viewers, forcing them to think that this is “Atonement: Part 2”. While the film was sold in such a way as to benefit from the earlier success of the film won by BAFTA Jo Wright, it is very different in tone. It focuses on the imagination of a kind of life of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas during World War II as the author of propaganda films for the war effort and his subsequent return to Wales. Directed by John Maybury quickly introduces Dylan (Matthew Rice's) baby lover Vera Phillips, played by Keira Knightley. She was Dylan's first love in their homeland, but the moment has passed, and the singer Vera wants it to be just a wonderful memory. Or is she? Vera unexpectedly establishes a close relationship with another woman in the life of Dylan: "Queen of Ireland, the love of my life, mother of my child" Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller). These three form a sort of control troika in London-ridden London, but Vera then falls in love with the dashing soldier, William Killick (Cillian Murphy). They marry quickly, and Killick goes to war. Frightened Vera convinces Thomas to “return with her to Wales,” but all three face the realistic birth of Vera’s child, William’s jealousy and a projectile after returning home, and Caitlin realizes that she cannot share Dylan with her best friend. <br /> <br /> Filmed with a small budget, this is more a mood than anything else. This works best as the realization that some memories and feelings need to be appreciated, but not updated. The performance of Sienna Miller is especially great (unfortunately, the nonsense of the paparazzi detracts from the fact that she is a real talent), and Knightley and Murphy are again very good. Disappointment is Rhys as Dylan, to whom, although the Welsh poet himself was not a bed of roses, lacked charisma and makes one wonder what these women see in Dylan. The letter is very changeable, some wonderful moments alternate with carelessness. But definitely worth a look.
