I love pop culture, but I got a little scared when I first heard about it. Then I saw the episode, and I love it! I was a little upset when I found out that Christopher Excelson would no longer play Doctor Who. He was probably the best of them. It suits the character so well. It's sad to see him leave. I really do not think that the new guy is going to pull out the doctor as well as Excelson. <br /> <br /> I think everyone can lose sight of the crappy effects in some places and creatures, such as darlex. The plot lines and characters can more than make up for it. I am currently waiting for the second season, and I will also consider it in case, for some reason, the quality deteriorates. <br /> <br /> In any case, I think everyone should try to see one episode. I did, and I love it since. Well written, well cast and well thought out, this show is worth an hour of viewing. Doctor Who gets 10/10
