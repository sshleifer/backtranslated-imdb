The film exceeded all expectations, an excellent understanding of the human condition. What exactly makes Mila paint her ass. What can push a person so far away that the only way out is that the anus is repeatedly painted by strangers. <br /> <br /> This film is not afraid to jump out in the face of a problem with painting ass. Just breathtaking. Throw on the sequel or anything following from the geniuses who did it.
