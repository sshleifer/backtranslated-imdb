Got a chance to see it at a friend's house today, and was impressed with what he achieved with such a small budget. Not that it ever bothered me, since I love low-budget science fiction films such as Doctor Who, Blake 7, and The Dark Star. Hell, even Outland was not a big budget, so although money helps, you need more than throwing money at things to make them good. <br /> <br /> At first, the story is simple with a group of mercenaries. paid for escorting a prisoner in space. Their ship is attacked, and they are forced to land on the nearest planet. Then they discover that the prisoner also coped with this, he is a stone with a cold nut, and this is only the beginning of their problems. <br /> <br /> The effects, with the exception of shootouts, are minimalist and are added to the film without overloading It. Computer effects from time to time look a little clever, but serve their purpose well and complement the story, giving a futuristic atmosphere to the process. In films like me, Robot could benefit from this approach, rather than using style to a large extent, rather than replacing special effects for the plot, such as too many Hollywood sentences. <br /> <br /> So far, none of the actors have received Oscar material, he is tightly written and shot, and after an hour and ten minutes does not precede his greeting. The characters are not well developed, but they are not in the Predator either, what does it look like. Big man Mike Mitchell is a good helper for Arnie, a great combination of brains and muscles. <br /> <br /> Some people may be unhappy with the lack of explanation at the end, but I like it. Unlike many films and shows that leave unexplainable things, it is not so unclear that you cannot cope with this at all, and I would like to see a sequel where the nature of aliens is explored further. br /> <br /> A stunningly small film from an adventurous team, made cheaply, but a fun way to spend an hour. If this is what they can do with meager means, I would like to see what they will do with a little more money, and I hope that the film industry and critics of the untalented armchair will not beat out all of their creativity in the first place. /> <br /> Recommended.
