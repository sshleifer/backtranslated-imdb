This little John Ford Western without the "stars", but with the cast of characters - one of his masterpieces. It’s like a documentary, as it follows the journey west of the Mormons party, and it may be the most authentic of all of Ford’s films (along with The Sun Shines Bright, which he made a couple of years later). <br /> <br /> There is a kind of conspiracy (a group of bank robbers joins the car at one moment), but the dramatic moments of the film are almost random. Great performances by Ford’s joint stock company (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr., Ward Bond, Jane Darwell, etc.) Significantly enhance the authenticity of the film, while the closest film falls into a full-fledged stellar performance - Denver Joan Drew. Drew was a much more beautiful actress than she was ever trusted in, as was Bond and Johnson, who at least were finally awarded Oscar recognition for his work in The Last Picture Show. As he himself said: "With a nice guy this could not happen." Add a great photo of Bert Glennon and you get a genuine piece of Americana that cannot be obtained from anyone other than Ford. This is a film that truly honors the pioneers of America and is full of feelings and feelings.
