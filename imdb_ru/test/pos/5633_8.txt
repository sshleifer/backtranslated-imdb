I liked it because I can relate to it. <br /> <br /> Once in my life I tried to make films and experienced many of the same problems that Borchardt faced when trying to make YOUR movie. And I also experienced a protracted period of self-arrested development, where I refused to grow. But then, miraculously, I got married and had children. I realized that there would probably not be a director who struggles with difficulties to feed my family. So I got a decent job and did what, in my opinion, I needed to do to make it happen. This is what makes a mature, responsible adult. <br /> <br /> Mark has not yet come across this reality, and in this sense he is a backward teenager. For this reason there is hopelessness in it. Like Don Quixote, he seems so inept and self-deluded that he does not understand how bad he is. The viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle. Mark has children, an ex-wife and bills that he has to pay, but the film shows that he cares mostly about his “artistic vision”. <br /> <br /> Despite this, Mark is seen in the film as a handsome man, surrounded by a very interesting family and a group of friends. Unfortunately, Mark lacks many things necessary for success in life and career: maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, prioritization, financial influence, etc. However, he, like Ed Wood is awake, like Ed Wood. without any semblance of clues. <br /> <br /> I believe that we should feel inspired by the spectacle "never die" of this noble man struggling with difficulties. And man, what are the chances! Kiefer Sutherland, Colin Hanks, Tori Spelling and Angelina Jolie are descendants of famous people from the movies or television; No doubt they will all want to direct someday, if they haven't already. How much space is there for an independent like Mark? It's like watching a guy beat himself on the head with a board again and again. If you think about it, it's pretty close to what happens to one of the actors, Mark, with the door of the kitchen cabinet, in one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in any movie. <br /> <br /> Despite these concerns and seeing criticism, I really enjoyed this film, and sincerely recommend it to everyone. Uncle Bill is awesome. I have a friend who met Mike and Mark, and he told me that in real life these guys are exactly the way they appeared in the film.
