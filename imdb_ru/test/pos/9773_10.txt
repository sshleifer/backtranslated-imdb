Changi has a delightfully fresh script, in which both young and old actors play superbly. John Doyle did an excellent job of bringing humor to the tragic true story, sometimes leaving a sad and fascinating story, especially for those of us who are not familiar with the events in Southeast Asia during World War II. <br /> <br /> John Doyleâ€™s parallel storyline successfully bridges the gap between the past and the present, allowing the audience to understand the long-term impact of war on prisoners and the lives of their families, and also provides the basis for an excellent narrative that pleasantly complements the stories. individual and collective. Doyle deserves praise for this effort. In the past, we were delighted with his plentiful and quick-witted humor, as evidenced by his longstanding collaboration with Greg Pikhavar in the role of 'Roy & HG' <br /> <br /> As the series approaches mid-way, we look forward to how evolving with anticipation.
