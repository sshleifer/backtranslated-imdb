Simply put, there are two parts to this series that made me cry until my eyes fell out. First: the part where it was installed to wash the toilet, but eventually drank toilet water, imagining that a hot director gives him a golden rain !!! (I was laughing so hard!) <br /> <br /> Second: the part where he tried to prove himself worthy of a swimming school instructor. He looked like a professional, but, as expected, did not know how to swim (at least correctly ^^). However, the funny part of it was when he finally reached the end and said “how it was” or something. It was so damn fun that I could not stop laughing. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this anime series, I highly recommend it. One of the best I've seen. <br /> <br /> Definitely the funniest!
