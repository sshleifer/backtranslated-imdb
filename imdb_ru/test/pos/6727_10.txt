I saw this film early in the morning in the early 90s, when I was about 12. I tried to find out what it was, and finally, today I did it! I remember how I enjoyed it and was a little excited at the end when he showed the Gravestone of a young boy and his ghostly face! Please, someone can let me refuse if I can get a copy of this, as I would like to see it again. I remember how a child stuck in a tin-plate mine and then was friends with a boy. I can not remember that the children were stuck there with the miners, but it must have been so. The boy helps them out of the mine and turns out to be the ghost of a boy who died while working there, I think.
