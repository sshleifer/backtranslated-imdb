Being in the suburbs of New York, when the Z-Boys were creating a story in Dogtown, I could only see what was happening. I had a P-O-S Black Knight skateboard with clay wheels. It has long passed, and in a heap of ashes of my personal life. But I never forgot. It’s like watching long lost brothers and friends, and it amazes me where I live. I can't watch this movie enough. Every time I look at this, some other aspect rises to the top, some other point of view is in focus. Vintage shots, incredible shots, current personalities mingled with the bright shadows of the brightly lit past, soulful and unproved narrative, everything is beautifully edited together to make a memorable documentary of an authentic piece of American history. According to Glen Friedman, “It was incredible.”
