Watching John Cassavetes's debut film is a strange experience, even if you've already seen improvisational films. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is rudeness. We immediately see that some characters spoil their lines. But then you retreat from the situation, plunging deeper into the intimate contacts of these people and ask yourself: “Do I ever come across my words?” The answer, of course, is sure that we do everything. Unfortunately, most of the missteps in this regard appear in the early stages of the picture, because after about twenty minutes you plunged so deeply into yourself that you would not know about it if a bomb had exploded behind you. <br /> <br /> The next thing you notice ... or maybe you notice this a few hours or days after the end of the film is that you have never seen any significant plot, however the themes and the poetry of dialogue and characters never leave you. In fact, the interpretation of the role that the race plays in the daily life of these characters is always present, but it is so ephemeral that even they do not realize how it informs them about themselves, their self-awareness, their perceived status, or the fate of their relationship. <br /> <br /> The title fits because you get a full range of black, white and gray ... and not just in the pigmentation of the skin of the characters. Leila Goldoni (really wonderful here) - an African American / Caucasian, her two brothers - an African American of white and dark color. The irony is that they exist in what is undoubtedly the "most hip" the most tolerant atmosphere of that time ... controlled by the bat riding east-west of Manhattan ... and there are still conflicts inside and around themselves. <br /> <br /> I don’t think I’ve ever seen a movie with such a fine delivery or technique. It’s like absorbing a truly remarkable artwork from the gallery, and then just bliss when you recall the images she evoked a few days later. <br /> <br /> Excellent mastering and additions on the Criterion disc. Perhaps this is the first truly experimental independent film.
