Disney, Jean Hackman. <br /> <br /> DOUG: In the end, our Odyssey resumes in earnest the first sound film by Greta Garbo, a simple exploration of characters called Anna Christie. Miss Garbo's excellent performance, which immediately showed that her talents could be transferred from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent works, but Netflix does not seem to supply them. How strange). Again and again I noticed how the Swedish accent sounds, how replacing the letter J with the sound of Y. Anna turns out to be the only character I liked; I really didn’t care about her estranged father or her potential suitor. It seems that recording systems are getting better (no one is inclined to talk with a riddle), but the camera is still not moving. We will definitely ensure that this changes as our odyssey continues. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Our first film of the 1930s is the first sound film of silent starlet Greta Garbo, Anna Christie. This is a very simple film, in which there are only about five different places where we have long sections of the film lasting 89 minutes, often with a static camera. It was great to see Marie Dressler in sound as well, and quite funny, because what we hear is an endless chain of hearty but drunk spots. I really enjoyed Garbo’s performance because it supports the film even in the most winding moments. I didn’t like George Marion or Charles Bickford very much, perhaps because I didn’t sympathize with any of them, so I was excited and excited when Anna finally stood up for herself and showed them that she “didn’t belong” to any of them. her estranged father or her muscular Irish guy. It is also nice to see that the famous silent screenwriter Francis Marion did not miss a single step, going from silence to sound. <br /> <br /> Last viewed movie: Speedy (1928). The last film in chronological order: Parade of Love (1929). Next film: The Blue Angel (1930).
