As a native of the city where the story unfolds, Buffalo, New York, itâ€™s very interesting to see local sites, but the storyline is just as local and funny! <br /> <br /> A small advertisement for this film requires a strong word of mouth in order to achieve the wide viewing it deserves. Please make this movie a success so that there is a big, fat Greek wedding.
