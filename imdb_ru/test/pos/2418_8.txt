I thought this movie was great if you don’t take it too seriously. Just relax and enjoy Hilary Swank in all its glory and laugh when the monks go to Boston, Massachusetts. I also think that in this film there is a great idea about self control and inner strength. Besides, Mr. Mägi was so cute that I would like to teach me karate!
