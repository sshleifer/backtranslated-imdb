This completely forgotten slasher film is one of the best horror films ever made. Very dark, sometimes he reminds me of the slightly famous thriller “Liberation”. Directed by Jeff Lieberman creates an amazing atmosphere of horror and despair. All actors are worthy, and the climax is really exciting and memorable. So if you are looking for something creepy, try to find this little treasure. My personal rating: 10 out of 10. PS This one is even more frightening than Halloween.
