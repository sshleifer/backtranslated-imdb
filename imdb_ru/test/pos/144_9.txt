The priest in deep love and suffering showed not the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has the spiritual beauty of a person (or a vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/ <br /> <br /> And the love of a femme fatale is not notorious, but beautiful, taking responsible death for a vampire. She did not continue to fall deep into the lost paradise, but decided to leave the man alone. Fragile, but sweet Femme fatale! This film made me think about the suffering between man and a vampire, which is far beyond the priest, and about salvation. I also thought about love. Adam was not so responsible for Eve, but this Adam (priest), sacrificial and responsible, to take Eve from Lost Paradise, the world of vampires. Another symphonic poem about Adam and Eve, Lost Paradise.
