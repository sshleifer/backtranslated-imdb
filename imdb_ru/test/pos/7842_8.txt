Here you see Mr. Eastwood in all his glory (i.e., at the top of his form as an actor and at the peak of his physical attractiveness), but the depicted "ladies" are hardly typical of the South, then or now. The young girls in the boarding school are incredibly naive, some of them are showing signs of becoming really depraved women, and Geraldine Page, completely bloated in her corruption, hardly represents an average when it comes to the main mistresses of girls' schools, then or now (This does not mean that there is no bad apple in any barrel.) Mr. Eastwood said that this is one of his two favorite films. <br /> <br /> “The Deceived” has an Original plot, many attractive characters and many surprises for the viewer. It is completely exciting and interesting, but not exactly realistic. (I know that I grew up in the south and attended school and college for girls. Moreover, I was familiar with countless girls who did the same, not to mention their easygoing teachers, or, you can even say, “repressed professors "." Which were far from the depicted director here.) She is absolutely ridiculous in her image of a gentle southern woman who does not look exactly as she seems. <br /> <br /> This film was a bit outrageous when I first appeared and is still there, I think, but you won’t regret taking the time to watch it.
