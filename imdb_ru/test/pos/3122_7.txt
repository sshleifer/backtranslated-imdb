By 1950, John Ford had already fully developed the ideas and motives that would form the basis of his most successful westerns. For example, there is always a strong sense of community, most keenly captured in the family of Joads Steinbeck "Grapes of Wrath" (1940). In these communities, even among Ford’s higher themes of racism and the pioneer spirit, there is always room for less human interactions, minor friendships and novels that make life worthy of life. "Wagon Master (1950)" appeared after Ford released the first two films in his "cavalry" trilogy ?? "Fort Apache (1948)" and "She wore a yellow ribbon (1949)" ?? and it covers a similar territory, but without a military perspective and, even worse, with a strong leadership from John Wayne. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. are great actors, but they think that they have to play a minor role to someone, and the damned Mormon elder Ward Bond, who is potentially a candidate for such a role, is not being given enough attention. to satisfactorily meet all requirements. <br /> <br /> In Wagon Master, Ford seems so pleased with his proven Western formula that any character development is largely obscured. Ben Johnson’s romance with Joann Drew is perceived as a commitment to more than anything else, and the charming Mormon girl Harry Carey Jrare is so careless that he almost does not exist in the final film, leaving one to think about the survival of distant scenes. Only in the charismatic and shamelessly villainous uncle Shilo Charles Kemper Ford is trying to do something else, and it works, even though he is surrounded by a squad of unbearably cheeky needles with jaws. Where does Ford succeed in organizing a conglomerate of three different American races? value-oriented morm, calm horse traders, an eccentric traveling showman ?? into a cohesive community of pioneers seeking a bright future. This apparent harmony is confused about the appearance of uncle Shiloh's criminals who exploit the lawlessness of the western border, but ultimately lose to noble cowboys who "only ever attracted snakes." <br /> <br /> Ford was reportedly considered “The Master of the Carriages” to be one of his favorite films, and perhaps this is somehow connected with the absence of such big names as John Wayne or Henry Fonda. Armed only with a set of his usual players, Ford is able to create a sense of community, avoiding focusing on any one character, although most of Mormom’s travelers still remain completely anonymous. Despite the fact that he is undoubtedly well made, I cannot help but feel that this film does better than other Ford pictures, even better: the stunning grandeur of the western border was more beautifully presented in “She wore a yellow ribbon”; romances and friendly quarrels among members of the community became more noticeable in Fort Apache; early relations with Native Americans, which are only hinted at here, were discussed in more detail in Quest (1956); The bold, innovative spirit of the first settlers was explored more touchingly (although Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) in his book How the West Wins (1962). Wagon Master is a pure John Ford, but this is not a milestone.
