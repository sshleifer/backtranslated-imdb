I was fascinated by the Niami debut. I hope we will see more of his work soon. I was lucky to catch the film during its short run in New York, and it seemed to me a worthy successor of such films in the center of the 80s, like “Desperately Looking for Susan” and “After an Hour”, but with a gentle European whim that made it fresh and fun. A strong ensemble playing mostly against the font was a pleasure. And I thought the complex interlaced areas were correct. Sandra Bernhard shows her best performance since the days of King of Comedy, while Peter Stormare is hilarious, and Lin Bai is touching. See it.
