One of the greatest movies ever made. The play of Charles Buchinsky (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown of the career of director Winner, who was often quoted as saying that this is his masterpiece. The plot was copied many times, but was never surpassed. Wildey J. Moore, a manufacturer of weapons, has repeatedly declared the growth of its brand since the mid-80s, and it can be easily attributed to DW3. This is not just a film, it is an art that many generations will admire and appreciate. Although this film has never been fully appreciated in the USA, it has found a huge number of fans in Europe and Asia, where the film is regularly shown in film schools, and it is still popular in student theaters throughout Europe. In general, a real classic.
