So now it is a bit obsolete, almost 30 years old. Surprisingly, I have it on a beta cassette and it still plays just fine. If it came to a DVD, I would have captured it right away. <br /> <br /> Currently, drug humor is not valued as it was then. Then it was not so "harmful." Very similar to driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. I remember how my father wept, he laughed so hard, watching this. In the 90s, I had colleagues who saw this, and I could upset them by taking the intercom and saying “Iiiiiiiivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy” <br /> <br /> Gorgeous features, a great deception of the original, and in any case funny even three decades later!
