I'm not sure that these other people saw the film - some obviously could not follow the “complex plot”. He is a billionaire who owns an oil company that ALSO happens with a big game hunt — wow — it's really contrived. In any case, his new “drilling machine” breaks through the glacier, and on the other hand it is a world separated from our time, when dinosaurs and cavemen roam around. There is nothing fundamental in this, but this, of course, is not funny. In any case, the rest of the movie about this T-Rex, which they find (who, as billionaire Bun claimed, was there), hunt them, and they hunt him. Listen, this is an old-fashioned film for television - of course, the special effects look stupid - they didn't have computer graphics - they did everything they could, and for MFTVM they did a hell of a job at that time. This film should be redone for a big screen - I would really like it, and I would be the first in line. Seeing a dinosaur with modern special effects chasing these guys would be great!
