If it was done 2 years later, it would be FORBIDDEN! Number one MUST SEE the recommendation of the day! The best Ruben Mamulian film that I have seen so far (but have not yet seen J + H). <br /> <br /> No wonder why this film won less than 200 votes. A large gray area that does not care about what is right will not be seen again until the 60s. Moral ambiguous and dark, like the sand of the 70s, but with a certain charm. Of course, this should have gone in the late 30s, and, unfortunately, it seems that it was not reopened. <br /> <br /> Seriously. It all worked out. Great actors: Gary Cooper, Sylvia Sidney and Guy Kibby. And a very good director. Until now, I was not a big fan of the Republic of Moldova, but I really liked his films, and with this he enters a new league. One of the best movies of the 30s, which I have ever seen! This is something that I never thought would even exist! 9.5 / 10
