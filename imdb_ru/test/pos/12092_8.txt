This is a great documentary, and the above comments provide a brief summary of how great it was, so I will not repeat the same compliments. But Faith, who looks like a guy focused on Turkey, who probably knows more about this country than a normal European, falls into the trap of orientalism, which is usually followed by other Western artists. But come on, man, you are Turkish blooded, and your film could be deeper and could describe what is outside the “old city of Beyoglu”. For this reason, for Akin missed opportunity. The performances of Museen Senar and Orhan Genchbey look from the film, and Cesa (a very talented and poor Turkish rapper) makes some dirty talk about American gangster rappers, with which I fully agree. I will recommend this film to my American friends.
