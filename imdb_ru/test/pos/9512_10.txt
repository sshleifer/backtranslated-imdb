I do not know what Dick Steele was talking about, but I found this film one of Japan’s most exciting epics to date. As for Armageddon or Deep Impact, or in this respect the Day after tomorrow is pale in comparison. From what I know about films, most of the disasters in films are mainly due to mill asteroids or one of them - because of global warming. This, as always, ran the other way. The natural course means that the crust begins to collapse to such an extent that the trip will require another piece of land. Scientific groups had to create a way for erosion not to go far and not to sink Japan as a whole. In most cases, this can be called a tectonic shift on steroids. I found the characters quite attractive in all respects, from a child who lost his mother just to face her own death among unfamiliar friends. Or a rescue girl who does her best to save lives in the face of disaster. Or a person who thought that he could change his mind so as not to be such a brave devil and go with him to a safe place, only to become a hero himself and save his homeland. And let's not forget how the rest of the world just threw them all back to forget them, forcing the world to turn away from the Japanese citizens who called for help. It was a great movie in all aspects. Dick is trying to say that this film was not made by Hollywood, that it was made in Japan, that there are characters in it that compete with other actors around the world, that the effects are very great, as he mentioned, but that's all he was waiting for , and nothing else. He lacks a vision of what is important for everyone, and why this film has all the elements of feelings, greatness and humanity. I thought this movie was upscale, and I saw a lot of disaster films to know that “The Sinks of Japan” may have been one of the most original and well-designed projects I have seen. I really hope that Shinji Higuchi will make another such movie. Yes, and by the way, I am not Japanese, although in many respects I would like me to be. I am Canadian, born and raised. And an avid movie lover in all aspects. Biased vision is bitter and not worth the effort to be recognized as an opinion. Dick, you have to watch it with a more open heart and mind, and not just look for candy, which makes the content of films, look for what is more important, and understand it. They may not be Americans, but recently the Japanese have driven the market into a corner in order to make one of the most exciting and believable filming today breathtaking. That's why spending 25,000,000 is what the doctor ordered. You heard correctly, 25,000,000 to make this film. Now, you tell me, was it worth it? or was it worth it because there were no american actors in it?
