amazing !! in simple words ... both Aparna Sen and Concon Sen seem to understand each other well, or maybe both are too good. It may just be her best performance as an actor and Aparnaya as a director. yes, maybe better than mr. and mrs. ayer. Concon plays the role of schizophrenic. Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali, Mitya's elder sister (Konkony Sen). Shabana Azmi made the best of Anjaliâ€™s character because she had to play the strong, responsible, arrogant role of an older sister who was solely responsible for her family. Aparna Sen handled the character of Anjali, a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life, her love for her family. <br /> <br /> Mitya's behavior was not at all juvenile, since you can expect this from most Indian directors for this role. It seems that a lot of research has been done to understand the role of Mitya, the schizophrenic. When at times Mitya is a normal, nice college girl, she also scares you when she is ill shown that both sides were beautifully rated and played .. Believe me, sometimes it reminds you of an Exorcist girl .. it's not scary, though In general .. The wonderful work of Aparna Sen, Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi ...
