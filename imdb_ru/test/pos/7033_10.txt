There was a conversation on E! Hollywood's peculiarity of dirty dancing, which many women, including my dear friend over fifty, is still considered one of her favorite films of all time. Maybe music, dancing or melodrama around the plot of Little Frances becomes a dance sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course, this film was set by Jennifer Gray, whose biggest role to date was the offended sister in Ferris Buller's Weekend. Patrick Swayze is playing the role of a lead man who literally sweeps a baby. Dirty dances have it all to be a Broadway or West End hit. It has a love story, music and, above all, a lot of dancing. Jennifer and Patrick could easily restore their roles. It's nice to see Jerry Orbach playing the doctor instead of the policeman, and Kelly Bishop the mother. All this happened in the Catskills in the sixties, when many Jewish families rested in the area during the summer holidays. At the end of the film, it’s sad to see that the hotel owner, Kellerman, will be confused by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and trips to Europe than to spend their summer in the Catskills. These old grand hotels are becoming Indian gaming casinos. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well. In the end, they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, it should be easy! I know that this film is one of the favorites that you will not get tired of after watching 800 times. There are people who have probably seen this film - already 1000 times. Somehow, observing the creation and history of “Dirty Dancing” made me miss my childhood when I was thirteen years old. Dirty dancing may not be the best movie ever, but its universal appeal still attracts crowds and regular viewers such as the 800 Club, whose members have watched it many times. Now I watch with love with all the awkwardness of the first days of the Kid and her first real love with Patrick Swayze, like a heartbeat, Johnny Castle. No one could imagine this small film a big hit with the music of the sixties, two soundtracks and even a tour in the late eighties. I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical. For viewers it would be useful to become part of the film. Not surprisingly, it still attracts children and even adults, especially women of all ages, to watch it again and again. Well, both in Australia and in London were the producers of Dirty Dancing. It seems that he will arrive on Broadway in 2007 in time for his 20th birthday.
