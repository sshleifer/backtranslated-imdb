I really liked this comedy. Will Smith does nothing slow. It's always on target with the greatest scripts and comedies that make you laugh and participate in the plot. You are watching an experienced comedian who plays all his roles well. One fully believes that he is the one he plays. I loved him and Tommy Lee Jones in People in Black. This comedy goes well with this film. Humor is moving fast, and Will Smith is as sure of himself as in “Men in Black”. Smart and well versed in the art of forcing others to score every time, but do it with taste and grace. <br /> <br /> Will Smith seems to have sharpened his comedy well. He was damn funny. I liked the part where he had an allergic reaction to what he was eating, and his face was swollen, and he looked more like Cassius Clay after the fight than he did. Then he saw him squeeze a bottle of Benadril, trying to get his head back to the right size. I was laughing like that. He knows how to make us all laugh.
