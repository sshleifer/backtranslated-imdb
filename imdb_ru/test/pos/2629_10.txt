I first saw this film at least thirty years ago, and it remains one of my favorites in history! This is a classic - an intriguing plot, great characters, a tense and shocking finale (all against the backdrop of the magnificent coast of Monterey / Big Sur) never get old. Roy Tinnes portrays Johnny Brant, a charming character who becomes more and more mysterious when his true personality is revealed. The game is great and believable; viewers find themselves in a network that develops between a workaholic husband, a disappointed wife and a tempting stranger (Thinnes as Brant). I have been looking for a copy to buy for many years - I think that television films are not released to video, unfortunately. Great movie, watch it if you can.
