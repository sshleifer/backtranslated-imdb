This film is definitely one of the best of its kind. The Epoch of Victorion is a story of love and grit. The depth of his storyline is the one that will cause most of the inner emotions of love and hate, with some very interesting twists, it should have a film not only for a lesbian audience, but for all viewers. I cannot say much more, or I will spoil the experience for a new, young audience that can just go out. Another great job for Sarah Waters. It is also a great way for Sally Hawkins to win an audience that only briefly introduces her talent in another work by Sarah Waters in Tippinge Velvet. This is also a must see ...
