This is without doubt the most exciting and satisfying film that I have seen in recent years! The plot shown in the press is almost banal - the ship falls on a deserted planet with three suns, the survivors have to adapt to the landscape and to each other, then darkness sets in and monsters appear. Pilot Fry, after some cowardice while descending through the atmosphere, when she almost dropped passengers, takes responsibility for the group and enlists the support of convicted murderer Riddick to lead them through the darkness to the rescue ship - he is the one with whom surgical eyes, can see in the dark. But in fact, everything is not so simple - every character is complex, three-dimensional, has contradictory features, so you never know who is good and who is bad. <br /> <br /> The performances are equally gorgeous - Radha Mitchell shows how Fry plays himself. for leadership, overcoming his own fears and trying to prevent further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, as the man who brings Riddick back into custody, shows that he has his own agenda and his own special standards. But the film belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the most attractive presence on the screen, which I have seen in recent years. For most of the movie, his face is in the shadows, and he doesn't really say much, but he still draws your attention. Sometimes he attracts your attention by not saying - or not moving. And Diesel does not trivialize the character, as it can be easily done by giving him a “golden heart” - Riddick is still one angry and angry person when they approach the ship - he just allows us to see these first test steps out of caring only about yourself, caring about others. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is very good. Light effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - bright triple sunlight and total darkness. Special effects, showing the point of view of both Riddick and monsters, add to uncertainty, as well as the sound effects of flying monsters and the use of ultrasound to "see" (the monsters themselves are anatomically believable and therefore frightening). Editing is so prolonged that sometimes it is almost shocking - there is literally no indenting in this film, no attenuation, no time to reorient. <br /> <br /> From the opening frame to the end of your credits, keep your mind to yourself. Every scene, every line of dialogue, every picture from the camera is important. Look three times to figure it all out. <br /> <br /> The only thing I want to say about science is that the solar system shown on the model is impossible (the planets revolve around the suns, and not vice versa). However, this does not affect the history of mankind, so I do not withdraw points for it.
