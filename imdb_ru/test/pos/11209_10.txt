Probably a year has passed since I saw Uzak, but he left strong memories of the two main characters, the exhausted photographer Mahmut and his naive cousin from the village of Yusuf. <br /> <br /> This is a long film with very little dialogue and a rather limited plot. This clearly annoyed a lot of viewers. But the film creates such a painfully believable portrait of Makhmut and Yusuf that there is as much emotional tension in it as in the most silent thriller. <br /> <br /> Just to be clear, there is no indenting in this film — in the long run, pauses in which no one speaks, as many emotions of the characters (and yours watching them) as you could bear. See how he woke up and on his guard, and you will be caught, not anesthetized. <br /> <br /> Uzak rings true in many ways, and this sincerity is probably his greatest achievement. People are not so much struggling with events and problems, as with each other. In fact, there is probably not a single point in the whole film where the main characters (Mahmut, Yusuf and ex-wife of Mahmut Nazan) are not opposed. <br /> <br /> Much of this is true all over the world: the country may have a deliberately naive expectation of his cousin Yusuf that work on the ship will fall to his knees; Mahmut's urbanized cynicism and unwillingness to sympathize with Yusuf. <br /> <br /> Other truths are more specific to Turkey: Yusuf’s misunderstanding that Mahmut can tolerate his stay with gritted teeth; Yusuf turns between macho ambition and awkwardness with wide eyes when he tries to get acquainted with a woman. <br /> <br /> Uzak is undoubtedly a rather gloomy film, and one of them’s strengths are not about hitting us on the head with the topics he explores. At least for me, I fully believed in the behavior of my characters. All the little failed attempts to unite and the petty cruelties sound so true. And yet I did not leave with the message that “the world is such,” but instead I received “This is how we sometimes treat each other.”
