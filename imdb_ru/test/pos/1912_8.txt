Being a little rubbish connoisseur, I stumbled upon this little treasure. Action, romance, crooks, violence. Everything is here and none was right. I was in love right away. Then a funny thing happened the second time. I became addicted. I thought it would be a “roll and chuckle” movie. <br /> <br /> Rudy Ray Moore knew what he wanted to see in the movies. He had no money to make it look good, but he did it anyway. This is very commendable. It also shows that he was making a film for himself. I don’t know how many of you have heard Rudy Ray’s music, but if not, he has a whole series of albums reaching the fifties.
