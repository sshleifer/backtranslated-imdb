I have to admit, I did not expect it to be as good as it was. I also did not expect that Samuel L. Jackson would also play on the slide and sing in blue. <br /> <br /> Cinemark of Beaver County PA does it often. They advertise films in the lobby, make you admire watching, and then disappoint you with not showing them ... <br /> <br /> I expected that with such a wonderful actor Jackson, Ricci and even the former N'Sinser ( Timberlake) that this film was at least shown in a week. But no, at that time, if I remember correctly, MI3 was shown on 3 screens (this or that type of blockbuster). <br /> <br /> Like The Blues Brothers and Crossroads, this film includes the mystery and legend of what blues music is Passion and hard times. Religion and Sex. Hell hounds past. Redemption. I mean, so many elements go to the blues. <br /> <br /> It was a good story. Of course, few people see this, because there are no pirates or swinging spiders in it. But he has Samuel L. Jackson ... <br /> <br /> Think about what happens to Jackson's character in Pulp Fiction after he walks the earth and calms down, and this is, in fact, describes it as a "t". <Br /> <br /> Great and underestimated, but isn't everything so good?
