One night, when the channel switched, I just caught the beginning of this movie, and it hooked me from the very beginning. It tells the sad story of an adopted Adam, whose mother left him after birth. The film takes us to childhood and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from the past of Adam. I will not disclose more, but this is a very deep film that will surely intrigue you. It was one of the best roles Jimmy Smith in my opinion.
