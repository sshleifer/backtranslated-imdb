This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time, Rowan Atkinson is just a genius!, And it is fitting that I chose this to be my 1000 review! I cannot begin to say how much I love Mr. Bean, he is a man, and what amazes me is how he gets out of these incredibly difficult situations, and he is always so creative, plus Robin Driscoll also deserves praise! he is also a genius! My favorite part he did was “Mr. Bean’s Amazing Adventures,” and although the rest of them are amazing, this remains my real favorite, and I would like the show to not stop so soon! ". Each episode is brilliantly written, and they were all masterfully filmed, plus Each episode is a classic in my eyes! This show is incredibly popular, and I definitely understand why, as this is probably the funniest show ever. The actors of all the characters played their roles very well there, especially Robin Driscoll and Matilda Ziegler (like Irma). This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. Rowan Atkinso is simply a genius and an incredibly talented comedian (perhaps the best!), And it is entirely appropriate that I chose this to be my 1000 review if you have not seen it. Show me what you are doing and go check it out. sorry, believe me, this is one of the best tv shows in history! And I will continue to watch this show over and over again, I never get tired! Mr Bean Rules! ***** out of 5
