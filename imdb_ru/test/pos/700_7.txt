It's just good western style, not too complicated or long. He does not deceive himself, thinking that it was done, but for fun. However, this is one of those westerns that you can watch once and end without returning. It involves former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford, whose friendship is strong, despite the fact that Ford Cheyenne Rogers was involved in a bank robbery (he even stole Sheriff's horse Stevet Upton Scott, not knowing that he was his good friend whom he was stealing) . In the Red Valley, Upton is under scrutiny due to a bank robbery, which killed several people. Claire Trvor portrays Countess Malette, a Cheyenne girlfriend who gives him and Nitro's friend (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams) a place to sleep. Cheyenne wants to go straight, but it's hard when Jack Leicester (Bernard Nedell) and his bad team want to rob a Red Valley bank. In fact, Jack is behind the killings, but Cheyenne is hard to get away from the problem past. He and Nitro will be charged with the killings that they did not commit (the robbery was the one the Cheyenne did not commit), and it will be Upton, who must somehow save the day before Lester leaves with the murder. There are minor plots in which Cheyenne falls in love with Alison MacLeod (Evelyn Case); the irony is that Alison's father, Uncle Willie, is actually in collusion with Banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) in a planned joint theft with Leicester to steal from the city mining of the Red Valley}. Will Upton be able to uncover the insidious scheme of Uncle Willie and the banker of Canton? Will Uncle Willie be able to get through this without distracting his conscience? This movie has an awesome bar fight and dandy from the climax shootout. Colombia may not have chosen the best genre to begin the coloring process, as this film has some excellent mountain shots, as men pursue astride and the like. Don't expect your socks to be torn off, but the film is simple and well thought out.
