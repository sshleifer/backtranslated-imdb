Waking up to sleep because of loneliness, Lestat wakes up from a 100-year-old sleep to the sounds of new music, part of which he wants to become, and the group "The Vampire Lestat" is born. His desire to end loneliness and his attitude to life in the light along with the music, the wrath of his fellow vampires and the awakening of evil, which has lasted for thousands of years. <br /> <br /> This film is not for those who are looking for a real adaptation of the book to the film. Those who read the books and expects to see them on the screen, waiting for a huge disappointment. This movie will appeal to those who really enjoyed the movie "Interview with the Vampire." <br /> <br /> There are several holes and inconsistencies in the story, but overall this film was satisfactory. Stuart Townsend portrays Lestat with sensuality and sexuality, which are not in the previous film. The relationship described in the film was very sexy and hot. <br /> <br /> Like a movie, the story draws you and attracts you. Casting is great. Loved this story and the film. If you like boiling sensuality and sexual tension, you will love this movie!
