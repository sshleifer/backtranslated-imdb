I like this film, because each of its elements is nothing but a great one. I quickly praise some of them. Peter O'Toole gives us one of his great speeches when he becomes a real Mr. Chips. Petula Clark, has a beautiful voice and is beautiful as Katharina. The director was able to bring the plot to the screen in a new way. Combine this with fantastic and creative cinematography, editing, writing, etc., and you have a film that shows the excellent quality of its production. I can't praise the well-planned camera work, it moves us up and back, zooming in and out, giving us better views and allowing locations to become part of the scene. The last song of Petula Clark “You and Me” is just 3 beautifully composed long takes, and in this era of two-second takes, I can appreciate the extra care that all participants had to apply to make these long scenes perfect. The music is great, and the songs promote the story as they should. Leslie Bricuss is one of my favorite composers. Listen to these songs, how can someone not love them? This is a very romantic story between two middle-aged people who find each other, reveal the best in themselves, and this continues until the end of their lives. Excellent production quality, acting, cinematography and music make this film worth seeing.
