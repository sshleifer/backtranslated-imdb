Just saw this movie the other day at the Santa Fe Film Festival. I was delighted with his honesty and humor. It was the most provocative film I have seen in a very long time - I just can't get it out of my head for some reason. It may not be for everyone, because it makes you think. I don’t know if people like to think more in movies, and that’s a shame. The actors who play Franklin are a real find. I could not imagine these difficult people playing with such frankness. Although I thought that a couple of characters playing a minor role are not as good as Franklins, I can completely forgive this, because this is an important film, in my opinion this for several days, it turned out to be very important entertainment.
