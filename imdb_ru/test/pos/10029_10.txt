I first watched the film “They died in boots”, somewhere in 1970, and although many years have passed since then, this film and his impression remain. The shooting was good and excellent, and the main character was truly heroic. When I first saw this film I knew that the wisest and only real state of affairs was to enjoy this film as inspirational entertainment, and then something else. Then I felt that even now I feel that the Silver Screen as such does not give a true picture of much of that, not to mention the life of George Armstrong Custer, however, director Raul Walsh had to contribute to the real value presented in this film when I I watched a semi-documentary film with other great directors, such as Vincent Mennelli, in which these central figures spoke of their achievements with valuable commentaries that gave insight into Hollywood thinking. This is what I thought was interesting, and where it all became terribly interesting and very pleasant. However, so much was done because of the silver screen and its ability to tell stories, that part of the pleasure was lost, and you might find that this is also true here. Caster took 34th place in the senior class ... 34. Much of the final ranking was made of Caster, but of the 68 cadets who entered the Military Academy in 1857, half of them had already quit or left for the day of graduation, 24 June 1861 . This is proposed in the film, as the various instructors determine the soldier to be commanded, and then they meet with the name of George Armstrong Custer, and there will most likely be an exchange between the two sides, and this is where the Sergeant on duty speaks in an almost quiet voice, even suggesting that happened by chance "His squadron will follow him to hell." Your attentive Sargent, articulates the tape. If I am not mistaken when Flynn appears on the initial battlefield, he recognizes that Caster did not see the action immediately, and indeed he did work as a reliable attache not only for Sheridan, but for Hancox’s strength only to turn up for some time in the Army of the Potomac under the command of General George McClellan. In the impudence attributed to the heroic battle of Custers, there is a grain of truth that is illustrated in the counterattack - young Custer pushed his horse to the leadership and bravely plunged into the environment of the stunned Confederates. Like a lone Union Soldier surrounded by rebels, Custer's courage shone through. He accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers, including the rebel captain. The action he personally captured the very first battle flag of the Confederation, adopted by the Potomac army. This conspicuous act of courage marked him as an officer of great promise on the battlefield. Robert L. Bateman-general-chair. There is a problem here, and this is telling the story and the truth about George Armstrong Custer, history is good Hollywood entertainment, perhaps even great entertainment, but for some reason, all that could be said is changes for entertainment purposes. Although it might be jumping from a pistol, it would be nice to know that Tom Custer should have lost his life in the Little Big Horn, just a few steps from where George Custer was to die. They were brothers and Tom Custer still makes an honorable distinction, being among a very small group, perhaps only 3 others who were twice awarded the Medal of Honor for their military career. The list of battles that the movie shows shows that Caster really was an active young officer. He was not with the Union forces either at Chancellorsville, or for that matter at Fredericksburg, but he was with them in the Battle of Antietam, and at that time he was actually appointed captain by General McClellan, but it was not for long. McClellan was soon to be replaced because of the historical fact that the Army of the Potomac had the means and information (found wrapped around some cigars were General Lee's plans to divide his forces), and yet he had to act for 17 hours. It can be assumed that the war could have ended then, and there it happened, but when McClellan could not act, President Lincoln changed him forever, and as a result the promotion was lost. Caster's biggest win could actually happen in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. His forces, which in the summer of 1863 occupied an area called the cemetery ridge, on the Gettysburg field, were able to defeat Jeb Stewart's cavalry under the leadership of about 6,000 insurgents, but with a strength of 2,300. I think that the heroism in Gettysburg Custer deserves some discussion. There are rumors in the film that the appointment of Custers was a mistake, it is good that it is better to guess again, because Caster has not only people in his corner, but he submitted a petition to submit to the Governor of Michigan, who, by the way, was relatively new to the Union Affairs and where preparing for the formation of cavalry regiments. Despite the fact that Caster was strictly warned for such a Shenanigan, when he discovered in everything that the golden braid was not by chance, as you are forced to believe. In truth, the protection of Custers in Gettysburg forbade Jeb Stewart to dine in the rear stores of the trade unions and vitally defended this flank. happened, and it was timed to coincide with Picketts Charge, to ensure the greatest likelihood of success. It was a critical victory, and Custer was braver and better than anyone. His people followed him to hell and lived to talk about it.
