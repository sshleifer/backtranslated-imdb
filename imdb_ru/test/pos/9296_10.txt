For comedy to work, you need to take into account many factors: <br /> <br /> 1. Do not be afraid to take risks. 2. If someone or something deserves to poke fun at him, do it and keep doing it, <br /> <br /> ... but most of all: <br /> <br /> 3. BE FUN !!!! <br /> <br /> “War of persecutors in all” will be crowned with success in all these three aspects. In fact, the show turned out to be so popular and funny that just a few months after its first release, the first season DVD was released. I picked it up for a few days after it was released, and with a laugh fell to the floor, and I had so many tears in my eyes - this is good, good! <br /> <br /> In short, to save me from talking about the show - look, buy, podcast, whatever makes you watch the best show in the world !!!!! <br /> <br /> Go to CHASER !!!!
