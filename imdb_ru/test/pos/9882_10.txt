This film is well made, it is beautiful and wise. It is heartbreaking. It is great. And again it shows how big Peter Falk is ... he is fantastic, and he even gets better, the older he gets! Thank you, Peter Falk! Thanks so much for this gem of the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is entertaining. There is a lot of wisdom in this movie. There is a lot of humor in this movie. This film has life ... and meaning. This film shows what life can be. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk in this film. He's just great! Where is Oscar for Peter Falk? He really deserves it. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk has just turned 80 years old. I sincerely hope there will be more films! <br /> <br /> Walter J. Langbein
