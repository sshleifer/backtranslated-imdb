Oh my god, it was a fantastic movie. Every time we look, he takes us to another “WOW” place. Rhett and Scarlett brilliantly played by Joan and Timothy. They did a fantastic job redefining the roles of our two favorite characters. Each! This is a must see ..... Do not deprive yourself of this film. If you loved Gone With The Wind, you will love this mini-series. Go Rhett !!! Go Scarlett !!!
