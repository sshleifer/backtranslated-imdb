For people who are disgusted with blood, it may seem that some scenes are difficult, but “The Thing” is far from just a classic of horrors. The fact that unusual special effects confront most of today's CGI is only a small part of why this film is finally considered a masterpiece. Technically brilliant in camera and editing, great scripts and actions, one of the best discoveries, one of the best endings, tension and paranoia, supported everywhere (with countless views), an excellent soundtrack, open to many readings and analogies is simply not enough superlatives to make this movie fair. Absolutely required viewing.
