Haynes is great as a defiant cadet who thinks West Point really means something now when he arrives. Haynes shows his light, silly comic persona when he takes on West Point and Joan Crawford, a local beauty. Great fun for the first half. And surprisingly touching after the character Haynes goes too far and almost avoids other cadets. New, filled with humility, Haynes gets a minute respite to play a football game against the Navy and, despite a broken hand, wins the game. MGM’s superb, exciting entertainment in this film about Haynes’s formula shows Billy at his best. William Bakewell is also considered a thin follower. A beautiful but stupid character will be played by Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and others in the coming decades, another example of the beautiful but insane ladies played by Carol Lombard and Marion Davis. West Point is a winner!
