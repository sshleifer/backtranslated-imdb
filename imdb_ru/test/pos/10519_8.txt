I tried to remember the name of this film over the years. Finally, read something today, September 3, 2005, which mentions the name Stacy Keach, and it reminded me that I saw a movie that he starred in 1974 at the Atlanta Film Festival, so I did a Google search for Keach films. and found the Train Sauce. We had to see Duddy Kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they couldn’t show it, and instead replaced “Sauce”. We were terribly disappointed that we could not see the much-promoted Duddy Kravitz, heard nothing about the “Sauce Train” and did not hear anything about it. <br /> <br /> However, I remember we were pleasantly surprised at how good the film was, and, as I recall, it was quite humorous. I would like to find it on tape.
