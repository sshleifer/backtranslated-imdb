Having long despised network television programs, I remember the first time I caught the episode "Police Squad!" It was completely random. This was during the initial network show on ABC in early 1982. I am a chronic channel surfer and switched the dial one evening when the introductory “Police Squad!” Credit sequence suddenly appeared on my TV screen. I immediately found out that it was the M-Squad start-up title with Lee Marvin, one of my favorite police shows. I stopped surfing. Then, of course, came the headquarters, which was shot, followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln. By now I was saying to myself: "What the hell is IT ??". Then came the special guest star Georg Stanford Brown, huddled from a falling safe. I am addicted from now on. The episode was “The Ring of Fear / Dangerous Task” with its comic references to “On the Embankment” and “Muhammad Ali”, but the most memorable, of course, are all the spectacles and not the sequesters. Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their free parody of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of M Squad were an absolute riot. “Finally,” I said to myself, “The network television program is really worth watching !!!” Didn't you know that it would be canceled in just a few weeks. Leave it to the networks — I should have known. Anyway, I just bought a DVD collection of all six episodes, and they are just as funny today as they were 27 years ago. The Naked Cannon films were also awesome, but I really missed Alan North (he was as good as Ed Hoken), Peter Lupus as Nordberg (what did they think about playing OJ in this piece?), And especially Johnny William Duell " Johnny "Cleaner. Quality product.
