This is a witty and delightful adaptation of Dr. Suze’s book, brilliantly animated by the most beautiful UPA and deserving Academy Award. Special mention should be made of the excellent music and sound effects, which are an essential element in creating such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon. Later episodes in the series (there were four in all) were not actually based on Dr. Suze’s original material, although all but the last one continued to use his familiar rhyming style. Three sequels were: Gerald Mac Boeing's Boeing Symphony (1953); As now Boing Boing (1954); Gerald McBoing Boeing on the planet Mu (1956) - although he also appeared in a later episode of Mr. Magu.
