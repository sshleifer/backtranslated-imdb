Kaper Mevill's film is not as good as its most famous film, the exquisitely stylish Samurai (1968). I do not even think that this is the best example of a favorite genre of robbery. The main thing against the film is its duration. Mevill has a tendency to concentrate on too many trivial details. He could tell the same story in a relatively short time, but for reasons I don’t understand, the film seems to go on and on. However, the film is never boring. Melville's management impressed me, and the cast is very good, especially Alain Delon as a very "tough" master thief. A color photo, which you definitely need to see, is a big advantage, and Melville is very effective at using sound (or lack thereof). From a technical point of view, the film is almost flawless. Sometimes there is a feeling that Meville just boasts, but when someone is as talented as him, he has little reason to complain. I still like other films with robberies (“Topkapi (1964)” by Jules Dassin, just to name one), but one cannot deny that this film is good entertainment and a good example of what people call as “cool” cinema.
