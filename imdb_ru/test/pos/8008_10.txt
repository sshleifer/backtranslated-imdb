Of all the Bat movies, The Return of Batman is my favorite. This beautiful, dark and funny movie is one of the best works of Tim Burton. Although it is much more brutal and dark, it is Batman, whom Bob Kane had foreseen many years ago. Michael Keaton repeats his role as the avenger of Gotham City. This time he is against two deadly enemies, Penguin Danny DeVito and Cats Michelle Pfeiffer. A film with a great cast and a Danny Elfman film allows us to go on an adventure when Batman battles the evil forces that are trying to capture Gotham City. Christopher Walken looks great like Max Shrek, an astute businessman who has an evil scheme in his sleeve. But, of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who steals the show. With all these components, you have a film that will amaze you. This is the reason why you go to the movies. He has it all. It really is a shame that Tim Burton could not direct other sequels. If so, then I think the franchise will still be strong today. The return of Batman - a terrific experience for fans who love great movies.
