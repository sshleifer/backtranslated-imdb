If you like Madonna or not, this movie is hilarious! I'm a fan of Madonna and saw it in the theater during its release. However, over time, he did not lose his stupidity and pure fun. Of course, there are some bad lines and a stupid game, but the whole movie is just a comedy with Madonna, which actually carries the whole movie with a huge bombardment. She is cute, funny and the only comedy role in her film career. Madonna usually just plays "herself" in the roles, but looking at her like Nikki Finn in this film, she really seems like someone else this time. Of course, the film was made by James Fowley (who was filmed in a dramatic and memorable “At Close Distance” with Sean Penn and Christopher Walken) and colleagues in the film Griffin Dunn (“After Workday”), who also played brilliantly and played with the material. There is nothing ingenious in this story, and do not expect any climatic ending, but if you ever want to see a fun, clean, noisy game of the 80s, or if you are a Madonna fan, then it is MANDATORY to SEE. The soundtrack is also very remarkable and contains 4 songs by Madonna: hit No. 1 “Who’s That Girl”, hit No. 2 “Causing A Commotion” and the beautiful and one of her best balla ever “The Look of Love” '(Top 10 “Hit in the UK "and" Can't Stop "(" I can not stop "), left a pop song from the sessions" True BLue "a year earlier. It is only for VHS, but will soon be available on DVD.
