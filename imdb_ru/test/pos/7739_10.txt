What will be Prospero in the twentieth century, what is his life? Why do men need to choose to live on the island with their daughter and girlfriend? Because in the "civilization" it is too difficult to live and love in good conditions. This man (John Cassavetes) is a heart-broken giant; he can command a storm. He has strength, strength, but he is a man. Deep love for life is the subject of this unusual film. The acting is incredible, of course, the whole genius of John Cassavetes, Gena Rowlands, Vittorio Gasman, Shakespeare and Paul Mazursky. do not miss, it will be a mistake, this film is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. And I saw a lot of movies.
