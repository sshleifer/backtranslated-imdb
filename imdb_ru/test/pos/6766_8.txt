This film is a mixture of dark comedy and drama about two guys who worked in a butcher shop and wanted to create their own. When they finally realized this dream, they faced a new problem: there were no customers! One day, by chance, one guy dies in the fridge, and a new kind of meat business starts ?? They start selling human flesh, telling customers it's just chicken ?? and their business starts to improve: human flesh sells well! Oh! I forgot to say something ?? These guys are not normal! Something is missing in their brains! <br /> <br /> In the film there are several scenes with somber humor, but, in my opinion, this is mainly drama. One that shows us what is inside the head of a psychopath, what are his motives for what he is doing. I have to admit that I was a little surprised at the end of the film, because I never expected that they could do it without opening, but this is probably because I see too many Hollywood films ?? By this I mean that in Hollywood movies we always expect punishment for guys who commit “bad deeds”. Is there always a moral that protects “good values”, despite the fact that we all know that in “real life” this doesn’t happen too often ?? And I liked this film mainly because of this, because it fits into a kind of cinema, which is true, frontal, without false morals, and which “sees” what is on the other side, beyond “ordinary morality” ?? This happens in an independent cinema (especially in Europe)! <br /> <br /> Also, are there any great performances by Nicholas Lee Kass and Mads Mikkelsen (especially the first one) in the roles of "anxious guys" ?? <br /> <br /> Very good Danish film!
