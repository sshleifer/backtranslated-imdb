There are very few films that can tell such a complex story on so many levels, as well as “Mishima: Life in Four Chapters”. One of the most difficult aspects of storytelling is the ability to remember and move forward without losing the pace of the film. This film not only flashes back and the fourth with the greatest of the lungs, but it also goes through some of the greatest stories of Yukio Mishima. This film is superior in all aspects and a joy to watch. Not to mention the incredible soundtrack of Philip Glass.
