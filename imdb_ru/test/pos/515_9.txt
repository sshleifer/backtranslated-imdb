Now here's a movie that does something that hasn't been done for a long time. He takes ten or so different elements with which we are already familiar (vampires, martial arts, techno-beats, first-class special effects, etc.), and turns it into something completely new. In what could be just a combination of Mortal Kombat and Buffy: Vampire Slayer, Wesley Snipes (since I have no favorite, and mainly because of Passenger 57) gives a really good turn as a half person half bloodsucker. He recognizes the internal conflict, but does not dwell on it more than necessary. He makes Blade the same deep character as Michael Keaton, who was made by Batman. <br /> <br /> I’ll say that the only part of the film that has enraged me a little is the ever-present cliché of the horror film of the person who the hero knows, who knows how to exactly stop the evil guy. On the other hand, in such a film it should be, so it is easy to justify. <br /> <br /> Well, snipes is good. And Stephen Dorff, promoted in the preview, makes the bad guy more than a bad hero Snipes. He has class, presence and enough control in his little finger to teach Al Pacino how to soften him a little. Who would have thought that a comic strip movie would be the starting point for an actor? I sincerely hope that this is so. And wait! where the hell did Chris Kristofferson get acting talent? Don't get me wrong, but the prolific actor hasn't done anything memorable since the days of the Millennium, and how many of us watched it just because of the cool video box? Well, here he is, guys, in a very obi-pale turn, like Blade's mentor and father figure. And a good job too. <br /> <br /> The quality of performance corresponds to the quality of choreography and special effects. Accompanied by a pulsing techno-beat, the wrestling scenes return and quickly erase the memories of Mortal Kombat. Hello! There was a script there too! I was wondering what happened to all the good writers there. <br /> <br /> Two main signs that I saw a quality film were these; I didn’t have a feeling of remorse that I paid the full price to go in, a la Schumacher’s “Batman”, “Avengers”, “MK: Annihilation”, “Godzilla” or “Armageddon”. (wow, how many of them came out this year? Ugh) Also, I look forward to the inevitable continuation, according to the end of the film. Let's hope that they cope with this work as well as the first. <br /> <br />
