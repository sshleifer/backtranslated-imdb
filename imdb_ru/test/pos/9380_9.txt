The words "hidden gem" have never been so accurate. Bad movie lovers may look for all the hidden obscurity, sometimes failing with such things as Weasel rips my flesh, but in other cases luck will prevail, and you can get something like Mortal Bed, and then hope that this is not a bad movie he just has a bad headline, and not even a bad headline, but a humorous one that can confuse you, but somehow the Death Bed still fits into the category of “bad.” Possessing a dark and empty atmosphere, “Death Bed” is a real masterpiece of low-budget horror, intended only for those who are fortunate enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of vision. <br /> <br /> “Death Bed” includes an incoherent, yet intriguing relationship between a demon in bed and a sympathetic ghost trapped in a portrait who only wants him to save someone from the terrible fate of being swallowed by yellow foam. Although not everything is so scary, considering that we are talking about a murderous bed, Death Bed has qualities that contribute to successful horror. The gloomy, deserted atmosphere, confusion, eerie, thin account and the quality of the dream, which this masterpiece almost flaunts. Such a quality or atmosphere usually seems unintentional. Not only was this intentional, but from what I read, Death Bed is based on a real dream, director George Barry successfully transferred the dream to the film, only a genius could accomplish such a task. <br /> <br /> Old mansions are terrifying of good quality, as well as portraits, not knowing what to do with the murderer’s bed with its deadly yellow liquid, a really strange dream. In addition, this is not exactly the B-horror brand I expected, given the name and all that. Before watching this gothic pearl, I was expecting something more than Class Reunion Massacre, now this is a bad movie, if you saw it, you understand what I'm talking about. After considering all of the above, I feel that the Death Bed deserves only eight stars, but since it has remained unclear for so long, we say that the bed that eats deserves nine.
