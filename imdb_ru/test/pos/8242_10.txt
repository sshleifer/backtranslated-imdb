As a child who grew up in the 1950s Sydney, I can easily identify with the content of this beautiful film. Every week I went to George Street's Wynyard Newsreel to see Cinesound shorts (and usually 3 Stooges). There has never been a better combination of black and white and color in the film. Impeccable production values ​​complete an unforgettable film experience.
