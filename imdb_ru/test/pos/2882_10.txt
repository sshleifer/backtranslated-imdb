I will always think of Mr. Fert as Dorian Gray if I live to be 100 years old. <br /> <br /> Perfectly acted and directed, enlivening insight, wit and humor of Oscar Wilde with absolute and complete perfection unusual for television. <br /> <br /> Another proof that the BBC is more talented than it does not always have in money. <br /> <br /> A must have for all Wilde fans - and the rest is true for everyone. Inspired and brought to perfection, each of the actors looked quite right for this role, and each shot was well done. <br /> <br /> By the end, I found that I love every character like no other movie Type has ever inspired. Take a look, then try another version. It's just not the same, right?
