This movie is fun in many ways than one. This is an action. He has humor. He has a relationship. He has the whole female army of kung fu Dolemite! And this is just what the movie offers as a movie. It also acts badly on some, the microphone has several cameoids, and some “hit” on the legs. But when you make such a cool movie, who has time to pay attention to these "details"? This movie is swinging. Rent it tonight if you can find it ... I had to buy it to see it, but I don’t regret it!
