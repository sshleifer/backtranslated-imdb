David Attenborough brings his wild life charm, this time to creatures underwater, in this unusual 8-episode journey to all animals underwater! <br /> <br /> Cinematography is astounding, displaying truly breathtaking shots of these whales! But the best thing about it, like every episode, is how they did it! Whether creating creature models or these impressive images of whales, they will explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it! <br /> <br /> In 2001, there were some great TV shows on our screen. But, unlike this documentary gem, they make them rather lame! But even to boast of this documentary series as the best series in 2001 simply does not summarize the brilliance that this series provides in quality entertainment! <br /> <br /> Overall, this is the best TV series of 2001 with no competition, and maybe the best TV series of the 2000s!
