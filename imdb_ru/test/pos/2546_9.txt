This is one of those films, when you watch it, you wonder whether it is a documentary or fiction. After the film, Ramin Bakhrani answered many questions, and we learned that there is a script in the film. <br /> <br /> Bakhrani’s camera is silent, he does not condemn, he almost purposefully removes the director from the film, and the background is not organized to make the picture pretty, but don’t get me wrong; There are a lot of preparations for this film. Starting from a personal level, being part of the environment, being ignored when you are filming. <br /> <br /> The main character is in every sense a “real” actor. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank the entire film crew for this film showing us another country in New York. I highly recommend this if you like the stories of others. <br /> <br /> Bora Kizilirmak
