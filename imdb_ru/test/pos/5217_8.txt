He is very good at this role of a disgruntled and bored husband, a decorated air force officer, who gets bored because of his predictable life in the suburbs, and he decides to radically change the situation. <br /> <br /> One evening, he meets Karen Syllas, an attractive woman younger than his current wife. Relationships develop, and Cole decides to raise them to the next level. <br /> <br /> He has not only a novel, but he also fakes his death to avoid his family responsibilities. A lie becomes more and more stereotyped when he begins to rob banks in order to make his new wife (Sillas) happy and to project the idea that he has succeeded. Obviously, this is a fictional fallacy. <br /> <br /> This was also based on a true story, which makes it even more intriguing. Cole is believable and superb in these roles. Featured. 8/10.
