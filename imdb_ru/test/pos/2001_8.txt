Here is one of the nicest items from a dark house in the 70s; it is the ubiquitous low rent rental pimp, similar to the elegant version of The Mack. John Daniels, enthusiastically feminine hairdressing hero Mr. Jonathan in the immortal "Black Shampoo", gives an excellent steel image of Baron, ruthless, business savvy, forever transforming the all-powerful flesh merchant who, to his horror, bitter, cruel Italian rivals reign over the Sanset Strip. When Daniels does not tie the horns with his fellow innumerable criminals or does his best not to be arrested by local police, he lives in his ordinary life as an ordinary suburban dude in the garden (along with a caring wife and loving children!) In some typical Funny Californian town. <br /> <br /> The strikingly absurd premise alone promises the stunning grandeur of a truly awesome picture of class B slogans (George Tiakos deserves praise for his funny and funny script). Matt Kimber’s meticulously tactless and tasteless direction delivers unwanted merchandise at the expense of a slimy bucket, which makes this film an incredibly pleasant portion of celluloid dirt. Among the various squalid delights that should be savored here are an abundance of unreasonable female nudity, rude dialogue, beautifully tasteless Me Decade threads (blouses, felt hats, brilliant Day-Glo jewelry, loud costumes from a sizersacker), Smoke R & B score, some hopelessly pretentious game (the little old woman who lives next door to Daniels is painfully shrill), Patrick Wright's memorable nasty twist as a sadistic jerk, a couple of cool scenes (a serious culinary carnage in a slow bar), more dark shots from the Sunset Strip movie, in which you can shake a feather boa (these shots are said to include “real prostitutes and the Sunset Strip blades in Hollywood”), in fact, a cinematographic film about the grim and boring work of Ken Gibb , a few crazy fetish pictures, some crude blatant violence (the prostitute cut off one of her breasts!) and funny appearances in support of the familiar perennial characters of Schlok Richard Kennedy and George "Buck" Flower as a couple of racist, corrupt, intimidating itseyskih detectives. Of course, this film is not art, but it is definitely skillful enough to be considered a delightfully ugly piece of funny cinematic film.
