“Jaded” should not be viewed as an erotic thriller, because sex scenes are not for the pleasure of watching, unlike films like Indecent Behavior or Family Friend. <br /> <br /> “Jaded” is a hard time, as its history is difficult to understand and not so common in society. From the very beginning of the film, from the first scene, you expect more powerful scenes. <br /> <br /> The rape scene was not (in my opinion) a well-created scene. I think the director did not use the proper camera techniques in the film. This is why it sometimes looks boring and almost boring at the end. <br /> <br /> All performances are very good for all five female characters. These women gave strong, intense, but believable performances that demonstrate the dramatic abilities of actresses. <br /> <br /> Legal concepts helped to understand the complexity of the plot, because the legal term homosexuality is different from simple rape. From the point of view of the protection of Meg, homosexuality should be punished as rape (huge crime B), although this is another crime. Pat and Alex's defense claims that Mag enjoyed and asked for it. Here the film becomes interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. The only thing that can be said for sure is that the sex scene fits into the legal definition of crime. <br /> <br /> See “Jaded” if you like legal issues that are not very common in your society. If not, try it, because it is a very good and strong drama.
