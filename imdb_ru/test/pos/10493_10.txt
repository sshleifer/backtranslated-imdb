I first saw this movie on hbo in 1983, and I liked it! I searched all the auction sites to buy a VHS copy. This is a very good unknown film with a few twists and turns that make it more interesting. I do not want to talk too much, because if you ever have the opportunity to see this, you will be glad that I did not say too much!
