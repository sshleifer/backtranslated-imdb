Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wang are both gorgeous in the tightly directed crime thriller Johnny Toh, which shames most Western efforts. Think of it as Hong Kong's “Heat”, only better! Everything about the movie screams class; from performances to soundtracks, from cinematography to screenplays. The tone remains serious everywhere, but in the heart of the film is a good feature of humor, friendship and romance. Of course, later it will become a bit ridiculous, but it will be a cruel viewer who will not find something that can be loved in this film. Thank God, Hollywood has not yet done and did not destroy the classics. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!
