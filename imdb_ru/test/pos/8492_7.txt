2004 was the year of a biopic with at least four pictures depicting real events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. Of the four shots that will go to the Oscar race in early 2005 (KINSI, AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA and RAY), Ray became the main winner of the evening, as the acting award went to Jamie Foxx for his role R & B genius Ray Charles. <br /> <br /> And it was well deserved, despite the fact that Leonardo di Caprio approached, and Liam Neeson was not even put forward. What made Fox the winner was that the other two played relatively obscure eccentrics, Ray Charles continued to write music until his death in 2004, and by that time there was no soul that didn’t know even one song Charles "wrote. It was helped that Jamie Fox rose above the film - on its own, in general, somewhat weak and often looking as if it would not be inappropriate, like a television biopic, - and its image is detailed as it is fierce. He has a delicate the task, that is, to embody a person in the nuances, and as soon as the crisis of Ray’s dependence on heroin hits the head, Fox pulls out all the stops, and it is easy to imagine that the real Ray does go through such an agonizing ordeal. <br /> <br /> Essence the film is that he spends too much time on the details of Ray’s relationship with women.Like AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford wants to prove that Ray had this hectic life, the product of his own demons and his success at a time when blackness and success brought a huge amount luggage. Of the women, the only one who will succeed in real life is Sheren Warren, like Ray’s mother. Her difficult role is because she is alone on the screen, and the children's actor plays the young Ray, but her tongue and face torments, especially at that moment when she has to give up her motherhood so that Ray can find her way around the house. Such an intensity of emotion to stand there and watch your blind son crawling around the room and forced to make this rude awakening to independence. Excellent performance, and it should have been recognized. <br /> <br /> RAY's fantastic counterpoint - popular music. Anyone who knows R & B will enjoy the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as well as his later ones, which would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Fox actually stole the show as he performs songs like Ray . This in itself will live, even if the film itself is little more than a biopic. But I would really like it if in the closing credits they used his latest hit of Adult Contemporary of 1993 “Sing my Song for You”. After all, this is Ray Charles, a performer who was devoted to his art.
