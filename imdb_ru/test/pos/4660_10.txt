WEEE is still very fun! Like most of my friends, we watched this movie on HBO when we were young, and have since searched for a copy of it. When they finally released it a few years ago, we had a Midnight Madness party ... and the film stood well. Of course, this is pure cheese, but still very fun. If you have not seen MM in your youth, you could not appreciate its value today.
