In my personal opinion, I think this is the best video game ever created! I first played this game in the house of my friends many years ago, the next day I went out and got my own. Since that day, about seven years ago, I have not stopped playing it. I can't help it, I just can't get over it. I was addicted to other games on other, much newer systems, but I keep coming back for more Goldeneye. Each mission is amazingly fun and complex, multiplayer mode was unique. I hope you were luckier than me when I played in multiplayer mode for four players, because I had brothers and friends who gathered and played this game all the time.
