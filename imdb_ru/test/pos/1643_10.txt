Blimey! It is difficult to put into words my feelings for this episode. Ice is one of the best episodes of the first season. This is my favorite season. Six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure, isolated in the center of the Arctic with an unknown organism that causes suicidal aggression, the drama can not be better than this. Paranoia reigns because even Mulder and Scully doubt each otherâ€™s sanity. I heard that people complain about the similarity of this episode with the movie "The Thing". I did not see this, so I would not know. Ice is more than worth a look to see how Mulder and Scully really test their still growing trust in each other. This episode is intense and stressful to the end. You will not be disappointed!
