We watched this film in my chemistry class, so obviously it had educational value. I thought that the film did a good job with the interweaving of science, moral issues and personal experience of the Manhattan project, but was not exactly focused on a strong game. I would recommend this film for those who are inclined to science, or those who are interested in the moral problems of Fat Man and the Little Boy, but if the topic of nuclear bombs bore you, do not watch it.
