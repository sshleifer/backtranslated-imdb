Lost was one of the most exciting and exciting events I have ever seen. This is not only the mother of coincidences, but every time you think you can solve the whole puzzle in your head, the story takes a completely new direction. <br /> <br /> Take this sacrifice, for example, the USA. The Marine, who gives Said a way to become a Torturer, Clancy Brown, plays a character named Joe Inman. In the last episode, he plays Kelvin Inman, Desmond's partner in Luke. Fate, huh? Yes, right! <br /> <br /> I think we all will have to wait to find out what will happen next in the lives of wonderful people on this strange island, off the beaten path. Knowing that some of my favorite characters, Desmond, Said and Mr. Eco, have an obscure fate. <br /> <br /> I believe that, along with 24 and Shield, this is one of the best television shows in history, of course, keeping Twin Peaks in a special place.
