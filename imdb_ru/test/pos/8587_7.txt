In the film "Lumumba" we see the faces behind the monumental shift in the history of the Congo after it was returned to the Belgians, and we see the motives of those people in whose hands raped and hungry country fell. <br /> <br /> Lumumba is not a hypermass film; He demands the attention of his audience with a rude, truthful action and a complex, intense dialogue. A little of the main plot is shown in action, it relies almost exclusively on words, but there is a recurring thread that is only an action, and the ingenious move makes the film an enlightening and powerful panorama of the tense political struggle that gave rise to Congo independence. <br /> <br /> This film is real. This is a rough picture of those in power and those on the streets. This opens the eyes to its contents. And he moves in the passion and emotions of his beautifully depicted characters. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of history, a movie lover or just a lover of good stories, Lumumba is a must see.
