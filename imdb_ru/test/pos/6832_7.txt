I got this movie from eBay mainly because I'm gay and I love Tyla Schweiger. However, this is one of those films that when you watch it a second time, you never say to yourself: “Hmm. I forgot about this boring part. I'll go make popcorn. ” It does not have this part. This is a very smooth and constantly interesting film. And yes, Til Schweiger is worth it, if not more. But this is a great movie, even for straight guys.
