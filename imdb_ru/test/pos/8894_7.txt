Owen loves his mom ... only he will love her better six feet lower in this dark, funny, loud comedy in which both stars are shot and directed by Danny De Vito, with wonderful assistants from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the lead role. <br /> <br /> “Throw a mom out of the train” is an amazing comedy, even if it’s not a very good movie. This is too small in parts, and the end seems less organic than the attached. But in most cases this is not an easy trip: Crystal and DeVito use the glorious screen chemistry, working on their own comics about the essence of being a struggling writer (DeVito is energetic but inept; The crystal is blocked and bitter). br /> <br /> Professor Crystal Donner believes that his ex-wife stole his book (unfortunately, under the title “Hot Fire”) and cannot write more than the first line of his next book, which is not easy. He teaches a creative class of beginning writers, including a middle-aged woman who writes Tom Clancy's fiction, but does not know what the submarine captain says; and a padding salesman who wants to write his life story. Mr. Pinsky is perhaps the funniest character on the screen, Laughing Per Minute, a pervert in an ascot costume who sees literature as an excuse for writing his opus: “100 girls I would like to eat pork.” <br /> <br /> Then there is Owen Elevator from DeVito, who calls himself "star pupil" of Professor Donner, although the teacher does not read his work in the classroom. Owen is a somewhat unusual character who appears in the film, a 30-year-old man who lives with his domineering mother Ann Ramsey, who calls him a "sled" and other charming feelings. In any other film, we would be asked to regret Owen, but “Throw Mom out of the train” dumps the cruelties of life on this sad bag of laughter and expects us to go together. This is one of the main reasons why this film probably loses a lot of people. <br /> <br /> For those of us who love the humor of this character, even identifying ourselves with him, and perceives everything else that we see here, like Lark, it’s not so hard to agree with the big gambit This comedy takes, asking us to watch with passion, while Owen enlists the help of Professor Donner in terms of killing his mother. In fact, he first goes to Hawaii to kill the hated former Donner, and then tells the professor that it's his turn to kill Mrs. Lift, “exchanging murders,” as seen from Hitchcock's “Strangers on a Train”. <br /> <br /> As a director, DeVito not only complements the performances of his actors with a stage setting that puts emphasis on dialogue, he makes several bold visual statements, adding pieces of funny unreality to keep the audience in good shape (and not to perceive things too Seriously). .) <br /> <br /> Writer Stu Silver, who continues to laugh with his worthy quotation, also helps in this matter. "You have a rat the size of an Oldsmobiles here." "She is not a woman ... She is a Terminator." "One little kill, and I am Jack the Ripper." These are all the words of Crystal, but some of the funniest lines that work only in context but absolutely kill are the words DeVito and Ramsey. It is obvious that Silver never wrote another script after that, according to IMDb, and this is a shame, because he had a real talent for it. <br /> <br /> The best scene in this film, when Crystal Meets Ramsey, was actually used in its entirety, as a theatrical presentation about “impending appeal”, the only time I saw the film being promoted in this way. Owen introduces his mother's professor as "cousin Patty," and when mom says he doesn't have cousin Patty, panic Owen loses him. “You lied to me,” he shouts, clapping the professor's forehead with a pan. <br /> <br /> Of course, the professor will not actually moan anything witty from the floor, but “Throw Mother Out of the Train” effectively works in such moments when he plays his Looney Tunes vibration, no matter what. Of course, DeVito did not disappear from the films, but it remains a mystery why he did not fulfill the director's promise of this film. Perhaps this is because, as the lack of mass success of “Throw Mom Out of the Train” shows, his vision is not to everyone's taste. This is very bad for those of us who can watch it over and over and like it.
