Black Pitch was a complete shock for me when I first saw it in 2000. In previous years, I repeatedly became disillusioned with all inconclusive science fiction films (for example, “Star Doctors”) and thought that this film would not be any different. But I’ll just say: this film has enraged me ... in a good way. I did not know that I was still afraid of the dark until I watched this film; I must have buried my fear in the depths of my subconscious when I was a child, and he rightfully deserves to stay there. <br /> <br /> Alien creatures sent a shiver up my spine; the person (s) who designed them has a perverse, but brilliant and creative imagination to come up with something so impressive and grotesque. <br /> <br /> I liked the way the scriptwriters told each main character a story and demonstrated their weaknesses and strengths without much confusion. <br /> <br /> The gift of Riddick (Vin Diesel) for getting out of any impossible situation and arranging a hellish fight was a jaw droop. At first you realize that he is a cold-blooded villain, but after a few short moments you can see something humane behind his animal side. But as soon as you find it, he does something evil. He, of course, makes you guess to the very end. I did not know whether to despise him or admire him ... he definitely loves / hates nature. <br /> <br /> Jones (Cole Hauser) was an excellent example of a character who puts forward a good front but through the need for greed shows his real intentions and what he is willing to do to survive. John’s ability to know which buttons to press and which words to pronounce correctly makes him as tricky as Riddick. <br /> <br /> Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who, as Jones so well expressed, looked at her with his ass, before considering the consequences. But what attracts her is that she quickly realizes the mistakes of her path and desperately tries to pay for repentance, even endangering her life, when others throw away all human values ​​and go running across dark hills. <br /> <br /> Jack (Riana Griffith) simply wanted to have a hero and was the first of the whole group who was looking for this hero in Riddick; through the eyes of a child, good can be seen through the thick clouds of evil. I thought it was absolutely priceless when Jack shaves his head in Riddick's ode; You know what they say: imitation is the best form of flattery. <br /> <br /> Imam (Keith David), like Jack, is able to see good in any evil. He uses philosophy to transfer him through the difficulties he faces, and when time allows, he rationally mourns his loss, and then the soldier. In a sense, it served to increase the morale of the survivors, although most of the characters acted as if they were not listening. <br /> <br /> The cast of this film was impeccable. Each actor brightly illuminated his role, and his talents were perfectly combined on the screen. <br /> <br /> This film may have had a small budget, but the director’s direction and the actor’s actions made the film work and allowed viewers to use their imagination instead of letting some incredibly expensive special effects do all the work for them. This film is a definite classic of science fiction. Watch it and judge (with an open mind) for yourself. It's worth it.
