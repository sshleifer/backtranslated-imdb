I believe that this film was made for a not very large amount of 8,000 pounds, but in fact it was not shown. There was nothing amateur in the production or acting, the characters were tough and real, and any deserted place in the world could be a place, and not a too warm beach north of Aberdeen. The actors were fairly easy to accept, as a handful of mercenaries found themselves on a mysterious, deserted and unexplored planet, none of them seemed to be particularly friendly with each other, but was ready to fight to support themselves and their comrades. There were no good explanations of what was happening, what could really be invented, so most of the plot was left to your imagination, rather, like “The Great Emptiness”, a film that I also liked. I found that I was rather embarrassed by most of the characters, there were some, perhaps unintentionally funny moments, men were so ordinary that you felt you could empathize with them, and the climax and the end of the movie were pretty sharp. I think Mr. Stirton and his team should be proud of themselves. I have seen the worst films with a budget of millions.
