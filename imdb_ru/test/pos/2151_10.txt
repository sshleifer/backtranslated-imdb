I was lucky to see this film at the Seattle Film Festival, and I was amazed at how good it was. It is, without a doubt, one of the best musical documentaries I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot!). This is a love look at life and times, music and relationships of one of the true legends of music. Harry Nilsson deserves to be there with such as Gershwin, Cole Porter and all the other great authors of the standards of the 20th century. All four members of the Beatles group considered him a peer, and they all called him the fifth Beatle and the same wavelength as themselves. <br /> <br /> Harry refused to go on tour, so many people don't remember him today, and those who were born after his heyday don't know who he was. It is tragic. Everyone should have the opportunity to get to know this wonderful talent. This film is a step in the right direction to finally pay tribute to a person. Unfortunately, the film has not yet received wide distribution, or even DVD, so for now good luck in watching it. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to build a DVD distribution of the transaction, PLEASE contact the filmmakers. This film must be available. Hey, VH-1, how about a live show and then maybe a DVD release? Harry Nilsson deserves no less.
