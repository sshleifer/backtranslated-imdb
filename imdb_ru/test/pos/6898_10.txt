It is very nice to see such a film with a real mood and personality, and not just a bunch of CGI cartoons. This is a great parody of horror, in which there are real chills, along with some really great sets and performances. His laughter is subtle, but plentiful. Since CGI is very small, there is no need to shake the camera hard enough to hide the crappy effects. This makes the film incredibly watchable compared to other films of this genre, shot by an operator who has to shoot a film that came out in the last decade or so. <br /> <br /> Much nicer than big budget trash released today by Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Take a look.
