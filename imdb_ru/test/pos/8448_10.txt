Again, I read all the comments posted here, and agree with many clever ones, but completely disagree with those who believe that this was / is hokum. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that nuclear energy is the only energy left to us if our governments (federals and states) do not increase grants, thinking that homeowners will use photocells on their roofs. Many attractive and expensive homes in Southern California are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy around, the sun. I live in the attic, which is exposed to sunlight on the roof all day. I almost don't use alternating current — I'm sure it consumes too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees cooler. We are blessed with a dry heat in this part of the country. I’m from the Gulf Coast in the US, so I know about humidity ....... <br /> <br /> However, I believe that China Syndrome is a convincing film that CAN go wrong if the industry is not busy regulating and testing nuclear power plants. I think there are enough comments here to enlighten those who are still afraid of it like the plague: they are safe. TMI is still online .... <br /> <br /> Director James Bridges carefully guides this plot (Mike Gray-T S Cook) to create a tension and thoughtfully interesting film. All the roles were well played: Jane Fonda (“Kimberley Wells”), Jack Lemmon (Jack Godell) and producer Michael Douglas (“Richard Adams”) - everything is great in their roles, plus all the other actors. I also liked when there were no points. It was so interesting to get a realistic look from behind the scenes of the television industry - this should not come as a surprise. Currently Dan Rater is suing CBS, and I hope he wins. Can you believe that Donald Trump said "he is a loser"? Trump - who cares? Tiberius1234 posted a very good comment here - I agree. It is my opinion that “evaporating” with nuclear weapons spills much better than living in a world that was wasted, and becomes Blade Runner and / or Solyent Green. Get away from your video games for a couple of hours and see this "outdated" film (in fact, it is not. And I get a little education in atomic energy. I recommend the whole family ....
