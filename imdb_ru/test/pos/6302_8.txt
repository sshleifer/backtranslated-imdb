The first frame, The Consequences of Love, beautifully creates this intriguing and exciting film. The traveler slowly carries a lonely out-of-focus figure to the camera, dragging a huge suitcase. Like the main character in the film, we know nothing about him, and our initial interpretation of him, his profession, and the contents of the suitcase may be far from the goal. <br /> <br /> The aftermath of Love is such a film. From the title, you can expect Bergmanesq to cut the relationship. Instead, we have a main character, Titta, who lives in emotional exile, who seems to have decided to isolate himself from others. If the film can be classified in any way, I would call it a mystery, since we are engaged in figuring out who Titt is and what it is about. What we know from the very beginning is that he is 50 years old, cool, discreet and expensive. For the past eight years, he has been living in a posh Swiss hotel, always paying on time for a room, but rarely showing interest in the staff or other guests. <br /> <br /> His only real companions are a couple who sometimes play card games. It turned out that the couple owned the hotel, but now they lost everything and left only the room in which they live. Their love of money, antiques, and each other was their doom, and Titta seems to identify with their plight. He once had everything, but now he lives as a virtual prisoner in a hotel. His brother, a long-haired surfing instructor, sometimes comes to him, but he thinks that his visits are more an invasion than a pleasure. They speak of a man whom Titta regards as his best friend, although he has not seen him for 25 years. This long-lost friend is now a telephone engineer repairing a communications network that brings together so many people. Meanwhile, Tittas' phone calls to his wife and children quickly end when they refuse to talk to him. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, Titta takes an uncharacteristic step and begins to open the young barmaid from the hotel. With his judgment darkened by emotions, he chooses a course of action that ultimately seals his fate forever. <br /> <br /> Slow deployment of Titta, falling out of grace, perfectly and according to the scenario, shot and killed. The shock techno soundtrack does a lot to create tension, as more and more secrets are revealed, the last half hour turn into a trained thriller, when Titta lets his mask slip and again has to face the consequences of his actions. The final with Feliniâ€™s visual bow is dramatic but ambiguous and leaves the audience once again to question his motives. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bliss, 01/06/06
