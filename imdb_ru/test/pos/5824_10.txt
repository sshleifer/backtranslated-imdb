HBO created this show with the goal of getting us to see the most realistic look of the prison, and they did a hell of a job. Oz was created by the creators of the murder, who wanted to show the raw version of the prison. This show is what gave rise to any other original HBO program, such as Soprano, Sex and the City, The Wire, Arliss, Deadwood and Six Feet Under. Oz is the nickname for Oswald State Prison, a fictional prison in some US state that is never indicated (although accents, crime scenes and racial distribution are supposed to be New York). The main prison unit we saw on the show is the Emerald City, a seemingly perfect prison unit, with more privileges than the others that were invented by the manager of the liberal unit named Tim McManus. In general, this show shows us what it really looks like if someone wants to survive in prison. <br /> <br /> Oz shows about 10 gangs. First, we have Muslims, a group of blacks who want to destroy the injustice of the criminal justice system and help improve the living conditions of black people everywhere. They are headed by Karim Said, a black warlike minister who wants to destroy all racist attitudes towards the judicial system. As a group, they are not so much against whites as against injustice. Our second group of blacks are the Homeboys, who, in essence, are street blacks who want to support all the ghettoâ€™s bad behavior and drug trafficking. Their leadership varies mainly because they always lose members due to violence. In this group, one character who acts badly is Simon Adebisi. Adebisi - African prisoner, in fact the most terrible evil character of all living. This gang as a whole receives occasional assistance from the Irish people from time to time and is always in conflict with Latin Americans and Sicilians in order to spread drugs. Due to the fact that Oz is mostly black, the "Masters" have the majority of soldiers from any gang. <br /> <br /> Latinos and Sicilians, like the Masters, have different leadership positions due to the violent deaths that occur throughout the show. Sicilians largely have the most important view of how any illegal activity is conducted in Oz. Hispanics make their presence known, so they can at least move well if they do not control the situation. However, unlike Homeboys, these gangs do not have much of an internal power struggle, and they are usually more stable when it comes to drug use. The Irishmen mentioned above are a small gang headed by the manipulative and serpent Ryan O'Reilly. O'Reilly always manages to remain in good mercy with all his narcotic abilities and manages to manipulate things in his own way when he wants. They are not under illegal control, but at least they are on good terms with all those who are. <br /> <br /> Among the white prisoners there are bikers and Aryans. Bikers are just a bunch of tattooed drug addicts who help Aryans most of the time. The Aryans are the most hated and hated gang for most Oz viewers. They are led by Vern Schillinger, one of the most racist, most painful and sadistic characters you can see. Both gangs do not control anything illegal, they simply allow black prisoners to see that they pose a serious threat to anyone who considers all white prisoners soft. We also have others. Others are a group of prisoner outsiders who are not necessarily a problem for any other prisoner. In this group, we see Tobias Beecher, a lawyer who accidentally killed a young girl whose life changed forever in prison. We also see Augusta Hill, a black man attached to a wheelchair for killing a policeman who talks about the show and introduces the public to every prisoner. The character's crimes are revealed as they appear, and Augustus tells us how long they will be in prison. Finally, among the gangs there are Christians and gays. Christians simply remain religious in order not to fall into the mentality, and gays are a group of crossdressers that other prisoners often rape. <br /> <br /> This show examines in detail many issues relating to criminals. The justice system is clearer than any prison movie. Since the language is unedited, we have more racial epithets and curses here than on any other TV show. Augustus Hill's commentary gives us a good way to truly understand all the problems associated with Oz. This show is as good as not at all for the light and middle heart. He clearly shows the use and distribution of drugs by any means possible, rape in prison, murder, fatal injuries and bleeding than anything that anyone has ever seen. In my opinion, this is the most influential and greatest show ever created, but at the same time I understand why this show will interfere with other people. If you are interested in prison shows and films at all, Oz is definitely worth a look.
