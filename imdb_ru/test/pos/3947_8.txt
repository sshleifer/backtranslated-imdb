A scarlet coat about Bendikt Arnold, betraying his country, but he is really not in the film too much, focuses on Major Boulton (Cornell Wilde) and Major Andre (Michael Wilding) Wilding to steal the film as an officer and gentleman how to be friends with Boulton. While Boulton is trying to figure out who Gustav is, the man leaked to the British. Silver is faced with a suspicious Dr. Ollom (George Sanders), who watches his every act and loves Anna Francis.
