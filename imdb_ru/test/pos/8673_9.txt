We have a film that is perfect for those who participate in the post-industrial world: those who sit in their privatized house, earn money, buy and sell nonsensical goods, and perpetuate a system that values ​​little else but preservation of I. <br /> <br /> Wonderful shooting (I always appreciate fix 35s and softboxes) makes it an even more strange place to travel, which is nice to watch, but scary to understand (maybe it's too dramatic, but its true). <br /> <br /> Andreas’s journey through his hell is overwhelmingly tragic. His search is honorable, commendable and precious. Conclusion is necessary, and we are not sure what is better for it, which is the ideal conclusion. <br /> <br /> courage! It is strongly recommended to all people who look at their world with a critical eye, and especially those who do not (perhaps it will encourage thinking or two).
