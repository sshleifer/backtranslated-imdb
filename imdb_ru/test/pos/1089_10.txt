I like the way he experiments. Ab So So Chappan was delighted watching Satia and company. Jatin novice also justified her role, and Nana Patek was at her best. Suchak was really annoying, but I think he matched the character he was playing - he had really terrible teeth. The story has a lot of progress, and no songs in the film make it better. I just wish he would record Urmila for his other future films. I think they are the best combination of director and actress I've seen. I have not seen Naah, but I look forward to it. For some reason I do not find Antru Maali so exciting to see on the screen - unlike Urmila.
