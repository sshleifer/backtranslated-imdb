Honestly, I found Wicked Little Things a very cool and funny horror movie. A friend of mine gave me this, and I really saw nothing in him but a stupid, horrible, lower-class horror film. very cool and very good, and although I will say that at times it seemed like something unnecessary, and although it may not be the best horror movie, it is still good. I thought that the acting was very good, especially from the girl who plays the mother very believable and very cute for me). And although it is a little cliche and, of course, it is good. In general, I have to say that if the Afterdark Horror Fest films are not your style, then you should not watch it, but if you like horror movies, or a bit of an evil time, than check out Wicked Little Things. 8.0 out of 10 stars
