This is my favorite Colombo. Martin Landau (great!) Playing twins, one of whom may have committed a murder. This Colombo is unusual, because the usual murder scene at first does not give you any clue what he did! Peter Falk is in the form, as usual, in this episode written by Stephen Bochko (who also wrote Murder by the Book, my second favorite episode). The supporting cast is great, especially Julie Newmar (very underrated) and Janet Nolan as the housekeeper, which Colombo just continues to upset. The surname of the heroes of Martin Landau is “Paris”. This was the name of Leonard Nimoy’s character in Mission Impossible. Conjuncture? Or joke Stephen Bochko?
