True stories make the best stories right? There is always something pleasant in history, whether it be a novel, a film or something else, just the fact that it is real makes the story even more fascinating. This film is based on a true story of two young American men, one of whom is a government employee and a falcon enthusiast, Chris Boyes (Timothy Hutton), and the other one Andrew Doulton Lee (Sean Penn) is a drug dealer. These two begin to sell government secrets, mainly the CIA, in 1975 to the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the human aspect of two men, as well as their growing personal problems (especially the character of Penn s - worsening drug addiction), rather than glorifying their status as traitors to America, which would undoubtedly undermine trust for the film in the United States. Boyce gradually becomes more cautious and, ultimately, frustrated and paranoid, as their relationship draws out and they penetrate deeper and deeper into the treacherous territory. Dalton is becoming increasingly addicted and addicted to cocaine and heroin, as he becomes more and more frightened and more and more desperate to maintain control over a situation that he cannot control, besides which he already has problems with the law. The anguish of the families of Boyce and Dalton because of the way they lead their lives are also well depicted and well complement the idea that spying on one’s own country, even if it is considered fair, leads only to serious problems and deaths? ? including the deterioration of friendship and trust between the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Here’s a breakdown: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - Hutton and Each of Penn carefully examined the characters to capture their individual appearance, so they are depicted with great depth and realism. <br /> <br /> - The acting is great. <br /> <br /> - The atmosphere of paranoia is built quite well. <br /> <br /> - The story is exciting, and, of course, it is based on real events and has some additional impact. <br /> <br /> - Good sets. <br /> <br /> - Boys working with Boyce and Dalton are very well depicted and have no stereotypes and do not give an evil conscience just to make them look bad. <br /> <did not offend, did not help: <br /> - With music, everything is in order, but nothing perfect. <br /> <br /> - Sound effects are sometimes a little dubious - this was the case with a lot of movies from the seventies to eighties. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - Chris Boyes (Timothy Hutton) has a relationship with a woman we barely know. Because of Boyce’s problems with the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union, her life may be in jeopardy, but this is not as extended as it seems to be. However, a small problem. <br /> <br /> Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The obvious simplicity necessary to sell state secrets is a little frustrating. Nothing like a permanent state of unreadiness, so that the masses feel as unsafe as possible. <br /> <br /> Memorial Scene: <br /> <br /> - The vision of the first CIA message that was randomly sent to the wrong place with the reason being “a hard night.” <br /> <br /> This was another film that suffered huge delays due to the contradictory content of the story. Studios and producers have not seen how American viewers can take a film about two American traitors. Fortunately, this is filmed and depicted with a high level of class and quality. Of course, it helps that the traitorous anti-heroes are not portrayed heroically - rather, as a couple of young people who have made blunders in their judgments in their lives. Thus, it becomes a very human drama, and one is portrayed very well and very believably. <br /> <br /> Acting: 9/10 History: 10/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Character development: 9/10 Special effects / Makeup: 8/10 (small amount, high quality) Nude / Sexuality: 2/10 (one scene in a strip club) Violence / Mountain: 7/10 (no blood, just a little violence) Music: 7/10 Direction: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Cheerfulness: 0 / 10 Carelessness: 0/10 <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> If you like espionage and spy movies, then you can’t go wrong. If you like dramatic films with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters, this can also work for you. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
