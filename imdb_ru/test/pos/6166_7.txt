It seems that no matter how many films are shot on this topic, there is no shortage of stories that appeared during World War II. It goes without saying that a conflict on such a scale as a global war would capture the imagination of filmmakers everywhere and provide them with sufficient material on which to base history. The dark blue world, a film that has no relation to the traditional main battles of the war, does not tell the story of many of its main figures and does not even focus on a direction different from most of the main war films. soldiers of any of the main allied or axial powers.

A love triangle develops between the two main characters and the Englishwoman, which complicates the relationship between the teacher and the mentor of two expelled soldiers. These relationships are extremely good in all respects, in many ways they turn into father and son relationships. <br /> <br /> Air combat in the film is one of the best, and it is also very interesting for studying cultural challenges. mentioned above, because people are struggling to control their cars, fight enemies and send commands and answers in an unfamiliar language.
