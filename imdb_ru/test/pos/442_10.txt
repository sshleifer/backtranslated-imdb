This is my favorite Renoir from the fifties. This is a story about how Henri Danglars built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see workers exploding in place to start building, and training dancers. Finally, dizziness from the opening of the night and a long series of Cancan dances. Financial problems and performances of the ego are described. <br /> <br /> Gabin is in great shape, like the frivolous Danglars - see how he copes with the cruel guy Nini with humor. Gianni Esposito moves like a pensive prince caring for Nini. Maria Felix, with this Amazonian body, is impressive as a selfish Lola, Danglars first lover. Finally, Francoise Arnoule, like Nini, the washing girl, who eventually dances for Danglars and becomes his girlfriend, is simply amazing; her charm and charm will enchant you. <br /> <br /> Bonus: we get Edith Piaf, Patach, Andre Klavo and other stars in cameos who played stars a century ago who ruled the Moulin Rouge.
