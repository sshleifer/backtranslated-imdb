Just watched this movie on TV and it was awesome. <br /> <br /> I just planned to watch it while doing some work, but in the end I watched the entire movie without work, as it was so great! <br /> <br /> The actors don't know very well, but the storyline compensates for this. the fact that the actors gained fame makes it more likely that events can happen. I did not feel addicted to one character, because I do not know the judgments about the types of characters, because I had never seen any of the actors in the film, which made him even more pleasant. <br /> <br /> I recommend to watch it.
