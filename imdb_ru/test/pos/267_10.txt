After seeing Lost Child many times since its release in 1995, and reading the reader’s comments (mostly about Jane Tennyson’s past and Helen Mirren’s excellent role in it), I’m most surprised that no comment . after the brilliant role, Robert Glenister plays Chris Hughes. Even 10 years later, it is still one of the most reliable ways to portray the complex personality of the abuser, carrying the weight of his own past. Watching the episode for an hour and a half makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate this guy, in which hatred prevails because of the seriousness of his actions. I have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor, but this one cannot fail to make the most impression. Helen Mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her. Praise to Robert Glenister!
