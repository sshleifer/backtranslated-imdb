The Anderson Animation easily competes with the Pixar animation and goes far beyond everything I've ever seen in Disney. While some say the story is too abstract, I find it thought-provoking and with the refreshing change of exaggerated characters and clumsy animals commonly found in animated shorts. This is the interplanetary version of CASTAWAY! Anyone who left the safe haven of the house and went to a lonely, frightening place in and of itself, will readily identify himself with this unfortunate microbe. Great job, Mr. Anderson! <br /> <br />
