Impossible sex Rosie Holothik plays Charlotte Beal, a new nurse in one of those cinemas where the head doctor has his own, non-orthodox ways of treating prisoners. Reluctant to bring her on board, this is Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams, a.k.a. Annabelle Weenick). Prisoners also do not belong to Charlotte too benevolently. <br /> <br /> Partially an enigma, partly a horror, this is the initial effort of the director of BBC S.F. Brownrigg has a feeling of repression. These colorful psychos, including a nymphomaniac without self-esteem, a tender giant who already had a lobotomy, and an alleged “judge” who speaks legal slang dominate the screen with their unnerving presence. <br /> <br /> This is a picture that works quite well, creating a dark, gloomy atmosphere from the very beginning. Some short bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old exploitative quality. <br /> <br /> It intensifies as the heroine struggles to maintain her sanity, offering one surreal collision after another. Especially effective quote from poetry, dotti old Mrs. Callingham. <br /> <br /> For the cheap cheese of the 1970s, it is quite effective, with a particularly unpleasant climax. I had a very good time watching this. <br /> <br /> 7/10
