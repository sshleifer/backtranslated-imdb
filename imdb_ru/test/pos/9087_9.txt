Medical students are playing chicken with a process that mimics death, trying to get (hopefully, temporary) a look at the afterlife. Certain plot twists and themes are a little untrue, and the action sometimes goes beyond. But the basic idea — about the forgiveness of God and others for our real or supposed sins — is positive and unique in the movie, and the cast is very, very good. The last sequence between Julia Roberts and her father is made so effectively that years after I saw her, I still feel a chill about it. Highly recommended.
