This eternal summer love story is a classic and will never be outdated. I can't even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. This is one film that I could probably watch every few weeks and still love. <br /> <br /> There is something out of time in this movie. I loved other “love films” such as Pretty Woman and when Harry met Sally. I think they are there, but there is something in Dirty Dancing that makes it absolutely perfect. Characters, chemistry between Swaze and Gray, film directing, INCREDIBLE dance, a warm summer atmosphere, everything in the muddy dance is absolutely perfect. This is an instant classic, and I have never seen a single movie like this before or after. <br /> <br /> I don’t think that there is any particular element that makes this film so loved, but many things, many of which are mentioned by numerous reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, sluggish summer mood, realistic characters, a real connection, combined with incredible music and dancing, and one of the best dance sequences the cinema has ever given us. <br /> <br /> This film is always on TV and I will continue to watch it while they watch it. But I’ll say that I’m not interested in seeing Havanna Nights, this one that they should have left alone.
