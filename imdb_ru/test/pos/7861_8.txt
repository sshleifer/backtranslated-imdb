It is difficult to understand in which category this film is put, most of the films shot during this period of US history are Westerns, but here, instead of the wide open plains of the West, the action is almost entirely limited to the claustrophobic boarding school for girls in Louisiana. . <br /> <br /> The film begins with Amy, a young girl walking through the woods and collecting mushrooms. She bumps into Corporal John "Macby" Macburnie, a wounded Union soldier, whom she is taking back. school. We know that he is not a particularly pleasant person when he kisses her on the lips to distract her from the warning of passing the Confederation patrol, even if she told him that she was twelve. <br /> <br /> Once back at school opinions, they share what they should do with their new guest, some think they should look after him until his wounds heal, while others think that cheating is not transfer it to confederative forces as soon as possible. The former group prevails, and it is gradually being restored. When he does this, his presence affects all the girls who have not had a man for a long time, including a young teacher and an older mistress, who apparently had a previous relationship with her own brother. Macby is going to seduce them; emotionally, if not physically, this leads to significant jealousy among girls. <br /> <br /> Although this film is estimated at fifteen, it is definitely not for young viewers as sexual content, of which few are actually shown, but much is implied, and for a very exhausting scene, because of which I squirmed more than any other scene in any film that I have seen for quite some time. It is interesting to see how Clint Eastwood plays against the type, instead of being heroic, his character is unpleasant and in most cases depends on the mercy of the women around him. Acting is everywhere, not only from Eastwood, but from all the actresses, including the young Pamelin Ferdin, who plays Amy.
