Bon Voyage is entertainment for the audience, because it combines the necessary stupidity of comedy and sufficient sobriety so that the audience actively participates in the process and puts it into the result. Most importantly, the film is also historically instructive; it reflects the tension of the so-called "fake war", and then the flight of the French aristocracy from Paris before the German offensive. Yet Bon Voyage is not a "war film." This is a comedy about the life of a handful of people against unusual times. Bon Voyage conveys the chaos, confusion and emotional confusion of a nation on the verge of collapse, and a wide range of French reactions to the new political order. This film is a comedy that entertains the audience, a novel in which many cliches are skillfully used, and a story about a bunch of people whose nation collapses around them.
