With nurse Betty (2000), well-known indie director Neil Labute ("In the company of men, your friends and neighbors") makes a breakthrough in the budget with a large budget ($ 24 million. Betty, not the paltry $ 25,000 of the company). kingdom - and yet remains true to its roots. While his cast is now made up of Hollywood A-List names (Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman and standing comedian Chris Rock), his material remains as strange and bizarre as his first two roles, proving that he can be the next big thing. Nurse Betty is one of the darkest comedies that has been advertised to the main audience for many years, and given her moderate box office and critical success, the audience may not have been as stupid and brainwashed as we are. The story follows (both figuratively and figuratively) a naive waitress (Zellweger), who fell in love from afar with a beautiful soap star (Greg Kinnear from the movie As Good as She Gets), but was trapped without love for a slimy car dealer. (Aaron) Eckhart, who debuted on the big screen in the company). When two hired assassins (Freeman and Rock) are horribly murdered by her husband, she comes to shock and involuntarily goes to Hollywood to meet his object of affection - not knowing that he is just an actor. When Freeman and Rock discover that the car she took contains 10 kilograms of cocaine, they also hit the road, and as a result, a disturbance occurs. Fans of LaBute's previous work may have difficulty understanding how this could be the same guy who filmed “In the Company of Men” - the tragicomedy of two brutal sexist pigs who play a deaf employee in practice - but when you think about it, the connection is pretty clear: in the Company, a vulnerable woman does not know that she is being mercilessly used. In Betty, the vulnerable housewife does not know that the man for whom she is chasing considers her true adoration no more than a joke. Some may begin to wonder if LaBut himself is something of a woman-hater - assuming that his recurring theme is related to the fall of innocent women. But personally, I think that he goes to the defense of the fair sex and treats the offenders in his photographs much harsherly than the offended ones. One of the many charms of this film is that its absurdity is full-fledged: most directors, when working with scenarios like this, leave the story behind two assassins chasing a woman who is chasing a dream. But Labute knows best, and one of the hired killers (Freeman) is also obsessed with Betty. It was an interesting role for Freeman, because she allowed him to play her trademark “this is the last time” (see “Unforgiven”, “Se7en” and “Hard Rain of 1998”); The supporting cast also includes the famous cranks Crispine Glover (“Back to the Future”), Allison Jenny and Kathleen Wilhoit from the movie “Crazy over You”. The script, written by newbies John K. Richards and James Flamberg, is insanely overloaded (to be honest: have you ever seen a comedy or ANY film, for that matter), in which a person takes off his scalp? his own dining room?). It can be argued that the final is too perfect, but in fact you should not deny everything that is good in the film for one trivial complaint. If Nurse Betty is any sign that LaBute will prepare for us the next time, you can bet that I'll be in line for something with which he will decide to continue. <br /> <br /> Rating: A-
