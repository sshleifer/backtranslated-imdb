Wayne Wan's direction may be the ingredient that made this film much more impressive to me than Beverly Hills Slum, which embraces surprisingly similar ground. The interaction between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is exciting. Real chemistry there. This film allowed me to plunge into the dysfunctional life of these two women, but did not fall into depression. Character Susan Sarandon clogs all the nerves that a narcissistic parent can touch in an insecure teenager. She surprisingly manages to do this without looking insanely insane or intentionally sadistic. And Natalie Portman rejects every attack on the ego of her character with the submissive grace of an intelligent, child-dependent, unspotted character's complacent cynicism Natasha Lyon in Beverly Hills Slums. Character Portman - a teenager with dignity in a state of stress, an unusual creature in modern films. The film reaches a very satisfactory resolution, not trying too hard. I highly recommend this film to a viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained.
