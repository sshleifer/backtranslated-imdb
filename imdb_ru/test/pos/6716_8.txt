Lifeforce is a truly strange adaptation of Colin Wilson’s novel Cosmic Vampires, screenplay by Dan O'Bannon and Don Jacobi. The joint US-British group on space exploration makes a stunning discovery: an alien spacecraft located on the comet Hallis contains three objects that look like humans, one of which is female beauty (very attractive Matilda May). br /> <br /> They are returning these discoveries aboard their spacecraft. Big mistake. <br /> <br /> It turns out that these creatures are draining people's lives, like American Colonel Carlsen (tense, irritable and dedicated Steve Reilsbek) and the British S.AS. Colonel Kane (handsome Peter Firth) watches with horror as parasites vampirism in London, and the fate of the Earth is in the balance. <br /> <br /> This picture is definitely not without imagination. Sometimes he moves a little slowly, but he offers so many strange and bizarre ideas and stunning visual effects that it’s hard not to have fun. The first of the three pictures of the director Tob Hoopers with Cannon Films (he continued with the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre II" and the remake of "Invaders from Mars"), it makes it something truly unique. Including elements of science fiction, vampire films, zombie films, and doomsday sagas, I have never seen anything like it. <br /> <br /> Railsback and Firth skilfully support such strong British actors as Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart, Michael Gothard, Aubrey Morris and John Hallam. Matilda May is very memorable as a bewitching, mysterious wickedness; It certainly does not hurt that she performs most of her scenes nude. It is also worth noting the exciting music from someone other than the composer "Pink Panther" Henry Mancini. <br /> <br /> It may be funny, but I also found it funny. Bright and energetic entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
