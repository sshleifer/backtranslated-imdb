One day there was someone in my family (not to mention who he was for personal reasons) who thought that Mr. Bean was always so stupid about everything he did on the comedy series. Imagine what I felt at that time. Instantly shocked. <br /> <br /> There are several reasons why I like to watch Mr. Bean. Being one of those earliest shows on local television here in my country, where I first grew up, watched, this is just one of those things that are stuck in my head. There was even one time when my friends and I talked about several selected episodes, and we just laughed together. <br /> <br /> It's always stupid, funny and funny in all the tricks of Rowan Atkinson, like Mr. Bean will do in every episode. Although lately sometimes it may show some of the repetitions here, it could never fail to bring those childhood memories back to me. In fact, I can say that this is the very first show that introduces me to the types of shows that come out of the UK when I was growing up. <br /> <br /> Comedy series ... really very angry. As the British say.
