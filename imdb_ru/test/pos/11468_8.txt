I found this movie enjoyable and fun to watch, and I am surprised that it is rated so low. In fact, I understand why this is so; I suppose that fans of Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano give most of the 1st and 2nd, because if you put a tape in the car, expecting you to enjoy watching one or both of these two, you can be pretty disappointed. Erik appears about half an hour near the end of the film, and Alyssa - about 5 scenes in the second half, and in those she speaks little and carries less (although it is never exposed, if that's what you're looking for, stick to the vampire's embrace). Although they are always enjoyable, it is a pity that she or Erik do not get much time on the screen, but I still give it 8. <br /> <br />
