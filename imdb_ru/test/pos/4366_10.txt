Yes, this film was just fun, and the acting was top notch from the whole composition. With the exception of Shelley Winters, the German accent was not so great, but it doesnâ€™t matter, as she is hardly in the film. So if you are her fan, be careful! The two main stars of this film are Lawrence Harvey and Julie Harris. Now, before this film, I only saw Miss Harris in the East of Eden with James Dean, and I have the Glass Menagerie audio tape that she shot on stage with Monty Clift and Jessica Tandy, so I wasn't sure how she was I will be in this role and the BOY, she impressed me. How was Hammi she was? I love ham! ;-) Mr. Harvey, he tickled my imagination! Now I am a constant fan of Lawrence Harvey! This hair !!! * chuckles * OMG! It's almost like Burt Lancaster, this crazy dirty look, he doesn't get any better than that. He is young and so innocent in this film. LOOK NOW! This is definitely in my top ten! :) I'm so glad I found a copy that is completely mine! Unfortunately, this film is out of print and very difficult to find on the video. :( <br /> <br /> By the way, beware of the scene in the hospital hotel room !!!!! This is one of the best parts! Or when Mr. Harvey convinced himself that he was sick and he was trying to get on his knees kick, you know how doctors do it with this little rubber hammer ;-) Well, he does it himself, and his foot is kicked, and it kicks the table * squeals * Look at his face, it is innocent !!!! I can't describe it, but to all those people who say that he could not behave very well, and other comments about the hooligans, watch this film and you will see what a GREAT actor he is. You will be amazed! If not, then I am afraid I can do nothing for you, you are hopeless. ;-)
