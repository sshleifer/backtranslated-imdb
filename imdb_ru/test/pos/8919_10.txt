This is truly an iconic classic of Australia. If you are one of those lucky enough to see it, then you are very lucky. It was released in most countries, but not in Australia for some reason. I have a copy on a DVD from the UK. Not a very good show, but I bought it after seeing it earlier at the film festival. Directing on location and rock performances! This is a dark film, a scary film, but often very funny piecemeal. I urge you to watch this movie, this is a bite that you donâ€™t see at 99% of the typical Australian fare. The script is very well developed and sends you on a journey where you know that it will end badly, but until the last ten minutes you just can not choose how bad. Excellent work from four leads, especially from Lachy Hulme. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done: great work at the exhibition!
