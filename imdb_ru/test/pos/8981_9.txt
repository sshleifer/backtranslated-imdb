This does not happen very often, but sometimes one person can change something - a big difference. <br /> <br /> George Creel's 2003 best-selling book, Charlie Wilson's War, is an exciting and revealing record, the most unlikely “difference maker” imaginable. A relatively little-known congressman from Texas Second District, “Good time, Charlie”, was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation. Cute and dissolute (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson served well in his constituency, since the good people of Lufkin really only wanted two things, their weapons and being left alone. This is Easy Street, teeming with its seductive beauty, known, respectively, as Charlie's Angels. <br /> <br /> When asked why all his office staff consists of attractive young assistants, he responds with classics: “You can teach them to type, but you can't teach them how to grow boobs.” There are no arguments. < br /> <br /> But even the meanest rapscallion has a conscience hiding somewhere under it, and for Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocities committed in Afghanistan forced him to gather all his political sharpness to finance the complete, humiliating defeat of the Russian military and maybe even help speeding up the end of the Cold War. A good chance, huh? <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson, under the able guidance of Mike Nichols and Adam Sorkin’s ingenious script, is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that tells about the machinations of three backstage scenes. which consists of "Charlie's Team." <br /> <br /> The Screen "Team" consists of three amazing actors with four (4) Oscar awards and nine (9) nominations between them. Tom Hanks beautifully portrays Charlie in a solid, slightly understated manner, which is among his best works in recent years. He is helped, instigated and dismissed by Joan Herring, a rich socialite from Houston, played by the still thin Julia Roberts. Hey, why else have a bikini scene than letting the world know about it? Apparently, Miss Roberts looks good and holds on to herself, but the script never gives us even a hint of why Kabul and the country are so important to her character. Maybe two Afghan hounds are usually near her, but we, as an audience, will never know. As for the third member of the “Team”, Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene in which he appears as Gust Aurakotos, smart, street (that is, not an Ivy League graduate) dissatisfied with the CIA, who knows the result - both in the Agency boardroom and in the bedroom Wilson <br /> <br /> For the success of the Mujahideen, the most important assistance that the US can provide is the ability to shoot down the terrible MI-21 combat helicopters that fly the skies. This requires money, big money, and ultimately, Charlie’s Team secretly forces those in Congress to fund an effort of $ 1 billion in advanced weapons to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes the most modern, most modern anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles, as well as other high-tech killing devices. Nasty, nasty things. <br /> <br /> The fact that this type of illegal activity, worth several billion dollars, can and does take place outside the doors of Congress, is causing serious concern. Every American should watch this film or read this book, because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the ordinary political scene that is rarely seen outside our own government. Oh, mom, I would like it to be wrong ... <br /> <br /> Although the initial result of Team Charlie was an unqualified success, the unimaginable, unforeseen end result is that now This sophisticated weapon is used against our troops by the Taliban and others. Since funding was completely “hidden”, the younger generation in this part of the world has no idea about the fall of Soviet oppression, and the end of Russian barbarism was a direct result of American intervention. Yes, as soon as the Russians left, our help is lightning on schools, lightning on infrastructure, to maintain constructive relations with the Afghan people. As a result, a common consequence — an irreversible catastrophe — is like a precursor of “Mission accomplished.” <br /> <br /> As Nicola’s film clearly indicates: “The ball that you set in motion can keep bouncing even after you have lost interest in it.” Mike Krzyzewski knows this, Eva Longoria Parker knows this, small La Tisha in Lafayette knows this, but the typical American politician doesn’t know. So we are moving from the good guys to the bad guys because we can't let the world know that we are good guys. Let's talk about "Dodge-22" (Mike’s another movie Nichols). <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson may have said it best: “We took care end of the game. »<br /> <br /> Again.
