“Nuovomondo (2006)” (shown in the USA as the “Golden Door”) was written and directed by Emanuele Crialese. This film is different - and, I think, better - than most films about poor people who leave Europe and come to the United States. <br /> <br /> The film begins with scenes in a poor, rural region of Sicily. We always hear that Sicily is a rocky island, but you will not understand the meaning of this phrase until you see the Golden Door in the first half hour. <br /> <br /> The middle part of the film is about a long trip to the USA. Most immigration films show how ten minutes people in the third grade become sick, and then show us the Statue of Liberty. Not this film - we have a feeling of life under the decks, and this is not charming. (In fact, we will never see the Statue of Liberty.) <br /> <br /> Finally, a typical film will give us another ten minutes of Ellis Island, and then immigrants stroll along the Lower East Side of New York. Not here - the Ellis Island experience takes about a third of the footage. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Amato is known as Salvatore Mancuso, who leads his two sons and mother to a new world. Charlotte Gainsburg is equally good as the mysterious Englishwoman Lucy Reed, who also speaks fluent Italian. <br /> <br /> There are some strange touches in the film, especially the soundtrack with Nina Simone’s songs. There must be some kind of symbolism, but I cannot understand it. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer has already indicated that this film is better to watch in the theater than on DVD. However, the big screen or small screen is worth a look.
