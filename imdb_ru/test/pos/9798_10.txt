Young Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are featured in this excellent film about two boys who promised to “take care of their mother” and how they cope when their new stepfather starts beating a younger boy. The supporting cast around the boys is also top notch. The script really penetrates the mind and heart of the creative child. It's hard to believe that Wood could grow and look like Tom Hanks, but there is nothing new in Hollywood. This is, frankly, my only criticism of the film.
