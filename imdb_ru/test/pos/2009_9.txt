This new Jeskid movie is awesome! Check it out and you will be amazed. The story of Emily Waters, once a girl from a broken house, whose only way to get away from an abusive father was in her album. Until one night, her drawings were translated into reality and saved her, and now, using this power, she fights against those who will do evil. Live action and hand-drawn animation are mixed together, creating a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and amaze you. The music is also incredible, it really nourishes the emotional experience and draws you into conflict. Directed by Jesse Cowell and starring Erica Langworthy with the beautiful Marissa Parness with Nico Audi-Rowland, Daniel Collins, Jeff Strathern, Matt Sisco and Selcuk Bohr.
