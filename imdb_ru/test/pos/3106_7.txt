On the way to the country house, in order to hear the new play being read, the theater producer, his secretary and playwright found themselves in the mud. They sneak into the next house to be in the fiance's playwright's house. If you can't guess what murder and chaos is about to happen, you didn't pay attention to it. <br /> <br /> This is a good entry in the genre of an old dark house. Not only does he have a good mystery, you also have some very funny liners wandering around him. The cast is excellent, and they are more than willing to have a good time with good material. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this was one of the best genres, it should have been, but for me something happened on the way that made me downgrade to only seven out of ten. I can't tell you what it is, for sure not. Perhaps this feeling that I knew where it was going from almost the very beginning, or maybe something else, I'm not sure what, but it was that I could not shake what made me such a movie, despite to the fact that I wanted to love him, He just missed his magnificence and for some reason failed. <br /> <br /> I said that I suggest you see this. In the end, this is a very witty film that entertains to the fullest, despite the fact that I miss being great.
