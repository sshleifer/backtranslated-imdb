Admiration from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you donâ€™t like dolls, then I just feel sorry for you. This stunning film does not just cash in on the popularity of the doll - it is a well thought out and well written film in itself. He has great songs, and he has that thread of brooding melancholy that has always been present in the works of Jim Henson and which is most personalized in the image of Kermit the Frog. I have always reacted to this in childhood, and this makes Muppets still pleasant for me as an adult when other materials for children drive me crazy. <br /> <br /> A huge number of celebrities appearing in cameos makes this film look like a children's version of Around the World in 80 Days, except that it is about 80 times better. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
