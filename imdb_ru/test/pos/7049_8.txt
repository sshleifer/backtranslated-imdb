I know it was a dumb movie, but I really liked it. This is one of the experiences that makes me smile when someone says "Bill Murray." I almost always love films with outsiders, and there are more outsiders in this film than you can count. In general, this is a good film - some adults are not wrapped tightly, but laughter is more likely to be perceived than cruel, like many teenage films these days. Rich children across the lake are defeated, but none of those whom I know, did not mind. I never went to camp, but I did some things that were somewhat parallel, and most of the bits and tricks were done. Sometimes they were even understated, but Iâ€™m sure it was an accident. The cast showed itself well, Bill Murray showed a hint at what he will become. This is not Groundhog Day or Broken Flowers, but, hey, good silly laughter should be appreciated these days, but then ... it just doesn't matter ................. .. ............
