For those of you who have thought about what a movie about art-house monsters can be, don't be surprised. The DAIMAJIN trilogy, circa 1966, was just such a series. More epic epic about samurai than anything else, these three films simply show one of the most (literally) monstrous deux et machinas ever. There is not a single aspect of these gems that would not be polished, from the script (s) to the performances and the skill of the director. Even special effects are handled with above-average skill and are almost seamlessly integrated (in most cases) into the film (s). If you're a GOJIRA fan, a samurai movie fan, or one of us who likes a good movie, regardless of genre, I highly recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.
