May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> This is just a good movie. A lot of good nonsense to laugh. However, do not watch the television versions, they cut out too much. House Deluxe is pretty cool, like a mafia Don hired to kill Robin. All I can say about his ten minutes: it's a long way from jersey. You should also love them, checking the script to make sure Robin gets another shot. Also: 12th Century Fox. <br /> <br /> Is there something bad? The rappers at the beginning and end seem outdated. The songs were pretty lame. Once while watching this movie, I would have thought a few more times when they could add another joke or 2. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, it was a pleasant experience. A must-watch for comedy lovers.
