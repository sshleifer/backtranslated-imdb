This is a very strange series with Dean Learner. I really did not understand the guests. I knew that they were not serious, but whether they really were them was unclear because ... I think that I was just so stupid. I do not know whether these lessons are a spoiler, but the guests are not real, as in Ali r, or something that they are played by one person or so, I believe. I like the serious look that he has. This is similar to the program that was on Sunday morning, I forgot the name LOL. I also like his costume and mustache. This is pretty hot. He is insensitive, which is one of the most ridiculous qualities. I also like the way it has program sections. This makes it more authentic.
