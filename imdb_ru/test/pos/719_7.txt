To summarize this film: good for television, but too small for theater. I enjoyed watching this movie at home, but I will not watch it a second time. The concept is good, but what ends in the film is just a summary. The end had a “good” turn, but still not satisfactory. Maybe it was the director’s intention, but this is not how it should be. But again, this is a good movie.
