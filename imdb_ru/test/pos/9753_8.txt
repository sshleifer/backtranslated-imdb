“The hunt for justice” is connected with the fact that Slobadon Milosevic appeared before the court in The Hague. While it was a bit too clinically in the presentation, the subject could get very depressing very quickly. Canadian Judge Louise Arbor becomes Chief Prosecutor for War Crimes of the International Criminal Tribunal of the United Nations in Yugoslavia. She fights with everyone to get the evidence that Milosevic was sent to court. A good documentary drama with directing and staging of class A. “Evidence” was disturbing because of the discussion of the facts, fortunately, they did not go into details and did not present real photographs of those who were tortured.
