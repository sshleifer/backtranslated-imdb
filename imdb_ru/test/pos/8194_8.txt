For a feature film, the plot closely follows the story - or, at least, historical gossip. But then the Chinese, who know this story very well, seeing it again and again, will never tolerate it. Attention to detail is wonderful, especially for those who read the story of Sima Qian in The Historian's Notes. Jing Ke, according to Sima Qian, really attempted to the life of Qin Shi Huang at the request of Crown Prince Yang before unification. Sima Qian explicitly mentions both the head of General Fahn and the dagger, rolled into a map, and the dagger thrown into a copper pillar. Although Jing Ke is described as a stranger to play with swords, he is hardly the invincible warrior depicted by Chen Cage. Jing Ke is truly the weakest link in this film. In fact (again, according to Sima Qian), he drank a lot and postponed his visit to Qin for as long as possible, spending a lot of time with Yang’s ladies, before the Crown Prince finally ordered him to go. In short, he was a man and did not expect death, although he was ready to accept it. Jing Ke Chen Kaige is afraid of death, but not his own. He is a classic ruthless killer who has become a frustrated pacifist. His love (or maybe just love) for a woman and pity for the hundreds of children Zheng had buried alive (even two thousand years hostile Confucian historians claimed that Qin Shi Huang did this, although there is a legend that he 460 Confucians up to their neck and then behead them) enough to make this ex-killer kill again. The melodrama is not convincing, and the character turns out to be just boring. Acting is not terrible here, although not very interesting, given the nature. As for Lady Zhou, in all the many stories I heard about Qin Shi Huang, she never surfaced. In any case, Gong Li is well known to the Americans to hear about her (thanks to Zhang Yimou), and there should have been a love interest, so here it is. Unfortunately, her game is almost as wooden as the character of Jing Ke. She felt much better (in Qiu Jiu, for example), being thin; here she barely controls presence. But all this is trivial compared to the extraordinary play of Li Xuejian as Zhen himself. Qin Shi Huang is more for the Chinese than Satan Milton for us: accepted as a villain, but noble. Qin Shi Huang’s achievements radiate awe over two thousand years to the present, and Li captures his frightening will without compromising his humanity. Lee's presentation is sufficient, but the scale of the film is great, although the photo is intentionally boring. It feels ancient. Evaluation is adequate, hardly moves, although it is very suitable for action. Although I only saw this once, I believe that Chen Cage should be given more respect for his camera work than other reviewers allowed him to do. Initial credits excite. If five stars is absolutely average, I gave three more for actor Lee Xuejian and Chen Kaige as an actor, writer and director.
