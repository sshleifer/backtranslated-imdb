Where would Hollywood be without Frederick March as Robert Browning, or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, famous for his time lovers? Even such an actor, as usual humble as Michael Redgrave, once brought some kind of capricious charm into the image of VB Yeats. The life of writers is an endless source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> But of all the poets was Dylan Thomas, a wandering, loving Welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and drank himself to death in New York at 39), who was closest in spirit to the film industry. During World War II, he produced screenplays for British propaganda documentaries. He even wrote an empty melodrama script “Three Strange Sisters,” in which three old maids in a Welsh village are preparing to kill their rich stepbrother. All that is now forgiven. <br /> <br /> In John Maybury’s film The Edge of Love, Thomas is played by Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. This is not a full-blown biopic. The film tells about the four years of the poet’s life during World War II, when he lived with two women: his wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and the former mistress of Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley), whom he met by chance during the war. It seems he loved them both. The relationship of these extraordinary women — with Thomas and each other — lies at the heart of Maybury’s exciting film. <br /> <br /> As it happened, the story is almost as remarkable as the story of lovers. themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson, film producer, granddaughter of Vera Phillips and William Killik. William, a war hero (played in the film by Killian Murphy), married Vera while she was still in love with a poet. Gilbertson was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents, Dylan Thomas: a farm, two mansions and a bungalow written by David Thomas describing their tangled lives. Sharman MacDonald, who wrote the script, is Knightley's mother. Part requires Knightley to sing, and her mother includes songs specifically for her. Of course, no film with such good family ties deserves to do anything but succeed. <br /> <br /> We start in London during a blitz show. Bombs are falling, sirens are crying, and Phillips is singing to the hiding crowds at an underground subway station. In the pub, she accidentally meets Thomas and after all these years discovers that he has a wife and a child. Phillips and Caitlin form a friendship that is not intimidated by jealousy or anger, and soon they share beds and baths, listen to Thomas reading his poems, share intimate secrets and smoke their heads, as everyone did during the war. Caitlin turns out to be more experienced in the world (“My first was Augustus John, he seduced me when I was 15 years old”). But it is precisely the refined and soulful Phillips who evokes the most profound responses of Thomas and ultimately gives way to his charms. Meanwhile, she reluctantly married Killik, who saw her at the subway station and was instantly fascinated by her beauty (if not her singing). <br /> <br /> This is an intense and strangely beautiful film, although Thomas himself may be his least impressive character. He is best remembered at Under Milk Wood, his poetic radio show about the bottom of the life of the mythical Welsh village of Llareggub, whose name was not written backwards, which was not paid attention to by polite teachers of English. Once I had a vinyl record of Richard Burton reading a poem (he appeared in the film “Under the Milk” in 1971), and I never forgot the creamy, seductive quality of his voice. Legendary charisma, human magnetism - this is what I lacked in the performance of Rhys. Thomas looks strangely pale, even a minor figure compared to the women in his life. <br /> <br /> In his previous film Love Is the Devil, Maybury explored the tumultuous life of the artist Francis Bacon and his sadomasochist. relationship with her lover and model George Dyer. The edge of love seems to me a richer and more satisfying film. If you ask what he suggests in Thomas’s sources of creative inspiration, I would say Llareggub. But as an understanding of his egoism, his smoldering mood and his general indifference to the feelings of others, this is surprisingly sad and revealing. <br /> <br /> Thomas led a good war, drank and wrote, while other men (including Killick) were traumatized by the horrors of battle. In one of the scenes near the end, the behavior of Thomas towards his friends seems unforgivably callous. But this is, after all, not a Thomas film. Murphy gives us a magnificent study of the doomed passion and emotional exhaustion of war. Miller is charming and pitiful like a wife. And Knightley looks too exquisitely delicate to be real (as she did in Pride and Prejudice). But this is probably her best performance. And in all respects the film is worthy of her.
