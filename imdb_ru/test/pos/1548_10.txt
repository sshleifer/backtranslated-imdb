Ken Loach demonstrated to the world the flip side of Swinging London with “Poor Cow” about Joy (Carol White), a London woman who picked up a thief and gave birth to a son with him, only to see how a man ends up in a cracker While his friend ( Terence Stamp can help her, he turns out to be a little better at how unlucky he is. Soon Joy becomes clear that she will have to make a serious decision about where she will go in her life. <br /> <br /> One thing I defined - I don't know if this is true or not - was the use of irony in the film. Her name is Joy, but she does not feel joy in her life. Even if it was not intended, it is still a movie that I recommend to everyone. With the participation of Donovan's songs (one of which is “Colors”) appeared in another film by Terence Stamp: “Limey” (which, by the way, was released in 1999, when I was as old as my parents, when “Poor Cow ")).
