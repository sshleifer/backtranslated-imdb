I love this film. This was done ONLY before the punk scene in Los Angeles changed for the worse. It perfectly preserves the mood and attitude of that time and place. I was very lucky that I attended the filming of four groups in Fleetwood that night. The only part that does not fit in too well is sections with Catholic discipline and their social and political commentaries. I have not seen too many people who were interested in this. The rest of the film shows the relationship, which I witnessed a lot; people dealing with hard life, or swinging in the music industry and / or lousy hippies. I do not think that I saw a documentary film that so authentically and personally reflects the subject that is covered.
