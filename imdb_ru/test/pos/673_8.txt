I especially liked Delly’s review of this film, and I agree that Howard is not the only “spoiled” character. Howard is pretty ruthlessly “in tune” with the scenario, but there is no evidence that his previous employer is really dead or, if she is, that he killed her. Howard does not know, as we do. In horror and confusion, he saw a woman lying there, he escapes. However, he never hurts Helen Gordon, no matter how furious he is. Indeed, he reacts with horror to Helen fainting and the fact that he is holding scissors ... then he resumes cleaning and welcomes Helen who recovered with an almost pitiful: "I am very tired now. I think I'll go home." Honestly, I do not think he is a psychopath. Of course, a sick puppy, but not a psychopath. <br /> <br /> The problem with Howard is that he doesn’t have a real male identity. He wanted to serve his country, but his mental state deprives him of his place in the army. It has no roots and is isolated: neither the wife, nor the girl, nor the house (again, at least, as far as we know). And he performs women's work - "Paul - my specialty." Helen's niece mercilessly deprives this pride with her thoroughness, furiously exclaiming that she needs a man with a real job. In addition, although he finds himself strongly attracted to Helen, he cannot or does not want to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass. He is surprisingly helpless - he cannot fight, he cannot work, he cannot make love. <br /> <br /> However, Helen is justifiably scared. She tries to connect with him, but, finding that he does not react normally (that is, she goes beyond the comfort zone provided by her rose-colored memories of her husband Ned), she involuntarily presses all Howard’s buttons, lying to her in her attempt to escape. <br /> <br /> Both characters locked in a house locked in fear, neurosis, rage, and memory deserve sympathy. I know that the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers, but I felt that it fits well, as it offers a kind of liberation to the characters. I think Elena is free from the past. When Howard tries on her husband's army coat, Helen’s disgust at the reaction is emphasized. She, no doubt, feels that the "holiness" of Ned's property was violated, but I hope her need to keep everything "intact" is lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger. Perhaps she can move on. <br /> <br /> Howard is also freed from an endless cycle of anger, resentment, and violence. The question of whether he is going to treatment or to jail is controversial, but I hope that this is the first. <br /> <br /> Great performances by Ryan and Lupino. I prefer "On a dangerous land", but this is also pretty good.
