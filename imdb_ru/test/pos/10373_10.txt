To those of you who are still in ignorance, I will not spoil this Christie, as this is definitely one of her best works, and I emphasize that you should see her when you have free time next time! If before reading the book (or instead of it) you need to look at any changes, I would suggest “After the funeral” for the following reasons. <br /> <br /> I would like to commend the performance of Monica Dolan (Miss Gilchrist), whose companion employer Cora was brutally murdered at the very beginning of the film. Her image of a shocked, nervous, insignificant woman actually moves, especially when she has a moment of personal connection with Poirot, another man who travels alone in the “journey of life”. And when the killer is revealed in the typical manner of Poirot's denouement, Dolan's reaction to the revelation manifests itself in all its glory: you feel the same anger at the killer, as well as sympathy of Miss Gilchrist ... something unusual in the knowledge of Christie. <Br /> <br /> Although there are a couple of inconsistencies between the novel and the adaptation of the film, as usual (a matter of will may not make sense in the film), the incredibly generous re-creation of post-war England, a completely high level of action and leadership, and preservation ( if not amplification, Christie’s secrets and intrigues make these inconsistencies insignificant. <br /> <br /> Bravo Suchet, Dolan and the whole team for creating this masterpiece of the mysterious murder theater, as well as the producers who gave the green light! Encore!
