Once again I have to play the opposite. Most of the reviews of Ab Tak Chappan were extremely positive. My positive, but only a little. 7 out of 10 are equivalent to my letter "C". <br /> <br /> It seems that most of the praise is rooted in two factors: firstly, Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than a typical Bollywood film and two that he is trying to do something differently. <br /> <br /> The first thing that doesn’t bother me is I’m not looking for realism in films, and therefore I don’t get more points for a film that shows the story and characters closer to how I believe in the real world — I'm big fan of surrealism, fantasy, absurdity, and so on, although I don’t like realistic films just because they are realistic. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently. However, I do not think that “originality” compared to the wording makes the film itself better or worse. The film can be “original” and bad, as the film can be formal and excellent. What matters is how well the film does what it intends to do, and how pleasant or aesthetically useful it is for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Eb So Chappan is based on the real story of a Mumbai police officer named Daiya Naik. Nike was a "meeting specialist." Meeting specialists, who can be said to be the earliest instances of the real world "Judge Dredds", are trained to act as criminals and gang members who are harassed, and they are basically given a murder license - effectively acting as a policeman, judge Jury and executioner in minutes. Ab So Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agash (Nana Patekar), a collision specialist based on Nike. We see how he works, communicates with his fellow specialists on interaction and participates in violence. We see him at home trying to live a normal life in his less luxurious surroundings. We see him trying to adapt to the new “commissioner” in the middle of the film. And we see his strange relationship with the notorious Indian gangster Don Zamir Zafar (Prasad Purandhare). <br /> <br /> All this has the potential to create an incredible, gritty film. I agree that it is nice to abandon typical Bollywood musical numbers and romances - not every film needs this; Producer Ab Tak Chappan Ram Gopal Varma is known for leaving music and romances in the background or on the sidelines of many films that he has shot or shot. In addition, Ab Tak Chappan has several good performances - Patekar almost gives off Death Wish (1974) - the era of Charles Bronson. It also has great cinematography - hand-made things around the beginning of the film were particularly effective, for example. He has a great score that blends more capricious Hollywood action / crime with traditional Indian instruments and modalities. Violence is done well and hard. <br /> <br /> There is also a decent study of the subtexts, including the morality (presence) of meeting specialists, the idea of ​​following orders, and so on. The collision specialists show that they have to largely separate themselves from the ideas of good and evil. More acutely, the film questions the merit of blindly following orders. Parallels are made between collision specialists who carry out orders and, say, the country's military, and we are shown what kind of corrupt situation this may lead to. <br /> <br /> But (you just knew you were) But “it will come, isn’t it?” Director Shimit Amin and his writers created a story with too many characters, too much sprawl, and it moves too slowly . All these problems may be related to the fact that Amin and his team are watching the films of The Godfather, to which Ab Tak Chappan has some (at least superficial) similarities, albeit from a policeman's point of view. <br /> <br /> Most of the collision specialists we do not know very well - these are finely drawn characters, to say the least, with the exception of Agusha and Jatin Shukly (Nakul Vayd). Firstly, Narayan, I did not know who he was, at least until the middle of the film. His name is mentioned several times, but I can see him until the scene changes. Then everyone will change their clothes by the time they appear again, and I have to start all over again to find out who Narayan was. <br /> <br /> The same thing happened to the first commissioner Agasha. The film was already far away in the new commissioner, before I could sort things out. It seems that in every scene there are new characters. We will never know the stories of most of them. Although it may have some artistic value in that collision specialists basically kill people they don’t know anything about (because they mostly do it on orders), since we don’t know too much about most collision specialists, It's hard to find characters to take care of, and it's not quite suitable for an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> The main villain is Zamir. But until about halfway through the movie, there is no sign of it. He doesn’t get much more screen time than the other villains participating in the film, and he literally “makes phone calls” - he is in a different place (Dubai), talking only by phone for most of the movie. In fact, we do not see how Zameer does a lot. To some extent, the film depends on a couple of "turns" that do not require Zamir to do several things, but we could see how he does other things, and many other villains could stay away. <br /> <br /> This would strain the film a bit, making it more focused and about half an hour shorter, and both would benefit. This is not an action movie, in any way. At least during the first 45 minutes, I admired Eba Tak Chappan's significant style, but he said: “Ok, continue the story.”
