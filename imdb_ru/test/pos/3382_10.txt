This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has all the tragedy and happiness, love and hate. And a deep friendship that even a war cannot destroy. <br /> <br /> The most magnificent cast I have ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Reed were the best students in this film. <br /> <br /> If you see part 1, you want to see it all. Some of my friends watched a part of the movie at my place, then they went and bought a movie. <br /> <br /> I am a lover of civil war, but this film interested my grandchildren in history. Any film that can make children learn history is great. I have Books I, II and III, and when girls come from Florida every year, they want to see North and South.
