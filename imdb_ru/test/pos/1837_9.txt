I love this film. At first, I didn’t expect much from this film, because I didn’t hear about it being talked about, and it seemed that it was videotaped shortly after it had just opened in theaters. I also did not think that David and Minnie would be a good on-screen pair. (I’ve been expecting a lot from the screen pairs since I saw “You got mail” and “Sleepless in Seattle” with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) I personally think that Joely Richardson should play the role of Minnie and vice versa. I don't know, I just think that Jolie should have stayed in the movie longer with David. They seemed perfect for each other. But it just shows that in the movie the girl next door always gets the guy. :) (As in “While you slept.”) Although I was very wrong. This movie was fantastic !!! Everything was done brilliantly. Bonnie Hunt did an excellent director job. The lines were perfect with wise cracks everywhere. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD !!! *** <br /> <br /> I like how everything is intertwined with each other. For example, at the beginning of Elizabeth and Bob talked about a trip to Italy, and in the end Bob meets Grace in Italy. Sydney (the monkey) does manual work with Grace, as he did with Elizabeth, is also an example. <br /> <br /> *** NOTIFICATION: SPOILERS ENDED NOW !!! *** <br /> <br /> What I didn’t like about the film was that it was a bit unrealistic. Well, I just do not think that a man could outlive his wife in a year when she was the only woman he had been in all his life. You would think that he had isolated himself from the world for years before he even left the house to talk to someone. Instead, he goes on a blind date a year later and immediately falls in love with a woman with whom he has never seen, but feels connected with her. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a great movie. It made me cry two or three times, and it made me laugh countless times (the scene in the restaurant with the picky date of Bob to the bottled water was fun!). It’s definitely there with great romantic comedies such as “You Got Mail”, “Sliding Doors” and “While you were sleeping”. <br /> <br /> GO RENT IT TODAY !!
