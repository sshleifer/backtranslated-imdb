I saw this film a long time ago, but it remains in my memory as the saddest film ever. I cried without stopping. My mom will never watch this movie again, because looking at him is almost painful. In any case, except for this, the story is not entirely complicated ... Ann Margaret dies and must give 10 (?) Children. As if this is not so bad, it is during the depression, and she must part with her close brothers one by one. I think it was very sad for me, because I am also from a very large happy family and could identify myself with the pain of each child, leaving my mother and brothers and sisters. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm a masochist, but I would like to see this film again, because it was well made, and the end, surprisingly, is a little happy (so, at least, we could smile and sob at the same time). This should appear on television so that I can see it again.
