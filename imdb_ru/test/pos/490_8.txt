Well, of course, this movie is a little crazy. It’s hard to take characters from comics and put them in films with any certainty (Dolph Lundgren as “The Punisher”, anyone?), But it’s very hard. I never read real comics, but it doesn't matter much, I suppose. I value the film mainly by its merits, and not by whether it is a true retelling of someone else’s idea. (If this is not a film based on a real story that requires at least some attempt to establish the truth and accuracy.) So why will I give this film a rather high rating? Because it is trying. He tries very hard. In my book, this is a fair attempt to create an interesting film. <br /> <br /> Many films were made with a vampire theme that was the focus of attention. It seems that everyone has their own knowledge of vampires, be it a cross, silver, garlic, an aversion to sunlight, whatever. Some of these ideas are included here. The storyline is familiar ... a group of vampires is plotting to take over the world, and one person (mostly) stands in their way. Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives for the sole purpose - to destroy the masses of vampires, who slowly but surely moved into the world and shared it with humanity. For the most part, the human race is blind to the fact that there are vampires around them. Vampires even took familiars, people who aspire to be vampires and do the dirty work of vampires to show how worthy they are to be “turned”. <br /> <br /> Now that I think about it. There are many elements in this movie that look like the plot line of Roddy Piper's film They Live. Hidden enemy, hidden group of people, conspiracy against them, the struggle for the salvation of the human race ... all that is present in the Blade. <br /> <br /> This is not the best game. Snipes, at best, is only slightly better than some of his other roles; N'Bush Wright, a relative newcomer, is not so bad; Chris Christopherson is forgotten as Blade's assistant (he is the same for Blade as Chip for the Punisher). Stephen Dorff does the best job of the whole cast here, as the “main” vampire you just love to hate. <br /> <br /> I don’t know, but I just liked the special effects in this movie. From the blood-soaked vampire-style rave, right up to the inevitable fight in the final of the film, the special effects are not so bad. Of course, there is enough blood and blood, but in the end, it's a movie about vampires, right? The various forms and types of weapons that Blade uses are quite unique and are not commonly used in modern action films. Snipes has a great talent with a curved sword than, say, with a machine gun. Plus, a lot more thoughts about fighting the blade than just dumbfounded. (Unless, of course, you are not Indiana Jones.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not the best action movie that has ever been shot, but it’s not all that bad. As a bonus, the music and soundtrack are also very cool. Tell me, in what other films can you hear super drum and bass like Source Direct or Photek ?! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
