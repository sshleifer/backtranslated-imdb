This is a cute film with Spanky, Lucerne and Buckwheat from the comedy “Our Gang”. Being in the south during the Civil War, it may seem a bit strange to see Buckwheat Spanky's slave, but this film is as charming as the best of shorts with the same cast. It was the only feature film "Our Gang", and I highly recommend it to remake "Little Scammers" since 1994.
