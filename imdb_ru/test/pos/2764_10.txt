I saw this movie on the big screen in childhood and loved it - dampness and all that. I recently found a copy on the video and checked it again. Badly done, of course ... shocking fun, definitely. It still packs an interesting punch. It is much more fun than the dismal version of Disney (“Live”). The only thing that "Live" managed better - these are special effects. If you like bi-films, I highly recommend Survive, not to mention other films about Rene Cardona Jr. and Mexican wrestling filmed by his father (Rene Cardona-Snr). It is high time to "survive" to handle a special DVD release. Are you listening, all you kind people, in Anchor Bay ...?
