It was a day in 1891, when Scottish inventor William K.L. Dixon surprised his boss Thomas Alvu Edison with his remarkable film making work. After many experiments, Dixon could now shoot real-life scenes with his camera and reproduce them with his invention, the kinetoscope, as if a fragment of time had been stored in a celluloid. Soon, the Dixon kinetoscope will be a huge success as a new form of entertainment, with many people seeking to pay the nickel that is charged for watching people dancing, or acrobats performing stunts with the help of the kinetoscope. However, the invention was not completed, so that it could capture the real life as we know it, the sound was required in the films. So Dixon continued to experiment, and this short experiment, the first Kinetophone movie, was the result. <br /> <br /> In this experiment, codenamed “Dickson Experimental Sound Film”, directed by William K.L. Dixon stands in front of a recording cone for a wax cylinder (the earliest method of recording sound) with a violin in his hands, playing a song called "Young's Song". The idea was to record the song in the cylinder at the same time as the camera recorded his movements. To show that it was a film, two from the Black Mary lab of Edison decided to dance a bit in front of the camera. Unlike what the author Vito Russo stated in his book Celluloid Cabinet, this little dance had nothing to do with homosexuality, since it is obviously a reference to the laboratory’s loneliness environment, akin to the lonely sailors who are “Song” “Cabins” (dedicated to this name (as Rousseau suggests, “Gay Brothers” is actually an anachronism, since at the end of the 1890s the words “gay” had no homosexual meaning). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Dixon failed to achieve the desired effect, and the Kinetophone could never act But producing synchronized sound with images. While he had a cylinder with sound and celluloid with images, the synchronization of the two elements was not entirely effective, and the sudden appearance of Auguste and Louis Lumiere's Synumatograph prompted Edison’s team to focus on designing systems, and eventually Dixon left the company, Fortunately, in 1998, the Dixon cylinder with the sound of the film was restored, and the film's editor, Walter March, performed the restoration of the experiment, as it was intended. Finally, “Dickson Experimental Sound Film” could be heard with synchronized sound, as its creative inventor suggested. Although it was not a successful attempt, this outstanding film is evidence of the enormous genius of Kinetoskop’s father. 8/10
