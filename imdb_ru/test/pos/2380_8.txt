I agree that Monster of Mexico is the weakest of modern Scooby Doo movies, mainly because of the weak plot and its predictability. The Loch Ness monster, however, is a significant improvement, with great animation, to be honest, Scotland looked beautiful. The music is good, the plot is well thought out. Plus, there is some great dialogue, and the dubbing was unbelievable, with Casey Kasem constant admiration for Shaggy, and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena Istan, a pleasant surprise in the role of guest starring. In fact, my only complaints were some strange accents in one or two participants in the voice act, with the exception of Isten, whose accent sounded sincere, and somehow the Loch Ness monster was not as well designed as it was possible. In general, Scooby-Doo is a solid and enjoyable movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox
