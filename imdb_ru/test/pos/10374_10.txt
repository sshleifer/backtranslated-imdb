Aunt Cora was always tactless, and her raised family ignored a remark she made after the funeral of her brother Richard: “He was killed, wasn’t he?”. They remembered this the next day, when Cora was found cruelly killed by an ax ... <br /> <br /> For some reason, this year’s POIROT films were far from being faithful to the original book. I was disappointed with the changes to the CARDS ON THE TABLE - my favorite book by Poirot. “After the Funeral” is my second favorite book about Poirot, and I was afraid that the story would be destroyed. Did not have! The film was almost true on all pages, right down to the killer motifs! All the actors were great, but my favorite is to be Monica Dolan, who is very good in the role of Miss Gilchrist, the companion of the late Aunt Cora. No doubt the best movie of Poirot!
