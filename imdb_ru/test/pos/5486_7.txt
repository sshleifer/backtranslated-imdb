"In the Line of Fire" tells the story of the game between the old presidential bodyguard and the former government assassin who became a psycho. A secret service agent / bodyguard (Eastwood) is protected, and the killer (Malkovich) is under attack. Rates? President live. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie ... I saw it on TV many times and recently bought it on DVD. However, this is not a great movie. The plot is too thin, and attempts to thicken it are completely ridiculous. The whole love story is not very believable, and the way they brought the additional character into the story, just to kill it, offends a more or less reasonable viewer. Although I feel that these mistakes cannot be forgiven, I can easily trace them to Mr. Malkovich’s elegant execution. I always thought he was a great actor, but in this film he is really on fire. There is a reason why he received an Oscar nomination. René Rousseau and Clint Eastwood were fine, but I do not consider their performance unforgettable. They never do the best of their abilities. <br /> <br /> If you don’t expect too much, you’ll surely like this movie. This is not a masterpiece, but John Malkovich is really extraordinary, and I do not think that anyone can enjoy his performance. Really worth seeing ...
