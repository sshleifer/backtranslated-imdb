I'm so glad I taped this film when it appeared on the BBC last month! It blew my mind so stunning and real. David Tennant is absolutely incredible about this, even though his character is not always so easy to love or identify. The last scene, where he performs the song, just broke my eyes, those eyes .... <br /> <br /> I guess he shot this film between the Doctor Who series, and that makes him even more achievements for me. I just love Doctor Who, and yet I saw absolutely nothing about him in the image of Mr. Tennant of this man, who knows that he has changed, and is struggling to create some kind of new identity and life. intense drama!
