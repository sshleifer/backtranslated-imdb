First of all - this film is not for everyone. There are scenes of extreme graphic violence and “disturbing” images, which by their nature will turn off many potential viewers. Obviously from the reviews on this board - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY shared those who saw it. I am among those who really enjoyed it for several reasons. I feel that this was a very ambitious (and fairly well-executed ...) event for a 18/19 group with no budget and little experience. I think that every aspect of the film - direction, action (although the character’s actions are more like stage or arbitrary performance due to the nature of the film ...) production, FX, musical score / sound design - they all far exceed many of the films I saw that exceed the budget of these children and 10 times their experience. Honestly, I haven't been so impressed with an art house horror movie since GENESIS Nacho Serda ... <br /> <br /> Firstly, I don’t intend to pretend that I understand and / or comprehend everything graphic the content in this film - but, knowing that this film was not narrative, I was not disappointed with the way it was played. SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is 4 relatively short vignettes that revolve around the theory of the right hemisphere of the brain / left lust / anger / psychosis against restraint / compassion / "normality". To give a very brief overview of each “chapter”: <br /> <br /> EGG EYE IS basically just a naked girl who has an eyeball cut from her belly. I am sure that this is something symbolic - I do not think that at that moment I paid so much attention, and this moment passes rather quickly. <br /> <br /> The next “episode” - “HUMAN LOVE” is a nihilistic, terrifying, truly creepy story about a guy who is in love with his pregnant sister and repels her, which leads to his growing psychosis, which leads to the shocking conclusion of this particular chapter. HUMAN LARVA - the best of all that is in my book, and is likely to fall under your skin. The narrative dialogue underlines the growing tension, as you know that something terrible will happen, but you are not quite sure what it is. Do yourself a favor, and if you are interested in watching this film - do not do too much research on it. Come to this with an open mind and an iron stomach, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised, especially with this particular episode. <br /> <br /> “Revival” gathers people into the field who dig the ground and blow out trees and all that jazz. Apparently, the "skilful" interpretation of the rape of the earth or something like that. Not bad, but this one is also rather short, and I somehow lost sight of it ... <br /> <br /> AND THE RIGHT BRAIN / MARTIRD seems to be about religion and religious hypocrisy, as well as HUMAN LARVA, has some of OVARIAN EYEBALL is the most complex "image / message of the entire function ..." is not something worth telling, mainly because of the very short working time, but it makes a decent transition to the next frenzy. .. and REVIVAL is also partly short and not quite thought-provoking, but HUMAN LARVA (especially) and RIGHT BRAIN / MARTIRD only mediocre and well made, they more than compensate for the other parts. I think that the main reason I liked this one so much is that, despite the fact that it is “shocking”, “repulsive”, “violent” and “excessive”, it is also very beautifully made, and you You can say that it was a real work. love from those involved. Nothing in the film seems cheap or hasty, and even if the content is not fully decoded, it is undoubtedly original - and these are just some of the points in my book. Not that every “strange art house” film that has an incomprehensible plot deserves praise for its “originality”, but SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY is a type of film that I think I will see several times in the near future to see what else interpretations I can extract from this. Again, this film is ABSOLUTELY not for everyone - with some VERY extreme scenes of bloody, murderous, raped, incest, blasphemous images, etc., which definitely exist to shock the viewer to look at this film more closely. I have to say that it worked for me, and I look forward to the collaboration between Hussein and Serda, which is rumored to be next. Check it out if you have a stomach for this - 9.5 / 10
