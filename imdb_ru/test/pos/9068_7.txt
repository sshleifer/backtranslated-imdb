The story in this film is rather implausible, but the script demanded that the eerie guy play the main role, and in 1940 it meant Peter Lorre. And in this St. Petersburg, he is most terrible, as the owner of the island is Stephen Danel, who is imprisoned by prisoners to work at his diamond mine on the island. Upon arrival, parolees discover that they are slaves of miners who can be beaten or killed at the whim of Danel. <br /> <br /> It seems that only two things are worse than those of slaves; Danel's wife and monkey monkeys irritate him so much that his violence against them probably leads to the only meat that slaves receive. <br /> <br /> Lorre does an excellent job with his role here and sneaks up on the screen with industrial forces. Although the script is not a Casablanca caliber, editing is very difficult and there are no wasted scenes. This is a very watchable story, but I'm not sure which niche this film has filled. Too long for a short plot and too short for a full-length film, I'm not sure how it was sold in movie theaters. <br /> <br /> I just caught it for the first time late at night / early morning TCM show. Fans of Lorre won't want to miss it if they haven't seen it.
