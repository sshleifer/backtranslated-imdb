I must be getting old because I was chained to this film the first time I saw it. I am watching it again right now on HBO. This is a very simple film about two people who fall in love after they learned that the couple had an affair. The plot is very thin, but the actors played very well in this film. In a combination of Kristen Scott Thomas, running for the convention, and Harrison Ford, who works in the police force of the interior, the two meet under unfortunate circumstances and fall in love. I love the soundtrack. Perfect fit. One thing I can't understand, this film had a budget of 68 million dollars. Was it spent? Plane crash or salary of Harrison Ford?
