I saw "Nurse Betty" twice in September 2000 at the International Film Festival "Films by the Sea" in Vlissingen, the Netherlands. It made such a strong impression on me that I continued to smile the whole day after I watched it for the first time, and almost the whole evening again, when I took the film as the last taste of the festival. What I knew about Nurse Betty was, in short, that Renee Zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap opera. But what I saw was much more than that! Great roles for Morgan Freeman, Chris Roca and Renee Zellweger. A strange mixture of romance, violence and traffic. And for the whole story, which takes other directions every moment when you think that you are on the track. Many fans of the soap opera will like “nurse Betty” - both the film and the character !!! - but they can bring there all friends without soap, because they will like the plot even more for tough and humorous lines - freeman and rock - for cruel scenes, aspects of thriller and for beautiful pictures. And I’m quite sure that in the end everyone will love "nurse Betty" for her charming and innocent charm !!!
