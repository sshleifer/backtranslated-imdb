It may be interesting for people to know that this film was shot without the help of Phulan Devi herself, and when she finally saw part of it, she was so furious that she announced that the film should not be shown in India, or she would shoot herself in gasoline set himself on fire I do not know whether it was shown at all or not, but, given its credibility at the time as a novice politician, I doubt it. Since then, I have seen a report that she was removed from office and charged with further crimes from her days of Dacoit, as a result of which she was hiding. <br /> <br /> In addition to her own fears, this is an excellent film, made all the more by its refreshingly cruel approach; not a single melodrama with a pink tinge that you would expect from a typical Indian film. It should be emphasized that concerns about how actually the messages of the film and the like are feminist do not really matter: this is a true story. It seems her concerns are related not to what is depicted, but to how the film depicts it.
