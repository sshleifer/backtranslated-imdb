This neo-film noir is one of the genres of American films of the end of the twentieth century, in which, it seems, all involved are corrupt characters, fast cars, a highway lane and, of course, a lot of guns owned by people who never seem to take up arms security course. Actors are the best reason to see “Black Day, Blue Night”. There is a late, great Y.T. Walsh (Rocking Blade, Pleasantville, Red Rock West, The Last Seduction, and many others), who appeared in many neo-films (see also “Destruction”). Then come Michelle Forbes from Star Trek: The Next Generation and Murder. (In the role of support, there is even the late Bejamin Lum, who also appeared in the Star Trek episode entitled Naked Now.) In a way, the spoiler is a hint: only the most innocent survive, but innocence is a very relative term in such a film, and you probably won’t guess who is innocent before the final movie.
