Unusual second part of ATORA !! Directed quickly by JOE D'AMATO, an expert on all types of subspecies (subgenres) exploitation, and again interpreted by MILES O'KEEFFE. Debio's film budget should be ridiculous or minimal. Although the Antecessor film is not the best, it is not entertained, ATOR 2 also has something that makes it interesting. His introduction, which you support, explains the origin of ATOR to us with the images of the first part. The script is incredible, like any comic brilliant ROYA THOMAS. In the world of the sword there are such fantastic elements and such FANTASY as invisible people, black gentlemen, cannibals - monkeys ... the role of the villain, which this one brilliantly interpreted. not enough violence and blood, but that's good. It never gets boring. It has everything that was missing in ATOR 1. Be fascinated by me with me !! 4/5
