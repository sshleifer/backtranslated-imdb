Beyond Rangoon is one of the most emotional and intense films in history. Superbly filmed by John Burman and actively played by Patricia Arquette, this film can easily be called one of the best films of the 90s. The plot and vivid characters simply capture the audience from the very beginning and never let go. After seeing the film, the viewer can never forget “Beyond Rangoon”. The film has earned little money at the box office, and is little known, but should be noticeable. Watching this, you can say that it was intended to be viewed by a large audience. This is a very important and touching film that everyone should watch. <br /> <br />
