As in Rififi, the most compelling scene in the film is the perfect silence of the robbery of a precious stone. Scene workshop in its performance, each of the robbers has its own specialized work, each of which successfully combines his unique talent to achieve the goal, and each, up to a month ago, is full of strangers. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are played very slowly. In fact, the opening scene is a long acquaintance of the characters with Corey and Vogel, since we see Corey being released from prison, and Vogel avoids being arrested on the way to prison. These two characters then methodically unite through fate at a roadside diner when Vogel hides in Corey’s trunk. Because of this incredible breakthrough, two strangers agree to become partners in order to accomplish a perfect and accurate robbery of a precious stone. <br /> <br /> However, in order to pull out this robbery, they must include the help of a third person named Jansen. Jansen was hired as a reliable shooter. His inclusion in the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. During his tenure, Jansen was in full battle with DT and spent most of his day on his bed, hallucinating over lizards, snakes and spiders. His transition from the disheveled and hallucinatory world of William S. Burroughs’s dream to an uncompromising and sober sharp shooter is very fast and perhaps the only real fake moment in the film, but this is just me very picky. > <br /> Another frivolous note was noticed by police inspector Matthew. At times, he seemed brilliant in the ways of strong arming the right people or gathering information and waiting for his escaped prisoner to make his move. In other cases, he seemed to be retired 10 years ago, especially at the beginning, when Vogel ran through the forest. <br /> <br /> I wonder if I understood too much of the hidden meaning from the very beginning of the film. At the beginning of the film, when the police car is racing around the city, the first image we see is a red brake light. My first thought was that it could be a “red circle” and that if I want to find a deeper meaning in the film, perhaps this is what this car, or rather the people inside it, going through the red light, will be those who "stop" the robbery of the precious stone. Hmmm <br /> <br /> Maybe the red circle denotes the thief ring of the triumvirate? Perhaps it was a burning sleigh? Never mind. <br /> <br /> This is a long film, but it doesn't seem so. The ending is a little disappointing. It seemed too quick for a film that felt like such a delicious slow burn. 9/10 <br /> <br /> Clark Richards
