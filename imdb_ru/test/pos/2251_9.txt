Perfection seems to be rare in Hallwood today. Many believe that only two of the best nominees of the year demonstrate meaning for the film industry. And in “All Illuminated,” the label goes straight. <br /> <br /> The film begins its brilliance with a beautiful staging scene. From the very beginning, you get a feeling of warmth and true family connections and relationships with each other. Also, the cast is excellent. For Elijah Wood's character, Jonathon, his sensitivity is expressed in the fact that he holds the hand of his dying grandmother. And for a character called Alex it is easy to see his life from his perspective - a real Ukrainian rock star. With an illuminated cast, this story slowly penetrates our minds first when Jonathon decides to go to Ukraine to meet a woman who is believed to have saved his grandfather, that is, the whole family. And from there, the plot films are slow, but they keep fast paced by the contrast of the dripping tears of drama and the laughing humor of loud included in the scene behind the scenes in each scene. <br /> <br /> Although the film itself is quite rewarding, there are several complaints from other sources commenting on the inaccurate adaptation of Lieb Srieber to the novel by Jonathon Safron Foer. Personally, I never read a novel. But any film, especially this film, in particular, should be judged not by whether the storyboard movie’s storyboard matches the book’s storyline, but rather as the main ideas from the novel were expressed and used in the film. The fact that he may be implausible from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer necessary for review - it is still there. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, new information is very slowly flooding the audience. Some of these thoughts never respond; and in fact, the second half of the film reorients its entire theme and reason for traveling in Ukraine to something else, but rather similar to the original intentions of this film. The film, however, leaves you on a contented note - but for faint-hearted souls a tear can fall. And throughout the film. sensible people with a good sense of humor may have to just laugh at the fun and constant conversations of Alex and John. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to several types of people: those who like films that share the drama-comedy genre for those who are interested in family ties, and for those who are interested in Holocaust subjects. And to those crazy people who find farce as a funny comedy, this film is not for you. And for you, to whom it seems that this is a seriously funny and absolutely brilliantly funny movie, you are wrong; This film divides comedic moments and dramatic episodes. And for those who judge a film by its probability with a corresponding novel, you may or may not enjoy this film, but this film is worth taking much more than if it were close to the book. <br /> <In general, “Everything is illuminated” is a brilliant work that will enlighten everyone’s hearts.
