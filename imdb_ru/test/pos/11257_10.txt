I just watched this movie tonight (November 5, 2005) for the first time. I wanted to watch it, because I saw the basketball diaries (Leonardo DiCaprio) and I liked it, but it was much harder. I think it was a good description of drugs to some extent. I sympathize mainly with the character of Nick Stals, perhaps because if I were someone I was crazy about, I would like to help them with this. A promising student and athlete who spends all his time studying and studying is quite understandable that he would like to try teenage life (the crazy side of it), and in his efforts to help his friend he eventually becomes addicted to what it is all about and because of his terrible family situation that leads to his most tragic death. A truly sad film, but I noticed one drawback: you donâ€™t understand very well how much damage it does to families, but other than that, excellent performance in a truly heartbreaking film.
