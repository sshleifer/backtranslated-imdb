This is a silent movie. This is a simple story about a writer who cannot write his story, returning to his hometown to begin, but instead he enters into friendship with a strange old man, whose life externally represents perhaps the inner state of the writer - this is a museum of unfinished ideas outdated equipment and "useless" people. <br /> <br /> There are no extraordinary circumstances or any major movements in the plot. This is a film about internal change. Being stuck in their life, which develops little, the main characters get the opportunity to help each other transform, stop going away in a dream and achieve something, or at least make a change and give their life the desired and long-awaited new direction. /> <br /> With regard to filmmaking, I can only recall one weakness, which can also be viewed as a feature - we do not get a lot of character description or understanding of the inner world. This is a very narrative side of thoughts and events, and we have to guess their true feelings, which are quite hidden, but still you can see them, and this is what makes your own mind work, trying to understand them, understand the impressions made by these people, and it is not empty beneath them - the actors definitely hold well some of the internal states corresponding to their characters. It is close to real life, when you almost never know someone well enough to understand him completely, and it turns us around and puts us in front of our own feelings and choices. <br /> <br /> For me the most important thing is that this simple, almost flat story leaves you to reflect on your own life, your own dreams and achievements, are there any or are we seized by the routine and pleasures, leaving 100% or just dreaming about it, we could do more and move somewhere that we would like to be, and not just feed ourselves and others with stories like “I will do it once” - do not move with one finger, to make it really happen, or “I'm fine where I am,” because the footprint is easier Vat habits, you make any changes? At least, I had such an impression, and it was very timely for me, which adds to my appreciation for this far from famous film. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves films meant for the heart, but those who need events and actions should stay away.
