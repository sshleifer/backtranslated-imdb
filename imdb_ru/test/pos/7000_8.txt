Let me spend a moment of your time to explain how I approached this film. First, I threw trailers out of control, because the film turned out to be an uncredited remake of the film “Aliens”, which I consider to be one of the weakest films in the “Aliens” series. Stupidly continuing to reject the film after I heard positive reviews about it from people whose opinion I trust, I completely missed the theatrical production. Then I got hooked on Farscape in the 3rd or 4th season at the time and found Pitch Black on the cable one night before going to bed - so I said, “Oh, why not, at least Claudia Black is in it ". Soon I recognized Keith David and began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser can all act (why I’m surprised I don’t know). I was captivated. I now remained captive for four years. I just watched the movie for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it. <br /> <br /> This is not a feature film, not independent, and it is not entirely original, but where it cannot break a lot of new possibilities, it fully succeeds in providing interesting, realistic characters, intense action in exciting, but simple plot and non-stop entertainment; Absolutely beautiful setting with stylish effects. Sounds good to be true? Don't take my word for it ... see for yourself. <br /> <br /> The film also emphasized the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, representing Richard Riddick's character. Diesel continued to play a major role in its "Riddick Chronicles" (which I also liked, although I recognized their rather large flaws) and now has become something of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so large and so interesting to watch, that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor, but also smart. Check out the DVD version of Pitch Black, where audio comments can simply shock you. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the crew of an intersystem transport ship that landed on an unknown planet after a crash. landing in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced, but bright and heroic (Mitchell), but he is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who was surgically changed to see in the dark (Diesel). It's all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry. <br /> <br /> What an unoriginal and unbelievable thing, whatever it is, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well narrated and very well performed. Do not expect to learn something, and do not expect that you have to think a lot, but expect to enjoy this modern science fiction classic game.
