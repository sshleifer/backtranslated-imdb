I first heard about the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya from a reviewer on Youtube. He literally hit the show with big, angry, pompous criticism, condemning that shit and confusing. Curiously, I decided to watch the show (as soon as I understood the order of the episodes, thanks to those who made the lists), and I found it absolutely brilliant and enjoyable to watch. Great memorable characters that are full of life and absolutely attractive and fun; unique and not excessive plot, which makes sense now, when I watched the show; and two of the best anime moments in history, in my opinion. Plus the opening and ending themes are great. <br /> <br /> Anime, based on a collection of successful manga novels, follows a simple story as soon as you understand it. While the main character is the center of attention of the show, Haruhi Suzumiya, the point of view belongs to her friend Kion. Kayon is a regular high school student who doesn't really believe in supernatural things (like Santa Claus, newcomers, time travelers, ghosts, espers), but soon ends up talking to Haruhi, who is the weirdest girl in School and I prefer to meet with a foreigner, considering all men useless. She even joined every club in the school to find something interesting, but quit as quickly as she joined. Following the “advice” of Kayon, Haruhi decides to create his own club with the Kayon club. Being in the literary club hall, Haruhi forms the SOS Brigade - her mission to investigate supernatural cases (think Scooby-Doo minus the dog, the masked man and the Secret Machine). <br /> <br /> Haruhi "recruits" three additional members. First, it is Yuki Nagato, a kind of bookworm, who speaks very little and spends most of the time reading and sitting. The second is Mikuru Asahina, a shy girl that Haruhi forces into a club that thinks they need a cute talisman to do some things. Haruhi often makes her dress in costumes to increase her attractiveness. The third is Itsuki Koizumi, a friendly and sociable student who always smiles. Although Haruhi believes that her group is filled with normal people, it can not be more erroneous. While Kyon is as normal as possible, the other three are quite unique on the other hand — Yuuki is an alien, Mikuru is a time traveler from the future, and Itsuki is an esper (a person who has ESP). All three came to look after Haruhi, who can only have the powers of God, and if she gets bored, she can reveal her strength and create a whole new world, and Kayon is somehow involved in this. <br /> The show is worth seeing with great characters, music and fun and wonderful moments. However, there are some sexual references for parents, including splitting Mikuru, who has been exposed or touched several times, and several obscene words have been used. In addition, the show is one of the greats.
