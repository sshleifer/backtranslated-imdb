In a world in which controversial and misunderstood items can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes one at the top of this list; Moreover, he does this objectively and realistically, with sensitivity and sensitivity, which make him a truly great film for any measuring rod. And, in order to add some irony to all this, even the subject of this film was widely misunderstood, as it is mistakenly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; is not. At the heart of The Walking Dead, directed by Tim Robbins, is a topic that, in fact, is probably the most misunderstood of all, and for good reason, because for a person this may be the most difficult thing in fact. - and really - I understand. And that's the whole movie: forgiveness. Real forgiveness; Do not apologize for the monstrous crime or its culprit - do not say that what happened is good - but find the strength to continue and do it, choosing life. <br /> <br /> Director / screenwriter Tim Robbins prepared and delivered the faithful adaptation of Sister Helen Prezhin’s novel, in which she discusses her involvement in prisoners sentenced to death for whom she served her faith in God for many years. . As noted in the film, what for her was to be a lifelong desire not only for justice, but also for human dignity, began with a simple letter to a prisoner-suicide bomber in a Louisiana state prison in Angola. Sentenced to death for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) addressed everyone who would listen when his letter was in the hands of Sister Prezhin (Susan Sarandon), who soon found herself in an area where she had absolutely no knowledge or experience. And Robbins successfully captured Prezhan’s sister's emotional and turbulent journey, managing to save him without any sentimentality, which makes him not only real, trustworthy and believable, but also makes him sharp and emotionally attractive to the audience. Thanks to cinema, which was once a personal, significant emotional experience for sister Prezhin, he becomes what they see this film for everyone. <br /> <br /> For her exciting, passionate picture of Sister Prezhin, Susan Sarandon deservedly won an Oscar for Best Actress. Sensitive and fraught with emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way she conveys the basic natural fragility and vulnerability of her sister Prejean, whom she adamantly held back because of the strength with which she had to continue her efforts on behalf of Poncelet. (and in fact there are only five of them from the beginning). Regardless of your point of view regarding the issues addressed in this film, Sister Prejean is, without a doubt, a man of heroic proportions, which Sarandon personifies gracefully here; and she does this without resorting to any unnecessary melodramatic, but rather making it real, subtly and humbly exploring humanity in a very plausible expression of characteristics. This extraordinary performance, perhaps the best of Sarandon’s brilliant career. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn was the best in his career, who was nominated for the best male role for the role of Poncelet (he lost to Nicolas Cage, who won for his performance at Leaving. Las Vegas). Perfect for the role, Penn simply was never better, either before or after. He actually represents Poncelet as a real person, and not a bloated caricature of a monster capable of committing the crimes depicted here. Not that it made Poncelet less despicable; on the contrary, in fact. This is really embarrassing when I come across the fact that someone like a guy who can live with you may be capable of such things. And this is the power of Penn's execution - it is so disturbingly real, represented by the depth and nuances; you only need to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a restless soul. A terrific performance and - as if Cage were not at Vegas - Penn should have won an Oscar for him. <br /> <br /> In another outstanding performance, Raymond J. Barry is remembered in a supporting role as Count Delacroix, father of one of the victims of Poncelet. With limited screen time, he nevertheless develops his character in a way that allows you to empathize with him, as well as with sister Prezhin, because it is through him that we get some idea of ​​how complicated and outwardly inconstant her position. At least on the surface. Barry presents Delacroix in such a way as to give the plot the necessary balance and perspective, which ultimately is extremely effective and helps to emphasize the meaning of the film. <br /> <br /> The cast includes R. Lee Emery (Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Mother Helen), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Robert Maxwell (Lucille Poncelet) , Margot Martindale (sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet). It is doubtful that this film will in any way change the opinion of any person about the death penalty, but this was never the intention; what was intended was to make a thought-provoking, emotionally engaging film, which is exactly what Robbins accomplished with The Walking Dead. Regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact, and hopefully, will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness. For, as we see through the character of Count Delacroix, true forgiveness is not something that a person simply decides to do, but a task that can become a matter of a lifetime. And this is perhaps one of the most difficult things in life to perform effectively; and you leave this film with gratitude for people like Sister Prezhin, who dedicatedly dedicated her life to helping those in need, and for directors such as Robbins and Sarandon, for bringing her to life for millions of people who would never otherwise would not have recognized her. I rate this 10/10. <br /> <br />
