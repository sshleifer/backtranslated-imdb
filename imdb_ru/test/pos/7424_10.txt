I used to enjoy "Happy Ever After", but I was absolutely hypnotized by "Terry & June". After the departure of Aunt Lucy, the emphasis was on the relationship between Terry and June, an English middle-aged couple belonging to the middle class, and I really liked it, and I happily lost myself in every episode. The 1980s were the era of alternative comedy, but they were a decade of choice â€” and Terry and June certainly fit the more traditional tastes. And my - and I, too, was a big fan of "Young"! Every week, Terry found herself in a stupid situation, and June lost her composure and usually ended up rescuing him. No matter how obsolete these shows may seem now - it was a different world, but it is very interesting to see trends from the 1980s, such as the plot line of the 1982 CB Radio (CB radio legalized in England in November 1981) when Terry was imprisoned in his car in the back of a truck! I recently watched a DVD show again, and I still think they are awesome! Not the favorite of the enlightened elite - chatting classes, but a huge blow to the masses! Wonderful!
