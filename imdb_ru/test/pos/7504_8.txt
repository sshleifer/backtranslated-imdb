Another black comedy that won an Oscar for best screenplay. Starring George Scott, it redefines the phrase “breaking a new hole in $$”. In this case, the goal is Medicare and America's Grand Hospital. Throughout the hospital, patients and doctors die, because their names and prescriptions change. Scott roars, screams and blows up his workers and bosses as they fail more and more. His comment about Dachau to one of his many bosses will surely cause laughter. He even beats and rapes hippies 3 times. This is what you need to see and hear, as monologues and monologues are key moments of the film.
