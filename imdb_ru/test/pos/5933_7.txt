Royal Rumble has traditionally been one of my favorite events, and I have been a fan of it for several years now. Other shows may have better matches, but I have always found that the real crash is full of excitement. <br /> <br /> I am not going to disclose the winners in any match, since I don’t see it would be fair to spoil the results of the review. I will comment on their quality. <br /> <br /> We have 4 standard matches and then a big rumble event. Two from SmackDown and two from Raw. <br /> <br /> Sean Michaels and Edge open for Raw. This is a good match between two talented guys. This is a match that I would recommend to watch. It is difficult to sum up, not giving the winner. <br /> <br /> Then we have the usual Undertaker against some big nasty monster, whoever he is. Giant Gonzalez, Yokozuna, Kamal ... well, this time it's Heidenreich. It is also a match box. The typical Undertaker rate. See if you are a fan. I must confess that I am just for fun. It can hardly be considered a classic struggle. <br /> <br /> The next two matches are title shots. This time, SmackDdown manages to push into the background Raw. Their title match is pretty exciting and enjoyable, but with anti-climax and disappointment. Match Row is pretty boring and boring, and I'm sorry that I support both guys. <br /> <br /> Now for the main reason I love this event, hum. This is pretty good this year. Approaching this event, we all had a pretty good idea of ​​who can win, and this may not be a big surprise, but, hey, this is very nice. There are the usual various ways to eliminate people. There is a guy with symbols who does not enter the ring, a competitor who is absurd, and we all want to see the losers, and someone excludes a previously destroyed combatant. He has his usual ups and downs, and I liked the finale, in particular the entrance of Vince McMahon. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this show. Not WWE in great shape, but still good. Add it to your collection.
