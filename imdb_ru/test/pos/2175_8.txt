I recently read the story to see how these two match, and if you can believe it, this film will improve Balzac. I think the story unfolds to dispel the idea that Colonel Chaber is a man who has suffered greatly, and yet he comes home, not a hero, but an outcast. <br /> <br /> As someone mentioned I was initially embarrassed if Chaber was like the Return of Martin Guerra. Not. Balzac firmly established that Chaber is a real bargain. It is interesting, however, not he, not he, but how his wife and society relate to him. <br /> <br /> I think this is an eternal story about men who go to fight for their country, and when they come home, time has left them behind. Chaber - a tragic figure, which was even more struck by the amazing Gerard Depardieu. I don't care that he starred in 1 million films, he is charming. <br /> <br /> Fanny Ardant has a horrible character. Once, prostitute Rose used her feminine tricks to climb the social ladder. Are her emotions true for Compte Ferraud? I think that they are possibly related to her social position at that time, and you start to feel some sympathy for her. <br /> <br /> Fabrice Lucini slowly sneaks into my heart. He is exceptional here, like Dervill. <br /> <br /> I think that if you can get this gem of a film, you will not regret it. French cinema in all its glory.
