I agree with BigAlC - this film actually prepared me for many cultural differences and practices before I moved to live in Japan for a year in 1993. Tom Selleck, as always, does a fantastic job, and the film is very funny and informative. I'm a big fan of Tom Selleck, and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma, bringing the film to life in such a way that I cannot imagine that any other actor could play this role. <br /> <br /> Several first-class Japanese actors took part in this film, and it was very interesting to watch them when they talked to Sellek - I can imagine how much pleasure he got while shooting the film - Japan is an amazing place to be go, whether you want to have fun, see or just try everything.
