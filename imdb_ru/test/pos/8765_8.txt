Diversant is a 1942 film, partly aimed at gaining US support in the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, this is great entertainment. The lead actors are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stenwick to play roles that would give the film more status. In any case, this is a good film in which Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane bring their own personal style to the characters. As in other Hitchcock films, we see the director’s disregard for the social and good-natured. He often portrayed spies and foreign agents as pleasant people from the upper class, who at the same time mocked democratic values ​​and such concepts as guilt until they were innocent. These supreme traitors are the last to be pursued by the police or even suspected. Hitchcock didn’t trust the police all his life. He wanted to raise an ordinary guy, a bandler and a guy who doesn't take himself too seriously. You can see that he wanted Gary Cooper to be an icon in the shape of Frank Capra. However, Bob Cummings puts his own stamp on the boy next door and works well in this role. Priscilla Lane, the leading feminine figure, looks like an all-American girl who is very good at herself when she is tested. Robert Cummings, as a defense factory worker Barry Kane, was created for the bombing that kills his best friend. This leads to a cross-country race that resembles other Hitchcock heroes on the run. Hitchcock repeats some of the well-proven formulas from previous films - a reluctant woman involved in action, for example. Madeleine Carroll in 39 steps and risks her life to evade the authorities, who stand on his heels. We look at scenes from America when Kane is trying to find the real culprit in the bombardment he is accused of. We see rivers, bridges, houses in the wilderness, truckers, the Hoover Dam and, finally, New York. New York is a suitable backdrop for the climax when we go from Rockefeller Center to the ocean liners (with a cut on the Normandy ship) and to the final of the Statue of Liberty. Great movie with continuous action. Do not miss it.
