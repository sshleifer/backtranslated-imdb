So many literary adaptations are frustrating. There are many reasons for this, but usually it is the need to cut a complex novel to the size of a script. The dead are unusual - they needed to be “added”, since the story itself is a tiny, relatively short gem. In fact, this may be the best story in English. Gabriel Conroy realized that his life and the lives of many people around him are controlled by memories of the dead in beautiful language. Even his own long-term wife loved a man who is now deceased more than he. <br /> <br /> Bringing such a short story to the movies has always been difficult. John Houston did a great job. He never gave in to the temptation to play along with him or use fancy techniques to expand the story. It's simple and true, with an outstanding game. The only minor slip is the use of music to accompany the destructive final monologue. <br /> <br /> Rarely, when the cinematic version of a literary masterpiece is itself a masterpiece, but I think it’s fair to use this term for this film. This is not a bravura part of making a film, but it is simple and pure - I always think about the films of Ozu, when I think of the Dead, it is on that level of purity, simplicity and deep wisdom.
