All comments on this film are negative so far, but I must say that I found the Network attractive. Few films can keep me on the edge of my place, but this one did. Another advantage is that most militants / militants are full of language, but there was little profanity in it. I found this nice movie to watch. I'm a little prejudiced, though, being a big fan of Sandra Bullock. * Wink *
