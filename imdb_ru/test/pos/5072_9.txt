Some films are designed to simply entertain you, others - to make you laugh, or cry, or lift your spirits, others, like this one, tend to provoke, make you think and anger. I was angry at this film, not at the film, but at the fact that it is true that America, free, tortures the illogical view that it does it for the good. The scenes of torture in this film were heartbreaking, people's indifference was destroyed, the film was convincing in its arguments and showed how wrong it is to torture people. Of course, now it makes me a “bleeding liberal” label, imposed on people by others, which cover the minds of the facts that this really happens and should not. People who do not understand that, as they say in the film, for each person who was tortured, you get ten or a hundred people who rebel against acts of revenge. You get an increasing cycle of violence. This film did not make me hate America, although I can see how he could do it, but he made me hate how America responded in its world after 9/11. There is an important quotation in the film: right after we learned that 19 people died and seventy-five were injured at the bomb site, the quotation “one American is dead” is what matters. You cannot kill an American, America can kill thousands, but you cannot kill a single American, or they will do everything possible, including torture, to get justice. This is the American way, apparently. Call me a liberal, call me naive (although I think people who believe that torture is good, naive), call me cheated, call me whatever you like, but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in America today and in the West. I would like this film to be shown to all schoolchildren, at a minimum. This film will stay with me for a long time, a part of me would like me to forget it, because I would like this kind of thing to never happen, but I know that it happens, the other part of me wants me to never forget , because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent their recurrence. Whatever happens to me, this film will be with me for a long time, and I will tell everyone I know to watch it, not to entertain it, but to provoke it, because sometimes we all need to be provoked.
