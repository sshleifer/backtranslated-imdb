“Classic risks” recalls the grandfather “The Sopranos,” in which crime and family are mixed, and in a film about friends, which sounds as modern as “Reservoir Dogs.” <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that these gangsters are affectionately confused with their wives, children, lovers and parents, they are mercilessly ruthless, and we are constantly reminded of them, no matter how warm the atmosphere we see them. They can ruffle the child's hair — and then coolly shoot at the threat, the Key of loyalty, and the male partnership is perfectly transmitted, without ethnic or class stereotypes, even when their network of past obligations and payments narrows down to suspicion and paranoia, since the old gang is at various stages of early release, retirement and pledge or in new, less profitable enterprises. The charge is that he sends a stranger to execute the old escape script. When a wife is told that she is not the one with which the gangsters are friends, this causes strong emotions, although we can almost hear the music on the soundtrack when he remembers his wife. <br /> <br /> Cityscapes in Italy and France are miraculously used to dazzle daylight in dark water and on motorways, starting from the discovery of a pair of impudent robbers who travel with his wife and two children. Rough, rocky Lino Ventura immediately removes the screen, like a criminal dad. And the second thug is obviously an accidentally unnoticeable presence in their lives, as they smoothly coordinate the theft and run away in cars, buses, boats and motorcycles in light tandem. This is not an old cliché, softened by a big-eyed orphan; it is their job and their families, and they terribly intersect. <br /> <br /> The film does not strike with an unexpected killing of characters, direct and indirect damage and challenging our sympathy with them, even to an unsentimental end, therefore, probably, there has never been an American remake. <br /> <br /> It seems that it is so fresh that only after Jean-Paul Belmondo enters the film almost a third of the way, looking so harmless as a young punk, he realizes that it has been since 1960. Sultry Sandra Milo possesses smart and terrific chemistry, from ambulance to elevator and hospital bed. <br /> <br /> Although a new 35 mm font with recently translated subtitles was shown at the Kinoforum, it was not clean. The program notes explain that the title refers to a certain insurance policy and is a pun on the “tourist class”.
