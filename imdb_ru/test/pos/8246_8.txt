There was an interesting split in the voting for this film (at least for the time being). Those who are waiting for a documentary are impressed or at least not disappointed. I expect those who give the film 1 out of 10 are those who were expecting a movie about the war or a repetition of the invasion of Gallipoli. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to see the actors, shooting and blood, this film will not work for you. If you want to watch an independent documentary about Gallipoli without any bias against any one side (the only enemy in these events was War itself), then you will leave, impressed and sober. I found this film very touching, and even in the end he loved Captain Guy Nightingale.
