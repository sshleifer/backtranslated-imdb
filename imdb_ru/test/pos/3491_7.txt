No real story, no character development, no direction at Scorsese, but seriously, did you really expect any of this? The only thing that matters is that this film is absolutely funny, almost at the same level as Borat. Of course, the finale will drag on a bit, but if Boratâ€™s cameo has not caught you, it means that you are the thinnest of all the boys in history. Sasha Baron Cohen is perhaps the greatest comedian of life, and here he gets more laughter than Jude Law on a nudist beach. I dare you not to laugh. <br /> <br /> If you can pull a ten-foot pole out of your back for an hour and a half and just enjoy some timely and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid dull character story, watch this stupid movie. You will be glad you did. Keep it real!
