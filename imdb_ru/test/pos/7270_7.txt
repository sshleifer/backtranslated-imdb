When I got to the cinema to see it, I expected to see a kind of stylish action movie that trailers meant. However, it quickly became apparent that this film was trying to be more. <br /> <br /> Usually I do not approve of films that are trying to entertain as many ways as possible. For example, this film tries to mix action with comedy, romance, carelessness and seriousness at the same time. In most cases, this approach does not work in films (just look at Batman forever), but I was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case they did it. <br /> <br /> The end result is a very interesting film that should appeal to most mature moviegoers. (However, a weak stomach must really be warned about one or two scenes.) Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller demonstrate a brilliant double act, and Ken Stott is a great villain. It is blended with superb costumes and a few decent action scenes, which makes the watch very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> However, a great disappointment for me lies in the fact that there was a real opportunity for good dialogue in “Gentlemen’s Road Builder”, but the script clearly lacked assertiveness, and there was some belly laugh. Well, so these lines were not horrible, but for me this highlights the problem with recent British films; ignoring a few notable exceptions, the scripts that are being written today are still relatively mediocre compared to some of the efforts of Hollywood.
