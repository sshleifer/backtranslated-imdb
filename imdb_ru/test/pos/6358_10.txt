I was very impressed with this movie from rookie Dir. / Writer Jose Reyes. The cast was excellent. “Jorge Cordoba” performed a powerful and shocking performance as the main character of “Rafa”. It inspires to see independent films with such a level of talent. <br /> <br /> To go out and make a quality film, you need talent, courage and determination. <br /> <br /> I admire everyone who can translate an idea from concept to concept and walk a mile. <br /> <br /> People are easier to judge more harshly, but I applaud Jose Reyes and talented actors for their successful efforts.
