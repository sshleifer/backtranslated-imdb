Sandra Bullock paints a plausible picture as a troubled detective, although in order to see in her the cynical victim-ogre who has become the pursuer, it takes a leap of faith (or two). Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt portray two creepy problem children. <br /> <br /> I have some problems with bringing Ben Chaplin into the equation (the same problem arose when viewing “The Truth About Cats and Dogs” (http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0117979 /) I have in mind, when you put an Englishman in a general American film, shouldn't there be at least an excuse to put him there? Shouldn't there be some kind of story leading to an Englishman serving as a detective in the American police force? some dialogue indicating and explaining this rather obvious fact? Or even some jokes that he is English in? <br /> <br /> He looks out of place here because he looked out of place in “The Truth About Cats and Dogs.” Producers really should pay attention to this, it distracts and annoys the audience (at least me). Nothing wrong with Chaplin’s actions, it’s just a matter of creating an actor who’s “Incredible,” and doesn’t put him anywhere without a good reason or plot. <br /> <br /> The film itself: well, thrillers, especially those that with the disclosure of a complex crime requiring some suspension of unbelief. This one is no different; in fact, it requires a bit more effort than usual. In order to make Bullock smart enough to hack the case, despite all the pressure that requires her to give it up, some unrealistic assumptions about the evidence are made, and I am sure that many people who watched it had a few moments. from "C'mon, it's very unlikely in the circumstances," or even "Hey, you can't dismiss such evidence to end this movie!" <br /> <br /> As I said: quite interesting and watchable. Just do not use this as a must-see for detective examinations. There are no shortcuts there.
