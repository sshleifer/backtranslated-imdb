In continuation of the 1965 film My Name Is Barbra, shot in bright color, “Color I Barbra” has alternating nostalgia for La Streisand, clowning, female romantic passion and seductive seriousness during an insane hour of quilted show business. to blind She is a boring and fatal woman, a sprite and a riddle. With her Egyptian eye makeup and constantly changing hairstyles, she is also a chameleon. Her voice is rich and touching, even if some of her songs are not (“One Kiss”, “Yesterdays”). A circus sequence is not as intriguing as a trip to a museum (when Barbra becomes images in paintings, an idea that works better than you think). Circus potpourri (built on songs with the words "face"!) Very nice from the girls' side, and never becomes really charming. Nevertheless, this is a lively, jazz feature - not as emotionally agonizing as “My name is Barbra”, but, of course, a flawless job in the second year.
