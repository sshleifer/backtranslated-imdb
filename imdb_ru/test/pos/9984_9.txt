I was amazed by this movie. I am one of those people who simply take risks with films that I sometimes don’t particularly like, and I must say that this film has paid off. I mean, wow! The film even appealed to my young boys (at that time 5 and 6), although I am quite sure that it was not adapted for their age groups. <br /> <br /> This film was also clean, which is very cool. a plus. It’s so great to sit in a movie that you like, without profanity, violence (with the exception of one very short scene) or something else that might seem morally undesirable. <br /> <br /> This film brought you on a journey that you are willing to believe because of the great game. You feel a wide range of emotions, depicted with the characters. <br /> <br /> I never thought that a golf film would make me end up on the edge of my place, but I couldn't help wondering how this one would have turned out. I have nothing to compare with, since I did not look at golf in reality or at the film before, but everyone did a great job, keeping pace and exciting emotions here. The bill also did wonders; great, great <br /> <br /> Even if you don’t think this is your movie, watch it. You will be pleasantly surprised. I certainly was.
