CONTAINS THE INFORMATION "SPOILER". Watch another film by this director, The Earth, at some point. This is the best movie, but this one is not bad, just another one. <br /> <br /> A rare feminist point of view of an Indian director. Traditions, rituals, duties, secrets, and portraying of strict sexual roles make this an exciting and culturally dynamic movie watching experience. All married characters lack the “fire” of the marriage bed with their respective spouses. One husband is celibate and commits a spiritual “adultery”, giving all his love, honor, time and respect to his religious swami (guru). His wife is lonely and eager for intimacy and tenderness, which she eventually finds with her closed lesbian sister-in-law, who comes to live in their house with her unfaithful husband. This unfaithful husband openly loves his Chinese mistress, but was forced to marry a lesbian (unknown to him). They have sex only once, when his lesbian wife loses virginity. <br /> <br /> A servant lives in the house, and in the end he reveals the secret that two women are lovers. Another important character is an elderly matriarch who cannot speak or care for himself because of a stroke. However, she uses a clear call to communicate her needs and dissatisfaction with family members. She informs them through her call or knocks with her fist that she knows exactly what is happening in the house and how much she does not approve. <br /> <br /> In the end, the truth about everyone comes out and the two women lovers eventually run away together. But not before the emotional scene arose between the husband, dependent on the swami, and his former direct wife. Her sari lights up, and at first we think she will die. However, we see two women united in the very last scene of the film. <br /> <br /> The author of the film / director of this film challenges the traditions of its culture, but it shows us individuals who have fallen into the trap of their culture. and the floor. We really care about the characters and do not view them as stereotypes. Everyone surprises us with his humanity, vulgarity, tenderness, anger and spirit.
