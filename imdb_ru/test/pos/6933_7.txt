I'm a glutton for B-films. I like the old driveway at the entrance, as in this movie. This film, made for very little money, seems to do one thing that some films with a big budget fail. It is damp. This is blood. He has no real story, but he took me an hour and a half. I either laughed or shocked my eyes. There are some great effects, such as a shot from inside a guy's mouth, when he is stabbed in the chin with a knife, he pierces his tongue and hits the roof of his mouth, and one rough one with the guy getting his eyeballs pulled out. But there are also a lot of zombies, and some psycho-killers along the lines of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the demon-possessed scarecrow. I liked the dialogue that the murderers spew, torturing and killing people. He has great camera work and some cool editing tricks. This original is more original than the first Bloodbath, and the undead look better, but it still looks like those crappy movies about zombies from the 70s and 80s, and it still has the cheese factor, which is rated as powerful. Do not wait for Romero, just second-rate Fulci. I would say that horror fans will like it, and this is ridiculous, cheeky and quick to ride the B-Cinema Land.
