It was a great movie. He had one "very good" blast. In addition, there were very intense (dramatic) scenes that could make it unacceptable for younger viewers under 6 years of age. <br /> <br /> For the movie under the radar, acting was quite enjoyable and mundane in our family room for an almost perfect fit. He caught the attention of our whole family, and we were a little sorry to see his end. <br /> <br /> In this film, there were elements of child spies, where young people saved the day, but the script was somewhat more believable. Dream scenes at first distracted, but did a lot to establish the plot. Jokes and hi-jingx were pretty funny too. <br /> <br /> We hope that you love just as we do.
