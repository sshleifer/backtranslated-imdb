From the first 10 seconds, Pitch Black got me hooked. I entered this movie, thinking it would be just another fun sci-fi movie. Instead, I found a very interesting, on the edge of your place, a thought-provoking thought. The film goes beyond your main special effects. The actors are awesome, Rada Mitchell (High Art, Love and others ...), because Fry is really a joy to watch on screen, and Vin Diesel as Riddek is so fascinating that you can't wait to just hear him speak again. > <br /> The film shot is breathtaking, the contrast of blue, yellow and orange hue is amazing because of three different suns. Following the complete darkness of darkness. I would really recommend to any lover of films of ANOTHER or Radha Mitchell (which is why I went to see it) to check out this movie. I am sure that by the end you will look at the darkness in a completely new way.
