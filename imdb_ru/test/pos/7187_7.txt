This film is much better than the first Astérix et Obelix contre César, but it is far from perfect. Adaptation of comics is good, some pictures and dialogs of the film are the same as in the book. But there are a few things that made the film not as interesting as an animated film released in 1968. For example, the struggle between Numerobis and Amonbofis. It was not necessary or even trustworthy, nor for the little Asterix love story. Also, some things were missing, such as songs in an animated film, and some other things ... I was deceived by the film because they cut out what I expected to see and showed things that I did not want or needed to see. I know that it would be very difficult to make a film exactly the same as a comic or animated film, but I expected it. In conclusion, even if the film is good, I still prefer the animated film, which, in my opinion, is much better.
