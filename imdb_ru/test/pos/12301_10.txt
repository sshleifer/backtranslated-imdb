This is perhaps the most perfect film I've ever seen - in acting, adaptation and direction. It is self-sufficient in its own way, so it makes no sense to say that it is better or worse than other great films, it can just be a beautiful work of art in itself. <br /> <br /> And it was fun watching the horror fans get up and leave!
