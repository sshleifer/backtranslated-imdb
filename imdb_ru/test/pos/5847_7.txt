I like this movie. Unlike other thrillers, you learn to know the killers well. You will also meet two detectives who hunt them. Killers - two schoolchildren. They are very smart and want to prove that they are smarter than the police, so they are planning a "perfect crime." We all know that this crime will not be committed. What we do not know is whether they will be caught, or it can be only one of them, or even nobody. In a sense, I hoped that both of them would get away with it, although I donâ€™t know if it was the intention of the films. <br /> <br /> The story is told in a good way. You start to get acquainted with the people involved. Sandra Bullock's character is cute, but has her own secret that works against her. Ben Chaplin is pretty good, like Sam, and both kids are great. The scenes in between are the best scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> I think you can say that the film is pretty good and not as predictable as you think. For a good evening with the movie "Murder by Numbers" is a good option.
