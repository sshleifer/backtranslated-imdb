I saw this version about ten years ago, and since then I have been looking for it. I just recently found the original VHS version and bought it for $ 125.00. It sounds crazy, but if you, like me, think that this is one of the best music scenes on Broadway, you wouldn't even think twice. <br /> <br /> Why not overpay the Broadway ticket today. I really hope they release it as a DVD soon. This is a musical theater that screams to everyone!
