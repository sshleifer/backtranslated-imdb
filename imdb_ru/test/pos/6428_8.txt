In fact, this is a very good surreal film of mystery, despite the description, which is trying to sell it as a sci-fi film. Balkan stars as a woman, pursued by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to connect together. She spends most of the film trying to understand her visions. Very atmospheric and efficient. It's true that Kinski doesn't appear in this film very often, but the actors look very good. In the US, only the English dubbed version is available, and the duplication leaves much to be desired, but the actors do a very good job. Cinematography, winner of the Oscar Vittorio Storaro award, is excellent. The earlier Giallo of the director of Buzzoni, the FIFTH CORD, is also excellent, and he was also lensed by Storarro.
