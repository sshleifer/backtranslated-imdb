This film is a good start for newcomers who have never watched Silent Film, and for those who believe that quality cinema began with the efforts of their generations. They do a disservice to themselves without expanding their horizons. “Silent Film” is an artistic form of acting in a pantomime that differs from a sound film and a stage and may be in its own right. <br /> <br /> “The Beloved Tramp” (1927) is a fictional story of the relationship between the French poet Francois Villon and King Louis XI. Through the "Villon" pushing "King Louis", he will defeat his sworn enemy "The Duke of Burgandia", minimize the feudal system and establish the king as head of state and the beginning of modern France. <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional, led by John Barrymore (yes, Drew's grandfather). For those who remember him only for the decaying actor "Larry Reno" in "Dinner at Eight" (1933) or in "Old Invisibles" (1940), this will be a revelation. Adjust, equate with the 'Big Profile', still showing that he is commanding the screen. Starring in his first American film CONRAD VEIDT with his "deadly spider" as interpreted by Louis XI. This is a duel of active titans, each of which does not give a single inch. Notes on trivia - character actor and gnome ANGELO ROSSITTO in his first film, his last, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985). There are other characters actors who will continue to sound and be easy to catch. <br /> <br /> United Artists did not spare funds for this beautiful production under the direction of William Cameron Mense. Costumes, props and decorations are made well and are not exaggerated, as in DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS. There is a touch of reality. The DVD copy we watched from Delta Entertainment was received from a good master. Although he was not “restored,” his musical soundtrack was clear, and the imprint suffered only from unpleasant black spots (dirt) and dropouts. The only serious damage at the end of the last drum from the water. Cinema also has a publication that may be of better quality, since they make serious restorations on their prints. Better consult them. In our opinion, this is “mandatory”, especially if you do not have “silence” in your collection. This is a good place to start.
