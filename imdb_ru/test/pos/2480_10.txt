First of all, the whole script is basically improved, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we are seeing is a real documentary. Secondly, the actors employed by Watkins were deliberately chosen to represent their true political alliances and experiences. The hippies depicted are real hippies, government officials (although not necessarily in the government itself), at least in fact the heart conservatives in the system, and some of the policemen are real policemen. The interaction of these actors, given the textual freedoms allotted by Watkins, ultimately come to a cruel head, where even Watkins himself is convinced that the cast was actually shot. (We hear him screaming "Cut! Cut!" In the background.) <br /> <br /> An AMAZING film, although American critics were quite sharp in their reviews, one of whom actually reports that it The “most offensive” film ever seen. This is not entirely unexpected, since the promulgation of this oppressive communist mentality of America in this era will certainly shock some cells. This pseudo-documentary film certainly requires impartiality, although if you are seriously looking for an extremely accurate picture of the culture of the 60s, this film is worth seeing.
