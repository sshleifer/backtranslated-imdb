"The scorpion of the female convict is the stable of the beast," the third in the series, is a magnificent piece of flesh. Closer in tone and prone to the brutal pink color of Nikkatsu than other Scorpio records, he is amazingly photographed, directed with grim enthusiasm and populated by a fraudulent gallery of villains and degenerates. Shinya Ito, director of the first edition, returns to this surrealistic fable, which begins with the fact that Scorpio (Meiko Kaji) cuts off a hand from the policeman she is handcuffed to and runs into the Tokyo subway, and this arm is still hanging from her wrists. She finds refuge in the red-light district, where she will make friends with a prostitute who was first seen in incestuous intercourse with her brother (who eventually fertilizes her). Scorpio’s desire to protect this unfortunate woman ultimately exposes her identity, and all hell fails. She is beaten, sexually abused, and locked up in a quaint bird cage in the villain's den. I liked everything about this hypnotic, nihilistic and emotionally touching film. He surpasses the first three films “Scorpio” and shows one great scene after another. I can not recommend this highly enough.
