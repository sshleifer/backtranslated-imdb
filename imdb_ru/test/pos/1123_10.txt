This show is absolutely fantastic. This provides all the great drama and romance of teen shows such as The OC and Dawsons, but it's much funnier. This is a show with morality and values, without any sugar coating and disinfection (ala 7th sky). We have no Austrian or fraternal communities, and our university system is completely different, so I have no idea how accurately the Greek life was portrayed. But I do not care! Because this show is my new favorite! Any writer who can make me love racist, homophobic, Confederate flag waving is a genius. <br /> <br /> And Cappie is my new Pacey. Sorry, Josh Jackson, you were overthrown!
