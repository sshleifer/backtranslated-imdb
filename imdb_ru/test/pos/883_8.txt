Good film. At first I thought it was a hi-fi film from a good detective, but the final surprised me completely. I assume that the whole film covers too many items, each of which may be major, for example. Revenge, friendship and a dream. But it mixed all of them, not focusing on any of them. I think it would be a great movie if it was built from the start. <br /> <br />
