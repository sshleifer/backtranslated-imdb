I just watched this film a second time with my 8 year old daughter and remembered why we liked it the first time. All these people, who say it is bad, are too excited and critical! It's just an entertaining little movie, it should not change the world. I thought all the actors did a great job with their characters. (Except for Jeremy Jordan in the role of Guy - he was a maggots who looked seriously in need of soap and shampoo. If he was supposed to be the hot guy in their school, then they have slender quibbles.) as usual, and David Arquette was even pleasant, and I usually can't digest it, if only because of these silly commercials! Molly Shannon is always entertaining, and Lily Sobieski did a great job like a jaded brain. Some parts were really painful to look at, reminding me of high school. Although, fortunately, I did not laugh at this, it made my heart ache for those who do it. Such films are actually useful for children - my daughter made a few comments about the cruelty of some students and how wrong it is. This movie fits all and is a good way to pass the 2 hours. If you ever want to watch a carefree little movie with a happy ending, when you donâ€™t need to think a lot, this is definitely important.
