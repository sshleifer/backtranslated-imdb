Recently, I have been very fond of the Hitchcock series. I always shoot one of his films when I'm on a blockbuster or in a Hollywood video. As I said, Hollywood is incredibly losing touch, I had to remind you that there are amazing movies. Not to mention the fact that I want to be a connoisseur of cinema, and not a lover of cinema. Is there a better way to do this than with Alfred Hitchcock's films? <br /> <br /> “The Man Who Knew Too Much,” is another great and exciting thriller, in which the main role is played by Alfred’s favorite lead James Stewart and the woman who steals the Dorris Day series. They play a husband and wife who go on vacation with their son, but when the spy tells James some information that could arrest the other spy, his son is kidnapped and held for the purpose of ransom. James seems to simply doubt Dorris and her ability for ideas on how to get their son back, but she makes a great return and almost ends up becoming a movie hero. <br /> <br /> I play again, I would say that Dorris was the one who overshadowed the entire cast. James did an excellent job keeping up with the two made you sit down and never budge during the entire movie. I liked the little comedy at the end that Alfred added. You will understand what I mean. I always highly recommend this film, despite the fact that he is not Hitchcock's best film, it is still a treasure. <br /> <br /> 9/10
