Click, crack, pop! The terrible sound of every change in the angle of the camera. And this is not to mention the white flashes and cropped endings of almost every spoken sentence. What did they do in the editing room? Or maybe this approach was intentional? Of course not. What purpose can this serve? Despite all the technical flaws, this is an interesting film that tells about the bottom of the life of Joe, a crook who decided to earn $ 200 for his wifeâ€™s pregnant girlfriend. Joe Dullesandro is distinguished as a calm, passive, laid-back young man who wants to allow another person to do most of the conversation while he listens with a distant look in his eyes. <br /> <br /> The story is scanty and sketchy, documenting the uncertain life that a man leads, who relies on casual street sex to support his young wife and child. One thing is certain, Joe is not shy when it comes to stripping for sex or posing for an artist. Obviously, because he has a beautiful face and an equally beautiful body. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the film that is surprisingly effective. No sound, no dialogue. Joe Stark naked crouches on the floor and feeds the crumbs of the cake to his young child. In these quiet moments captured beautiful serenity and tenderness. <br /> <br /> Another fun scene is one in which Joe is desperately seeking a loan of $ 100 from a friend at the gym, to the extent that he asks a very devious approach. <br /> <br /> Joe tries to look interested, but hesitates in his conversation when the artist gives him a non-stop summary of Greek and Roman art. This is a preliminary case when Joe takes off his clothes and pretends to be a disc thrower in a truly classic style. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, it seems that we met Joe quite well. After all, he revealed more than his soul.
