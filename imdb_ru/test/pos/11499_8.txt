Some people swim through life, moving from one person to another, without taking their eyes off; others become attached to the cause, to another person or principle, and remain unmoved, committed to anything — and figuratively or literally they give their word and support it. But we are all different, “made from another clay,” as one of the characters in this film says, which makes life so interesting. Although some people are just crazy, and perhaps this is how you should live among the masses. Who knows? Who knows what it takes to make life work? Writer / director Lisa Kruger takes a snapshot using an easy approach to explore this fine line between commitment — and how a person “gets” —and obsession in “Perfect” with Heather Graham starring as a young woman , obsessed and maybe a little crazy too. Her name is Jolene, and this is her story. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, Jolene has always been a dedicated person; in work, relationships, in life in general. She is a woman of her word who sticks to this no matter what. And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it is forever. The only problem is that someone forgot to tell Karl - and 597 days after the wedding, he left; to "find" yourself and understand all this. When Jolene realizes that he will not return, she refuses to leave him or their marriage. Maybe this is because of the "clay" from which it is made. Despite this, she leaves their home in New York and goes in search of him, which she does - in El Paso, Texas, from all places. But as soon as she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him “space” and not even letting him know that she is there. She believes that Karl is in a “spiritual coma,” and her job is to maintain a “spiritual vigil” over him until he comes to his senses. And while she looks and waits, her life is not boring at all, as she encounters a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velasquez), a waitress in a local cafe; “Grampy” Carmen (Alfonso Aarau) - a mystic; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has problems regarding Karl; and Neil (Goran Vishnich), an artist who makes pins and enjoys it. For Jolene is a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about Carla, but even more about herself. <br /> <br /> He has a bit of humor, a bit of romance and a little understanding of human nature. this quirky movie that is more about characterization and character than plotting. And Kruger presents it all very well, providing an interesting and fascinating film. Her characters are very real people, with all the desires, needs and shortcomings that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic group through which she tells her story. We see this from Joeln’s point of view, since Kruger makes us aware of Johlin’s thoughts and, therefore, about her motivation, which gives a certain perspective to events as they unfold. This, along with the deliberate pace she sets, allows you to absorb the atmosphere and the atmosphere she creates, creates a very effective part of storytelling. There is serious seriousness in this subject, but Kruger prefers to avoid something heavy or too deep and instead concentrates on the natural humor that develops in people and situations that Jolene encounters. And the result is a well-textured, spectacular and optimistic view of what we call life. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham takes this role in the first frame of the film to make Jolene a completely personal character. creature. She plunges into the role and gives a presentation that is persuasive and believable, adding small personal features and nuances that make all the difference between an image that is a simple person’s representation and one that is real. And in order for this film to work, Jolene must be viable and believable, and Graham should succeed on all fronts. Her presence on the screen has never been so attractive, and her bright personality or even how she uses her eyes is enough to completely attract you. it's all part of the character that she creates; there is a call for Jolene who comes from her whole face, who she is inside and out. She is a pleasant, pleasant person, and since you have shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is. It's a good job, starting with how the character was written, and before Graham so animates her life. <br /> <br /> Like Carmen, Patricia Velasquez is also fully interested. Her game is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character. She has a charismatic presence, but she is not so bright, and this gives her an attractive and down-to-earth aspect. She is refreshingly open and sincere; you have the impression that Carmen is not one of those who are holding back something, but she is absolutely honest on all fronts, and this is also part of her appeal. And, as is the case with Jolene, this character is well written, and Velázquez convincingly makes it come to life. <br /> <br /> In general, there are a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (as brother Jolene, Jay), Goran Vishnich, Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo in the role of T-Bo, who with a very small actual screen time manages to create a memorable character. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Val (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (car thief in New York), Dylan Baker (ed. Carl) and Mary Kay Place (psychiatrist). A film that talks about how important it is to retreat to see the “Big Picture” - thinking about who we are, where we go and what we really need - “Devotee” is a pleasant experience; the trip is definitely worth it. 8/10.
