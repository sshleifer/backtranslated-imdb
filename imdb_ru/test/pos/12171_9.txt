I gave 9 out of 10 points. I sat in tears for almost the entire movie, because I had to laugh! <br /> <br /> History, of course, was not excellent, but also boring. Erkan and Stefan were commissioned to become the bodyguards of the beautiful Nina. In carrying out this work, they are between the "advanced" BND and the CIA. Of course, they are not inborn bodyguards or gentlemen, so they are fleeing from one disaster to another; and they do it in such a funny way that when you watch some scenes, you can't stop the tears! As actors, these two "stupidly grinning" characters cope quite well, better than some of the so-called professionals. <br /> <br /> Do you think these two heroes are curiosities or “pseudo-foreigners”? Well, if you hear quite a lot of Turkish-German people in Munich, speaking exactly like them, you will remember Erkan & Stefan. And maybe in 10 years this could be the usual speech of young people. (God forbid!) <br /> <br /> So, if you like to laugh, watch this movie!
