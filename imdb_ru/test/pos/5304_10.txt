Hayao Miyazaki's magic continues with this absolute pony fan on the rock by the sea, his latest animated film that includes the usual sweetness to charm your socks. I thought the trailer had his song, which was quietly hypnotic, and I did not have to wait for an invitation to make sure that I received my ticket for a preview of the film, which is scheduled to open here next week. <br /> <br /> For fans of Ghibli films, you will probably know what you need, since Miyazaki has another winner in her filmography who will win over new fans. At the very least, I’m ashamed that so far I’ve only watched “My Neighbor Totoro” (looks at this bunch of Ghibli DVDs) and I love it to bits, but I think this will be the last push for me not to miss Most likely, I will like animated films. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (voiced by Nara Yuria) is a magical goldfish that craves to find out what life overseas is, with its constant forays into a bubble to the surface. water to sneak a peek. However, these ambitions do not bode well for her humanoid father Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who harbors some hatred of the human race for environmental pollution, and also briefly touches the environmental / revenge plot from Mother Nature. One day, as a result of an accident, Ponio was washed ashore, and a five-year-old boy, Sosuke (Doi Hiroki), who lives in a house on a cliff with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), takes him, while Papa Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) mostly at sea since he is a sailor. And you can expect some moments of return to such as the Little Mermaid, or Splash, made for children. To say something else is to spoil the fun. <br /> <br /> The work here is still simply amazing, despite the fact that it is in 2D magnificence, knowing that they are working hard on every cell. There are so many things happening in the same frame at the same time that you are likely to be a replay game just to notice them all. It definitely surpasses any 3D or CG animation on any given day, considering its beauty because of its simplicity, and not only from the art department, but also because of its history, despite the complaints that he took the sheet from Hans classic Christian Andersen. Although there are ways to make this film extremely dark, he suggested only certain dark themes, but instead chose a film with more positive emotions, suitable for both children and adults. <br /> <br /> In its essence, it is about love, which is between members of the family of Koichi, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and son. Moreover, it is about the love between the boy and his new favorite fish, which he christened Ponyo, and I tell you that Ponyo herself has enough wit in it to defeat the likes of Bolt, WallE and Eve. The characteristic here is top notch and it’s hard not to fall in love with Ponyo in whatever form he is accepted, especially when she is so playful, who does not hide her emotions - if she is upset about you, she either turns away or you can expect that the jet stream will erupt from its mouth into your face! <br /> <br /> A pony on a rock by the sea is a definite entry into my best films of this year without hesitation. And the next time I go to Tokyo, I'm sure that, damn it, I'll go to the Ghibli museum to bask in the magical world presented to us by Hayao Miyazaki. A movie is highly recommended, so don't miss it on the big screen!
