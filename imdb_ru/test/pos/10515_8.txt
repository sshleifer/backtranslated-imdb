I love Lin Cheney’s version of The Ghost, and I appreciate Webber’s version, at least for his growing interest in the book, and I want to discover even more mysterious horror with romantic aspects that are diminished. I do not approve of the fact that Andrew Lloyd Webber made the relationship between Raul and Cristina less restrained. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, since this comedy short film is only with Eric and Christine, this version doesn’t even have to mess with any other characters. <br /> <br /> I thought that I would still wait for another version that would match Lon's performance. I was completely wrong. Leslie Nilsson, like Eric, is gorgeous, although of course this is a hoax. This is still great. <br /> <br /> I especially appreciated the fact that Eric looked more like a living corpse than an accident victim. I still have not seen such a ghost, except Lon. <br /> <br /> However, I don’t recommend this short one if you don’t like parodies. Because it should in no way be taken seriously.
