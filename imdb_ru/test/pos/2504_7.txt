Besides the fact that this film was shot mostly in Rockport, Massachusetts, in a beautiful city where my mother once rented a small shop window, and I spent a lot of pleasant summer as a child, this is a funny and cute little movie. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I had no desire to actually watch this film, although I have a weak spot for romantic comedies (I donâ€™t know why). The trailers I saw were not attractive, the actors did not look so interesting, and I had no idea what the plot would be about. In the end, I discovered that this is an interesting meditation on relationships and family. I fully enjoyed it and I must admit that I thought that this film was one of the most under-appreciated gems of the past year. I am disappointed that so few people seemed to enjoy the very "humanity" that this film gave the viewer. <br /> <br /> I have read a lot of bad reviews of this film and must recognize a certain level of shock from the cynicism that is prevalent in them. As a graduate student, I consider myself rather cynical, but it was a wonderful little film that deserves much more than it received.
