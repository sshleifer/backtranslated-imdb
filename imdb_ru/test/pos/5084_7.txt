Just reading why this show was canceled makes me sweat. As a child, it was my favorite thing, and I always watched it when it happened, no matter how many times I saw this episode. Of course, the effects were not great, but they were not terrible either. They did a pretty good job with the costume, and it had a pleasant atmosphere of the 70s, which is always good to see and hear, because the music was also very 70s. In fact, there were no comic book villains in it, but in most adaptations to live comic shows there were very few true comic book super villains. Spidey's strength was a bit different here too, he had Spidey feeling, and he could climb walls, but he wasnâ€™t as strong as Spiderman comics. Although he was very strong, although, as I remember, the episode when he burst into the room, breaking the door handle, he simply was not the automaker, what could be one of the comics. The show was organized in Los Angeles, so there were no such male buildings from which one could sway, but they did a great job with the web. It's nice that there are web shooters on this show, not organic movie shooters. I love movies, but part of me wants them to start over and make smarter Spidey pants that have mechanical web shooters. This show had a good star, like Peter Parker, and he was a good Spiderman. It's nice to see that Spidey basically doesn't live in slums, like in the movies. Neither in this show, nor in the film, however, is there a Spiderman who is quick with an insult, like in a comic book. However, this show was fun, but not as trite as the Batman show.
