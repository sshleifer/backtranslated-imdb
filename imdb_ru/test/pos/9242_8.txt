I watched this movie at the Magnolia Theater in Dallas a couple of days ago. Punk! Everyone and everyone involved in the film added punk to him. Music, of course. But the film itself captured the entire punk genre. Even the grandmother and the school teacher (s) can appreciate the artists who are able to translate their ideas into reality (well, reality, in the movies). Several young filmmakers, marked with a check mark, take part in this film and clearly and intelligently show the “why” that they lack the green light at the end of the Waldo film. The (relatively) happy girl gave a good comic relief, a good respite from the constant (but understandable) lies to the dude who threw them in trouble. Gotta love Stu, though. And be sure to look / read loans - they are icing on the cake!
