The most intense and powerful film that I have seen in recent years. Before that, there were other films about the Vietnamese vet, but nothing compared to this emotionally heartbreaking film, since a typical American suburban family, circa 1972, is falling apart at the seams, showing the scars that Vietnam has left on all of our teams. the soul. The cast of A ++++ is fantastic, all four actors (with outstanding Kathy Bates) give spectacular performances. What is surprising about this film is that you take no sides, but you understand all four characters and empathize with them, even if all four have different points of view and needs. There are scenes that are so powerful that family secrets and feelings are revealed (for example, the confrontation of a son and a mother) that will lead you to emotional exhaustion and tears of anguish. I actually cried in this film, which I rarely do. The shocking end is awesome! A very underrated film that is worth watching. I think this 1996 film is excellent. It is highly recommended, especially nowadays, again and again, our country is embroiled in a disgusting war, our headlines scream about atrocities and again, our young men and women return with deep psychological scars, with their deep pain of acts done in an honorable manner Must watch a movie.
