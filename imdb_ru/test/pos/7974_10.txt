For my taste, “Hell to Pay” is a bit bloody, though not worse than many films. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the parade of experienced stars and the western landscape & everything; but the storyline was very weak, and I could not understand the meaning of all this. However, the music that accompanies the film more than compensates for the dull film. <br /> <br /> Where did the guys come from - Nate and Noah Kriens - who wrote this music? They are wonderful !! From the moment music begins, it is much better than everything I've heard in recent years. I think this may be the best I've ever heard! Although I was not thrilled with what was happening in the film, the music caused exactly the emotions that were necessary for each scene. I was on time transferred to the old west during the opening credits and really felt that I was reliving those old days with music. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely worth buying and watching for the beautiful music and the journey through the memory lane to see the old western stars again.
