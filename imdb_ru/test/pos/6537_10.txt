This film brought me to tears. I must say that if I did not have a beautiful husband at home, I would ask this beautiful work of art to marry me. Aaron Carter masterfully plays the role of a tangled young pop star, and Timothy Barton writes quick and witty dialogues that only contribute to the genius of Carterâ€™s game. Kyle is pretty funny, but his performance was no less exciting. He is also very beautiful and cute. I'm thinking of inviting him on a date and making him a very sweet gift for the night.) <br /> <br /> If you want to discuss this movie in the future, contact me. <br /> <br /> Nick Burrell Vassar, 2012, Malibu, California, Malibu West 310 924 0126
