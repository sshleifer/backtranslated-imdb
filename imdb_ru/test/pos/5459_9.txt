Late Shift is a great book, I read it several years ago, and I was shocked by the merciless debauchery that occurred when Johnny Carson resigned, and Jay Leno and Johnny Carson tried to capture his place. When the film came out, I grabbed a VHS copy of the film, and having recently re-read the book, it's hard to say that I like it more, because they are absolutely equal in the amount of information transmitted. The two main actors, John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, are two actors that I have never heard of and have never heard of since, and have been convincingly played by Leno and Letterman, despite the fact that Letterman rejects his image of bad. They play roles quite well, despite the fact that many are looking to imitate both. I was not so interested in this. History is what matters. And that brings me to Kathy Bates. Kathy Bates, who plays Helen Kushnik, is a movie. She plays this evil bitch character so ominously that you understand how this woman can control herself, not to mention the national TV show. Clap! There should be a sequel!
