I like the early description of this movie as a poem. I caught it completely by chance on the Kino channel last night and was captivated enough to stick with it entirely. In fact, the film has a truly unique voice, a poetry of narration that makes sense, without deviating from the claims. There are also a lot of fun moments from Wirey High School days that are rude, not being a little humor. It's sad that this film is so low rated. The fact that there are so many of them makes me think that the numbers have been prepared - I donâ€™t understand how anyone can see a movie so terrible. Of course, this is by no means a typical romantic comedy, but it is a very unique point of view on the completely unique life of a person whose appeal comes from his squad, from the squad he must overcome before destroying him. Give this film a chance. It came out of nowhere for me, and I feel richer for it.
