I watched this movie every time he showed up on a cable and he never grew old. Who can forget some of the best lines in cinema history? --- Johnny Fat Boy Burgers! JOHNNY FAT BOY BURGER !! and look between the giant melons! I used to want to run around the city in a treasure hunt, how fun it is. This is a favorite all the time, and I'm glad to hear that this is on video! I am sure that it was here that MTV received its initial premise for the Road Rules series.
