I did not expect much from this film, and they gave me a slap in the face. Julie Walters, Rupert Grint and Laura Linney are great starring roles in this film. Any teenager can relate to parental control and the desire to play the role of who you really are, what this film is about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express his ideas in words. He slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward. Each viewer feels the ups and downs of the film, and the theater is filled with laughter in 75% of cases. The film satisfies everyone, and I hope that in the near future it can be released in all cinemas in the USA, because many do not have the opportunity to watch the film if they do not live in big cities. This is a MUST to see!
