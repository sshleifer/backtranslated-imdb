If you are looking for a movie that is smart and does not get bored, then this is the place. It is fast paced and fun with some decent game coming from the characters. I always find it difficult to see Mark Wahlberg as anything other than Mark Mark. This image burned in my memory forever. As an actor, although he is pretty good. This film is a must-have for action movie fans who like to see a few small turns. I will have to pick up this movie one day and buy it.
