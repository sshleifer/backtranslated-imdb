This is one of the most insightful films I've ever seen. The language of the script, the costumes, the scenery, the plot, the characters, etc. are all at the highest level. You will not be bored. I intensely watched or even just listened to this film, working so many times that I lost count. Scarlett is aging gracefully, eventually gaining wisdom beyond his years. This film takes you from Tara to Ireland, where her family came from, and you see the results of another civil war, this time between the Irish and the British. <br /> <br /> This film reflects the double standards of a man at that time - a man is still respected, if he has girlfriends and whores, but no woman. If she is simply noticed in a secluded place with a man, the society accuses her of being irrelevant. And, of course, Scarlett always thought outside the box, breaking the rules when necessary to create the necessary changes, helping people and / or surviving. <br /> <br /> The beauty of Scarlett is definitely to the bone. Her strength, self-esteem and wisdom increase with age. <br /> <br /> I remember her lines when I come across too many things on my plate, for example, “tomorrow is another day,” and the way she behaved, her determination and courage, and learned from her experience . This is a good film that shows your daughters how he teaches a woman, how important it is to have respect for yourself, and that men, especially very beautiful ones, can have two sides and can treat a woman differently depending on how she acts and respect yourself. An attractive woman should find out what this film teaches. <br /> <br /> This film is like therapy to me, and it's better than Gone With the Wind. The second part takes place in Ireland, and anyone who is of Irish descent will treasure the scenery, the people and the character of Scarlett in it.
