SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love the Simpsons, and I saw every episode that ever came out. I have to admit that the first season is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated episode in the first season. The episode begins with the family playing Scrabble to prepare Bart for the intelligence test he needs to go through at school. He says that the game is stupid, and he does not want to play it, but he needs it. He utters a word that angers Homer, and chases Bart all over the house. The next day, Mrs. Krabappel assures the class that the test is not part of their assessment, but simply a test that tells them what their future will be. Bart cannot answer one question. He thinks fast. He quickly switches from Martin Prince, the smartest in the class. Later that day, Marge and Homer were summoned to the director's office to discuss Bart's behavior. Suddenly, a school psychologist comes from nowhere and tells Skinner, Homer and Marge that Bart is a genius and must go to a special school for the gifted. Bart agrees to go, because he did not need to do his homework. The next day, Homer will take Bart to a new school. It is presented to everyone and everyone. Unfortunately, his day is not very good. Smart students take his lunch wisely, he does not know how to read comics, but in any case he does, and his colleagues criticize him. Fortunately for Bart, he and Homer have a great time together, but Marge bought tickets to the opera. They go to the opera and laugh at it. The next day he goes to his old school, but his friends make fun of him. They call it a dexter point. While in his new school, Bart is told to make a Chemical Experiment. He does it wrong and blows up the school, leaving himself green. The psychologist tells Bart why he did it. Instead, Bart tells him that he wants to go undercover and return to his old school to watch other children. The psychologist is intrigued, and he asks Bart to explain it on a piece of paper. He finds it too difficult and instead writes a confession that he is not really a genius. He gives it to the psychologist. All he cares about is that he wrote the word confession wrong. That night, Homer bathes Bart, and Bart tells him that he is not really a genius and that he deceived the test. Homer is angry and stalking Bart around the house when Lisa and Marge casually look at them. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very underrated episode of the first season. <br /> <br /> 8/10
