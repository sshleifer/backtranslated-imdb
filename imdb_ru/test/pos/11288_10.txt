I want to anticipate this review by saying that I have no idea what “Begotten” is. All I really know is that at first God kills himself, in turn, giving birth to Mother Earth, which begins to impregnate itself with the sperm of God. Then she gives birth to a son. Everything else is rather subjective, and you must interpret it in your own way. <br /> <br /> This is how I decided to interpret the film; God’s suicide meant the beginning of the scientific revolution when people began to question the doctrines imposed by the church, such as a geocentric view of the universe, etc. Mother Earth symbolized people starting to think for themselves and reject the church: "views". The tribal people were the church that pounced on them, trying to get Christianity to cut their throats. I'm not quite sure how the Son of Earth fits into all this. Mother Earth and the people of the tribe seemed to be fighting for him, so perhaps he represents the freedom of the people or something like that. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the final parts of this film should mean, Hammer, rape, then dismember Mother Earth and the Son of Earth and rub them into the ground, like a mortar and pestle, can mean anything, but this is where the fun of this film lies; You can interpret it as you wish. There should be no definite meaning in this; you can let your mind wander. Sometimes you don’t even know what you should look at because it’s a shot from a strange perspective or too blurry. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed me was that I was expecting a truly terrifying film. I thought about this immediately after I was called immediately with the warning “seven days”. What I got was nice to others. It was not at all scary, but it disturbed my imagination. Attempting to decipher the mysterious message of the film was a creative test. There were many scenes that were really beautiful. Mother Earth immediately after her birth and the last snapshot of the forest path comes to mind. <br /> <br /> In general, I have to say that I really liked this movie. This is by far the most abstract film I've ever seen, but it's not bad.
