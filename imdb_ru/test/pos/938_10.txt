It’s almost impossible for me to sit down and write a bona fide review of “THREE COLORS: RED”, without letting people understand some of the ideas that Kristoff Keshlowski had explored in the previous two entries of this exciting trilogy. The more I see them, think about them and imagine myself in their world, the more I understand his topic: we are more connected with each other than we would like to think, and all that is needed for this is a small hand of fate. set in motion some events. In CINEM, Juliette Binoche played a grieving widow, whose plan to live her life without regard to the past made her meet someone unexpected. In WHITE, an act of cruelty creates an unlikely friendship between two men, who, despite everything, are about to speak, to bring the perpetrator to justice and circle the circle. And now, in RED, all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence are applied at the meeting of a young Geneva model and a retired judge who has a habit of looking into the lives of other people. <br /> <br /> This young girl is named appropriately: Valentine (glowing Irina Jacob), who shines around her and even smiles openly while working on the runway. Not that she is without baggage: she has a boyfriend, invisible, who also constantly needs to know what she is doing, she has a brother who bothers her, and she rejects the success of the photographer who is working on her image for a huge billboard. She beats the dog while driving and cares for her, recovering, but when she takes her to her master, a retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant), he does not want her. “I don’t want anything,” he says coldly, and the elements of the BLUE suddenly manifest themselves as this arrogant person, who also lives in conditions of anonymity and obvious free-floating freedom, is observing unsuspecting people. This male version of character Juliette Binoche initially shocks Valentine - she says she can only feel sorry for him when she leaves in horror, but a random event causes her to return to her place, and then he begins to reveal who he is and his great loss . <br /> <br /> At the same time, Keshlovsky unfolds a parallel story: the story of a young man Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit), who is going to become a judge and who lives right across the street from Valentine - but they miss each other. Chance is the word. Like Valentina, who won the jackpot in the grocery story she visits, elements of randomness pervade her life and Auguste’s life. He has a girlfriend who also provides people with telephone weather reports. One of them happens to be an old judge. He knows more about her than Auguste, and he never met her. Like God or Prospero, he slowly creates a storm that will reveal the walls of the current state of conformity and add new meaning to the phrase “We will meet again.” It is this parallelism between the old and the young judge that makes RED so beautiful and transcendental, because in fact time is much more changeable than we would like. There are people with whom we meet in life, and if we were only born on the same time, many things would be different. <br /> <br /> This is the case with Valentin and the old judge. I believe that there is definitely a strong brotherhood of souls tying them into a close relationship: she is the woman with whom he did not meet - by chance or not - and, whether he knows it or not, is trying to repair the damage therefore, therefore he is at great risk disclosing one’s observation and becoming an outcast in society. But it does not end there. One of the many links between these three films is the character of an old woman walking to a big dumpster. Where Julie had not seen her (and would not have helped her in any way), and Karol had just heard a mocking thought from her public humiliation: “Someone is worse than me,” Valentin is the one who helps her. A fragile need can happen anywhere, and Keshlowski even uses it here as a secondary character. <br /> <br /> Now RED is much more than a story. Valentine, the old judge, Auguste, even Rita's dog: these characters are not limited to storytelling. The American version would destroy the idea and commercialize casual encounters and even bring a blunt end. RED is so devoid of a linear, definite plot that anything could happen to any of these people, and the opportunities that this story could divert in many directions had one crucial element that did not take place at a particular moment and place. <Br /> <br /> Adding to the concept of characters that reflect each other, despite the time frame or location, is the topic of sexual betrayal. This is also an important and defining character in all three films: in BLUE, her husband Julie had a lover, and she also betrays Olivier when it becomes clear that she is emotionally dead. In White, Dominic forces Karol to listen to her moan on the phone (which becomes an important device in RED) when she has sex with a man, while the Billboard “Budy Bardo” CONTEMPT looks on. In RED, the tale of love and betrayal of the old judge is recreated. And all this time, the image of Valentine’s billboard hangs over them, as an omen of what will happen at the same time that Rita, Valentina’s dog car, hit, has seven puppies, the life of the six main players in this complex trilogy, renewed removed care and love. Why am I saying six? You will have to watch a movie and wonder.
