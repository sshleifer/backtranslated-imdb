Boogie Nights, without a doubt, was the best film of 1997. I could watch this movie again and again and again, and still love it. I'm not in a hurry to watch this bloated titanic / disaster story again. The fact that “Boogie Nights” did not even get the nomination “Best Picture” simply proves how academic and unpredictable the Academy is. Only Atom Egoyan “Sweet Life After Death” and “Contact of Robert Zemeckis” were close to being as great as the Boogie Nights. No other director in recent years has even come close to making a film as good as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, until now. Paul Thomas Anderson accepted the challenge and succeeded. Just as Tarantino gave an impetus to the career of John Travolta, PT Anderson gave Burt Reynolds the punch that his career needs. Boogie Nights will surely make the stars Don Cheadle, Heather Graham and John Reilly. Overall a great movie. The best since the days of reading. Maybe even better.
