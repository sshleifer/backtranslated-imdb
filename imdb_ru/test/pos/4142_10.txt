The story of Buddy Holly opens on a picture of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a skating rink in 1956 in Lubbock, Texas. When the credits begin, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, to the skating rink, past the concessions and through the skating rink to a small stand where a small group performs a sound test. Wells and Scorsese will appreciate it. It shortens the face of Buddy Holly in glasses, peering in enthusiastic concentration when he grabs the headset and talks to the person who includes this band on the radio. <br /> <br /> Young Gary Buzie plays Buddy Holly, and his performance plays a key role. He must somehow show Holly's passion for his music for the film to work. This is a rock and roll story without the lines of coke, followed by shots of heroin and a fifth of whiskey. This is not about a man with several women to choose from in the scandalous sex life, abandoned depraved tragedy. This film is about a good Texan boy who respected his parents, went to church, he had the same girl for 5 years, and he fell in love with rock and roll. Busey finds this spark and ignites her, his passion is clear and contagious. He really plays the guitar in the film and sings, it does not impose the recording of Holly. Busey was a young guy in Hollywood in the seventies, an actor who fought, and also a rock musician. Thus, he gives an excellent game, because, although he is not Buddy Holly, he is in a similar situation. <br /> <br /> His first song is the old classic Les Paul, "Mockingbird Hill", and he has country to nail it. Then the child cries out for some kind of bop and against his two band mates (in fact there were 3 guys in Crickets, but the reduction in size is great for the limited narration of the film), he leads them into a shout of "Rock with Olli Wee". Kids love it, and parents hate it. A DJ at the rink records it on tape, and later he goes to New York without Buddy Holly, not even knowing that he was ever recorded. This leads to the funniest scene in the film, filled with humorous moments. The amplified disc jockey from Buffalo is calling Buddy at home. DJ plays "It will be a day" for 12 hours and goes for 24. Cops knock on the barricaded door of the station. Holly is confused, but when the dust settles, he is very excited. He speaks to the boys, and their rapid rise begins. Dan Stroud, as a drummer, and Charles Martin Smith, as a bass player, perfectly complement the band and support good chemistry with each other. There are problems, but not exaggerated dramas that can be found in most rock films (all?). The film also does not manipulate you. Your emotions soar, but they are not manipulated. When the Crickets go to the Apollo stage in Harlem, the first white band to ever play there, then burst into the electrically charged “Oh Boy” performance and win the audience, my loving rock and roll ass is choking and crying. Further, Bucy and the guys make “It's so easy” sounds more fun and heartier than I might have thought. <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows the story of Buddy Holly even a little knows where this movie ends. Holly died in a plane crash with Richie Wales and Big Bopper, too young. We, as spectators, know this, but the film is so well written, directed and acted with love, that we forget about it almost immediately. The film is not about his death, but about his life and his place in the history of rock and roll. The film ends with his last gig, and it's a good fifteen minutes of swaying Bucy, possessed by the ghost of Buddy Holly. I was happy to hear him finish it on “Not Fade Away,” my favorite of his songs. The film is frozen to the end, and information about a plane crash appears in it, but I hardly noticed it. I was still thinking about how good this last song is.
