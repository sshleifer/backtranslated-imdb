It was the most thought-provoking film about the death penalty ever! He refused to appear one-sided, and the emotions felt throughout history are as real as possible. This film was one of the most "human" (and I correctly use this term) compassionate religious characters! This film actually made me go out to find and read a book (which is rare for me). Sister Elena showed more spiritual tone than religious (which is also rare). And it put both parties to the question so that people on both sides who watched the movie did not feel that the point was left out. And we have a director to thank for that. This is not a movie for fun. But this is a film that conveys a message that can penetrate the heart of your heart. I can't think of another movie like this.
