One way or another, you cannot get away from the main message. The strong survive. Those who are mentally or emotionally sensitive go away. They leave a hole in the lives of those who love them. The hole, which is visible in its finality as selfish. This is what Phoebe understands at the end. Just before helping Wolf heal from his guilt. She may agree to the disappearance of ... her sister. Beautiful European landscapes. There is a lot of truth in it about idealism and dependence on the next important point. For a moment, I thought of the Baader-Meinhoff gang, which was in the early 70s. I liked this film because it reflected the time when I myself came of age.
