Watching the Armored preview, I thought the film would be either very bad or very good. Fortunately, the film was interesting, intense and realistic. There is never a crime committed, and Armored showed why. The film perfectly shows, when people get into a stressful situation, they behave like animals. The last hour of the film is very interesting. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. Hard to believe that Dillon is 50 years old. I would buy this movie. I give armored eight out of ten. Not a Christmas movie. I already wrote ten lines? Nope In any case, not so many militants. Armored has great excitement, which gives the viewer the opportunity to choose another comedy.
