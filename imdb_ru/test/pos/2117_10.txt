My mother and I went to the premiere in Fort Worth, mainly to see George Strait, but in the end got a chance to see the premiere of the film at Bass Hall. What a wonderful, beautiful film that not only depicts a beautiful Texan landscape, but also has an excellent storyline. It was well written, directed and produced, and my mom and I loved it from beginning to end! Thank you, Jay, for giving us the opportunity to become part of the premiere of this wonderful film. It was a night that we will never forget. As if watching the movie was not enough, we were also lucky enough to sit in 4 rows in front of my favorite singer George Strait !! Thank you thank you thank you!! Keep up the good work again, thanks! <br /> <br /> Debbie McClendon & Maureen Daugherty Ft. Worth, Texas
