A wonderful librarian played by Playboy model Christine DeBell, falls asleep and dreams of a strange world filled with exceptionally free people ?? Do these people like to sing, dance and fool around ?? Does Alice have a series of sensual adventures among these characters ?? <br /> <br /> The movie was originally shot as a poem about erotica with several obvious sex scenes that were ultimately cut from his theatrical release ?? However, in the versions of videotapes there are several original erotic encounters connected at the end with them. <br /> <br /> The producers of this film did an incredibly good job for a film with a very low budget. The cinematography is full of life and energy, the dances and the numbers are quite professional, and the acting is attractive. No doubt this is one of the best adult fairy tales around ??
