After watching this film, I realized that Drew Barrymore is a great actress. This movie would not be available for viewing without Drew. The fact that someone as attractive as Drew could actually freak me out, and she did it when there was “Josie Grossy.” Her attempts to "go", as the cool girls called it, were fun, especially her attempts to dance in a nightclub. <br /> <br /> We also had SNL's favorite, Molly Shannon, playing a big part in the role of Anita, and Josie's best friend. One of the funniest scenes in the film was Anita, who tried to teach school sex. It was one of the funniest and best performances of Molly. <br /> <br /> Lily Sobeski also had a great role, and I was really worried about her, because I know people like her who were so tormented. <br /> <br /> This film is a must-have for Drew Barrymore fans because Drew is shooting a movie.
