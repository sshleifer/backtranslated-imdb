This is one of the most enjoyable adaptations of the book to television. An actress who makes us believe that Borg can be sexual makes us believe that a spy and a traitor can have some redemptive qualities. <br /> <br /> The plot of the television story does not quite correspond to the plot of Cornwell, but at the same time exciting and useful as retelling damn good yarn. If you have a desire for a romance in the form, a lot of sexual energy breaks out between our boy Sharpe and the lying bustle. He made me wish her role to be closer to the one in the books. But regardless of whether the hero was offended enough, the hero was redeemed, the hero was furious, the hero in flight, and the hero in battle to keep you informed about your DVDs.
