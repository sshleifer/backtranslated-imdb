Like others who have commented on the Internet ... I am a 130 pilot in the coast guard. Having said that, and being a skeptic, I expected excessive cheese factors. It was a bit of cheese, but overall not a lot ... and the film was pretty accurate. <br /> <br /> Today I watched the trailer again. After watching the film yesterday, I realized that the trailer gives the impression that the film is nothing but salvation after the rescue fighters. This is not true. <br /> <br /> There are more characters and stories in the film than in action movies. The internal struggle faced by Costner and Kutcher. Kutcher is revealed further than the film, than Costner. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a small love story ... unsurprisingly. But for the most part, the film tells about two lives that come together, and after a while help each other to heal old wounds. <br /> <br /> As a girl, as it sounds, Costner and as much as I try not to love him, Kutcher works really well together and complements each other very well in the film. <br /> <br /> According to critics, you have already seen it all before. Top Gun, officer and gentlemen, etc. But what movie was not redone a million times. <br /> <br /> I can remember only one spoken word F ... and I can not remember any other language. <br /> <br /> The film lasts 2 hours, and for some it may be slightly longer by the end. <br /> <br /> You will laugh, you can cry, but I can honestly say it cost 4 dollars that I paid. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the movie.
