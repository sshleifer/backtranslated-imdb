I can get very tired of the murder mysteries, with the exception of a few really excellent TV shows. Otherwise, too many such murder stories. I do not like the subject of two super-intelligent, selfish young people who kill as an intellectual exercise, I am not interested in any way in Hitchcock, which seems to have been associated with this in some way, I'm not going to find out about, But don't get me wrong The theme itself is excellent, the whole film is very well made, and, of course, Sandra Bullock is, as always, excellent. <br /> <br /> Sandra's character (as in Miss Congeniality) is not appreciated by the male team she works with, despite her obvious skills, and the boss basically ignores her ideas, eventually throwing her aside and bringing the matter to the end. her male partner. Of course, Sandra understands what is happening, and almost dies in a very dramatic denouement. Interestingly, the boy who developed the murder plan cannot allow her to be killed by his colleague - he has some conscience and maybe he can be “saved”, and the other is a real psychopath. <br /> <Sandra's hard shell is caused by suffering in her past, which is closely related to the murder case. Her colleague, realizing that Sandra is solving this case, despite the fact that she is confronted by a dense boss, finally discovers what happened to Sandra herself in her teens, that now she must face off and drive out, and the last scene shows her the beginning - we still hope - to do just that. <br /> <br /> I can see from several other reviews that I had time to read that this film will attract a wide group - those who are interested in two spoiled boys who spend their time with their terrible philosophical determination to deceive the police and to commit a perfect murder, the relationship between them, which is so cleverly depicted, the terrible connections to the heroine past, the police theme, and some smokes and mirrors - as well as for Hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> For those who wondered why the character of Bullock should have a problematic past, I really think it would be a much less interesting film if it were just a detective trying to understand what was going on with ready to help fellow and chauvinist boss. Is the connection between the murder victim and the detective needed to show that the detective got too carried away or how else would she lose the trust of her arrogant boss and thus almost lose her life? This is hardly an original topic, in fact it’s usually an extremely annoying topic, as this chauvinist boss is brutally telling his disappointed but clearly inspired operative to get out of the business and leave him to someone who clearly doesn’t have enough skills to solve nice though chum is. In the end, I was very worried about what might happen to Sandra's character, because her emotional involvement in the case and a special sympathy for the unfortunate victim of the crime dangerously forced her to end this case. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed by the relationship between the character of Bullock and her girlfriend. This happens interesting, and sometimes very badly. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two boys is definitely intriguing, if that's what you wanted to see. I felt that this was to some extent restrained, either because the filmmakers did not want to make friends too much, or because we should not have thought that emotions govern their relationship. The film cleverly makes you wonder which boy is in charge of the situation, and there are some twists and turns, and the boys show their hidden immaturity at different stages. <br /> <br /> There is one thing I would like to clarify, and this is what happens "after the movie ends" when Sandra's character comes to court ... you need to watch the movie to find out why there. <br /> <br /> Everyone played very well. Of course, I cannot agree with those who complained about the actions of Bullock - she was gorgeous. This part is very suitable for her. The story is exciting, even if the riddles of murder are not yours, and they are not so often mine.
