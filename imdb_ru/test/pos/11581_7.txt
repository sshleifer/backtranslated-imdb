I believe this is a great achievement in order to be able to present the audience with a real tail about a weak person; tail, in which the main character will spend most of the film on his back, in bed and absolutely can not move. Yet the achievement lies in the effectiveness of the film as a dramatic work; as a memory of a true story, and I suggest, as an argument, why people should have the right to die if they want it. But the film is not a political statement and, perhaps, fortunately, it shies away from too many scenes of debate, although in any case it includes for the sake of argument. Moreover, it is one of those films in a foreign language, in which his main character is depicted as a cripple, who can do nothing except talk to people around him, but in any case may seem attractive and convincing to them. <br /> <br /> So, instead of being a controversial argument, the film is a more enjoyable, but timely, dramatic storyline about the other person wanting something or looking for something; the only difference is that the achievement of this “goal” would mean the termination of someone’s life, and this would be achieved if you did not go physically anywhere. Javier Bardem plays a real Galician Ramon Sampedro, a man who at a much earlier age plunged into water that was too shallow for such an activity. This made him bedridden for the rest of his life, and his desire to die is the focus of attention of Chilean director Alejandro Amenabar. We have seen a lot of films in our lives, in which characters have certain “goals” or goals that need to be met before the film ends, to provide a satisfactory experience for the audience, but the change of pace in “Sea inner space” is soft; this does not mean that young, energetic, attractive heroes go to fight in remote places, but a real person after something that means so much to them. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a strong policy, either For or against euthanasia, you can hope that Ramon will still get what he wants in the end. The film sets the tone very early, when Ramon makes a speech about why he wants to die, watching family members, immediately presenting the situation and submitting to viewers who may not know what the film is about. Interestingly, some of the family members are “against” what he wants, which can put any audience member who has strong feelings for the subject in their respective shoes. But the purpose of this production is to tell the audience: “No, this is not one person after something, which, by the way, his whole family supports him to the end”. Quite easily, the film could have taken the path that Sampedro’s family opposes everyone else, but some are an idea against Ramón; some are too young to understand what is really going on, while others seem to be too upset to even have some opinion, and not just want Ramon to hold on a little longer, they still love him. <br /> <br /> The Sea Inside is a continuation of a story revolving around some kind of sacrifice. Ramon is paralyzed, and from his point of view we see things. This is something that can disconnect viewers or make a film rather strange, considering that we are shown the film from the point of view of the victim, and not the instigator or protagonist of the film, who always causes a reason in the film. Causal relationship. But this is not a criticism, but the director’s merit for an effective approach to such an approach. The film asks questions; he offers a script for his audience. If you were in the position of Ramona: what would you do, think, dream or speak? Consequently, the dreams of a lawyer Dzhuila (Rueda) are removed not so much for the pleasure of the audience, but because they represent a very small window in the fantasy of the escapist of one person from his predicament. <br /> <br /> Julia’s study intensifies a little later, when she begins to share certain similarities with Ramon, it is then that she begins to have strokes caused by her own illness. This trait seems timely in the development of their relationship and adds another communication component on top of the already involved friendship. This is because Julia feels physical pain and limitations, not in the sense that she can not get up and walk, but I think she understands the value of life, given how emotionally ill she felt in advance. Although the film is based on a true story and covers the topic of euthanasia, it reminds a drama about a person in a situation in which he is ready to fight for what he wants, but must do so orally. It's nice to see films like The Sea Inside, because it not only refers to the story and gives us an idea about it, but it is also a separate film that demonstrates an emotional and attractive level.
