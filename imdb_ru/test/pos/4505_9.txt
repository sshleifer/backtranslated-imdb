"KITE RUNNER" is one of those modern epics that is sometimes used. Covering two continents, several family generations, and many decades, this film involves many things, including friendship, love, loss, and, ultimately, redemption. <br /> <br /> His main engine is young Amir (Zekeria Ebrahimi)), an Afghan boy who often plays with hired help; mostly young Hassan (Ahmad Khan Makhmudzad), Khazar boy, whose family is supposedly inferior to the ruling Afghans. But these two form bonds of friendship based on education (Amir teaches Hassan to read), intimacy in Amir's house and, of course, flying kites. <br /> <br /> But the bad times of Kabul are coming for the city. The communists are invading, and Amir and Hassan split up because of the incredibly cruel prejudice of the Afghan boy against Hassan. They may never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Amir’s father runs to get himself and his son out of Afghanistan, eventually finding a way to America. Here they founded a gas station and live live selling in niche markets. And when Amir’s father gradually falls ill, a new revelation will strike Amir’s heart; one that he cannot ignore and demands his return to his beloved Kabul. <br /> <br /> Studying friendship, war and reconciliation, “Running Serpent” is truly a fantastic movie. When we are in a foreign country, the stories are never improperly spoken in English, and only in broken English, when we are in America. It was refreshing and gave a feeling of realism. <br /> <br /> The game was at the level of the best, which you will see too. Of particular note is Homayun Ershadi, who plays Baba, Amir’s sick father and strong patriarch. Also lead Khalid Abdullah, since the elder Amir plays well, especially when he returns to Kabul to find him in the ruins; quite the contrast with when he left. <br /> <br /> Afghanistan’s cinematography during Amir’s escape and his final return is nothing but breathtaking, with snowy peaks that will make your mouth relax (I don’t know exactly which mountain range they used in the film but wherever it is, I would like to go there and shoot it myself!) But it’s not a movie or an acting game of one or two people that makes this movie a success. This is a simple story, told very well, which is worth it to watch movie lovers. Highly recommended.
