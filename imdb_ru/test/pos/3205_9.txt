I really like this show. It has drama, romance and comedy. I am 28 years old and I am a married mother, so I can identify with the experiences of Lorelei and Rory in the series. Recently, I watched mostly replays on the Family Channel, so I am not aware of what is happening now. I think that women would like this show more than men, but I know that some men will like it there! I really like that this is an hour, not half an hour, as it seems that this hour flies by unnoticed when I watch it! Give a chance if you have never seen the show! I think Lorelei and Luke are my favorite characters in the series, mainly because they are with each other. How could you not see that something was there (or, I think, I should say it took so much time)? <br /> <br /> Enjoy your viewing!
