044: The Great Footprint (1930) - released 10/24/1930; viewed 4/5/06. <br /> <br /> BIRTHDAYS: Richard Harris, Harold Pinter, Robert Atkins. <br /> <br /> DOUG: In Hollywood, Raoul Walsh presented his latest film, The Big Footprint, a western western story across the border, played by 23-year-old actor John Wayne. In 1930, we see a lot of "first", but few "best." In addition to the first John Wayne film, we have the first widescreen film (although we only watched the full-frame version). Interestingly, the decision to shoot in widescreen mode was, in fact, the very reason why the widescreen image became popular later: to compete with television, which was not yet on sale, but still curious. Nevertheless, this film was extremely good, giving us a painful look at the march to Oklahoma. Opening title cards give us to understand that this is the western one of the most traditional types, about America, about the earth, who should live on it, and so on. And this is a great demonstration of this. Walsh gives us some amazing visual images of a company of wagons in the desert (when they reach the cliff, they have to take down each cart in turn), and we also get a plot of revenge in which Wayne pursues the man who killed one of his friends. (I think I remember something like this in the stage). Wayne’s tough cowboy routine will certainly continue to evolve, at least in part, in subsequent films. Since this film represents all the works of Wayne in the early 30s for Odyssey, we will not see his face again until Stagecoach, but as soon as we do, we will continue to see him to the end of Odyssey and beyond. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Ah, our first Western sound and the first lead role of John Wayne. This is Raoul Walsh's Great Trail. This review will be short, as several weeks have passed, as I watched it. I liked this movie, but it was far from a masterpiece. The most predictable adventure had several surprises, for example, when the brains of the bad guys, Red Flack (Tyrone Power Sr. in his last role) was killed halfway through; I thought he would be the boss at the end, but in the end it was Bill Thorpe (Ian Keith). I remember that I didn't like the way Breck (Wayne) kills Thorpe and demands revenge at the end. I realized that this is what he should have done in this story, but I really didn’t like his reasoning when he tells Ruth why he should do it. I think he bore much greater responsibility before the hundreds of settlers, whom he led through the stern west. <br /> <br /> Last viewed movie: Crackers with animals (1930).
