I was not sure about this movie before rolling and made it, assuring that Hilary Swank always gave excellent performances in his films. She seems to rely on restraint to get the emotional impact she makes. And she did not prove that I was wrong in this film. <br /> <br /> However, the film also had fantastic performances from all the other actors, both speaking and non-speaking. I have to single out Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor - the two main characters - for their outstanding acting skills and portrayal of true human feelings and shortcomings. The whole movie was almost like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I have to welcome Tom Hooper as a director and Avril Box as an editor for ensuring that the multi-layered story is smoothly revealed, while maintaining dialogue and action in an understandable way. fashion. The striking sequence of the South African landscape was striking, and I had to press the pause button to enjoy the photo. <br /> <br /> Why such a film cannot be nominated for an international award. It seems to me to hit the high rating button on all items. It was not just a film, it was a real experience of living in a country emerging from apartheid. Life around poverty was around, but it glorified the dignity of the human spirit.
