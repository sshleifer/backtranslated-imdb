I played Sam (the doorman, Lou's sidekick) in the movie “Dead Rail”, which was later shown as “Alien Express”. And I must say that for my part I really enjoyed watching this movie. For me, as a struggling actor, it was a chance to work with fantastic people, he gave me great scenes to play in the video and let me work on the dream for a month and a half (without waiting tables!) Turi (director) And Steve and Scott (producers) Were very kind, giving me the opportunity to participate in the production. I made many friends (Lou, Todd, Stephen), and I consider myself very lucky that I was able to work with these incredibly talented people. There was not a day for me not to laugh. The real tragedy is not so much in the special effects as in the fact that every person who watched this film did not see what was happening behind the scenes and all the talents who really entered it. Masters, building sets, masters, guardians, dressing rooms, makeup artists, script writers, filmmakers, production assistants, extras, craft services, producers, directors and actors. It is believed that science fiction has not spent a terrible amount of money on the film (2 million), but a lot of time, energy and human power was invested in it. Now I look at the film as a production, in which many talented people have gathered for a fun project, shot without complications in less than two months. It was a great cast and film crew, and I'm just very happy to be a part of it! Another note for those of you who do not know Lou Diamond Phillips, Todd Bridges and Stephen Brand. These are fantastic people who are incredibly funny. Lou I am still working on my impression of DENIRO and I cannot thank you for introducing me to Midnight Run. Todd, every time I hear a Elvis song, I can't forget the story you told me about hanging out with him at his house for dinner. "Could you pass me the patterns?" (I AM A HUGE ELVIS FAN!) Stephen, "Mr. Brand!" You are a true gentleman, and all the advice and encouragements I received from you will always be appreciated. I miss you guys and hope you are well. Thank you for the good memories, stories, jokes and friendship. Oh, and Miss Uta says hi! winked. <br /> <br /> joe
