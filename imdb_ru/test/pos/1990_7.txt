An exciting study of virtual reality, although it is not yet clear what the director himself was counting on. This film deliberately guides you through several layers of artificial reality, leaving only subtle clues about which virtual reality layer you are in, creating an ontological confusion for the viewer to think about. <br /> <br /> It can also be viewed as a satire of video games — although the entire movie may be misled by the imitative form. It seems he cannot break out of the video game genre, which he imitates; thus satire becomes problematic. <br /> <br /> Despite this, many interesting ideas are ubiquitous: a biological mutant is one; interface technology and biology, cyborg's desire to transcend reality — and philosophical allusions, such as Heidegger’s heading, along with existential questions: that is, game characters are partially written or defined and yet partially free to change their destiny, and they are surprised at how strange It is felt in the game. Then one character notes that this existential confusion is like real life, thereby again blurring the distinction between virtual and real. Similarly, with the observation that it is unpleasant to stumble in a world where you do not know what will happen next, and you do not know how to play, as you must stumble to learn the purpose and the unknown rules. The virtual game in the game is called “TranscendenZ”. Also criticism of how virtual violence makes us unable to feel the effects of real violence. Even heroes at every level of ontological existence are confused in violence. They do not like it, but it is fascinating and is part of the “game” that they fear is real. <br /> <br /> The creator of the game, the god of the system, is finally killed; nevertheless, this scenario unfolds in parallel with the video game that we have just witnessed, and viewers believe that it is still part of virtual reality. In the end, the film does not resolve doubts as to whether it is “real”, but the gist is clear (at least for me). Existenz means Da-sein: you are here. You fall into a set of rules and riddles at each level. Ontologically, virtual reality repeats reality. And his general playful motifs express, as the royal path to the unconscious, our own passion for violence. <br /> <br /> However, although Cronenberg confirms these philosophical hints in an interview about the film, he claims that he is very much against “Reality ... {the underground name of the terrorist group}, depicted in the film and in the game, and at the "real" level. It seems that Kronenberg himself did not think too much about the film, although his impressive education can be traced. The Cineaste interview gives the impression of a middle class intellectual who is trying to be avant-garde by inclination. Kronenberg is simply on the side of free imagination — a cliché of bourgeois modernist creed — despite the duality recognized there. (My impression here may be due to one limited interview.) However, Kronenburg seems to overlook the fact that his film betrays the imitative form of delusion (here imitating computer games, making a satirical criticism of them, but unable to “transcend” the same form), probably because he actually thinks that it is “figurative” and radical. And yet the creative world of the film is less tolerant and more elusive, than our own too real world. It remains trapped in the outlook of a computer game.
