This is the only thing that I can look back on from 2006 and say that it happened. It swayed strongly, and yet it also swayed deliciously. Mr.MEATLOAF added a slight touch to this movie dish before the opening credits rolled through. Now, that tells you something, this film is shocked even before it began! Now I don't want to give away too much or be a "spoiler", but this film is ROCKED! If you heard the new album and thought to yourself: “It seems to be a bit of poor-quality persistent material, it's as if I'm just playing badminton with Satan, what gives?” a masterpiece. For those who would like this, it’s better not to know what they want, because there would be no D. this film is a period D! ,
