Co-author of the script, William H. Macy from, perhaps, the best and most difficult to find Donald Westlake novel - “Travesty”. * Very * true to the story, in the film, Macy plays an unfortunate man who goes too far after trying to hide an accident. Bonfires Adam Arkin and James Cromwell in good supporting roles. The strength of the film is in the “turn-by-turn” storyline and in the acting, especially Macy, who usually breaks through the 4th wall here and gets away with it every time. A good storyline with a lot of dark humor, this one attracted me so much that I watched it three times a week since its release. Get ready to put your critical abilities on the shelf and publish a loud, two-party "fieee!"
