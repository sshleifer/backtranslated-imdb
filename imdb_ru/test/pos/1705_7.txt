I have mixed emotions about this film, especially if you compare it with its predecessor, <br /> <br /> “American werewolf in London”. There were funny moments in this film, it was even worse than anything else. This updated version, now installed in Paris, does not have such an “advantage” at all and simply does not belong to the same class ... but it has something good that the first film didn’t have, and on the whole it is still interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> So, apart from the “purists-werewolves”, most of whom consider this film to be pure rubbish compared to the London version, I will still give it a decent rating, because I don’t care what others think . I liked it, although I agree that “London” is better, and I also prefer this version. <br /> <br /> The first 30-40 minutes of this film are strictly played out for laughter, including the hysterical “balloon” scene in a restaurant. It also represents the main female role played by Julie Delpy. I do not see enough of this actress. It seems that she does not shoot so many films, nor less than those that I heard about here in America. This French actress has a face of classic beauty, so the film has glasses for taking it off and it looks great. <br /> <br /> When horror begins, it can become scary, and the special effects are good. I also liked the absence of profanity in this film, unlike the first: without the words and the evil words of the Lord - in vain! <br /> <br /> However, there are a lot of sexual remarks, and there is one scene with a guy running out of a bar tied to a cross, which was sacrilegious to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal, which is also not suitable for a middle-aged guy like me. This film is designed for a little over 20 years, if it helps someone. <br /> <br /> He is interesting ... just don’t expect him to live to see the first movie.
