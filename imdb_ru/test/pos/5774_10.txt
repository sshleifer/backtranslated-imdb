Hello, I was wondering if anyone has a copy of the movie "Broken Promise" ?? I loved this film as a child and watched it every time it was included. YEARS have passed since I saw this, and I would like to receive a copy. I checked the entire internet and could not find it. If someone has a copy for exchange or sale, please email me at NoelGypsy@Yahoo.com ... Thank you and have a good night !! Christine --------- "broken promise" was given to eleven-year-old Melissa Michaels, whose parents abandoned her and her brothers and sisters. Accepted by the district, Michaels was forced to watch helplessly as her brothers and sisters divorced and divorced in different families. One of the children even brought up. The juvenile court officer Chris Sarandon joins Michelsen in her fight to reunite his family under one roof. Broken Promise was originally offered as a presentation of the General Foods Golden Showcase. It was the first telecast on May 5, 1981.
