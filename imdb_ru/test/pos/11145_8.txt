The story takes place in rural Germany on the eve of the Second World War, a unique situation where a pair of British agents are held by the Germans in a farmhouse. Since technically they are not yet at war, it seems that both sides must have understood what is going on. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) flee to the countryside and disintegrate. Milland meets the Gypsy Marlene Dietrich one evening when she cooks dinner alone in her camp. Their meeting is an amazing and exciting scene, not so much for Milland, as for Dietrich, who takes the sexual heat of a whole new level. Milland is disguised as a Gypsy to hide from the Germans, but he is still committed to his mission to find a scientist who knows the formula for a new poisonous gas, but is also not a convinced Nazi. Hollywood perceptions of gypsy life and customs are predictably portrayed, but the fundamental knowledge that they will be one of the goals of destruction by the Nazis adds some tension. The film covers the line between a serious story about poison gas and an urgent search for a formula, as well as a colorful, but not too convincing love story between Milland and Dietrich. However, they are both very good; it’s the film’s fault that it didn’t give them or their relationship dramatic realism enough, relying on and using obvious cultural differences for dubious comedy purposes. Nevertheless, there are some tense and interesting moments here and there, unexpected meetings with German soldiers and Gestapo agents, where Dietrich reads palm trees perfectly, and Milland almost equally fakes, and a dinner party of Germans of various stripes. an announcement comes over the radio that Germany has been attacked by Poland, and everyone stands up and cheers. Mitchell Layson may have missed some of the opportunities here and there, but he took full advantage of others.
