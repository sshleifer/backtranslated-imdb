Tipping Velvet is one of the modern television programs that proves that some TVs can be as good or even better (like this) than what you see in your local theater. <br /> <br /> If you want to read the plot, read this, and if you want other details to be missed before the next paragraph. This is an unforgettable portrait of an unconventional young girl named Nan, who works with a naive oyster until she finds her repressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named Kitty, who dresses as a man for her stage profession. Soon the young girl joins the act as another male imitator, and they became a major hit. Soon they both enter into a tender. Kitty ultimately finds herself married in a calculation and destroys the heart of young Nan. Since then, Nan has worked as a male prostitute who imitates men who want to have sex with boys, then she becomes a private slave for the evil and sadomasochistic Diana, where Nan is experiencing severe emotional abuse. When it ends badly, Nan is back on the streets, where she recalls a young woman named Florence; a kindhearted socialist who had the true potential to be a wonderful partner. This is where Nan will discover the power of socialism and learn how to return to glory. <br /> <br /> The show from Region 1 is distinguished by exceptional image quality, a very good selection of scenes, a vibrant photo gallery and a cheerful interview between the novelist Sarah Waters and the film's author Andrew Davis. <br /> <br /> Magnificent scenery, costumes, cinematography and music. Acting, writing and directing are extremely strong and filled with realism, class and originality. I loved the movie and the novel. Section III in the film is significantly different in the film than in the novel, because section III in the novel is well recorded, but not the screen material. I will be brave and say that I love films interpreting this much more. <br /> <br /> In this fascinating story, drama, comedy, erotica and romance with lively perfection are combined in an original way, which at the same time deeply excites and inspires spiritually. For every mature and open-minded adult who has ever felt the pleasures, the pain and the power of being in love and full of life. Revolutionary production; absolutely must see!
