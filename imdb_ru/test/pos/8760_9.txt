If you have not seen this, then follow this. It is available on DVD. This is channel 4 (UK), possibly in combination with German and Danish television. If you've seen the movie, it's basically the same story. Several alternating stories related to drug trafficking. The story jumps between a housewife (played by the great Lindsay Duncan) trying to make a deal on behalf of her husband, who, to her surprise, is an international drug dealer (and a dangerous person in general). <br /> <br /> A Minister who is involved in his work to the detriment of his family is investigating the entire situation with international drug trafficking. He receives several revelations from the reality of heroin when his daughter has a “problem”. He then officially visits Pakistan, where he seems to be taught that abuse (and not just a drug or its accidental use) is a problem, and he also tries some products (a great scene, where he simultaneously realizes what attraction is and why and why this is such a problem). In Pakistan, we see the other side. The despair of farmers who can barely survive is transformed into the production of opium and criminals. Meaningless attempts to subsidize enrich the system. And a country so drugged, but only a relatively small part of the abuse that we have in the west. Around all this, a customs officer / Interpol agent is trying to catch a “Dutch” connection in heroin smuggling. In search of justice for his dead partner. This is truly a masterpiece. Super, understated performances from all the main actors, as only European cinema can do. <br /> <br /> Must see. Especially if you have seen the film, they complement each other and present some subtly different opinions / views from both sides of the pond.
