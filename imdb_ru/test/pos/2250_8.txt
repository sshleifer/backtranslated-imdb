Let me start by saying that Liev received a lot of respect from me when he saw his directorial debut “Everything Is Illuminated”. Anyone who has read the book knows how rich the story is with Alex’s senseless and fun vocabulary, along with countless scenes of memories and crazy scenes like dreams. Liev took it all and made it work. The film itself is great - soundtrack, performances, cinematography - it all works. There are a lot of stories about the city and its inhabitants, but much can be done with indie, so this part didn’t bother me much. It is simply disappointing that not many people will watch this film or even find out that it exists due to the lack of advertising that accompanied it. I did not even know that it was in cinemas. I did not know when the DVD came out. You might think that since Frodo Baggins was one of the main characters, SOMEBODY, at least, released a commercial for him. I had to watch the trailer on my Paradise Now DVD (released on DVD in spring 2006) to even know that it had a theatrical release date of Autumn 2005. Haha - sad really. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you stumble upon this review, because someone of your friends read the book and loved it, or watched the movie and recommends watching it - take my advice and see it. This is a very good experience. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
