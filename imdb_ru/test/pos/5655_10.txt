Every American who thinks he understands World War II should watch this movie. Few Hollywood war films have challenged the stereotypes of Japanese soldiers, since insensitive cattle obey orders without thinking. We like to think that every Japanese was ready and able to fight to the death, right up to the day we bombed Nagasaki. The “fires on the plain” show a different reality: the troops are pathetically undelivered, demoralized and hungry to a degree of cannibalism. They euphemistically call human flesh "monkey meat." The film and the novel on which it was based also dispelled the myth that all Japanese soldiers preferred death to surrender: they had good reason to believe that their enemies were not inclined to take prisoners. For me, this raises the question that most Americans would prefer to avoid: if the Japanese military were so beaten up at this stage of the war, why was it necessary to fire Hiroshima?
