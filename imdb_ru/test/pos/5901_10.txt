For me, this is for the movie that the song Vigno "Mon pays, ce n'est pas un pays". In addition, Jean Ducheppe himself was part of the legendary Quebec. <br /> <br /> This film can be contrasted with “CRAZY”, the current release in Quebec, which is quite successful for showing here in Spain, and about 1960. Quebec City (Crazy) vs. Rural Quebec (Antoine). But also a film that should be something completely different for foreigners and for people who know Quebec from the inside.
