This is a romantic comedy, so it's really a fairy tale, but unconventional. Cinderella, instead of living in the ashes, lives in an overpriced castle in the suburbs with a handsome husband who is not a prince. She does find her prince, but he is not so handsome. Instead of a castle, at least initially, she gets a tiny walk through Manhattan. <br /> <br /> Pfeifer, Stockwell and Ruehle lead the cast of fully realized, albeit slightly excessive, characters. <br /> <br /> Demme reaches the highest level of filmmaking in my head. He creates a world in which I want to move - the area of ​​Manhattan and street life, teeming with life and society. <br /> <br /> I would like IMDb to be associated with other reviewer comments. I would like to know what the other films that made this film hate. I am always looking for lots of laughter and good places to live in for at least an hour or so.
