Many of the early British sound films that I saw in the video suffer from either poor print quality, or bad sound, or both. Fortunately, I managed to get a copy of this movie on a video of excellent quality, which allowed me to focus on the story itself. <br /> <br /> And it was a great story. At first glance, the passengers of the ill-starred bus looked pretty boring (except for the always sweet Jesse Matthews). But when the film came back to show the story of each passenger the day before the accident, I found that the cast, contrary to the original appearance, was a talented group of performers, skillfully tuned to bring true personality to their distinctive characteristics. <br /> <br /> Spectators may have different preferences regarding which two passengers will meet a tragic end, and which will survive. But the movie interests you, as it makes you guess. This film deserves a much wider audience - a real gem of early British cinema.
