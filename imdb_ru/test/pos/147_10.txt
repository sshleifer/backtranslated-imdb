Of the Korean films that I saw, only three really stayed with me. The first is a great horror "The Tale of Two Sisters." The second and third - and now the fourth - all these were the films of Park Chan Vuk, namely “Oldboy”, “Sympathy for the Lady Avenger”), and now “Thirst”. <br /> <br /> Park seems to remind me of Quentin Tarantino for his disregard for the convention. All of his films are shocking, but not in the gratuitous sense. This is more like it shows us what we do not expect to see - as a rule, situations that radically go against the moral foundations of society, such as incest or libidinal, bloodsucking, but pious priest. He is also quite artistic in terms of cinematography, and his films are among the most magnificent ones I've seen. <br /> <br /> Thirst is all about the said priest and a depressed woman without a conscience, he falls in love with - and even more. This is horror, drama and even comedy, as Puck disarms his audience with many inappropriate but funny situations. Thus, this may be his best work for me, since in his two other films, which I saw, there was no element of humor that would make them more acceptable for re-viewing.
