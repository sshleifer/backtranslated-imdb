I think that anyone whose stupid person risks becoming a wax mannequin just to go to a football match or does not want to get out of the car to "strip" him deserves what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The guy, Wade, who "went to the hairdresser and asked for He-Man's haircut," was not to my taste, but there is this really cute scene, when his eyebrows and facial hair are waxed. It's too expensive for me. <br /> <br /> Also funny, but not to my taste is a fat guy in big sunglasses who looks “like Elton John, only a geyer,” but this whole plot is not going anywhere! <br /> <br /> Blake was hot, I could see myself with him if he hadn’t been so in love with his girlfriend, who is fake Paris Hilton in a bad wig (there is no Chihuahua in her purse, although it could really valuable). I don't think girls who look like that go to football games anyway. Nick car thief is the sexiest! One of the best moments is where the soccer ball lands on him, and instead of throwing it back, he throws his cigarette and she burns football. See, this is just the guy he is. He has a sister who looks silly, borrowing her white beater wife. Her bra straps show half the movie! <br /> <br /> Basically, you just want to find your feet and never go to football games after seeing this.
