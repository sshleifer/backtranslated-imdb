Just watched it on the Hallmark channel. I was surprised, John Denver! This film was full of clichés, but this was to be expected (made for a TV Christmas movie - come on!) The acting is just as good as in any other 80s made for a television movie. History, as I said, is predictable and cliché, but still good. If you are looking for a funny Christmas movie, it will surely scratch your itch. <br /> <br /> I was also pleased to learn that this happened in Georgetown, Colorado. This is a true mountain town west of Denver. Very cool, because this is my native region. <br /> <br /> I have never been a big fan of John Denver (I always thought he was very cute), but he was a decent actor. He is very good in the role of the good old guy he played in this film. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see it, than then. I am sure it will be again in 2007.
