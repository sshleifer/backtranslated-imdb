"Married To The Mob" was one of the first VHS tapes that I had with Coming To America and Grease. After all these years, I still have fond memories of this film. Hell, I still have the VHS of this film in good condition. <br /> <br /> History: secret policeman Mike Downey (Matthew Modine) is sent to spy on Angela de Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer), wife of the murdered mafia member Frank "Cucumber" De Marco (Alec Baldwin). He later falls in love with her after he realizes that she is innocent of all this. Angela has to deal not only with the undesirable achievements of Mafia boss Tony "Tigger" Rousseau (Dean Stockwell), but also with the jealous wife of Connie Rousseau (Mercedes Ruehl). <br /> <br /> Married to Mob is funny and still maintains your interest when not trying to be funny. I like the little shots that are needed for the life of the mafia (the jealous wife of the mafia, the mafia boss who does not understand that he is not a magnet for chicks, etc.). And you like the characters of Angela De Marco and Mike Downey. It was the last of the fun stages of Jonathan Demme, before he became serious and gave you such pearls as Philadelphia and Silence Of The Lambs (the best thriller of all time). If you're in the mood for comedy, Married To The Mob is a keeper. This is better than the rubbish that is coming to comedy today (“Epic Film”, “Date of the Film”, “Meeting with the Spartans”, “Disaster”, etc.).
