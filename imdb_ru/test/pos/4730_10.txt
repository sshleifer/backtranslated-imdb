After reading about this documentary, I shot it and watched it with my teenage children. It was surprisingly well balanced, showing the perspectives of each side and leaving many questions unanswered. This is how it should be. I do not watch a documentary to be told what to think. I am watching this to learn and draw my own conclusions. <br /> <br /> After that we went to Waco and visited the branch of Davidian at the fire site. It was a powerful lesson to see for yourself. And this led to the fundamental integrity behind Waco: Participation Rules. If you just open your eyes and see, the facts can speak for themselves.
