As noted in many other comments that I read, I fell in love with this film when I was a kid. My sister and I had a copy of a beta movie (before VHS) that we were wearing. Of course, this did not help when our parents sold BetaMax on a sale in the garage. Since then we are trying to find a copy. I, like another commentator, eventually found a copy of the rental at a local video store. The owner would not part with a copy after any number of attempts to beg, bribe and cry as I became the owner of the tape. GOOD NEWS! Two days ago, I bought a brand new VHS copy of Midnight Madness for $ 9.99 on Amazon.com two days ago !!!! In the end, Disney woke up. Now, if they just re-release the Song of the South ... If you like the film, take it. If you haven’t seen the movie yet, it’s worth checking out - completely stupid humor, but a lot of fun (Stephen Furst is hilarious).
