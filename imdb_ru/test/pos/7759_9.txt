Good animation, good character design and carefree plot make Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> After the first viewing, I thought that this anime was pretty good, but much better for the second hours. <br /> <br /> This is because it is done in chronological order, and as soon as you look at it in the correct order, you will notice links that you have not seen before. (OR it may be that you see the second value for some events that you have not noticed before). You can read Tanigawa Nagaru's original novels (not manga) before / after viewing this. Anime very well displays every detail in the stories that it shows. <br /> <br /> However, there are several stories in the book that are not animated, but have links to them (bamboo with the wishes shown in episode 14). In general, this anime is actually very good once after a brief analysis of the plot (reading the book also improves it). This is a good break in the skydiving anime that seems to take over.
