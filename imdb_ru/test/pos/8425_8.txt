Despite the fact that this production received a lot of bad reviews, it actually maintains a good age. Also note that this is not a BBC program, it was just licensed by Granada Ventures when the Jane Austen collection was released on DVD. <br /> <br /> So how does it fit in with other adaptations of the same novel? The most famous version these days is the 1995 film with Amanda Root as Ann Elliott and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Frederick Wentworth. This film was, of course, shorter, but a good snapshot of the story â€” the earlier version, in which Ann Fearbank and Brian Marshall were in equal roles, had four hours to tell the story, and she moved at a more leisurely pace. <br /> <br /> Firbank is good for ten years for her role, but she is very good - Marshall is great as Wentworth, a man disappointed in love and bitter about interference. And in the cast, there are hidden people who also contributed - Michael Culver, later seen in Cadfael as Harville; Richard Vernon, later seen in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, as Admiral Croft; Noel Dyson, previously in Coronation Street, in the role of Mrs. Musgrove. <br /> <br /> One of my criticisms is that the hairstyles are a little distracting, and the costumes are terrible! However, this should not detract from Austin's extremely pleasant adaptation.
