This is a strange odd thing, filmed by a guy who edited the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Chuck Conners gives a stunningly funny performance as the owner of a roadside wax museum, near which our doomed teenagers are doomed. The wax figures look "so real," emphasizes one of the teens. He-he-he ... Not so much a slasher, as a strange mixture of psychological horror and old-fashioned terror in the style of the House of Wax. I can think of many, many horror movies that are worse than this.
