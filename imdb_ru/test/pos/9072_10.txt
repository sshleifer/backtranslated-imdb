In this film, the phenomenal films of major league stars are phenomenal! William Baldwin, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts !! This film was shot in one of my favorite years, in 1990 !! I am a Chicagoan, and the situation in Chicago was very recognizable and artistically accelerated !! I liked this film, and the excitement that motivated the climax in this picture was a powerful plot element that was sensational !! /> <br /> "Flatliners" center around a group of disgruntled medical students who want to be flat to achieve a kind of social protection !! When life does not make sense, it would be very illogical to be interested in apocalyptic nightmares !! At the same time, when their disgusting curiosity overcame them, there is no turning back! King of the hill (so to speak) - the one who shouts violently: I will do two minutes !! Who else is going to do it !! ANY WANT TO TRY TWO AND HALF !! Ultimately, all these new arrivals and highly undesirable accusations now have an extremely omnipresent character in the life of these guys! Implementing their justified or unjustified pathos required a full 360-degree view of the problems over which they were tormented !! Regardless of the purpose that this reckless and academic joke serves, this is definitely an original approach to asserting your personality !! I liked this film, 1990 was a good year for me, that year everything seemed to fall into place !! When I watched this movie in November 1990 in the evening, I was very happy about it!
