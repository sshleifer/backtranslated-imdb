The race against fear must be one of the most exciting television films that I have seen for a long time. All the performances from the main actors were excellent, especially Ariana Richards (Mickey Carlyle), William Bullimer (Coach Kurt Ansom) and Susan Blakely (Margaret Carlyle). Ariana, in particular, showed an extremely emotional presentation with facial expressions in line. She portrayed the emotions that Mickey felt perfectly, and you could easily believe that she was really raped, so realistic was her game. <br /> <br /> RAF is an incredibly realistic film, due to the thrilling performances from throwing. Bullimer showed himself incredibly well as a rapist, and you hated him more and more as the film developed. Blakely also played an emotional role in the role of the mother of a raped girl (Mickey Carlyle), and you are all the more sorry for the Carlyle family because no one believed them to rape. <br /> <br /> In general, RAF is a great movie. This is both touching and stressful, as you are constantly not sure that Ansom will be held accountable for rape due to the lack of witnesses, evidence and faith in the lawsuit. I highly recommend watching this movie.
