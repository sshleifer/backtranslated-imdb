Thirty years after the original film “Goodbye, Mr. Chips” was turned into a musical. Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark starred in this wonderful remake of the beloved school teacher Chippington, whom her beloved wife calls Chips. <br /> <br /> O'Toole was an excellent student and received another Oscar nomination. You have to wonder what Peter O'Toole must do to win an Oscar. He lost the coveted reward 8 times. You also have to wonder if he lost in 1969 to John Wayne for True Grit, which really testified to his long career and popularity. This year was also marked by the remarkable speeches of Richard Burton, Ann's Thousands of Days, as well as Dustin Hoffman and John Voight for The Midnight Cowboy. <br /> <br /> Surprised to see that Petula Clark will play Mrs. Chippington. However, since it was a musical, a beautiful voice sounded good and she played well too. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the scene when Chips continues in class, despite news that his beloved was killed in an explosion. He could not tell her the wonderful news about his career advancement. <br /> <br /> Beautiful cinematography and music only reinforced unforgettable impressions.
