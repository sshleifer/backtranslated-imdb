NBC produced a lot of good products when this series came out, but none of them got viewers. At least, according to their executives, who wisely canceled good shows, such as Star Trek & My World and Welcome To It, due to low ratings. NBC advertisers got the deal from NBC ignorance. <br /> <br /> This show is distinguished by the fact that the only time that James Garner lacked the audience. It's a shame, because this show received excellent support from Stuart Margolin (later Angel in Rockford files), to Neva Patterson and to Margot Kidder. <br /> <br /> It was installed in the western city of 1900. Garner played a sheriff who did not want to use violence to carry out his duties. It was a small town, but it was excellent. Shortly thereafter, Jim Rockford returned Garner to success, but for my money this show was good enough, it was just not the right time, in the right place and had no suitable opportunity. <br /> <br /> The show was so good that most of the people who worked on it also got a job at Rockford.
