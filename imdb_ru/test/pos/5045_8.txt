“Autumn Spring” tells about the misadventures of an amazing, frozen, 78-year-old Czech man who unhappily embarrasses and confuses everyone who knows him with his mischievous manners, while his wife carefully plans her funeral. The central part of Hana (Brodský) shows us how to make the children kiss you when you are 78 and how to handle the feeling in the elevator and thank you for it when he jokes day after day in this warm and radiant look at old age and creative, funny but socially unacceptable ways of enjoying the life of one person, refusing to be sent to a nursing home. Autumn Spring is a cute, subtle comedy with messages for all ages that will have the greatest appeal among more mature foreign movie lovers. (B +)
