I was 13 years old when in 1956 Elvis achieved great success with his first RCA hit. A year later, Buddy Holly joined in to set up a competition for the king. One of Buddy’s main talents, apart from his unique singing style and his ability to write songs, is often understated. Buddy was also an experienced guitar player, developing a unique rockabilly style on his Fender Strat. Gary Busey is trying to capture this aspect of Buddy's personality. There were other modern guitar rockers of the same level as Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins and Eddie Cochran, but Buddy’s talent is often overlooked. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, Busey is the driving force behind the success of "The Buddy Holly Story". The script not only plays with facts from the life of Buddy, but even interrupts some anachronisms in the two years of Buddy’s popularity, mainly 1957-1959. A scene comes to mind where Buddy and Maria watch a 3D movie. Buddy is disappointed with all of this and tells Maria that it will never last long. This is just a fad. In reality, at that time there were no 3D films in circulation. The heyday of 3-D was in the early 1950s. By 1955, the hobby has already disappeared. Another example where a little research would be enough to make this story more believable. <br /> <br /> It is sometimes difficult to separate what really happened from the urban legends surrounding Buddy’s career. The story of how Crickets got its name may or may not be apocryphal, but certainly not the way it was in the film. Another problem with the film is how Buddy's parents are depicted. Of course, Buddy's parents supported his musical career. "Maybe Baby" is attributed to Buddy's mother, and she really participated in writing the song. <br /> <br /> It’s good that the film used the biggest hits of Buddy, but I miss one of my favorites, “I'm looking for someone to love.” I am proud that as a result of this film, Buddy's music was reissued for a new generation to hear. His legacy is one of the best from the early days of rock and roll. Rave, Buddy, nonsense.
