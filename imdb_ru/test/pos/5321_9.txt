I noted that in the official IMDb review, Leland is referred to as a sociopath. I believe that this diagnosis is clearly and fundamentally wrong. <br /> <br /> This is a film about sadness and about the ability of one particular teenager to see sadness in everyday life, as it lies waiting around every corner. , in anticipation of the deployment of lives, which it affects. A sociopath is a person who cannot empathize with others, and who, understanding the difference between right and wrong, does not care about this difference. A sociopath is a subject who places himself in the center of the universe of this subject with complete disregard for the impact that the subject’s actions have on others. One of the defining characteristics of a sociopath is that a true sociopath lacks the ability to feel empathy - lacks the ability to feel what others feel, and does not correlate other people's moods as a result of this sociopath's actions. The psychopath cannot feel the pain of others or understand that the pain of others is the result of the sociopath’s own actions. A sociopath is a person who is not fully formed. The psychological and emotional structure of this sociopath lacks a vital element, which makes it immune to "talking therapy" and other therapies that include human interaction and the study of personal feelings. Sociopathy is destructive, even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment, aimed at containing the harm that a sociopath can cause to others. Many sociopaths function more or less normally and never ignite on the radar of the criminal justice system, although they usually leave behind a trail of emotional rubbish. <br /> <br /> Leland Fitzgerald is not a sociopath. This is a person who is endowed (or damned) with the ability to foresee what he considers the inevitable consequences and consequences of human interaction. Leland literally sees the sadness written in the eyes and faces of people around him when he slowly learns and assimilates the philosophy that life is connected with loss, and that people are slowly amenable to the inevitable and inexorable fact that due to the lack of a better metaphor, things fall apart. People who fall in love and who today kiss and embrace, turn into "miserable" elderly couples. Electricity in the eyes of Leland’s “mother” (a wealthy New York secular who loves Leland and invites him to the house she shares with her family when he comes to New York, alone and resolutely wants to stay in the city at the age of 12 years) disappears when she explains to him during his last visit to New York that she learned that her husband was cheating on her all the time, that she was divorced, that everything happened with a broken heart, and that such a loss is an inevitable part of growing up. Her eyes still reflect the light, but the electricity that once illuminated them has disappeared. This scene - this is the explanation, the last thing that he will come soon - is crucial for understanding why Leland is committing a seemingly wild, senseless crime (killing the backward younger brother of her ex-girlfriend). Leland knows what awaits this little boy - a lifetime of unattainable goals, when he is taught only words that mean danger, never know the love of another person, never feel such love and never connect with another person. This little boy, more than any other character in this film, personifies everything Leland considers inevitable and terrifying in the world. The act of Leland - the murder of this little boy - for Leland an act of mercy, perfect because it was the only thing he CAN do in a world in which actions cannot change the results. While a true sociopath knows that action can and does change results, but does not care about the harm caused by other actions, Leland doesn’t care. What most people consider a barbaric and terrifying act, from Leland's point of view, is the only worthy thing he can do to alleviate the suffering of only one person. <br /> <br /> It would be comforting to present this as an explanation of Leland’s actions - comforting, but not completely. After all, the “fault” of Leland’s actions lies elsewhere. As it often happens, there are no simple explanations and a balm that can be applied to a perturbed soul. Why did Leland not recognize something that even the most pessimistic people usually recognize - that sometimes - just sometimes - people stay in love, and that relationships are really successful, and that even the most sad lives are transformed? For Leland, there is no middle level; there is no inner core to which he can retreat and regroup. There is only pain and sadness. One tempts to blame his arrogant and completely unpleasant father - a brilliant writer (played by Kevin Spacey) - for not having been there at critical times during Leland's development, but given the abomination of this man, that may have been a blessing. br /> <br /> In the end, this viewer was touched by a huge sense of sadness. Why was Leland doomed to look at the world through a veil of pessimism and depression? Leland has a characteristic maturity - for example, the present, when he constantly insists that no one is to blame for the fact that his girlfriend broke up with him - this is simultaneously stoic and heartbreaking. Stoic is that he is absolutely sincere, despite the hot accusations of teacher Leland. But heartbreaking, because it is born not so much from understanding, as from despair. Leland’s indifference to his fate is simply a reflection of the full confidence of his belief that nothing really matters. Nothing that he does can change his fate. <br /> <br /> This is not a demonstrated sociopathy. This, in any case, is its polar opposite ......
