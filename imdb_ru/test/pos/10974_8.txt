No bullets, no secret agents, an interesting, funny and believable story. I met some of the producers / actors of this film in the theater. They seemed as interesting personally as their characters on the screen. You may not hear about this movie on TV with high-dollar commercials, but it's definitely worth checking out. I spent $ 8 on a movie ticket for many other films that weren't so exciting. I look forward to future projects of this production company.
