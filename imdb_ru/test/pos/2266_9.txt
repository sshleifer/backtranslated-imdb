I really liked this film ... but the advertisement I saw implied, and one published review actually said that this film "benefits from a light touch." This is very misleading. <br /> <br /> There is really a lot of humor: eccentric, elusive, sometimes somewhat distorted humor: that type of humor that I usually find very attractive. But most of the humor is the kind that at all times seems conscious, very serious, deeply sensitive and even very painful. The film combines themes of the past and present, perception and truth, memory and activity, life and death. The whole film is filled with the history of European anti-Semitism in general and the Holocaust in particular. <br /> <br /> How can you combine humor and horror in one movie? A review that I saw showed that the humor is absurdist. I do not think so; at least not in common sense. Instead, I think this film stands in the tradition of many Jewish / Yiddish literature and theater. I do not claim to be an expert in this field; but from what I have seen, humor is used in this cultural context as a tool for overcoming the terribly tragic experiences of these people; and also humor is used as a means of “restoring the Divine” for men and women who choose the path of faith, and not the path of despair or absurdity. See the Fiddler on the Roof for Humor used in both ways in this rich tradition. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood (Jonathon) Wood wears horn-rimmed glasses that really make him look. He wore the same glasses with a chilling effect. In this film, it is easy to see how glasses become a metaphor for both his Search and his Fight between Perception and Truth. Eugene Hatz (Young Alex) and Boris Lesking (Old Alex) are really great. Jonathon and Young Alex belong to the same generation, but seem very, very different; and then find that they are not so different. And the way the voice of the obvious narrative gradually changes from the voice of Jonathon to the path of young Alex ... since the journey of the alleged discovery for Jonathon becomes one of the discoveries for young Alex and for old Alex ... very touching for me. <br /> <br /> There are some wonderful scenes and panoramas from (I was told) of Prague and the surrounding area behind the Ukraine storyline. Everything feels very genuine and seems to give a wonderful sense of place; although I have never been to Ukraine and I can hardly confirm it on my own experience. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are looking for a light comedy, I would not recommend this film at all. On the other hand, if you are interested in a wonderful, delightful and deeply moving film, please watch this wonderful film.
