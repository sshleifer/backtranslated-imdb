I think my husband and I are a little slow. We usually do not warm up until the series until they end their production life. In this case, we didn’t start watching KoQs until almost the 6th season. I’m not sure how it escaped our radar for so long. In addition, we are not big fans of the "destination" watching TV. Our graphics are such that we do not like to watch TV shows every time they appear (and we have not had a DVR). So, I suppose that was until TBS began to repeat in its daily queues in the evenings that we began to watch. <br /> <br /> By the time we were hooked, there were still a couple of seasons before the series was canceled. But we still watch it almost daily on TBS. I almost prefer to watch the series this way, because you can watch several episodes day after day, and it helps to build continuity and what happens to the characters without having to wait a whole week. <br /> <br /> But the loneliness episodes are that the stories are not transferred from week to week. But this is normal for me, because you can watch an episode, and then skip weeks - and still go back. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that the letter was not always consistent. Some episodes would be incredibly fun, and some - just ridiculous. So I'm not sure that he had the same qualities as writers like Seinfeld or Raymond. But I loved the casting, and all the characters are quite believable and realistic. Kevin James is just funny to watch! So, even if the plot is not so good, James’s body language and expressions make the show worth seeing. Leah Remini is great in the role of the wife "play right." I think it’s harder to play a straightforward character for a laugh than a comedic character, and she does an excellent job. She knows sarcasm and insults like no other. She's one cool cookie! And who can forget Arthur as Carrie's father, who lives with them in their basement. <br /> <br /> This is a great series, and I was sorry when it was canceled. But thank you very much TBS for keeping the King in repeated starts!
