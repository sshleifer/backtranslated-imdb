Golden Boy is a real sense of humor (bordering on hentai) under the guise of "educational moments." The main character, Kintaro, wanders around, getting into the most stupid situations involving women ... Heâ€™s just shy on the surface, but he analyzes everything until he can learn something. The most striking feature of the series is the circumstances of its formation, which are embarrassing, but at the same time ridiculous.
