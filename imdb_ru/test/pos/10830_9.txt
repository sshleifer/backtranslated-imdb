In Paris, a few months before the Nazi invasion, manipulating actress Vivian Danvers (Isabelle Adjani) uses her former lover Frederick Auger (Grégori Deràngere) to hide the body of the person she killed. Frederick crashes into the car, the dead man is found, and he is sent to prison. When the Germans invade France, Frederick escapes with another prisoner, Raoul (Ivan Attal), and they become friends. On the escape in Bordeaux, they meet on the train Camille (Virginia Ledouan), a young assistant physicist, Professor Kopolsky (Jean-Marc Stele), who is trying to leave France, conducting heavy water research. Once in Bordeaux, the group meets Vivian with his new lover, State Minister Jean-Etienne Beaufort (Gérard Depardieu), and is pursued by German spy, journalist Alex Winkler (Peter Coyote), while Paris is falling and the population is confused. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful and gorgeous romantic adventure "Bon Voyage"! An excellent and complex scenario includes action, melodrama, war, comedy, espionage, drama, and many characters played by a fantastic cast, truly a star constellation; the direction is amazing; the music is beautiful. I really liked this marvelous film, and I have to finish my review due to my restriction of adjectives to describe such a gem. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Viagem do Coração" ("Journey of the Heart")
