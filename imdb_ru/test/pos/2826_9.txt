Ok, where to start. Did you know that some of the leading robots were proposed by the famous pantomime Shields and Arnez? I bet no. But they refused, complaining about the cosmetics of robots. Then they disappeared into obscurity. Now this movie has it all. A crazy killer robot who thinks he's dirty Harry. Lots of cool robots. It's funny, touching, this is the perfect date for those who love science fiction and romantic comedies. This is the first robotic romantic comedy. Of course, very few films are perfect, and there are some problems with the characters. But they are very insignificant and can be overlooked. I think couples will enjoy this movie and will want to watch it again and again. 9 STARS
