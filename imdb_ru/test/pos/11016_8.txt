Since it is already late and I do not have enough vocabulary, I will describe this film as “beautiful and heartbreaking,” asking forgiveness from those who cringe from such stamps. Robin Tanney does an amazing job portraying a young woman in the grip of Tourette syndrome - her character was absolutely sincere and convincing, and I will follow her career wherever she goes for this film.
