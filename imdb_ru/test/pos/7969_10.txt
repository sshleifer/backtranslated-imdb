Hard Justice is a great fighter! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting! For people who say they are not shooting as before. Well, this one is really hardcore! David Bradley is really good, and his character in the film is shelling. He gets hit with a stick more than a dozen times, gets hit with a knife in the back and is in a coma for three days, and then wakes up and fights again, is beaten, recovered and he is ready for new actions! His character is incredibly tuff! Charles Napier was also very good, and he may have stolen the show! Vernen Wells was good! Professor Toru Tanaka played a short and uncredited role in “Difficult Justice”! As for the action, it's really amazing with all the shootings, and in a huge confrontation, as at the beginning of the scene, cars explode and explode in the air! In 95 minutes of running, so much happens. For action fans, you'll be amazed at all the firepower and struggle that this film has to offer! Hard justice is a movie that is not easy to find, and if you are in a video store and see it for sale, buy it, because this film is a big keeper, and plus the box is cool! There is a mass of actions that you need to see to believe! See if you can find good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Z-Shops on Amazon.com and Market Place! I highly recommend to all action movie fans who like to make movies and fighting movies and were disappointed with other movies that look like real non-stop action films, but are not able to achieve this in order to get Hard Justice!
