This year the full-length film CGI has just been released, but, despite the fact that it will provide children with a lot of entertainment, for the stubborn Alvin fans and followers who grew up in the 60s and 80s in cartoons, probably the best animated film based on Alvin and the Chipmunks that ever existed. <br /> <br /> For beginners, the animation is awesome, the character design is what they should be in cartoons - unlike the movie itself, it’s just fun to watch. there are no celebrities, effects generated by CGI, only 2-dimensional pure quality, drawn animation and fantastic colors - bright, bold and beautiful. Jokes and humor are the typical standard of the chipmunk, and the narration is in place. In truth, The Chipmunk Adventure is all that a live-action movie should have been, but it’s not. Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete with Chipetts, Elenor, Janette and Britney in a balloon competition, and along the way the children face all sorts of problems and dilemmas that they must solve in their own way. And not a single film about a chipmunk is complete without a strange performance of classical rock anthems and pop music. <br /> <br /> The Adventure of the Chipmunk is intended for both children and adults, which is another advantage over the CGI movie. The version will receive several new fans, the 1987 film will appeal to both young and old chipmunk fans. Baghdarasyan and Karman provide the heliel-like voices of the film trio. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is a must for fans of cartoons - you will not be disappointed. If you have seen the live version of the action movie, then you will feel that this film is much better than this. If you don’t, then you should go and see it still, or even still forget Jason Lee’s movie and, alternatively, stick with it
