The movie was very good when it came out, I was in high school at Kuli Khai and Kuli, somewhere in 1968 I was also the queen of the house, grew up and lived in Cabrini Greens area, I knew a lot of people in the film, it was nice to see friends in a film that also lived in the area, and they had a chance to become a star that could be an unforgettable experience for them, I had good times when I grew up on the north side and In difficult times I can relate to a film where Coolie High is no longer worth it, but a person like me and others still remembers the fun we They grew up visiting Cooley High, in this northern part a lot of history.
