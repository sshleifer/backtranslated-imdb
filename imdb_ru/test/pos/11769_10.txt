what a wonderful little movie, a lot of good roles from random stars. In fact, there are pot makers who fall into a comic adventure. In some moments the movie makes you believe that everyone will die! What adds to the comedy. When the character of John Lithgow reappears (3rd rock) - it’s impossible not to imagine the journey, this could be a cause, as a total paradox. The film is full of twists and turns that make you guess until the end. Billy Bob Thornton (the astronaut Farmer) is great, in fact, looking back, the character is quite similar in that he holds the potter family together. All participants in this film should get a thumbs up. <br /> <br /> As I said, “the last scene is a dream; However a nightmare at the same time. I like it when Hank Azaria (Carter) speaks at the end, do you think we should do this every year? I felt like they would do that. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to say that this film is useful for everyone, but I, as an amateur stoner, put it on 10/10. - my advice is joint ready; Lean back and enjoy!
