I felt that this film had a lot of heart, and it must have been a labor of love for Eleanor Bergstein. The main actors (Campbell Scott, Jennifer Beals, Yancy Butler, James Goodwin III, Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron) were very well chosen and played their roles with excellence. It was a very encouraging film that I would like to be available on tape or DVD. Rare gemstone.
