I just got back from Santa Fe. NM I visited the Loretto chapel. When I looked around this building, which was acquired by a private owner, I again experienced a movie version of the stairs. This is the irresistible mystic that occupies this building. It is about what can happen if you really have faith. The bookstore has a story on this topic, namely the story of the stairs. I read the story in full. I was absorbed by the atmosphere of the people around them. As if we were completely immersed in a temporary deformation, all with the same thoughts and reverence. When we left, the silence was overwhelming. Everyone should visit the Loretto chapel in Santa Fe. NM
