Similarly, HOW the director John Madden came to negotiate with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz, who plays the role of an Italian officer and a Greek villager in an honorary history: "Mandolin Captain Correlia" just eludes me! Witness: Cage’s wobbly, inconsistent accent against the background of the terrible over-acting with Cruise - more adequately played out like a spoiled Latin American with Johnny Depp in “Strike” - basically a re-introduction under the guise of a Greek nurse ... yes, that was painful. But there were saving graces. <br /> <br /> The story itself is fascinating to the tragic, and Cage has some (- ransom, that!) musical ability. Then the great performance of John Hert (Cruise's father, village doctor) Oscar Kallibre, as well as Irene Pappas, each of whom was the village elder, and Christian Bale (the son of Pappas) among the freedom fighters of the village. go far towards balancing awkward actions (especially at the beginning) of Cruise and Cage. Fortunately, the last two seem to grow into their roles as the movie progresses, but this is gnashing of teeth at an early stage. Finally, the landscape itself and photography could receive a technical reward, and this provides pleasant distractions when it is most needed. <br /> <br /> John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations, and this will be the third; I hope that he will get it as his presentation, as the Doctor makes this film worth seeing. The true test of the supporting actor / actress is whether the film will be the same without the character in question, in which case it certainly will not be ... even close. <br /> <br /> Entertainment value, with the exception of the mentioned positive factors that help raise the bar. Look, if not. Rating = 3.5 stars (out of five).
