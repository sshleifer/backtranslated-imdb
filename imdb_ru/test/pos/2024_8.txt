This film is great with some of the best songs performed by Bon Jovi and a kiss. The film is about a man named Chris (Mark Wahlberg), who is the biggest fan of a group called Steel Dragon. And then, when he gets a concert for leadership Singer, his world changes upside down. Thanks to the great game Jennifer Aniston, this film is an indispensable place for rock lovers! <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
