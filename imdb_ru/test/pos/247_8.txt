This is a very pleasant, fluffy, glamorous musical of the 40s. The Cover Girl turned Rita Hayworth (former dark-haired Latin senorita Margarita Cansino) into a real American star. This confirmed the amazing talent of Gene Kelly as a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. It embodies the abundance and color of the musical genre. <br /> <br /> Rita Hayworth is great in the role of Rusty Parker - this is her picture, and her presence is always at the forefront. Her singing is called, but her dancing is absolutely brilliant, and she combines very well with Kelly. I think Rita was greatly underestimated as an actress - she plays each scene superbly here. Gene put on dance episodes (he was given almost complete creative freedom here), and his dance number “Alter Ego” is amazing. Such artistry. Such melodies as “Break through tomorrow”, “Test me” and, of course, “Long time ago and far away” stand out. The plot is rather thin, but it has a moral. It is about the dangers of quick glory and quick money, and how any happiness with these factors will ultimately be doomed. It will lift your spirits, lift you to your feet and make you laugh. <br /> <br /> However, the “Cover Girl” is not the best musical ever created - there are a number of shortcomings that need to be addressed. We can say that a little Phil Silvers goes a long way. His character quickly becomes tedious. However, I was struck by his dance skills and how he could keep up with Gene and Rita. Another serious problem is that too many songs are just not that good. The Cover Girl looks fantastic, but I'm not a fan of lyrics or singing. “Poor Tom” is a huge loser. I think this is one of the worst numbers I've ever heard in a musical of the 40s and 50s. It stinks. The plot of the grandmother borders on absurdity. But this is just my opinion. Others may like these items. <br /> <br /> However, apart from the flaws, this is a very, very good film, much better than most products released today. Dancing and singing are sublime, production values ​​are excellent, and the mood is infectious. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
