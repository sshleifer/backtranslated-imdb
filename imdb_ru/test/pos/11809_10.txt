*** Contains spoilers *** <br /> <br /> A beautiful film featuring Brad Renfro and the wonderful Joseph Mazzello. I like Joseph Mazsello, of all his films that I have seen so far, I loved each of them for different reasons, and The Cure is no different. Brad Renfro copes well with this film. The Cure is a drama film about coming of age from the perspective of a sick child and his friend. <br /> <br /> Main idea: Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) has AIDS. He ends up making friends with a child next door (Brad Renfro), but Erik's mom is very close, poorly informed and somewhat “fat” when it comes to Dexter's disease. She thinks that AIDS is contagious, like a cold, and does not want her son to go anywhere near Dexter. <br /> <br /> After many attempts to heal without success, the boys go to New Orleans. find a cure after reading the brochure about it. After receiving his blows from Playboy magazine, soon after that, Dexter’s health goes south and, as his health deteriorates, the boy still has enough life for two jokes pretending they stop breathing. Unfortunately, poor Dexter does die from his illness, leaving poor Eric behind to wonder why he could not find a cure. Throughout the film, he is more associated with Dexter’s mother than with his own. <br /> <br /> This is a very touching film that cannot be watched, and it is not quite perfect (films are rarely), but you will not care how you get involved in a film anymore. A must for fans of Joseph Mazzello, one of his best performances in history. It is very well recommended to watch the movie - if you can find a copy :)
