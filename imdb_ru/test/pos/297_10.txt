Brilliant actors and brilliant picture !! I love the chopper scene with music at the beginning, it is SO touching and at the same time real, but at the same time surreal! The Vietnam War was far from human, and I believe that in films of this type, terrible people can act under certain circumstances. Modern war films spend so much money on effects. This is just a smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. The film, which really depicts evil and hatred, mixed in fear and fate. How insane is peace and willpower and friendship, love and passion. A must-see movie and, without a doubt, the best war movie! Many tried to copy, but still there is no film, even close, as good as this one !!
