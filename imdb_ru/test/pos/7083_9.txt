I have loved the One True Thing since I first saw it in the theater and screamed out my eyes. I bought it as soon as it became available, and I lost count of how many times I watched it. <br /> <br /> For me, One True Thing is the best movie about family relationships. I love to watch how family relationships change and turn into what they end up with. I can touch many details in the film. My mother died of bone cancer, so this is very similar to me. Maybe that's why I love him so much. <br /> <br /> I like the relationship between children and their parents, the relationship of brother and sister, but I especially love the relationship between husband and wife. For me it is really beautiful. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this step to anyone who loves this movie.
