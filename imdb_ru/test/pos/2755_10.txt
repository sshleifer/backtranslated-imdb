In my opinion, Flatley spoiled the first show with his ridiculous ego. He disrespected his dance partner, tried to push everyone into the background and was not aware of the spirit of Riverdance. Good thing he left the show. Colin Dunn, the new male leader, is great, and when he and Jean Butler dance together, magic happens! Eileen Ivers's play is amazing (like Noel Eccles' percussion), and Mary Paige's “Dance of Fire” is worth its price! When Pagers and Ivers get together, near the end of the show for a musical duet, well, this is a real treasure. I agree, editing is not free, but no technical flaw can crush this extraordinary power. This is the one to get. There has never been anything like Riverdance! This is real!
