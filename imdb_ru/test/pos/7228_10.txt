Wow, this movie is awesome. This is such a great movie. There are some sick scenes (not as sick as “Terror Firmer” or “Citizen Toxie”), a little nudity, and this was the penis debut in the film! This set the stage for many Tromy films, this is a very tromatic film. It combines comedy, romance and my favorite movie HORROR / GORE! Not much blood in this film, but enough to satisfy. This is Shakespeare's best adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. Much better than any other version. They make it so interesting and fun to watch. And we have Debbie Rochon ... hehe ... I like her. :) All I have to say is a great movie, very funny, and Lemmy is a good host for that. The game is good, and Kaufman runs stylishly, as always. Be sure to look at all TROMA fans!
