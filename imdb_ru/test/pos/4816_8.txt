This eloquent, simple film makes an amazingly clear statement about a teenager and his father. Despite the fact that this is a theatrical release, it has the quality “made for television”. We can attribute this to director John Frankenheimer, who learned his craft in the first days of direct television in New York. In fact, he filmed the TV show, on which the film “Make a Shot” is based, in the dramatic series CBS “Climax”. "Young Stranger" presents his Hollywood debut. After a four-year hiatus, during which he will be doing more television, he returned to directing Young Savages with Burt Lancaster, and a year later, All To Fall, with Warren Beatty and Angela Lansbury. <br /> Casting is competent when James Daily and Kim Hunter (especially well) played the parents of the main character played by James MacArthur (his first theatrical film), who played the same role in the television version, which was his first appearance on a small screen. Look for James Gregory and Whit Bissel as a supporting role.
