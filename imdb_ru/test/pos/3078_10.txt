I love this film! I know that some people may say that it was not a very good movie, but I really disagree. The classic style comedy is Mel Brooks, and the actors were chosen superbly. This was my first encounter with Carey Elvis and Dave Chappell, and what a first impression they made. Carey Elvis shines like Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood, mind you. He has great comedic plots and the right attitude to this type of film. Dave Chappell is obviously a lot more now, but at the time it was his first film and he did an outstanding job as Achoo. All the characters were very well planned and added their little quirks to the movie. I highly recommend you make this movie and enjoy it with a beautiful bowl of popcorn and some close friends!
