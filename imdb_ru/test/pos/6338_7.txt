Apart from the fact that I was a clever and widely sold version of the currently popular horror genre and a great formula for attracting potential new fans in general, I have always considered Supernatural to be a huge worship of the genre for decades. Although this is not always noticeable for young viewers and / or people who are only interested in the latest horror films, each episode contains several obvious and subtle references to classic and influential films. From this point of view, it was only a matter of time when the authors pay tribute to the films “Creepy car without a driver”, and, in particular, to the milestones of the 70s “Duel” (Steven Spielberg’s famous debut) and “The Machine.” two films, I really enjoyed “Route 666,” even with its flaws and flaws. the driver behind the wheel. The daughter of the victims You, Cassie, turn out to be Dean's ex-girlfriend, and she calls the Winchester Brothers for help. Cassie's parents, as well as some of the more prominent residents of the small town. Some of my fellow reviewers here point out Route 666 as one of the weaker entries in the first season, mainly because the script is too preached on racial issues and shows a different and more emotional side of Dean's character. He is usually a strong silent type, whereas here he is faced with unfinished romantic affairs from the past here. To a certain level, I agree with the debate on racism, but that didn’t really bother me, really. The authors ultimately had to explain the presence of the ghost truck, and racial conflict, as I understand it, is acceptable. As for Dean's emotional vulnerability, I can only state that it is great to see how the authors are constantly trying to give depth and detail to the main characters. In fact, Dean's behavior towards Cassie sheds a whole new light on him. In addition to what is really important in this episode, it is a monstrously sinister truck and its vicious attacks. This is an impressive and powerful vehicle that produces dazzling lights and terrible engine noises. If you worshiped the brilliant aforementioned "duel," you will surely find some pleasure in the exciting episodes of the chase depicted in Route 666.
