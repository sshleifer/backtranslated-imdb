Blind spot images are awesome. The action draws you down completely, although the film is a bit long. By the end of the work, all you can think about is the positive moments of the film. The main actors have the most incredible presence on the screen. The story is heartbreaking. The rating of the film is well understated. Fully moving in its own powerful way. Not your standard melodramatic connection. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the exciting story and stunning visual compositions. I hope you will have the opportunity to watch this movie. It goes deep into some dark territory, but you leave the tunnel without seeing anything but white light.
