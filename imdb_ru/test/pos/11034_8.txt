I saw this film alone when I was a teenager in my hometown in India, at a time when the only thing that fascinated me besides the girls were the Tigers. I came home after watching, with a glazed look in my eyes, wanting to be that guy in the film who made friends with the Tigers. What a movie and what a moment it was! The theater in which I saw him does not exist, and he gave way to a shopping center. I don’t know what I would feel about this now, after so many years, and I don’t want to spoil the children's memory by finding this film available on DVD or something like that, and no longer finding it interesting. From previous experience, I learned that memories of childhood are often blurred when someone travels on exhausted roads of life, from time to time trying to rediscover their unstained past with the help of movies, only to discover that its gushing innocence is completely deplorable and is no longer welcome . And I do not want to throw memories of this film into the wind. I have no children, so I probably selfishly leave this film in a sepia-tinted area of ​​my brain, not wanting it on DVD. But if you are at an early age and want to recall memories of a sweet childhood in later years, try to watch this movie (if you ever can). It is really worth it.
