The Oculus is the first of its kind in Turkish cinema, and it is much better than I expected. Those people who say that it is not scary and not funny, make sense, it is not so great. But it should be remembered that all those who participate in the film are rather lovers, so this is basically the first trip. And if you compare this film with other Sinan Cetin films, such as the Propaganda 1st Grade Trash Can, this film is pretty darn good. <br /> <br /> One thing that MUST say: it concerns the lives of high school students Turkey is VERY real! This is exactly what is happening! The scenes that should scare are pretty cheap and Hollywood. Most of them, even if not all. But this scene of a religion lesson made me laugh in tears, and Emre Kinai plays this role as a teacher of religion. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a waste of time, go and see! You will find it quite amusing, especially if you know Turkey enough to relate to the school life of Turkish youth.
