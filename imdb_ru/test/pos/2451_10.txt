I have to agree with the previous authorâ€™s comments on superb action and plot. I started watching this movie by chance ... (on a lazy Sunday afternoon, clicking channels to see if something was good) ... and was hypnotized by Martin Sheen and Emilio Esteves. Blimey! The gut is painful! Glory to everyone (always admired by Martin Sheen), but he was particularly impressed with Emilio! Great job acting and directing ... just great! So why have I never heard of this movie before? I will have to spread the news.
