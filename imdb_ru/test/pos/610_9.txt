Mikio Narus’s consideration of the lives of three inactive, constantly complaining, lonely ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a remarkable character. They used to be friends, but now their relationship is tense, because one of the women has become a successful usurer, and the other two owe her. Although the usurer is the only one who has succeeded in this recovery economy, she is the only one of the three who has no children. The other two have a child on whom they depend in terms of income, because neither of them works. Complications arise when children decide to get married (but not to each other) and leave home. This leads to the fact that the bitter, grumbling old women become even more bitter and grumbling, get drunk and mourn their rotten children and inattentive friend, usurer. Meanwhile, the usurer himself is unhappy, despite his fortunes. She has no one but her young deaf maid who will keep her company, and occasional meetings with two former lovers from her days of a geisha will not lead to anything — all they really want is to lend her money. All three characters are head over heels in the shifting sands of their bored lives and are too tired to try hard, instead usually prefer to put up with the futility of it all or, at the most, throw up complaints to everyone. <br /> <br /> “Late Chrysanthemums” are very slow, and in fact nothing special happens, but Naruse, like all great directors, is able to do very little. I have not seen many of his works, but I suspect that this is not the best, although it is very good. The problem, I think, is that all this does not seem to matter much. But the film is full of good moments. Although it is cynical, but not too much. It seems that Narus sympathizes with his desperate characters, and he draws bright portraits that make the heroes seem even somewhat noble in the misery of their own suffering. Although the film is not mandatory for viewing, it is important as a fragment of the work of the great little-known (outside of his own country) director, a valuable part of which is available on video here in the USA.
