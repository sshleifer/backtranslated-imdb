I recently shot this movie on a Sci-Fi channel. In fact, he turned out to be quite decent in terms of horror / suspense films on the B-List. Two guys (one naive and one loudly speaking **) go on a journey to stop the wedding, but they have no luck when the maniac in a fancy hybrid tank and truck decides to play cat and mouse with them. Things are even more complicated when they lift up the ridiculously stupid hitchhiker. What makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror really works in this film, unlike many others. These two guys are pretty cute, and there are some good chase / wait scenes. Good tempo and comic time make this film more than bearable for a horror / slasher lover. Definitely worth checking out.
