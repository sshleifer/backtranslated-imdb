This is another one of the films about the return of John Travolta, and if he continues with such characters and films as this one, his return will take effect. <br /> <br /> This is so cute ... disgusted if you are not in a romantic comedy. If so, this is one of the innovative RomCom. Each performance (including Skippy's speech) was excellent, and there was nothing in it except a trace of disrespect found in Dogma. (Although, like in the cinema, I loved Dogma!) He is an angel, and if you consider yourself well read, you realize that the angels were far from perfect. Therefore, you will not be offended by this film. This work should not offend even those who are too sensitive to such things, as Nora did her best to make sure that she was as less abrasive as possible, given the subject. <br /> <br /> I love it, and I love it more every time I watch it. It is beautiful and cute, attractive and attractive. <br /> <br /> He estimates 7.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
