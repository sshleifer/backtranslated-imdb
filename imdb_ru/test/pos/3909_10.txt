I thought this movie was pretty good! Well, maybe there were some scenes in it that could make people think about other horror films, but I saw much more pitiful films that got much higher marks than this one! Many films are now converted into a more modern version, and there is nothing wrong with that, it supports the story. I do not think that this film was generally pathetic, and I do not just say this because I am a big fan of Chad Michael Murray, but because I liked it. I was on the edge of my place for most of the film and my friends, and I really liked it, and we talked about it all the way home! I would tell my friends to watch this movie. I'm not saying that this is the best movie that has ever hit the box office, but it is much better than some people describe it. Everyone has their own opinion, so if you really want to know whether this is good or bad, look at it and then decide.
