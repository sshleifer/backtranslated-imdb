I had never heard of Silverwing before, then I saw him at Disney Cartoon and immediately fell in love with him! I also think that it is not only for children, and that people of all ages will enjoy it. He has a great story, great effect and cool characters. I will always love the show, and I heard that it will be released soon on DVD around the world, and I'm going to get it! I have not read any of the books, but I am going to. The show deserves 10 out of 10, and I hope the books are just as good. Well, that's all I have to say. But I still have two lines that I have to fill out, so ... who do you think is the coolest character? My Shade, and my second favorite Marina.
