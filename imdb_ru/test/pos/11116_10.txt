This film has become a landmark replacement for what is good in America. <br /> <br /> Glory is famous for its music and performances. There are several outstanding actors, singers and dancers, including Irene Cara, Paul McCray, Ann Meara * and the excellent Gene Anthony Ray. <br /> <br /> The plot is not a movie. It follows an interesting format ... but it all really ends in some kind of mess. <br /> <br /> Parker succeeds in pushing this film to periodic overload - with an extremely sharp, sometimes beautiful and frank campaign of musical accompaniment and performances. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is the Christopher Gore festival of dance songs by musicians, dancers and scores. Miracle to contemplate. <br /> <br /> * An interesting note about the gorgeous and superbly talented Anna Meara ... sometimes the talent must be in the genes ... Miss Meara is married to Jerry Stiller and is the mother of Ben Stiller. ..
