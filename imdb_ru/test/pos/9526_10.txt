I think that together all reviewers really captured this film. I have seen it many, many times, but I still feel joy and warmth just like the first time. My emotional response to this film never disappears. The final scene certainly brings me to tears, like the scene between Perks and the children on his birthday. And as for the Good Gentleman. Something else is going on with this character. Generous provider and problem solver. He knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere. The perfect father to run and make us feel safe. I donâ€™t know how the film does it, but it touches something very English deep inside that has long disappeared from our everyday experience, but we all know and thirst again.
