I heard about this documentary for so long that I knew that I needed time to watch it. As a documentary, this is very well done, in which he takes a neutral observant view of their experience. There is no voice over or interview. This is honest. This is true. It is also humiliating. Two comments really stayed with me after the film was made. One of them was how the boys are told not to look like American boys who wear baggy pants, and like there is time in Africa, but no money, but in America there is money, but no time. The greatest influence was made by how the boys were eager to get an education, and how one of the boys moved so that he could go to school. I watched this high school sophomore film, which said it upset him when I saw the boys return to their new life without any real orientation towards America. He also said that he knows so many American teenagers who simply cannot appreciate how their lives are in America. I would agree with him in both cases. A strong film that will make a person think about a lot.
