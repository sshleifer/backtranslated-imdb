I have not seen this film for several years. He appeared on the Disney Channel in the early morning hours. I did not sleep to watch it, and found it even more interesting than the first time. The story, the scenery, and the characters are as good as they come. I know that if someone finds the time to watch this movie, he will definitely find it a second time. It is very memorable in many ways than one. I recommend this film to everyone, because it is interesting and informative for all interested parties. <br /> <br /> s
