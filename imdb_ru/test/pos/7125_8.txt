There are some films that made me wait and wait for the release more than this. This is the last film of the group “Dead Gentlemen”, responsible for the original film “Gamers” and “Demon Hunters”. This group has not been very active in the past few years, but this film is a definite reason for trying to keep up with their development. <br /> <br /> This film is about a group of players who are trying to end a campaign conducted by a grandmaster, frustrated by his group’s disregard for his story. With the help of new blood, they are again trying to campaign in the hope of ending this time. <br /> <br /> This film is a breath of fresh air in the cinematic community and a significant improvement over the original. The film shows respect for the game in the same way as in the original film, but beyond that, this film shows a dramatic improvement in special effects, launching it over the simplicity of student films. The acting is pretty decent, and the jokes are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, many jokes are jokes, so if you are not a gamer, the film may not seem so funny to you as others. That's why I give film 8 instead of 9, which I originally thought. In any case, if you are a gamer or know about games, check this one, you will like it.
