First of all, at about the time when I wrote this comment, I already read that kittiwake-1 wrote about this game, and was puzzled. This is a video game, not a real movie. I mean, I would have chosen a good film about Dénir or played video games any day. But, man, what are you talking about? Now that I have this out of the way, let's move on, right? Adaptation of the video game "Crouching Tiger" and "Hidden Dragon", as you may have guessed, is based on the movie of the same name. What is strange is that it was released three years after the release of the film. No one knows whether it is because of the slow development time or simply because of laziness. At least I do not know. <br /> <br /> The game allows the player to play for the four main characters of the film: Jen, Shu Lien, Li-Mu-Bi and Dark Cloud (whose story is a secret bonus that is unlocked for a separate game process.) All four of these characters have fighting styles based on how they fought in the film. However, the real candy is evasion, which allows each character to avoid the attacks of an enemy attack in the most impossible and gravity-defying ways that were first shown in the film. <br /> <br /> The story is obviously based on the story told in the film. The story in the game is told with the use of films in the CG genre and it is spoken in Mandarin with subtitles (a nice little touch, considering that I preferred the film’s foreign language composition, rather than a duplicate). to other characters during the film, and even (not surprisingly, since almost all adaptive video games have done this) change what officially happened in the film to make the game more active. I never thought that Jade Fox would go so far as to get hired thugs. <br /> <br /> The real bonus to the story is the ability to decide how the game will end. What if Jen had all the ingredients to cure Lee-Mu-Bi? What if Jen didn't return her comb? What if Lee-Mu-Bi did not return the green fate a second time? Your actions will determine the outcome of these scenarios and the fate of the characters in this game. This is really the best feature of the game. <br /> <br /> However, despite all its strengths, it also demonstrates some of the flaws. Enemies often become a nuisance after a while, and the angle of the camera is usually fixed in the most useless places. Even the special functions (which are unlocked after passing the game) are not good enough to forgive even such difficulties that are imposed on the player. <br /> <br /> If you like the movie, you can enjoy the game. However, this game is the only way you can immerse yourself in the playable version of such a beautiful and amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, you could just choose the film Deniro instead,
