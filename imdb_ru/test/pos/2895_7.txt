A long-awaited live release, Rush-in-Rio DVD is not only convincing, but also disappointing. This sleek set with two discs shows Rush in all its glory. After 30 years of honing their unique sound, it's great to have this album one of the most talented rock bands in history. <br /> <br /> The concert features over two dozen songs, a documentary and three songs that feature Angular Viewing. Packed in a two-layer holder with a sleeve and a small insert, it is very well appreciated by the amount of material contained in it. <br /> <br /> I’m a fan of Rush from the late seventies and early eighties, and this DVD comes out big, with half the show, covering the songs of that era. I will not list the songs if you want to be surprised. If you have been on the Vapor Trails tour, then you will know what they will play. <br /> <br /> Playing Rio for its largest audience in history, Rush is a huge audience that likes it. In fact, it was one of the first features I noticed on this show. For most of this two-hour concert, you hear and see a crowd that is actively singing and dancing wildly to music. First, it is encouraging to see that fans give Rush a well-deserved answer. But after a few songs I was ready to hear and see more of the group and less crowd. This is by no means a blow to the crowd of Rio. More power to them! This is a critique of the final DVD editing. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the second and main reason: "I hate it." Video editing is terrible in my opinion. With the exception of bonuses with several angles, the whole performance is the madness of visual chaos. As if the director wanted to see how spastic he could do it. I believe that the change in camera viewing angle averages from one to four seconds all the time! After three or four songs, my head and eyes were ready for a break. Which is very bad, because I would like to sit through the whole concert, as I could at the concert last year. Maybe this quick editing is the latest hobby for live DVDs, but I really think that this is an annoyance and a distraction from the general experience. As mentioned earlier, I don’t mind this song or two, but the whole visual aspect of this disc is in a hurry, or RUSHed. This is really ironic, because all the previous live clips I saw in Rush, mostly from Moving Pictures, were strictly filmed with a slight switching back and forth. It's almost boring, visually speaking. This DVD took him to the other extreme. I know that many Rush fans dyed in wool will strongly disagree with my statements, but this is just my impression of it. <br /> <br /> Essence: if you are a fan of Rush, you Buy this DVD, regardless of my review or any other. I would still buy it after I read my review. Just do not expect a "normal" concert. Who knows, the things mentioned above may not bother you.
