This film is about Xavier, an Erasmus exchange student from Paris who spends one year in Barcelona. During this time, under the influence of all new impressions, it is changing and growing. Upon his return, he has a much clearer picture of his life and, finally, takes him into his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most touching films I've ever seen, and the reason is probably because I was in a very similar situation. I'm from Germany, not from France, and for me it was Madrid, not Barcelona, ​​but I can assure you that this film is a completely accurate description of what the Erasmus semester in Spain will do with you. From what I have heard, this story is autobiographical, and it is probably why it is so realistic. <br /> <br /> Let me give you a few examples (a slight warning from SPOILER) - Xavier shares an apartment with other students from Italy, Denmark, and Germany. , Belgium, Spain and England. The apartment looks EXACTLY like all the apartments of Erasmus that I saw in Madrid. The main characters are well developed, and some funny scenes arise from the usual stereotypes. Spanish homeowner is also 100% accurate. - The story of Xavier and his girlfriend Martina, who stayed in Paris, is also very typical. About 90% of all relationships break during the semester of Erasmus (or shortly thereafter). - There is a wonderful scene in which Xavier is trying to convince Wendy, his flatmate from England, who, as it were, is “not cool”, to go with everyone else. He finally succeeds, and Wendy probably had a night in her life. <br /> <br /> Another great thing about this movie is that it’s really trilingual: the students in the apartment speak Spanish or English, and Xavier speaks French with her mom and girlfriend. There are subtitles so that everyone can understand what is being said. I certainly hope this movie will never be duplicated. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that for people who do not belong to Erasmus, this is just an entertaining comedy, but for all my fellow Erasmus I can only say: this is YOUR film! If you have not seen this, do it. But be prepared for some sensations of nostalgia ... <br /> <br /> 10/10
