Mel Brooks is a great writer, director and actor, but from time to time he may even have a clinker. The beginning of all this begins with almost meeting one character after another. You have Cary Elvis, who is charming and talented, but does not know how to act in a comedy. His expressions to the camera show that even he cannot believe in the senselessness of the script. Richard Lewis looks bored and scattered, and Amy Yasbek is stuck in acting mode in high school. Dave Chapelle shows great comedy performances, robbing and humming for the camera, and Mark Blankfield is mostly strangled as a blind man, but then he still manages to show a great comedy range. Eric Allen Kramer has nothing to do, but a few scenes that he has are mandatory. The best roles are those of Roger Rhys, Tracy Ullman, Megan Cavanaugh and Brooks when he appears. Dom DeLuise has a funny move, like a mob don using Clint Eastwood's twin, but on the negative side, some jokes aren't very funny, while some of the really funny ones seem stolen from other Mel films.
