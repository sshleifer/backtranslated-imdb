I like this movie! Yes, it's pretty cheap, and I'm sure a lot of reviews will scoff at this. But, my God, how much they invest in cash. I was reminded of Sam Raimiâ€™s early work. Yes, it is rough, but it has good energy and a lot of pleasure. Acting ranges from very good at Scott Ironside and Shaun Paul Hassere to not very good in some of the less significant roles. Is this a cult movie? Well, it grew on me. The first time I liked it, but by the 3rd viewing I liked it. The film is probably 7 out of 10, but I give it 8 for a clean cheek. Anyone who can do it for 8 thousand is worth a look. Almost makes me want to visit Scotland!
