This film was well made, but sometimes I felt very bad. For anyone considering show business, this needs to be seen, as it shows a rough deal in what is going on for these struggling employees. The soundtrack was definitely awesome, and acting and dancing perfectly complemented it. Some of the student’s views may have been a bit flimsy, like that of Leroy, especially because I’m sure that someone like this would be immediately kicked out for not reading, for example, if it were a real High School of Performing Arts. Coco's screen test is difficult to observe for people with a weak stomach, please listen to my warning. While it is very tough, I know that it is true about what is happening, therefore, in this respect, the movie is excellent. In general, this is interesting, and although some parts are pulling the majority, they pass very quickly. <br /> <br /> Final grouping: <br /> <br /> Films: perhaps this film would have been missed. <br /> <br /> DVD buying: not something that I would need to see again and again. <br /> <br /> Rental: should be rented at least once in a lifetime!
