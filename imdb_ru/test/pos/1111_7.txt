John and his wife Emily, accompanied by their child Edward, depart from the comfortable suburbs of the suburbs to the village, where the husband spent part of his childhood. There was a death in the family, and John must start a trial to take control of an old, decrepit cottage, located on the seashore and once inhabited by an old man, who apparently committed suicide. <br /> <br /> Skeptical of Under circumstances of death, John separates himself from his family and from reality, endangers his own life and puts on the clothes of an old man who is now dead. <br /> <br /> The film is now changing - nothing is what it seems - the people of his past appear in full gothic / village glory - his wife is worried about his mental state - and his son disappears into the reeds. <br /> <br /> John finds that the old man is not suicide, that his death is much more mysterious and strange. In the finale of horror about the spine, we learn that the events of the film never really happened and that the whole plot was invented by the little boy Edward, who is struggling to reconcile with his parents' divorce proceedings. <br /> Modern Love is an eerie work of fine art, a mysterious and perverted kind of pretentiousness, full of vague suggestions and unexplored red herrings. He has no sense of humor and, apparently, has no relation to the current trends of indie, which not only confirms its creators, but also makes it passive. <br /> <br /> But the weaknesses of this Australian film are completely outweighed by its pure muscular cinematic vision, its bloody minded and uncompromising accuracy and its crank euro euro. The meanness of the rules of the script and the lack of a smooth dialogue fade against the background of noir and the leading role that needs to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> One of the most aggressively strange Australian films in recent years.
