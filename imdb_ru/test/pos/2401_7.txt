I watched the movie with tears and smiles alternately. Anger flashed in me to see the ruins of Hanoi after the 12-day bombardment. And, living now in a village with my parents who have lived in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that now we are much better, and it would be better if the American did not bring war here. While watching the film, I learned more about the different types of wars that America was planning in Vietnam, and what disasters they caused. <br /> <br /> The series seems to go well with interviews with real people. But I do not like that some people express only general opinions, for example, an analyst near the end of the series, I forgot his name. <br /> <br /> There should also be more documentary images, such as life in the army camp of South Vietnam and northern Vietnam (if possible). There was also a sudden transition from 1972 to 1975 (Iâ€™m not sure that the intermediate point was censored because I watched this series on TV).
