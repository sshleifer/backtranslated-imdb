Frank Sinatra has done so many wonderful things in the world of entertainment that it is difficult to single out his best. If I had to say the best he ever did, it would be his performance as Frankie Machines, a heroin and poker dealer addicted to heroin, who was hardly saved by the love of a good woman (played exclusively by Babi Kim Novak). The scenes of "cold turkey" between Sinatra and Novak are terrible and heartbreaking. In fact, the film is almost perfect, from the title graphics of Sol Bass to the stunning jazz soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein. This may not be something that anyone thinks about in the 1950s, but, nevertheless, it must be seen.
