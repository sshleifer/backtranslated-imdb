I just watched it a second time today, and I must say with all my heart that they damn long ago made a film about us as people who are not spiritual beings. Such a waste of human life, like this story, maybe out of it. And Eric is hotter than ever. Often in films, people of the first nations are not viewed as ordinary people. We are always depicted as leaders or people of medicine. Hey, we are the same. And this film showed just that. It hurts us when injustice is committed, and we can win in the search for justice. Too bad the big film companies can't see it. I can't wait until it is released on DVD. Thanks to those who decided to show this story as it really was.
