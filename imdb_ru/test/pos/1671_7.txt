As far as I know, in this film noir there were two completely different things, unlike the film noir, which I used to watch: 1 - the situation in Paris, France; 2 - there is a 28-minute scene without dialogue. <br /> <br /> Both make this film a bit unique, at least for English-speaking noir fans. In fact, the American, Jules Düssen, was shooting a film, so this is not a very European film. Initially, I was disappointed with this after I watched the first 40 minutes. This is an expensive DVD and I was bored. However, as soon as this silent segment began - an actual robbery (you already know what it is about), the film came to life significantly and became better and better. In fact, I thought the best part of the Story was what happened after the robbery. The best aspect of the whole film was cinematography. This is what makes the disc worthy of ownership. This is a great noir-style photo and a real trip for those of us who have never seen Paris ... and this is Paris of the mid-1950s. There are many dark, but interesting rain-drenched Parisian streets and buildings that I find fascinating. In fact, in the much better-known film The Third Man there were much more such wonderful shots than in London. <br /> <br /> The main actor, Jean Servé, I think his name is also interesting to see. Someone described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton, and that sums it up perfectly. A warning for those who do not expect profanity or nudity in a classic film. This is France, not the United States, so there’s both here and there. I also appreciate the DVD offering a choice of subtitles or a dubbed version.
