I saw Anatomy many years ago — duplicated in the house of friends, I remember little, and then I saw the second in the video store — not very much like the first, Franca Ponte makes a small cameo. And this one was not as good as the first. Tonight, I will again see the first, not named collection edition. I really like German films like this one, it's very interesting, and people and cults like the one in the film may exist, I think, I don't know. But it is very fun and scary. Anatomy 2 is slightly different, and the characters are not as good as the first. But if you really think that anatomy is interesting and good, you should see a second one.
