This little click resembles several other films, but he manages to keep his own style and mood. “Troll” and “Do not be afraid of the dark” come to mind. The builders of uncertainty were good, and just crossed the line from G to PG. I especially liked the choice of no cliché with my parents; in other films I could have predicted the dialogues literally, but in this film the choice was better. If you want a movie that is not rude, but gives you a bit of cold, this is an excellent choice.
