I heard about this case, but I really didn’t pay attention to all the hype when Furman was writing a book, arresting Skakel, etc. However, this film did an excellent job with the detailing of Marta, Skakeli brothers, murder Mark Furman’s participation and the results of his investigation. I especially liked the scenes of memories when Martha spoke about her last summer. The actress who played her literally began to shine with life and even more focused on the fact that the real Martha was probably like that. Martha seemed a real man, not a victim. I definitely recommend watching this.
