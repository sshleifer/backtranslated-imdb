I have to say that one of the main reasons why I thought AristoCats is so good is that I love cats !!!! I love cats, who probably gave me this film a big rating, but not only that, it was definitely a good movie well, and I like where they make the film. This is one of my favorite animal films, although it is animated and I really like that the actors / actresses do not sound so unprofessional as the voice of animals. This film seems to me to be a classic, but I think that this is not so for IMDb, because it has, yes, I think, too low a rating. You’re looking at all the other Disney’s “ORIGINAL” films, and they have a much higher rating than this, but nevertheless AristoCats is one of the best animated films and I could enjoy it all over again !!
