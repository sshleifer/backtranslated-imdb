The film is based on a book by Jules Verne, which I read once, ten years ago. I remember that I really liked the book, and this film tells the story very well. However, the most important thing in this film is not the story, but the very original visual appearance that it has. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are absolutely beautiful, and they are obviously achieved through a clever combination of animated drawings. in conjunction with live actors, motion stop animations and scenery, painted to look like an animated film. In combination with Jules Verne’s own unique versions of airplanes and submarines and Karel Zeman’s good directorial results, a very well-made and convincing visual style is obtained that allows you to effectively keep your attention until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> as well as with some problems, for example, one of the underwater scenes at the end takes, perhaps, too much time, since the plot in the first part of the film passes rather quickly. None of this matters much, as the film is always very pleasant. A gem that deserves to be better known to the modern audience. Recommended movie for the whole family.
