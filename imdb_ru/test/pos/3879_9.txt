He made one for Christmas to try and get the number one song back, and now the awesome Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the cast and maybe some film crew of his favorite TV show as a child, A-Team. The only participant he could not get was the late great George Peppard, who played the main character, Colonel John "Hannibal" Smith, but he did get some kind of psychic to try to help. He managed to reunite all participants, including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton "Faceman" Peck # 2), who went to "Big Brother of Celebrities" in 2007, Dwight Schulz (captain HM "Howling Mad" Murdoch), Melinda Kulea (Amy Amanda Allen ) William Lacking (Col. Lynch) and Lance Lego (Col. Roderick Decker, the only dead member of the team). He spoke with Mr. T (Sergeant Bosco "B.A." Barakus) in one of the expected interviews, but could not attend the meeting. It was really fun to watch him try to find them and talk to them, although they probably donâ€™t want to, and reunion, of course, is a big climax. Fine!
