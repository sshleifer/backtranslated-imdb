After all these years, I am puzzled as to why Julie Brown (West Coast) is not a household name or a very famous comedy star. She is one of the funniest women on the planet. In this parody she takes Madonna, which is one of her favorite goals. She is Medusa, a very successful singer, like Madonna, who also had the documentary “Truth or Dare”. Julie Brown forges Madonna as Medusa, who came from Wisconsin, a country of dairy products and beer. I remember the part where she went to Wisconsin to visit her family and the grave. I do not remember whether it was a parent or her pet. I remember someone saying that Medusa did nothing original. She just copied others. I have to say that I hope that this documentary film on fake is available anywhere on DVD. Julie Brown at her best ridiculed and deceived others.
