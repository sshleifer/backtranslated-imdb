It has always been my favorite movie. I had a copy of VHS, and a couple of months ago I found a DVD release, which is also part of my video collection. I am also a big fan of baseball, and as part of my off-season reading, I picked up a copy of Robert Whiting's excellent book, “You Have a WA,” which talks about the pros and cons of Japanese baseball, and the problems that foreign players have met while playing in Japan. When I started reading yesterday, it made me think about this film, because it seems that the script was based almost literally on this book. The parallels are strange. Jack Elliot's character is very similar to Bob Horner, an MLB aging slug whose best days were behind him. Horner's teammate Leon Lee is also portrayed as Max's character “Hammer” Dubois, a Japanese league veteran who has come to terms with the frustrations of the Japanese game and helping to keep his teammate in his right mind. The character Elliot is experiencing the same sequence of encounters as Horner, starting with the signing of great fanfare, early success that feeds both the crazy sports media, and the subsequent recession that causes disappointment, alienation from teammates, fans and the media, and the resulting disappointment , which causes the desire to return home in the United States. The only difference is that the film adds such Hollywood touches as love interest and happy ending. <br /> <br /> Speaking of love interests, I am sure that many viewers came to this site (like me) to find an actress who played Hiroko (beautiful Aya Takanashi), and what other work she did. It only lists this film. Based on an article I read, it turns out that the short love scene with Tom Selleck (a foreigner) in this film (soft by our standards - they mostly kiss when he is in the bathroom and she wears a towel) caused such an insult to Japanese the public (in particular, men) by the fact that she had never been offered any other role in the cinema or on television — in fact, blackmailed by the Japanese film industry. This is a real shame, as she (was) quite a talented actress in this film. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie as much as I do, on the elements of baseball and cultural differences, find a copy of You Gotta Have WA by Robert Whiting. Good reading and a great companion to this film.
