I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I've always been fascinated by Mrs. Hayworth's appearance, so I decided to try. <br /> <br /> This may be the best showcase for Talented Miss Hayworth. She never looked more charming in the film (except, perhaps, "Gilda", where she is the main symbol of sex). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers are more than expert in helping Rita. Comedy can be outdated, but still quite funny. Kelly performs one of his dance performances, dancing with a picture of himself from the window. <br /> <br /> But Rita is leading this whole movie. Excellent cast with the participation of Otto Kruger and always wonderful, wise and intelligent Eva Arden does not hurt. <br /> <br /> Rita sings, Rita dances, and she looks incredibly beautiful all the time! The music may not be classical, but the lyrics of most tunes are pretty clever. <br /> <br /> I believe that this film works better than Gilda, which I consider to be an erroneous film. To its credit, Mrs. Hayworth, she also drives a "Gilda", and Gilda drives every red man crazy. <br /> <br /> The film feels good after all these years. A lot of candy for a male audience - a nice bonus!
