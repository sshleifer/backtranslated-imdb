I saw this week when it opened four years ago, and I really did not know what to expect, being unfamiliar with the work of Sorrentino at the time. He created a very intriguing and, ultimately, touching story about a strange character to whom the phrase “life for life” is no longer applicable. It outwitted me at every step, and I was constantly amazed at this story. I really liked the stimulation and how I was gradually given pieces to understand what was going on. Tony Servillo is great, like Magnani. It opens with a brilliantly stylish wide frame and ends with a very moving image that takes the film to the sublime territory. After that, I thought for a long time about the main character, his position and his fate, and I did not shake him for weeks. I recently bought a movie, and this last scene, where he thinks about his friend, brings me to my senses every time. I have yet to speak with everyone who has seen it. It's a shame that it did not reach a wider audience, as if this was a direction of Italian cinema, it can only be good.
