It seemed to me that it was a dim film that produces a low-budget film with bad cinematography and not so much work on editing. This may be interesting to those who know something about submarines in the era of the Second World War, but I recommend everyone to beware. Many of the scenes in this film were flat, and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story that men return to the service during a short vacation seems realistic enough, but there is no real rhythm or tension in this story. It was also hard for me to understand what the actors are saying, in part because of strong English accents and, perhaps, because of the poor performance of sound recording. I give it 55/100. Most people will want to "stay away."
