I do not understand why all people give this film negative reviews?!?! I like this movie! Bled is a form of abstract art, and if you don’t appreciate art, I understand why you didn’t like this movie. It was a great twist on the average vampire movie. If you are looking for a fresh, new and original vampire film, then this is for you. But if you want one of them to turn into bats, wolves, and melt in films about sunshine, then go and watch your old played Dracula movies. Of course, this is a bit on the budget side, but they did an excellent job with the budget that they had. I am very glad that I found this film, because I was going to throw the vampire genre for good. I thought this movie was brilliant! I give 2 thumbs to the writer, director and everyone involved in the film.
