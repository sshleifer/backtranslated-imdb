There is no doubt about this. This is an animated video that put Uncle Walt at stake. When Walt's older brother, Roy suggested that there should be a sound in the next Mickey Mouse short film, Walt jumped at the opportunity. Result: The Steamboat Willie was a rampant 1928 hit. In the end, it was the first animated short story with a synchronized sound track (mostly music and sound effects, since the dialogues were minimal). It does not look like a wet blanket, but the shorts are far from perfect. Until 1935, the animation was creaky and rather shaky (but as soon as the equipment improved and more advanced artistic techniques appeared, the rest became smoother), and the sound was primitive (Disney wanted to use the well-known RCA Sound System, or the Western Electric Noiseless sound system, but both firms refused, forcing Disney to use the Photophone system, which PA Powers was experimenting with at the time). The plot (is there an actual plot line here?) Concerns that Mickey (like the aforementioned Willy) is the pilot of the steamer, terrorized by Black Pete (captain Pete for you), and decides to arrange a jam session on the ship using various animals on board as musical tools (ASPCA, note). If you donâ€™t think too much about technical flaws, Steamboat Willie can be eight minutes of fun (and part of the story).
