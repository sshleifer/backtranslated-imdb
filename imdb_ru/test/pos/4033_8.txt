So this film may not have won an Oscar, but this is not a bad film. Original "D.A.A." This is undoubtedly the best film, but this does not mean that this film is bad. <br /> <br /> Movie stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he first became truly famous, after “The Right Material” made him a star and very cute looking Meg Ryan, when she was still pretty now known. <br /> <br /> This is more a “renewal” of the 1950 film than a remake, after the production is different, and the characters are different too. The plot is almost the same. The man (this time an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin) is poisoned, and he has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young college student trying to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays Quaid's estranged wife in a low-key but intense performance; she steals every scene she plays in. Daniel Stern (also in an early role, before Home Alone made him famous) plays Quaid's colleague. Charlotte Rampling is also good in the supporting role. <br /> <br /> All the cast is top notch; The film is stylish, with a fast pace that makes you guess until the end. <br /> <br /> I think this is a film that is definitely worth seeing as a thriller, as well as a modern version of a classic film.
