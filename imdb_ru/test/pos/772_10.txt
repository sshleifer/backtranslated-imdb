Great movie. The one that made me think of God, but not feel guilty or depressed. He forced me to think about death, but not to be afraid of it, to think about life, but not to hide from it. A film that gave love to everything I stand for, and at the same time condemned him to the deepest pits of hell. The film that made me think about love and everything that I lost, but no sadness brightened my eyes, for some strange reason, with relief. A child of two worlds, God and theater. And good wine and irony! I highly recommend the ***** <br /> <br /> “When The S *** hits a fan, take a tent” Oh, and we should all go camping. Everyday.
