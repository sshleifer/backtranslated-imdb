My first "Colombo". Rather like it. Great format, and Peter Falk's character is extremely good ... surprisingly strange, he can take his place next to Poirot, Miss Marple, as well as those like Marlow and Rick Diamond. I can understand why this series has it. <br /> <br /> As a professional musician, I have to say something. Firstly, a conductor who simply creates these pedestrian performances from the simplest examples of the repertoire (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Strauss Waltzes, Beethoven ...) will never have such a home or such fame or such cars all the more can be called genius. And the behavior that makes the actor so bad as to be laughable. No orchestra will take it seriously. <br /> <br /> There are also a few little things, such as his rehearsal for Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (why rehearse when they just did it for television? Any orchestral musician can play it on his or hers anyway ...) . His instructions to the ensemble are completely meaningless, and when Colombo asks Blythe Dunner what “quasi-fantasy” means, she says that it is “Latin.” This is Italian, like the vast majority of musical instructions. <br /> <br /> And finally, there are no two great musicians who would ever have the following exchange: "Play something." "What should I play?" "Chopin." Music is their work and passion, they know it well. Something more specific will be offered and suggested! <br /> <br /> I know. I have to leave more ...
