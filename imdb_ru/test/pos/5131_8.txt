Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for the children. A bit predictable. The book was better, gave more plot details, talked about the environment and how the children had uncovered the plot. I think that Khiassenâ€™s distorted humor is better in the book than in the film, but there were also many funny moments in the film. This is probably a slower pace for children under 6 years old. I really liked the cast of Jimmy Buffett. And these little owls were charming. I wonder how they managed to remove them? The film showed a lot of Florida at its best, made her look very attractive. Do I imagine this, or did author Karl Hiassen make a brief appearance?
