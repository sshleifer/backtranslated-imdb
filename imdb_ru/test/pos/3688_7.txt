I'm a big fan of Rupert Everett. I love Katie Bates, so when I saw her, I decided to check it out. The synopsis actually said little to you. In some parts it was stupid, touching, and in others some parts were hysterical. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is a big fan of any type of person will find some small distinctive features with the main character. (Of course, there are many that they will not, but this is the essence). <br /> <br /> If you like that one of the actors is looking at him, but do not look for anything dramatic, this is fun. <br /> <br /> I can also mention that you see how damn high Rupert is. I mean, I knew he was 6'4 ", but he seems to be even more in this film. He even seemed to lean a little because of the height of the other characters in it. He's tall! I mean high !!!! And for you, Rupert fans have a naked scene of a chest ... Wonderful!
