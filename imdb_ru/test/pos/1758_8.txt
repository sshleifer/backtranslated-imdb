"Mr. Bug goes to the city" was one of those films that I heard about, but until now it was impossible to get it. I just watched this movie on DVD and thought it was a delightful and charming movie with great animation, good plot and great songs. If this film were made by Disney, then the film would be considered a classic, however, since it was made by a little-known film studio that had long gone, the film had slipped through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The film was made by Max Fleisher Studios in their studios in Miami, Florida and was released via Paramount Pictures. The premiere of the film was to be held on December 7, 1941, on the day of the Pearl Harbor explosion. Although it probably hurt the release of the film, the film played in some cinemas throughout the year, as some studies show. The film was named the family favorite of most major American newspapers. The film continued to re-publish approximately every year, usually on holidays, such as Easter, at least in major cities. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1950s, this film was re-released under the new title "Hoppity Gos to Town", named after the main character of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is a real historical play, which captured a piece of Americana, as it was in the late 30s and 1940s. The animation is great, and many of the characters are very nice. tracked by animators, giving the movement a very real look. <br /> <br /> Fleishcher Studios was one of several animated studios they make cartoons back in the 30s and 40s, while some of the Fleischer characters, like the Betty Boop, Popeye and Superman cartoons, are better known, the studio’s work is more or less forgotten. <br /> <br /> Nearly all of Fleischer’s work is freely available, all Superman cartoons are in the public domain, all but one of the Color Classics series are public domain, and Gulliver’s Travels is also in the public domain. This film was never released in the US on VHS or DVD, but was released in Europe. However, some, looking around the Internet, can give you a copy very quickly. I recommend the search.
