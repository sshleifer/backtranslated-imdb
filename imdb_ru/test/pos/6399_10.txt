The biggest problem faced by the Key West television program was that it was advertised incorrectly. If you saw the ads, you would think that it was not easy, and would be very disappointed. It was a much more complicated show than that. <br /> <br /> I ended up in Key West shortly before Hurricane Andrew collapsed, and I think I actually drank a couple of them with some of the actors in Rum Runners. Of course it was before the show. I actually saw the sailboat that was in the opening pass several times and chatted with the guy who, as you see, also cracked coconuts in the opening. He was a real local. Yes, I would like to see it on DVD.
