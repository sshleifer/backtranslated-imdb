Recently, I was lucky to see the “Running Kite” in a small theater, surrounded by experienced moviegoers who knew how to enjoy the masterpiece of such refinement. Despite all the controversy surrounding the central scene of this film, I expected it to be a rough and cruel thing. But the way Mr. Forster handled the delicate subject was touching and truly touching. Despite the fact that the films indicated that China was the main filming location, I could swear that I had seen Kabul in all the scenes that were to take place in Afghanistan. The acting, both by non-professionals and professional actors, is excellent, and the actors are great. Thus, this is a film I would like to see again and again, because, although it is undoubtedly sad in its subject, the masterful way in which it was done awakens a completely new hope in modern cinema.
