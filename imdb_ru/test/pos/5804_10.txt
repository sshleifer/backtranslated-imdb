Madonna has been rocking the boat for more than 20 years, and with that comes a lot of experience - obviously - and a lot of knowledge. She never thought about yesterday, on the contrary, she seemed to know that she would be popular tomorrow. She boldly takes all the new trends, technologies and incorporates them into her actions. Her world tours have never been "average". When Madonna speaks, she gives 120% - more, better, theatrically and meaningfully. It draws inspiration from the East, the West and makes them unique. Everything has a deeper meaning, and The Confessions Tour is no different. From the very beginning you are sitting on the edge of the chair. She starts with an explosion, then she does bold circus poses on a horse high in the sky, she does her best to entertain you. She remakes her own songs, giving them a modern look. She sings on a disco cross, almost falls in the middle of the stage, and with her amazing dance team, who doesn't know the size of fear, the show is absolutely more than you expected. This is a spectacle, an audiovisual orgasm that cannot be expressed in words. Fortunately, those who really saw Madonna on the scene. Having gone fifty, she is still in incredible shape. The recent Sticky and Sweet Tour has become even more innovative, which does not prove that Madonna was, is and will be the only queen of popularity.
