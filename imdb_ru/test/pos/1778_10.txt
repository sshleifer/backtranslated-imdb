Cruelly straightforward story about the murder and the death penalty by the state. So painfully slow and precise in describing the death penalty (from preparing the gallows to the victim, who breaks into his pants before dying), he can change his mind about the death penalty. The whole Dekalog came from this story: the screenwriter Dekalog was an impotent lawyer who tried unsuccessfully to defend and then console the defendant.
