Many believe that BEAST STABLE is the last of the "real" films "WOMAN ATTENDANT", as this is the last of the TV shows filmed by Shun Ito, followed by another film (GRUDGE SONG) of another director. I haven’t seen GRUDGE SONG (but soon ...), so I don’t know how it goes with previous FP films - but it will be interesting to watch. The way BEAST STABLE ended did not really leave much room for another predecessor - but I think I’ll find out ... <br /> <br /> In this post, Scorpio runs from the police, where she connects with a street prostitute who got pregnant from her backward child of brothers (oh yeah, this is not a lie ... should love these slovenly storylines). Scorpio was eventually kidnapped by an old rival, but (because she is so good at it ...) ultimately escapes and takes revenge on some people who have offended several of her prostitute friends ... <br /> <br /> I agrees with some other reviewers that this item is a bit slower and more “serious” than the previous two entries. At times, the story is somewhat tangled and confusing, but many of these little fingers of the 70s era films - and I still love them. BEAST STABLE is badly lacking in the field of nudity, which was pretty disappointing - but I thought it was strong in other areas - storyline, cinema, some good entertainment, etc. other films for female prisoners ... 8/10
