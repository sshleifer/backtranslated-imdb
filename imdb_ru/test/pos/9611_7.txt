Crimson starts with some cool jazz music, so I immediately liked it, but when the movie was put on, I started wondering if the music was not the best part. We have some thieves pulling in to rob a gem, and when someone does something wrong, an alarm goes off, and the police chase them, and when the car turns at the checkpoint, one of the thieves (Paul Nash, Hasinto Molina, whatever it is) gets a shot. Now it seems that he may die, but with the help of a drunken doctor and his friend, a mad scientist (and wife), he was saved, with a part of the brain of some nightclub owner called "The Sadist." Sadist sad that the gentlemen who abducted him lost their knife to remove his head, therefore, to add insult to the wound (or, in this case, death), they remove his head with a train, leaving the body to the authorities. find, oops After the brain transplant is completed, Ours wants to ruin any woman who approaches him, because now he has a mindset of his donor. Well, of course, all this is quite unbelievable and includes medical equipment that seems to have been bought at Radio Shack, and in general it is rather stupid and despicable. But he has a good appearance from the early 70s, and the music is awesome. It's not so much a horror movie as a thriller with a lot of thugs fighting for turf, kids and other things like thugs, but this is strangely entertaining, and I can't describe it. 7 out of 10.
