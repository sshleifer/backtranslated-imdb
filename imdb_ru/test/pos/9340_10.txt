Prior to this clip, music videos were just to show the artist. "Thriller" by Michael Jackson created a whole new section of music videos, which can honestly be called mini-movies. Thriller follows the pair when they go to the house of the girl from the movie. On the way, they meet zombies declared to be the immortal Vincent Price. My favorite part is when the zombies fall for a couple, and the girl turns to see that Michael has turned into one of them. Then they dance a little. The most terrible thing in the "Thriller" may be the fact that it is always more fun and more pleasant than many movies that are shot. Twenty years later, he remains the main music video. <br /> <br /> P.S. My music video Top 5: 5 - Madonna "Like a Prayer" 4 - Guns N 'Roses "Sweet Child of Mine" 3 - Nine Inch Nails "Closer" 2 - Peter Gabriel "Sledgehammer" 1 - Michael Jackson - "Thriller"
