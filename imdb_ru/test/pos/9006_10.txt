“Forever Strong” is one of those sports films that you can really watch. It reminded me a lot of Remember the Titans, because it included comedy, sadness and just amazing. I saw it in the preview, and all my friends loved it and easily put it in their best 2 sports films. The acting is great in the film. Although it sounds like Remember Titans, there is something unique about this movie. I feel that this is definitely a worthy Oscar and will receive many awards. Everyone should definitely watch this movie, and it is worth your $ 10. I'm going to see it again when it comes out, because it was so good. I can't say anything bad about the movie.
