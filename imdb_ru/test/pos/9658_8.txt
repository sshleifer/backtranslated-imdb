Satisfying fantasy with ships sailing through the clouds with guns, evil conspirators, strange landscapes, time manipulations, magnificent sets, devoid of reality, perhaps like Never Ending Story or some Merlin stuff. If you like it, you will love it. Christina Taylor is beautiful. Sword fights are weird. The music is amazing. Good wins, they kiss, everything is good, and the cook is happy.
