After watching "The Texas Tale of Betrayal," you have an aversion to the nature of the Hollywood beast. In interviews and conversations of all those associated with the project, there is a general sense of camaraderie and rebellion, which covers backgrounds, social classifications and even geography. This may be due to the hard work on the immortal commitment of the entire project to the project and the love of the story from the original film, and the complete creation of the vacuum that is its creator. The scale of the people involved in Waldo's Hawaiian Vacation was amazing for me, with no budget and no fame. There were no trailers, no craft services, no amenities, and yet everyone who participated was stuck in place. If nothing comes out of this project, Antstuie Productions laid the foundation for becoming a serious, honest company that is never going to fold, take or sell or make a film just for money. I would like some director LA The guerrilla process went through to get a chance. At this time, CG and green screens lack more realistic, real cinema. Mass can enjoy their entertaining spoon being served to them by good sized, censored quiet pieces, but there is a large group of people here in the world who share the opinions and ideas of directors who still make films for the love of material. or a love of storytelling, not selling a DVD or box office. I liked this documentary, and I hope that the IFC has cajones to pick it up and broadcast, so maybe, just maybe, another person decided to pick up a camera and shoot some real life, so that we, the viewer, can even have a temporary understanding that everyone is the same everywhere, and anyone can be a real storyteller.
