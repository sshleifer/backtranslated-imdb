There are two ways to regard the "head". Either this is a dazzling, mind-blowing collage of music, old clips, psychedelia and comedy in the style of a comedy series, or a plot, pretentious, rambling mess. The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. It is also one of the best films of all time. <br /> <br /> “Monkeys” - Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolens and Mike Nesmith - just finished a series of hits and wanted to make a movie. In collaboration with writer Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafelson, they made “Head.” <br /> <br /> This begins at the opening ceremony of the bridge in San Francisco, where the Monkees Gate collapses. Mickey jumps over the safety railing, plunging hundreds of feet into the water. Mermaids save him to the accompaniment of the magnificent composition Jerry Goffin & Carole King called “The Porpoise Song”, as well as the visual effects that make the final Stargate “2001” relatively boring. By now, you will either disconnect with surprise or be completely fascinated. <br /> <br /> Stranger events appear; Mickey uses a tank to destroy a Coca-Cola car in the middle of the desert; the whole Italian army surrenders to him; the group is hired to play to play dandruff in Victor Mature's hair for television commercials; an overweight waitress insults the group, describing them as “God's gift to an eight-year-old”; Mike's unexpected birthday party goes wrong; the group is sucked into a vacuum cleaner, and to close it all, it is distilled into a giant glass tank. <br /> <br /> You either hate it or love it. I found this a refreshing change from meaningless pop musicals of the sort “let's do a show right here.” The songs are good too; "Daddy's Song" is superbly staged by Tony Basil (later she will appear in Rafelson's "Easy Racer") and boasts excellent editing: Davy's clothes change color with lightning speed. “As We Go Along” is a wonderful number by Goffin and King, the accompanying images of which carry a strong message from environmentalists. <br /> <br /> Frank Zappa, Annette Funichello are just two of the guest stars. I wonder if Victor Mature read the script before agreeing to do it? Although he is hilarious in this. <br /> <br /> So crazy that it just has to be a real genius, “Head” is a small stone of the 60s, and it should be reconsidered again and again. Shame it did not find an audience at that time. If only Spiceworld were like that!
