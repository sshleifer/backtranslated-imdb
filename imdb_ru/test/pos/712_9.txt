I really liked this film - I like prison films in general (I'm not sure why - I'm sure some psychiatrist can do something from this!) I spent one night in prison more than 20 years ago, and I knew then I will never come back - I received an individual version of the "scared straight"! (I was locked in a isolation cell on Alcatraz for a couple of hours, compliments from a park ranger, but that's another story!) In any case, the genre really interests me. The soundtrack, in particular Rolling Stones' Empathy for the Devil, became the perfect backdrop for the film. To this day, I think of the Mile of Jericho every time I hear a song.
