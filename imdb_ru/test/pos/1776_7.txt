Director Jacques Turner (Cat People, From the Past, Demon's Night) and screenwriter Philip Dunn (How Green Was My Valley) Ann's from India is a rather interesting pirate adventure film. His main character, Captain Anne Providence, is based on the real female pirate Anne Boni, who really lived and sailed across the Atlantic of the 18th century. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a naval battle, where Anna’s pirate ship (Jean Peters) attacks a merchant ship heading for Europe from South America. As a result, valuable treasure is captured along with a beautiful French officer, Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jourdan), who was taken prisoner. In the end, Ann falls in love with him, and, obviously, her feelings are mutual, but only until she releases him when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife, Molly (Debra Paget), with whom he is very in love. Ann begins planning revenge on both of them, but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a big sacrifice to save them instead. Here also appears a cliché figure in the pirate film Blackbeard, this time it is played by Thomas Gomez. <br /> <br /> Although Ann from India is probably no more and no less than a repetition of a pirated film. Cliche, he still has his classic moments in the beautiful visual effects and sequences of sea battles shot in Technicolor, as well as in some aspects of the story and, above all, in personal touches staged by all of this by Jacques Turner. 7/10
