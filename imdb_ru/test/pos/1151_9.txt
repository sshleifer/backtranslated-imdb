Returned from Morocco, where my father was seconded to the German embassy when the film was released in Europe; I took all my friends to see it, to show them the beauty of the country where Jimi played - and stayed -; where the hippies stopped after they left Ibiza and joined Goa. Sean Combs recently noted at a friends restaurant in Marrakech that in those days Jem el-Fna was much wilder than he is now; “The stones went there earlier,” Brian wrote down in Tangier; so it's memories and family fun, and I'm glad my son finds out about North Africa by watching this movie. Candice Bergen looks beautiful, and oo7 / Connery is pretty funny; and Teddy Roosevelt as Brian Keith is quite impressive.
