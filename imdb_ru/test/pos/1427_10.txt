Clifton Webb in the role of "Mr. Scoutmaster" - one of the greatest composers in the history of comedy and innocence memories, now diminished in the world. I can't understand why networks like American Movie Classics and the like don't show this movie, although I asked for it again and again. <br /> <br /> This film should be shown to children now, because it shows loyalty and respect. , dedication and determination to achieve the best on an individual basis. In today's daily life, they talk about such low self-esteem, but this film, among many, many others, would be an excellent educational tool for the modern younger generation to see what can be achieved by common sense and decency and be proud of yourself and your achievements to it is better. It is sad that this type of film does not attract the modern audience. This, of course, attracted us yesterday, the generation of "baby boomers." OLD LESSONS ARE UNIVERSAL AND TIME.
