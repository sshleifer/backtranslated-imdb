If you have ever had a nanny in a house that you didnâ€™t know, or if you saw the original and enjoyed it, it would be a good choice. Ignoring the reviews and what was published here, I rented this film because of the memories of how the original frightened me when I was a teenager. This film (of course) changed some of the original stories relating to today's teenagers, such as the nanny in trouble, because she spent the minutes on her mobile phone, and she has to work as a nanny to pay the bill. However, it adheres well to the original storyline. If you can relate to the nurse without knowing the house, and it is usually cracking and cracking, it is pretty tense. When the killer is shown, he is very creepy, and you find yourself shouting at the girl to "EXIT FROM THE HOUSE". If you have never been nursing or have not been in a similar situation, you probably will not be able to communicate and you will not like it. It's all about understanding her fear.
