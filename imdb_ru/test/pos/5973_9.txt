I agree with another reviewer, itâ€™s such an amazing film that will soon be difficult to watch again, although for the quality alone it deserves to be re-watched. The complexity of the characters, incredible cinematography and excellent leadership make this film worthy of the emotional price of viewing. <br /> <br /> There is one scene in which two partisans are dragged through the snow to avoid a patrol, this is possible because of its physical shape, the most amazing view I've ever seen. In fact, though not sporadically - the story flows - this is a film of unforgettable scenes. Among the guerrillas there is a distribution of rations, snow scenes, a destroyed farm, meetings in houses, an interrogation, a scene in the basement, an ascent. All stand out like jewels in a necklace. <br /> <br /> Religiousness is not obvious to me. Honestly, I don't think that would be allowed in a Soviet film. I see it as an existential parable about the value of life. This is the story in which the hero - and he is a true hero - becomes a villain, and the weak becomes stronger. Is it a mystical process or dictated by circumstances? There is a transfiguration, but does it come from within or from outside? You have to watch the film in order to understand the problems, because they cannot be discussed without giving away too much history. I can not say enough about the game. I find it difficult to choose which of the reasons affects more. I am not familiar with the Soviet film of the 70s and am not familiar with any of the actors, but they are all great. Also note how the director Larisa Shepitko uses children. They remind me of Giotto's angel children. <br /> <br /> At the end of a bit of confusion. Apparently, the former relationship exists between the soldier Sotnikov and the investigator Portnov, but this remains sluggish. And the final scene is a bit ambiguous. But compared to the general experience, this is a niggle. This is a movie that will mark you for life.
