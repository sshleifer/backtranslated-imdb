This is how Burt Reynolds describes this film, which turned out to be his best in history. He plays Tom Sharkey, a vice-detective who follows the trail of an international gangster (Vittorio Gassman) and the man he funds to become the next governor of Georgia (Earl Holliman). In William Dil's novel, the story is more complicated, because the guy is running for president. This is a very long film that looks like three hours instead of two. Shooting in downtown Atlanta and at the Peachtree Plaza Hotel creates a mood just for history. Reynolds does not laugh at this in comparison with his comedy films. Here he is very serious, especially at the beginning of the film, because he is being demoted for a dope failure that goes wrong. From time to time, however, the film plays more like a voyeur drama than a crime film in which Bert tries to get close to a female gangster. Only at the end of the film does the violence begin, which leads to a climax. Like the magnificent jazz soundtrack in LIRO SHIFRINA's “DIRTY HARRY”, Sharky's Machine shows an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars, including Chet Baker, Julie London, Flora Purim and Buddy De Franco, Manhattan Transfer, Doc Severonson Sarah Vaughan and Joe. Williams. Al Capps handles invoice with magic. This film has become one of the best crime dramas. Check this. <br /> <br /> Rated 8 out of 10 stars
