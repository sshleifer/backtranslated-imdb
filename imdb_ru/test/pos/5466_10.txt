Great story with the acting of all the actors. The warmth and understanding of who the Joad represents is moved from the screen to the heart of this viewer. The frustration and perseverance of Mother Madalina in her desire to do HIS work before her last breath was also done with the superiority of Barbara Hershey. The intertwining of the personalities of Joad and Mother Madalina grew throughout the storyline with a breathtaking crescendo in the final scene.
