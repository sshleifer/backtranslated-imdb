I really liked this movie. Yes, the film was disrespectful, but Bruce Willis learned from Kid that respect for other people is of great value, and his disrespectful life must change. This film was a refreshing change from the rubbish that Hollywood is trying to shove down our throats. There are some very good lessons in this movie. I really believe that it was one of the best Disney films, although some things could be omitted. I was impressed by the lack of curses and the lack of sexual hints. It's not perfect, but much better than everything else there.
