For unknown reasons, this beautiful masterpiece did not receive well-deserved recognition and was significantly undervalued by many American film critics. So it's easy to understand that I met a lot of trouble trying to find this movie. Finally, I watched it, and it was so beautiful, sincere and painful that for the first time in my life I watched one film five times a week after receiving the tape. The plot tells about the friendship of two young men, Eric and Dexter, eleven and twelve years old, who are very different from each other, but become the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of their friendship has been shown in Cure as sincerely and naturally as ever. There are so many beautiful, emotional and sharp scenes (especially on the river) that hit the heart and can not leave anyone indifferent to them. The film is also full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism (especially strong in Eric's shoes), which also greatly increases the visual impression of such a beautiful work. The story, written by Robert Kuhn, is well written, and, unlike the vast majority of modern Hollywood works, almost every scene, every phrase and every sentence in the film makes sense and brings something important about the characters and the relationship between them. Peter Horton, who, as I know, did not have much experience in directing, demonstrated his great abilities and talents in this area. Cinematography is also great with well-chosen places for the film, but the most important thing is the perfect acting game that, with all of the above, makes The Cure one of the best films ever. Both Brad Renfro as Eric and Joseph Mazello as Dexter created a wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and great chemistry between the two main characters. Only one of this film (I have not seen most of their other works) is enough to call them one of the best actors of their generation. Annabel Sciorra also gives an amazing job as Dexter's mother. It is terribly sad that such talented actors are not widely accepted, while numerous overrated stars enjoy huge advertising and huge salaries. Finally, it would be unfair not to mention the amazing soundtrack, written by David Grusen, and the amazing Mark Kohn song (one of the best songs I've ever heard in movies) My Great Escape. So all I can say about Cure is one simple word ?? a great. In any case, this film is a beautiful, soulful and inspiring work of all the people involved in the creation of this masterpiece. I have to pay tribute to all those people who have invested their hearts and souls in the film and Universal Pictures, who have found a way to make such a beautiful film among the many sample commercial projects. But such films so rarely go to the cinema that the studios themselves often do not understand what they have done, that they cannot provide an appropriate marketing campaign. For me, the only small drawback of The Cure is its short length (a total of 97 minutes). <br /> <br /> I don’t want to write more about the film, because it’s just impossible to express its beauty and sincerity with words, so if you have the opportunity to watch The Cure, rent or buy it and you wouldn’t be disappointed . <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. Sorry for my bad english.
