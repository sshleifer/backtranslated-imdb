The Cure is an outstanding real-life drama that touches a very sensitive topic. This is a story about the deep and dear friendship of two boys, Eric and Dexter. The latter acquired AIDS from blood transfusions. Thus, he and his mother (Annabella Sciorra) became outcasts, avoided by the public and marked as a dangerous company, mainly due to the general lack of public knowledge about the disease. <br /> <br /> When Eric (Brad Renfro, known from Client and Apprentice Apta and his mother move to a house next to him, he has to deal with public insults and fear of becoming infected with AIDS himself. However, Eric overcomes his fear and risks to everyone. At first he starts talking to Dexter, but eventually he climbs over the fence and joins the witty boy (played by Joseph Mazzello from Jurassic Park) and his games. Very quickly he makes a real friendship with Dexter who is elegantly folded and x a handful because of their condition. <br /> <br /> The central theme of the film ?? a topic that makes it universally authentic and tragic at the same time? That's how Eric and Dexter are trying to find the ultimate cure. First, they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves. This is very naive, but at the same time sincere, because it shows how young children cope with such disgusting diseases and how much they still believe in the magic of the world. When they hear about the proposed treatment that was developed in the south, they did not hesitate and set out on an adventure that will bring them closer and symbolize the ultimate search for hope. <br /> <br /> So they sit on the raft and head south along the Mississippi River. What begins as a real adventure becomes a dangerous event that is emotionally intriguing and instructive at the same time. The scene where Dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe, where everything is dark and cold, Eric hands him sneakers, a symbol of what, wherever the boy goes, Eric is and always will be with him; he will never have to be alone. This episode, which is one of the most persuasive in the film, demonstrates a very convincing interaction between two actors who manage to avoid awkward and banal dialogues and provide a very authentic presentation that ultimately impresses with its tenderness and honesty. br /> <br /> I will not describe the plot, since I am not going to give out too much information. The ending, however, is emotionally tough and makes the audience such an important part of the tragedy that everyone who watches the movie is personally influenced. This aspect makes this film so strong, so outstanding and so convincing. The emotional load on each character is so real and so great that even tougher members of the audience may need handkerchiefs. <br /> <br /> 10 points corresponds to this film and is not too high. I hardly saw any other film in my life that would cope with such an emotional problem with such wit and feeling. This is a story about how two boys make each other's life richer and how they teach each other life lessons. In this way, Dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness, and Eric learns what really matters in life; and they both understand how true friendship gives when it comes to the most difficult moments of life. <br /> <br /> This movie is tragic ?? but his message is pure inspiration.
