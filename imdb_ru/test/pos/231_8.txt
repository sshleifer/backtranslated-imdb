The most famous feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors, the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dance. This typical rising star star musical has an overwhelming plot even in 1944, but because of the actors itâ€™s still interesting to watch him. Kelly plays her usual caring authoritarian role, while Silvers gives a lot of self-deprecation and laughs. Sometimes a movie can be very serious. Not necessarily to watch, but recommended if you like actors.
