One of the best films for television series, I would like it to tell us more. I read a lot of biographies and saw other things about Carpenters, and this film did everything he could, based on the restrictions imposed on him by his family. Sintis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to revive Karen. One of my disappointments is that there was no deeper understanding of Karen anorexia. In the reading I read about the disease (especially in Cherry Boon O'Neill's excellent book, Fasting to Attention), anorexia seems to be a control disease. Karen saw in her weight one thing in her life that she could control. She felt controlled in all other aspects of her life. Don't get me wrong, I believed that she really loved music, but she felt that she had little control over her career. She really loved her family, but they did not express it well, and she did not know how to make her family understand her. The film might affect a lot more about it. I cherish the music of the Carpenters, which I have, and I wish her to be still alive to make a greater contribution to the music today.
