Watching this strange little adventure film, it’s hard to believe that it was the same person who brought us such great works of Giallo as “Mrs. Ward’s Odd Defect and the Scorpion Tail Case”, but I must say that despite this it’s low product quality, Island of the Fish Men is an exciting journey, and it certainly deserves more praise than it receives. Like many Italian films of the seventies, this film is a successful successful American film, this time it is a question of the critical island of Dr. Moro. The film Sergio Martino combines ideas such as mutations, greed and adventure, and combines them into one slightly convincing film that compensates for the lack of consistency and logic with many intriguing ideas. The central section follows the boat, which falls on a small island. It quickly becomes apparent that not everything in this place is normal, and it soon turns out that half of the population turned into "fishermen" - something between human and fish, which exist for purely selfish reasons ... <br /> True in this film is that much more fun if you ignore the dirty production values. The central monsters look completely ridiculous, and most of the film takes place on film sets, which seem to cost someone a few kopecks, but the film is well shot, despite the fact that underwater photography is a special highlight and pace of shooting. the film is well made in that the film never gets boring. The way of making the plot is not quite brilliant, but there are a lot of ideas in it, and I saw films shot on plots with much less thoughtfulness than this one. The biggest place that stands out in the film is definitely the lost city of Atlantis. Honestly, I am not a big fan of adventure films, and therefore I don’t see much to be mentioned about this lost city - but it’s always nice to see him in the film. The location on the central island is advantageous in that it provides a suitable setting for the story, and also gives the film the right amount of mystery, since Martino makes good use of the topic of voodoo. In general, this is not really a classic, and, of course, there are much worse adventure films than this one.
