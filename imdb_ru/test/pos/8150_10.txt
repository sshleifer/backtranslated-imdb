I watched it last night and again this morning â€” that was how I liked it. There is something in this film ... When the film was almost finished, I was about to cry. I would strongly recommend "Last Days" to my friends - this is definitely worth a look! I agree with those who say that some parts of the film do not look very realistic. For example, both main characters are absolutely cute and have excellent physical form (although the circle is also a form :)) I rarely meet such people alone and never met them in pairs. Other parts of the film, including all these "coincidences", also do not look very realistic. BUT, in the end, it's a movie, not a life story.
