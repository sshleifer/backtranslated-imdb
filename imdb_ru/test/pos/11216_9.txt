In this episode, Locke and Eco go in search of "?" the character that we saw during the lock in the previous episode. Michael, shooting Ana Lucia and Libby, struggles with his actions when Libby approaches death. <br /> <br /> The most interesting in this episode (I think). This is during a commercial break. Locke and Eco find the hatch under the plane that killed Boone in the first season, and the new instructional video ends with “Copyright, The Hanso Foundation, 1989”. (commercial) and advertised website (www.sublymonal.com) guides the visitor through the world of life information outside the LOST storyline. Be sure to look for all the fans!
