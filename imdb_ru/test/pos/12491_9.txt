This is an exceptional picture with so many recommendations. The acting and writing are awesome, and there are many wonderful twists in the plot. Like the French film Noir, his language is, of course, much more mundane than his American counterparts, but for me this only added to realism. In addition, I liked that everyone was charming - especially her husband and lieutenant. The only negative, and the reason why the film gets 9, not 10, is that there was a clear hole in the plot. As in the other famous French film “Drôle de Drame”, the confusion between the police and the accused could have been easily solved at the beginning, but the characters made rather stupid decisions. To do this, you just need to suspend disbelief and continue to look - the gain fully justifies the expectation. <br /> <br /> This is just one of the best French films I've seen. Period.
