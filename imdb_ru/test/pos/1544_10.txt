This is one of those classic American ones created for television films that are simply created for viewing on a rainy day. Although the script is incredibly implausible, he never takes himself too seriously, and the cast that leads to the magnificent language in the movie “The Murder / Murder in the Cheeks” movie best suits with popcorn bags or a box of chocolates. A great bonus of this film is the fantastic location of filming, and, despite the strange events and even unfamiliar residents around Tomahawk Lake, for example, I do not mind living there! <br /> <br /> In general, an excellent movie to watch and again.
