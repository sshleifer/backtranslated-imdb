Although this film looks like “Crime Thriller Noir”, the plot is actually a bit simplified and quite a bit unexpected - and those that appear are not quite shocking. <br /> <br /> However, if you exit the “intense action movie” mode and turn into “meaningless entertainment,” then this is really a pretty funny movie with a few funny moments. Most of them can be attributed to the witty dialogue between Alan Rickman and the characters of Emma Thompson - but, nevertheless, Sadie said all this in her cheerful introductory greeting to Friedman, and nothing was left between these two characters to develop. I did not find these respected British actors a version of southern accents, which is bad (well, Thompson sounded like she was rolling balls in her mouth when she tried to speak in the south, but Rickman was surprisingly pretty good with very few errors in his usual English accent) - if you want to criticize accents - let's discuss it with Koko - she only occasionally spoke in the south! <br /> <br />
