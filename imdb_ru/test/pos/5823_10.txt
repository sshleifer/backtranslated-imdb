One of the other reviewers mentioned that after watching the episode for just 1 ounce, you will hook. They are right, since that is exactly what happened to me. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me in Oz was his cruelty and unrelenting scenes of violence that came directly from the word GO. Believe me, this is not a show for the faint of heart or timid. This show does not cause any upheavals regarding drugs, sex or violence. This is hardcore, in the classic use of the word. <br /> <br /> It is called OZ, as it is a pseudonym given to the Oswald Penitentiary District. The focus is on the Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison, where all the cells have glass facades and are turned inwards, so confidentiality is not on the agenda. Em City is home to many .. Aryans, Muslims, gangsters, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and many others ... so brawls, deadly looks, tricky deals and questionable agreements are never far away> I would say that the main attraction the show is that it goes where other shows dare not. Forget the beautiful pictures drawn for the main audience, forget the charm, forget the romance ... OZ does not mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so unpleasant that it was surreal, I could not say that I was ready for it, but when I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz and got used to a high level of graphic of violence. Not only violence, but also injustice (dishonest guards who will be sold for nickel, prisoners who will kill in order and get away with, brought up from the middle class, turn into prison bitches due to lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may feel uncomfortable due to the fact that you are uncomfortable to watch ... so if you can get in touch with your dark side.
