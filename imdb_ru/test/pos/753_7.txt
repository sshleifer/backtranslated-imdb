Nurse Charlotte Beal (charming Rosie Holotic) came to the clinic of Dr. Stevens for the insane, ready for new work. What she doesnâ€™t expect is that she will find another alleged doctor in her post after Stevens is attacked by a manic "judge" wielding an ax Oliver W Cameron (in a running gag, whenever he faces a situation from under his control repeat his name). This doctor is Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Broom), who is not sure whether Beale is suitable for their institution. After a long discussion of the situation (this is a rather awkward scene, since two discussions about the fact that Stephens sent Bill a letter asking for a job at a clinic where Masters often reminded her that he no longer responded), Masters agrees to allow her to work as a nurse but a good doctor may not be who she seems .. <br /> <br /> The range of psychos includes Sam (Bill McGee), a simple child who was the last victim of Stevens Jennifer (Harriett Warren) - a woman need an adult to succeed eyeing her when she caresses Masters' heel like a puppy, Danny (Jesse Kirby) is an unpleasant irritation, often trying to steal a fake child by a worried Harriet (Camilla Carr) Allison (Betty Chandler) is a sexy nympho who just wants to be loved and jumping on any man she sees, and "Sergeant" Jaffee (Hugh Fignin) - your typical case of a soldier who did not escape the madness of war. <Br /> <br /> The film shows unorthodox methods of the Clinic Management Wizard, allowing patients to roam. free with doors to all rooms without locks that question .. and not to mention that Oliver is still allowed to walk around despite the fact that he is simply chopping Dr. Stevens with an ax. And what exactly happened to Dr. Stevens? Ah, ha .. <br /> <br /> Tacky 70th entry trash is a lot of fun if you're into a cinematic brand. I am attracted to strange films about mental disabilities because of their unpredictable nature ... you just never know what the hell can happen, especially in this case when they are allowed to wander often without supervision. Some consider a low-budget commitment, but in the case of this film, I think it improves the experience. With a cheap photo and a weak production value (being filmed for a peanut in a dilapidated house in a horrible place), this seems scary, and I felt like a voyeur looking insane through a camera lens outside, looking inward.
