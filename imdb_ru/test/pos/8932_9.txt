I saw this movie on Sunday night and I must say that there is no better way to end the weekend. I am completely satisfied with the humor and warm charm of this film. It just leaves me in a great mood. Watching this movie means having a good time and keeping warm feelings. <br /> <br /> The film offers a sharp black British humor and seems to me very fresh. You really enjoy the story and the characters. Brenda Bletin is SO great. I do not know exactly why. She is too old to arouse my love interest, and too young to be my mother. But I really feel comfortable when she appears in the film. <br /> <br /> Some may say that the story was subtle and predictable. But who cares? There simply must be a happy ending, dancing in the sun! Are characters stereotypes or cutouts? I do not know - I donâ€™t care! I just loved them and enjoyed them. <br /> <br /> Also, I must say that I usually do not like romantic comedies. But this outstanding: black comedy with a heart of gold !!
