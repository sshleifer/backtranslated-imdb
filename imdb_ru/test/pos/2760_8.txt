Graphically, this is the same game as in the first one, only different levels and some new features added for fun. <br /> <br /> In the PS1 version, there is still a problem with providing the skater with enough air for some ground stunts. The Dreamcast version, which is rarely seen, was the best version of the 4 versions (as a result, the Xbox came out with the 5th with 2x), it had a clearer resolution, and the skaters looked better and more detailed like PS1 and N64. <br /> <br /> The levels were really made amazingly, from beginning to end, as in the first one, the school was my favorite, I really liked this level, not only for the golf cart, which sometimes forced you to interrupt but for length. This is what I liked in the first two games, they do not make these games graphically improved, they just focus on the length of the levels, which is cool. <br /> <br /> In general, itâ€™s as good as the first, and well worth playing.
