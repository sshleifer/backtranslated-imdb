This film does not claim to be a great art, and that is good. But this is a well-written script with well-developed characters and a solid game. I think that if I had written this, I could have done without the drama around my wife, but this did not divert enough attention to divert attention from the main story about the character of Minnie Driver. I think that too often Hollywood refuses to try to create a really high-quality letter to try to add more visual drama, when with an adult film like this, the emotional type of drama is all that is really needed - and probably more believable. Overall, this is a very well-made proposal that is worth seeing.
