"The English Patient" by Anthony Minghella is a film that returns us to the golden years of Hollywood. It is majestic and impressive in scope, and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in depicting human love and suffering. At the 1997 Academy Awards, the film belonged to the night in which he received nine awards in twelve nominations, which was the most decisive revelation after Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor in 1988. “The English Patient” is a touching meditation about life, love and loss, tracing the story of a burned man after World War II. <br /> <br /> During the war, a man (Ralph Fiennes) was found in the burning remains of a crashed plane. With his scar unrecognizable and with a man apparently suffering from amnesia, he is considered an Allied soldier, and is simply called the “English patient.” After the war, in the mined hills of Italy, the kind nurse of Hana (Juliette Binoche), who apparently lost all those who were near her, remains in the ruined monastery to look after the dying man. Over time, she will learn more and more about her “English patient,” who, as it turned out, is a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almacy. Instead of losing memory in a plane crash, we learn that this scarred man might have decided to forget his past in order to protect himself from persecution and heal himself from the tragic memories of his past love. Thanks to numerous memories, we learn about the former exploits of Almassi in the Sahara desert and his romantic relationship with a married woman, Catherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). <br /> <br /> Of course, it's easy to see why the “English Patient” was so successful at the Oscars. This is such a beautiful film, combining the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Cinematographer John Seale captures the landscape to perfection; since in the gorgeous David Lin film, Lawrence of Arabia, a film was shown showing a desert with such beauty and grandeur that radiation images from the almasi aircraft are particularly well used. Even in more intimate moments of the film, the excellent use of close-ups and lighting reflects the emotions of the scene, of course, in combination with the brilliant performances of all the actors. <br /> <br /> For a long time, My favorite actor, The English Patient, can only contain the best performance of Ralph Fiennes, and, given his story, includes films such as Schindler's List and Permanent Gardener, this is not a complement that should be taken lightly, His Count Laszlo de Almacy was originally a very responsive character, but as we gradually learn more about his past, his cute qualities are blurred because of his less admirable aptitudes towards others. “Property” is the main theme of the film. When Catherine asks what he hates the most, Almacy responds: “Property. Be owned. When you leave, you must forget me. ” However, as the relationship develops, and Catherine may be trying to distance himself from him, Almasi shows a hint of arrogance, insisting that his love for her somehow gives him the right to have her at any time: “I want to touch you. I want my things that belong to me. "<br /> <br /> Juliette Binoche, who won an Oscar for her performance here, is excellent, like Hana, a lonely nurse who is afraid to love because of the tragedies that always hurt people close to her. After some time taking care of Almácy, She is joined by the dubious Canadian thief David Caravaggio (Willem Dafo), who lost his fingers during the war and suspects that Almaci betrayed him to the Germans. Hana also establishes a romantic relationship with Kip (Navin Andrews), an Indian bomber in the British army. However, from for his Khan's past history is afraid that his participation in Kip's life will condemn him to death, especially given his very dangerous direction of work. <br /> <br /> In the 160th minute, the “English patient” wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of the past , successfully finding a balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The ending of the film is heartbreaking and sad, but also inspiring in its own way. While some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning, others have a very good chance to bring happiness. However, in any case, it is always better to love and lose than never to love at all.
