This is one of my favorite Disney movies. It has everything you could hope for in a Disney animation: cute animals, great songs, a disgusting villain and many adventures. The story begins in Paris, where aristocrat Duchess and her three kittens live with their Mistress in a mansion. Life is beautiful for them, until the evil butler of Lady Edgar discovers that she plans to leave all her fortune to the cats. He understands that if he even has a chance to claim a fortune, cats will be on the sidelines. An excellent, often forgotten masterpiece from the 1970s — a time when Disney’s studio did several animations — with songs such as the title number Aristocrats and Ev'rybody Wants To A Cat, it will charm the audience young and old with its constant jazz .
