I love this show! it's amazing ... i can never miss an episode, even if i've already seen it. the actors are perfect for the roles ...... i love gilmore girls! I made all my friends see this. even their parents are watching it now. I watch it daily, and I usually watch it more than once a day. I would like my mom to be like Lorelei. my friends say that I speak and behave like Lorelei. Lorelei and Rory have a wonderful mother-daughter relationship. This is a great show for teens, because they really learn to watch it. my vocabulary has expanded from viewing Gilmore Girls. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bled El are perfect for the roles of Lorelei and Rory. I think that Luke and Lorelai should get married because Chris left Lorelei and Rory too many times. and broke the heart of Lorelei too many times.
