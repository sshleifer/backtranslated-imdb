Cheerful, clean, carefree and decent quotes. What else can you ask for in a movie? This is my favorite movie of all time. Since I was a little girl, I have dreamed of having a blue van with fire and a watchful bubble. <br /> <br /> Cliches in ridiculous situations make this movie so funny. The fine comedic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) makes up the majority of my favorite parts of the film. And who didn't like Flynch's hopeless awkwardness? Do not forget about the tricks at the airport obsessed with Leon, dressed like Hari Krishna: dance, sing and play the tambourine - invincible! Tips are brilliant, classic locations, the plot is not subject to time. <br /> <br /> Word wise: if you didn’t watch this movie as a child, it probably won’t win. place in your heart today. But, nevertheless, give him a chance, you may find that "no matter what you say, no matter what you do, you have to play."
