Maverick director Sejun Suzuki was finally able to shoot his dream film “Princess Raccoon”, and fortunately, he did not try to do it in the 1960s. Special effects and computer graphics undoubtedly made this type of production easier than the old matte technologies for films. <br /> <br /> Some familiarity with Japanese history and theatrical traditions will help to enjoy this film. Getting familiar with Shakespeare's Storm will help with Peter Greenaway's Prospero Books. These two films actually have something in common, although “Princess Raccoon” is much more colorful, and it is easier for a person without a background to observe it in order to fully appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Although artistic design, action and direction For most of the movie, this viewer feels like energy is running out in the last third of the movie. Most of the interesting sets have already been presented, and the camera seems to be retreating to get even more impressions of the shooting scene. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a unique film, and I recommend it to anyone interested in alternative forms of film performance. This is not really intended for children, although nothing happens that would upset them. If the last third was better, I would give her nine stars.
