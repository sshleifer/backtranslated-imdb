This can be considered not as a review of any film, but simply as a commentary on the film that I saw in my childhood. I remember coming home in the evening, full of wonder at what I saw. I tried to retell a part of the story my parents were telling, but they didnâ€™t understand very well what was so strange about the fact that two children were on the island who fall in love, grow up together and have a son. As you have probably guessed, I mean the Blue Lagoon (1949), which kept me enchanted and bewildered for many years (almost 50), and now I am surprised at the full anxiety and disgust, who film affordable. in tape or DVD or something else. I spent my whole life in pursuit of the opportunity once to master it, and no one knows anything about it. What a waste indeed! Sorry if my English is not technical or scientific, but my native language is Spanish. I do my best to understand me. Thank you, my name is Juan, and I write from Uruguay in South America.
