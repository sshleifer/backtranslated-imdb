Time travel into the past is at best insignificant as a topic. In this episode, the man who thought about the possibility turns out to be at the date and place of the murder of Abraham Lincoln. He tries everything he can come up with, in the short time available to him, with predictable results. Of course, he is considered completely crazy. He is arrested and eventually handed over to the very person he is trying to stop. Serling was bright enough to allow him to return to the present, but is the present the same? This is a kind of predecessor of the "Tunnel of Time", where time travelers were given the same task weekly, overcoming what had already happened. Unfortunately, the consequences of distorting time and future always nullify the result. If you don't have something like Ray Bradbury's “Sound of Thunder”.
