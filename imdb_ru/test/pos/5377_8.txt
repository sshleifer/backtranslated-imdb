I would probably say that it was on a par with films such as Devil Rain and the like, although this is probably a little better done. I love the horror of the 70s, and it has most of the elements that make up other films that I like, so it was pretty easy to enjoy. The family on vacation stumbled upon a small town where people seem to be engulfed in some kind of hysteria. Looks like the kids are gone. After the initial attempt to leave this place, the family somehow stopped on the outskirts of the city and found their way back, but not without first finding the house where the children had left, and their mother and father died. It looks like we have another kind of turns in this city nursing center, they are all admirers of Satan, and they need children to renew their life so that I think they can continue their service. Itâ€™s not that someone seems too eager to give up their children for the sake of this enterprise. That's pretty cool, considering that it's scary and creepy without buckets of blood and loud, startling events that make people jump in films today that seem to have replaced real fears. We have Hank Kimball (Elvi Moore) from Green Acres as Toby, deputy sheriff who reads UFO magazines, and LK Jones as a sheriff, and a very familiar character actor as a father in a poor family. And Stroter Martin plays a doctor who seems to perform a double duty without the knowledge of his fellows. It's pretty good stuff, but sometimes a bit confusing, but overall it works quite well and is recommended for fans of the 70s horror. 8 out of 10.
