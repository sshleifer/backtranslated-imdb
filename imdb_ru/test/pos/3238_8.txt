I just checked Northanger Abbey from the local library and didn't expect much. Imagine my surprise in this gothic pleasure! Northanger Abbey is one of the most terrible places you have ever seen, with empty aisles and richly decorated rooms full of hidden secrets. The filmâ€™s fame is that it never reveals everything: your imagination works freely, works with the imagination of the main character, Catherine M. alone. She is a girl of wild fantasies, a reader of Gothic fantasies that she brings to her (and our) real world. <br /> <br /> If I used one word to describe this wonderful film, it would be surreal. Dreams are woven throughout the film, improving mood. It is sometimes difficult to say what is real and what is not; I think it is intentional. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere prevails. Music is not what you expect from the movie Jane Austen: it sounds creepy on the flute and drum, high and haunts us with a shock of fear. If a soft, pleasant melody played in Northanger Abbey, it would be positive. Now this is a premonition, a gloomy palace with insane walls. (But! Characters! You must see them yourself!) <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the most pleasant evening, do not look away from Northanger Abbey.
