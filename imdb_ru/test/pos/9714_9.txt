It seems that everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and say "Maha Go Guo Guo" .... The word MAHA ........ Like "Mah" ..... It is said Maa-Ka ... <br / > <br /> I grew up with this show in the early 70s here in Los Angeles, on a late and VERY mourned channel 56 ... Before that, there was Astro Boy, dating back to 1963 on the old QHD. Astro Boy TV was the first television example of anime that we got here in the states ... I was a kid in anime and watched him until the end of the 80s, when by that time he had become a series of poorly animated “talking heads.” “This is a phenomenon which is only it worsened, ”said Nuff. <br /> <br /> As for“ Speed ​​racer, ”I really liked the basics, first-person shots, cinematic aspects of live action, skillfully transferred to the animation. ... It was quite typical for most Japanese anime at the time ... Graphics, graphics, graphics! Note that the series was once inspired by the Stanley Kramer film "Grand Prix" (1966), especially reworked American captions .... <br / > <br /> Oh yes, I have the original comics on which the series is based, so I know what I speak. <br /> <br /> What were we doing in the animation, besides shit, like Johnny Quest? ..... "The Same" Things we've been doing since the 20s .... Ho-ham! <br /> <br /> I think that the real problem that I encountered / which was related to the way anime was shown / shown on American television is clumsy work done on the basis of scenarios, credits, etc. . To “sanitize” them for the American audience ... I will not go into other programs until we say "Speed ​​here. <br /> <br /> Look at clowns like Peter Fernandez as one of the culprits here, as he was 99% responsible for rewriting the series ... Not to mention the voice of Speed, Racer X and others ... Between him and that Hertsi in Trans / Lux (think the Cat Felix and the Mighty Hercules - oh-oh! Oh!) They took a cunning, very sophisticated show and lowered it to the level of Sesame Street. ... If I continue, I will vomit. <br /> <br /> This series dates back more than 40 years ago, but I, at the time was strong enough to feel offended because of the stupidity of this and other Japanese programs ... I mean, when someone is killed, it is obvious, but they either remove it or embellish it ........ Pleeeeeze! <br /> Good show - original. Unfortunately, all the later incarnations of the series look as though CRAPPY is “made in Korea”, not to mention that their content is “nauseous.” Even the Japanese are now outsourcing their animation. <br /> <br /> Try to watch the original Japanese debut performance on YouTube someday. Well. Robert
