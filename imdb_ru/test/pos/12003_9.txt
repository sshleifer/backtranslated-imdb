Colombo is a guest lecturer in the class of criminology. Students invite him to a meeting after classes. Driving through a nearby garage, they find their regular teacher next to his car, dead from a gunshot wound. (No, Colombo was not busy with the work of this person.) Colombo, as a cool project, involves students in sleeping. <br /> <br /> Two students, whom the viewer allegedly considers guilty, were in the lecture hall for the entire class. In addition, recordings from surveillance cameras in the garage show that no one except the professor entered or left after he was last seen, as he unexpectedly left the lecture hall. <br /> <br /> Unlike the usual routine, Colombo is the one who pestered an evil (?) duet who longed for reports on progress and attention to their theories. Judicial evidence is virtually absent. The decision of the case depends on some possible and interesting luck. <br /> <br /> At the first viewing it seemed that Colombo had swallowed the wrong direction of all the criminals; however, when re-viewing small details showed that this is not the case. <br /> <br /> This reviewer is not yet tired of Colombo Going to College.
