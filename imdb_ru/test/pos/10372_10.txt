After The Funeral was absolutely gorgeous, and definitely the best episode of the season. I was disappointed with the “cards on the table”, which started out so well, but weakened significantly in the last half hour, and I did not know what to think about “Taken after the flood”, although I remember that at the end I was confused. After the funeral, as I said, this is one of my favorite episodes of Poirot with Five Piglets, Sad Cypress and ABC Kills. I was afraid that they would spoil the story, but instead it is very true to the book. Now I will say that I do not object to changes in the books, and I will try not to compare films and television adaptations with their sources, except when the book is a masterpiece and the adaptation does not justify itself. That is why I didn’t like some of the Marples, such as Nemesis and Sleeping Murder, and so far from Poirot. The killing of Roger Ekroyd, “Taken during the Flood,” and the cards on the table are the only ones that really disappoint. Everything else ranges from good to outstanding, even the recent “Meeting with Death”, despite numerous deviations from the book, which, I admit, is not a favorite, turned out to be surprisingly good thanks to its wonderful staging qualities, star ensemble performances and outstanding music, Back to After the funeral, production values ​​are fantastic. This is truly a cinematic sensation, and stunning photographs, magnificent scenery and costumes made it a visual feast for the eyes. The music was very exciting and even haunting, and the whole cast gave great performances. David Suchet is flawless, as always, as Poirot, and Geraldine James and Anna Calder Marshall are just as awesome. But for me, Monica Dolan was outstanding in the role of Mrs. Gilchrist; she was there with Donald Sumpter and Polly Walker as the best supporting actress / actress in the episode of Poirot, that's how well she played. In general, one must see, one of the best Poirot episodes to date, and one of the most faithful. 10/10 Bethany Cox
