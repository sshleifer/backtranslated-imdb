This film was a wonderful noisy, clever, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in odd places and great energy. The famous director (protagonist) and the events he is trying to manipulate in the film are entangled in exciting ways, since he is almost maneuvered by a prince who never heard of him. There are surprisingly rich images everywhere and proposed paths, but they do not follow (what exactly is happening with the gloomy wife of a pedestrian tourist wedding director?). The ending is all the better because it is untidy. Realism and logic are not what you should look for here. If we are going to turn our weddings and our creative lives into filmmakers, we should be ready for a wild trip, this film seems to offer.
