I read some grunts about court scenes. These people betray their ignorance. This production went to amazing lengths to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story took place. Exquisite manners are something that few outside the court have ever seen. While the action may seem very stylized, in fact, it is as close as possible to reproducing the behavior of people at their particular stations, as the director could have created. The actor's expression is a miracle, especially the two-faced Marquis Changsin and the Kingâ€™s mother. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a reflection of both the Greek and Shakespearean tragedies in the relationship between the king, his parents and his love. Comparing the king, moving from good to bad and the killer from bad to good, gives much food for thought about the evolution of the individual nature. In this film, one could reflect a lot on a liberal arts course in college. <br /> <br /> At the same time, he almost rushes forward, even in the slowest scenes leading to an inexorable junction. It is possible to suspect the involvement of large parts of the movements of the troops, which were quite surprising. In comparison, the scenes of the battles of the Lord of the Rings are pale. Few directors can literally put thousands of people on the battlefield for the sake of art. I recall one scene in which at least 30,000 soldiers are seen moving across a huge plain. Logistics for such a survey would be stunning. <br /> <br /> I could continue ... but simply, I cannot recommend this film highly enough.
