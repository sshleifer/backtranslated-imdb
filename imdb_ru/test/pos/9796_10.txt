Where should I start? I first watched this film in 1995 and had no idea what to expect, at the time I was looking for films that Elijah Wood starred in, and this film was highly recommended. I sat down and watched the movie once and did not know what to think. I watched it a second time a few days later, and the gateways just opened. Never before in my life have I ever cried when I watched a movie, and I screamed, every time I showed a movie I rode on an emotional rollercoaster. <br /> <br /> This struck an emotional chord in me on many levels, the intense sadness and delight that we see in the film, the miracle and innocence of childhood, longing for the time that was once, but no more. More than anything, this film reminded me of my childhood (with the exception of ill-treatment) during my life, when I dismissed my childhood a few years ago and did not even notice that I had abandoned it and passed on to a life completely devoid of it. The radio flyer made me wake up and suddenly realize that I had quit without even noticing it. From that day I immediately began to change my life and myself, and I did it. <br /> <br /> It will sound trite, but basically I rediscovered my inner child, I went on a path that has been going on for the last 6 years and has changed me so much, for the better, embracing and living this part of myself . I found out who I really am. I don’t think it was just a case in which the right movie appeared at a crucial moment in my life, Radio Flyer really did something very special, and I still think it is an incredible job in all respects, Incredible movie. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can not fail to mention the music. I'm a big fan of Hans Zimmer, and this is one of his best works. The sheer breadth and depth of the emotional expression he invested in this film’s account is a huge part of what makes the film what it is for me. Like a foreign language subtitle for a film, its floating music is a cheat sheet for the intense emotions that this film takes through you. To find the soundtrack at any cost, he, unfortunately, was deleted a long time ago, I never expected to find it, but I surprisingly found it by chatting with someone I met in the guest book of the Hans Zimmer fan site. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, allow yourself to experience emotions, do not get bogged down in a banal cavil to the final, be such a child again
