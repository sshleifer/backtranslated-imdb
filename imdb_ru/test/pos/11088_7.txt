Falcon and Snowman is the story of two young people, a CIA employee and a drug dealer who became disillusioned with US foreign policy and sold state secrets to the Soviet Union. The events of the film are based on a true story. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn convincingly play major roles and develop interesting characteristics. The auxiliary cast also gave a good account of itself, especially thanks to the performance of David Suchet from “Hercules Poirot” as an experienced Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> The film is usually effective in presenting its premise, developing and giving the sensation. Two boys caught something they did not understand when they went inside. However, it seems too long and cumbersome at points in the middle. The ending, however, is tense, awesome and effective. The soundtrack includes several catchy rock songs, but unfortunately, this is a repetitive soft synth track that does not fit into a spy story. There are other spy movies that are worth looking for more than Falcon and Snowman, but nevertheless it is a good movie.
