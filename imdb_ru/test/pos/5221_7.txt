“Father Hood” is a fascinating story about an unwitting father who is definitely HUD! Patrick Swayze plays Jack Charles, who is always in awe of one big "score", which is going to put it on an easy street. His wife died while he was in prison, and his two children were sent to foster families. When he "went out", he thought that they were probably better off in a foster family ?? besides, he still had to win his fortune. His daughter Kathleen Charles (wonderfully played by Sabrina Lloyd) comes from a foster family who abuses children and misappropriates the money that is supposed to be spent on children. She hunts down her father; tells him how bad the place was and what her brother, Eddie Charles (played by Brian Bonsall), "just a small 7-year-old child", was transferred to the institution from which she had just escaped and convinces his father to kidnap him . All three are going on adventures across the country, while Jack constantly tells himself that he needs to get rid of the children! Patrick Swayze is really good at this comedy, playing “the hood” (probably a little downplaying of this criminal character), who looks like his “Dirty Dancing” Johnny Castle, except that Jack in this comedy is funnier and more optimistic than johnny castle. Swayze is fun and rally does comedy very well! Halle Berry plays Kathleen Mercer, who is a reporter trying to understand the truth about the guardianship system that becomes Sawyer's ally. Diane Ladd plays Rita, a crook, Jack Charles's mother.
