We still love the movie and the Girl from the Valley soundtrack. I owned it on video for many evenings and raped the original soundtrack. I have a few friends that I meet with, and we have "Raves of the 80s" - the parties where we get together, play the music of the 80s and run "Valley Girl" on the big screen - and we all now thirty. We have a great time. <br /> <br /> It's all fun, you know?
