I saw this in the theater back in 1982. I was expecting a stupid T & A film. That's not what I got. <br /> <br /> This is mainly about three teenagers trying to have sex. We get the expected sexual jokes and scenes - but in fact they are pretty funny! <br /> <br /> Yes, they are stupid, but I still enjoyed them. In addition, there were unexpectedly many male nudity. <br /> <br /> Then the film, about halfway through, takes an unexpected dramatic turn when one of the boys (winningly played by Lawrence Monozon) falls in love with a girl. Then the jokes stop and everything gets very dark. I'm not going to part with what is happening, but I was very surprised by the sudden turn of events. The film raises some very important topics and considers them realistically and wisely. And he has a truly heartbreaking finale. <br /> <br /> I give him 10, because this is probably one of the best teen sex comedies / dramas. It mixes fantasy and realism together and works! What else do you want to ask? He also has a great soundtrack.
