I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival, in the family section. I'm not sure that any of my children really got this film, but I must say that it was a wonderful short film. <br /> <br /> Nostradamus and Me is an interesting short film about hopes and fears. that we all felt growing up in the 1980s, which in turn extends to what my children feel today. Then we had Regan, today we have Bush. Instead of Nuclear War, we have Terrorism. <br /> <br /> I really identified with the main character, and I myself met with Curehead in high school. We all felt that “nothing mattered” when we were 16, but it’s great to see a film in which they discover that everything matters !!! <br /> <br /> Again, I would probably not put it in the family section ... there were too many curses for younger children, but it was a wonderful and enjoyable movie to watch.
