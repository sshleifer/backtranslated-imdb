Eighty-one, as written and directed by Richard Bell, may have too many stories for a simultaneous 102-minute film to achieve complete success, but all the actors and film crews have such a wonderful sense of commitment that the viewer ends up wanting the film to work — and the way it is. Yes, aspects could be better if producers had more money to spend on the final version, but as a small independent film from Canada, this is a gentle, affectionately humorous, very touching story about vulnerability, communication and commitment. It works on many levels. <br /> <br /> In a very successful choreographic debut, we are voyeurs at a family dinner, where, obviously, something went wrong, and as a result, the father and two sons took off in a car and had an accident. in which one of the sons is killed. With this opening speech, the mood of the surviving 18-year-old son of Pip (Paul Anthony, who looks too adult to be believable as a teenager) forces him to leave his family and live on the streets. He meets Clark (Clarence Sponigla), a male prostitute who gives Pip food and shelter, Jenny (very good Carly Pope) who saves him from being beaten by her partner Derek (Ryan McDonell) and becomes romantically entangled with Peep and Father Chris (Alan Cumming ) in the subtle sympathizing role of the priest. This is Pip's 18th birthday, and his father (Serge Hode) is looking for Pip to give him a gift from his late grandfather with instructions that the gift should be opened for Pip's 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> Peep, although he drinks too much and is full of anger, lays a tape recorder, but keeps the tape and starts listening to the words of his grandfather Jason (voice of John McKellen), who remembers his 18th birthday in World War II in France, where he (now very sensitive actor Brendan) Fletcher) has experience working with a wounded doctor named Macauli (Marc Hildret, also great) and reflects on his one-day wedding with cabaret singer Hanna (Thea Jill from Queer as Folk, as well as a beautiful singer and actress here), just for the sake of something, ra What can you live during the war: Jason offers Macaulay help when he dies, with a beautiful redemption scene for two people at the end. Parallels Pipa and grandfather Jason interact each time Pip listens to the tape and leads Pipa to change his outlook on life and love. The scenes include Clark's isolated existence as a traitor to Jeff (David Beazley is in an amazingly good movie debut) who just wants to be loved; unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip; thanks to trust, Father Chris instills Pipa and Clark as a good shepherd and a memory of a car accident in which Pip could save his brother Daniel (Paul Dzenki) from being mistreated by his father, shortly before the accident, but could not do it, revealing his deep guilt and the resulting inappropriate anger reflected by his grandfather's taped experience. Each of these auxiliary scenes at the end unites, creating a sense of isolation for each of the people involved. <br /> <br /> In this film there are aspects that make it look like a big budget film: Bramwell Tovey performed by the participants of the Vancouver Symphony, Kevin Van Nikerka’s cinematography is successfully atmospheric, and the overall quality of this Canadian composition is very good. Although Paul Anthony copes well with his role, if he played a very young teenager in the lead role, the story would have turned out much better, and Richard Bell, who only has one more film, Two Brothers, in the resume promises young talent. watch. Despite the shortcomings, EIGHTEEN is a worthy film and deserves attention. Grady harp
