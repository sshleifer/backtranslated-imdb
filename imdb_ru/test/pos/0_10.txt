I went and watched this movie last night, when several of my friends persuaded me. I admit that I didnâ€™t want to see it, because from what I knew about Ashton Kutcher, he could only play a comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character Jake Fisher very well, and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. A sign of a good movie is that it can play with our emotions. This one did exactly that. The whole theater (which was sold out) was filled with laughter in the first half of the film, and in the second half was moved to tears. Coming out of the theater, I saw not only many women in tears, but also many adult men, desperately trying not to let anyone see how they cry. This film was great and I advise you to watch it before you judge it.
