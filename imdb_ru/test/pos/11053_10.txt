Garbo's first words in this 1930 film electrified the audience and became part of the Hollywood legend. Garbo became a star in her first American film Torrent in 1926. And the audience waited for this film to see if Garbo could go on to colloquial speech. She did. And while Paula Negri, Wilma Banky and Rene Adori were sidelined by their accents, Garbo sailed for another decade. Despite the spectacularity of this film, Garbo is really great, especially on the debut scene with the same great Marie Dressler as Marty. The two great stars exchange dirty looks and sharp words as they value each other, while they have a few drinks and set the tone for the rest of the film. Garbo was 25 years old; Dressler was 60 years old. With Charles Bickford, everything is in order, as with Matt, and George F. Marion - with Old Chris. Marion created this role on Broadway in 1922, and also played it in the silent version of 1923 with Blanche Sweet. This play by Eugene O'Neal is a real classic, but, oddly enough, it was never filmed again. Anna Christie is considered one of Garbo's greatest performances. And despite the film’s entertainment and the darkness of the story, it’s truly a miracle. Watch it for Garbo and Dressler!
