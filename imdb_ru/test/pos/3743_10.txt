Oh yeah! Hollywood really remembers how to use the good old formula, and when a lightning strike is a pretty wonderful feeling. Rarely, Hollywood creates a masterpiece, because lately it seems to be more worried about rushing and getting the most reward in a hurry, or there are too many cooks in the mix. Usually, good scripts are the result of a talented writer who fully controls his property, understands his material and is a good writer. In addition, there is a small, important part that marketing geniuses often neglect, who so often lack creativity and foresight: a good actor. <br /> <br /> A good actor can make the difference between a mediocre, half-prepared attempt and a fully realized film, which may not be an important and relevant film, but contributes to its genre and may eventually become classics of this type. We have very few romantic comedies, and we are people who crave them. In the sexual humor of "Sex in the City", Romantic but stormy relations of Big and Carrie are hidden, and people flocked to "Mamma Mia" because there was some kind of novel in it, skillfully played by Stripe and Brosnam. It could have been a stupid musical, but it really touched us because it was played with intensity and conviction. Nights offers us more, with the amazing talents of a woman who does a great job in romantic films, Miss Diane Lane. Since the time of her children's acting, we could appreciate how her talent, combined with her grateful soul, allowed us to look into the hearts of the main characters of the story. Several years ago, she teamed up with Mr. Gere, giving us a painful, romantic and sexual performance as a wife who is not too sure about the consequences of her actions in “Wrong,” the work that was supposed to bring her at least an Academic award. She returned, doing more labor-intensive work in this romantic gem, as a woman who was disappointed in her romantic perspectives, and suddenly she realizes that there may be another chance around the corner. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lane makes this film pulsate with intelligence and passion. Her facial expressions report volumes about the various emotions that her character is exposed to. We can read disappointment, longing, despair, anger, hope, loss, and the range that is the way out for many of the market types that Hollywood constantly puts pressure on our throats. This is a mature performer who has the gift of projecting real emotions and allowing us to connect with the material in such a way that we move when we become part of the experience. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lane is such a triumphant joy to watch as she goes through the transformations from the first scenes of the film to the very end. Her discoveries become ours when we celebrate with her the power of hope and love. She is able to bring back the unsurpassed joy of a man in love, like a teenager, and yet she never lets you think of her character as stupid or irresponsible. Her eyes are expressive pearls that can touch even cynical viewers. She is one of the stars that can work wonders with one glance. It returned the classic sensations of these great films of yesterday. Her work reminds of the passionate and clever work of Hepburn, Davis, Garson, women, who played everyday looks and made them unforgettable because they created complete characters. <br /> <br /> We admire those excellent actresses who recreate legends from real life and are rewarded for it. Half of their work is done by the mysterious characters they portray; however, no matter how you think, it is the roles like Lane’s roles in this film that are more impressive because they are created from scratch, have a personal imprint and are able to reach heights without any previous theatrical material support, for example and against the background of the famous legend, whose life pays homage on the silver screen. Lane's character is one woman whose experience can be any of us. She represents our dreams and emotions with great quality, class and just the right amount of mood. This is a rather remarkable achievement, and we should be grateful that we can still find such a wonderful performance at this time. <br /> <br /> There are several adjectives that I could use to pay tribute to her work, but I can only say that, in my humble opinion, every frame of her work in this film is evidence of one of the greatest performances ever put on a celluloid live performer. Thank you, Miss Lane.
