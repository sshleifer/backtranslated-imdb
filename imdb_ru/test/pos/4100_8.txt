As a movie lover, I obviously read all the painful reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favorite tip is Woody Allen, "If I had a life to live again, I would not change anything ... except to see a musical remake of "Lost Horizon"). So I could never watch it without a smirk from choreography / set / songs, etc. Just recently, I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in many years with a friend who had never heard of the film. reputation. He really enjoyed it, and after trying to get rid of all the negative prejudices that I obviously had with regard to the film, I did too. There is nothing particularly bad about Lost Horizon, and it is much more pleasant and watchable than many other films of the early 1970s. This is not even a particular camp. The lyrics of some songs are rather repetitive and simplified, but in fact it is not obvious when you first hear them or point out the flaws in advance, so you are ready to laugh at them. As for all the reviewers who claimed that the cast could not sing in unison, this criticism was falling apart because Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were duplicated (brilliantly, too, because the vocals match their voices), and Sally Kellerman is really beautiful and completely unique style of singing. Vocally, the Kellerman duet with Olivia Hassi on "Things I Won't Miss," is excellent. Special mention should be made of the brilliant performance of the legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer in the role of the Supreme Lama, and his comments about the fact that humanity is destroying itself are frighteningly suited to today's divided world. I would not say for a second that the “Lost Horizon” is a masterpiece (I would not miss this boring choreography and Bobby Wan’s “Question to me answer”, which could easily have been cut out), but if you hadn’t even seen “Lost Horizon” or have not seen it for some time, try to look without it “Oh, boy, let's laugh at this pile of garbage”, and you will be surprised at how pleasant it really is,
