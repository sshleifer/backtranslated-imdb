Maybe people like to have the devil more than God. Maybe we like this cause safety net; to make a mistake just to blame the devil for the pain and suffering in the world. There are so many difficulties to the masses that it is hard not to see the sadness on the faces that you go through. Leland P. Fitzgerald understands all this; he knows that maybe not everything will be fine, and perhaps helping someone leave this earth in order to avoid the pain that his life is waiting for is the risk that he has to take for the person he loves. Authors / director Matthew Ryan Hoge are grateful for creating lyric prose about two suburban families that intersected in good and bad times. If you look at the cast of almost all the actors from lists A and B, you can see that the material really resonates with its audience. Emotions do not need to be worn on the sleeve to exist. Sometimes all we want to do is put an end to suffering. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling brings a modest performance here that embraces the inside of his character Leland’s emotions. He is a very passionate and intelligent young man, cutting through the foundations of life, knowing what he sees, and perceiving the worst with the best. The film is a catharsis for the souls of those who suffered from the terrible event when Leland killed the mentally retarded brother of his former girlfriend. In the confused mind of this teenager, he enters the incident, knowing full well what he is going to do, he was going to stop the pain he sees everywhere, but most of all on the face of young Ryan Pollard. Almost immediately, he realizes that he made a mistake, that perhaps playing God is not the work that he is assigned to do on Earth. Whether this is true or not, will soon be discussed when the killing begins a series of events that finally bring meaning to the lives of many people when they awaken to the tangential fragility of life. This boy opened his eyes both to grief and rebirth. <br /> <br /> Ghost ballads performed by former frontman Sunny Day Real Estate Jeremy Enigka talk about the journey of small vignettes from the lives of two families in the aftermath of the tragedy. The game is gorgeous in everything, with a special mention of a few. For someone who plays a naive performance in most films, Chris Klein actually does well with almost the same material here, but also with the evolution to a single-minded person. His alienation is effective when used on the right side, similar to his election success, and I’m interested to see whether directors allow him to expand his talents and sink his teeth into something more substantial. Jena Malone is also effective in the same vein, fulfilling the role of restless youth, as in Donnie Darko and Life is like a home; Don Cheadle is an adherent of professionalism, which allows us to take a different look at the sympathetic psychotherapist in comparison with what he did in “Manic”; and Martin Donovan is great, like a grieving father trying to keep wit together and finally realizing that he must also prevent his family from falling apart. It is also great to see the beautiful Sherilyn Fenn in a small but important role. <br /> <br /> When a tragedy happens, people come together to go through it all. As Leland shrewdly points out one moment, you see how men and women help others and embrace when they see the pain and suffering around them, but after a couple of days everything returns to normal. Cheadle’s character extrapolates the optimistic view that, at the very least, we can see the true nature of people who want to help and be kind to each other, only to get a retaliatory blow to the cue: ". Maybe we do not want to think that we are good-natured, because it makes us feel that we should be good all the time, and that when it is bad, it should be, in turn, should be so. Being spoiled, we allow ourselves to recover and try again. Leland's mistake allows him to see the love he feels for his loved ones, and also to open his eyes to others, to wake up and not let his loved ones get farther from them. No one can focus on the sadness of others when they must first come to grips with their own. Hoge has prepared for this a parable and a truly effective film, which we hope will still appear.
