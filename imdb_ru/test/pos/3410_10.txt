One of the best! Being a fan of civil war, I was very pleased with the first release of the northern and southern trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Lesley Ann Down. Watching how this fairy tale unfolds in times that are never forgotten, objects of love, passion, grief, shame, harmony and cruelty come to life. I first met this series when I was in the eighth grade. As a young boy, you would think that I would not be interested in this soap of the civil war. To be honest, this story won the hearts of everyone in my class, and this is only the first book. I bought a novel and studied the likes and differences, and it was awesome. I am now 17 years old, and I still enjoy the story, characters, plot and remember the times of civil war. Being a film director of the future, I will always enjoy the North and the South: Book one.
