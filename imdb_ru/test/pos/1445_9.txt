Otto Preminger was one of the great independent directors. Like John Houston, he was a character in one of his films, like Mr. Houston, he was a wonderful ham that accidentally turned on and went out of the play, but the end result of his work was his unmistakable one. With a few exceptions, films are currently being produced by corporations rather than private individuals, and as a result, they are usually highly polished “packages” that in many ways resemble a golf ball, a can of dog food or a car. The involvement of people in this process is almost random. Such an appetite for the product lies in the fact that there is no end to the lineup of well-finished, glossy, externally entertaining, but ultimately empty films that fill countless TV channels and films. For a man like Mr. Preminger, there is no time to be a little away from the flow of the “product” and create a personal work of art. Of course, there was always the ethos "Art for Art - Money for Christ" in the film industry, but now "Ars Gratia Artis", in all respects, except for the name, was put at the forefront of history. Today Otto Preminger is lucky enough to get a job delivering pizza in Hollywood. Half a century ago, having made a very influential “Laura”, “Where the pavement ends” and “The Blue Moon”, he began filming the scandalous Nelson Algren's novel “The Man with the Golden Hand” in his eccentric and individualistic Instead of taking the camera outside , he stayed in the studio and used stylized, almost expressionistic scenery, fancy casting (Mr. Frank Sinatra - hot from his success in “From Here to Eternity”, young, inexperienced, but stunningly beautiful Miss Kim Novak and Mr. Arnold Stang, a man whose rannosti have been linked to his own heart) and a great era - defining assessment Elmer Bernstein with the cream of the West Coast jazz. The film Otto Preminger has always been a comprehensive experience that needs to be considered as a whole, and not to break it into acting, directing, photography. Preminger's vision, his creation and his interpretation of Algren's novel appeared on the screen, and not the film about Algren's novel - one of twenty competent Hollywood hacks. Starting with a hi-hat first strike on a plate accompanying the iconic title song of Saul Bass, we begin by saying that Preminger has taken on what is called “Life” in our day, in truth, a dark area occupied by fraudsters, drug addicts, police, drug dealers, stone players, jazz musicians, their women and hangers. The lines are blurred in Life, and there the dog eats the dog. Residents surround each other like sharks, looking for signs of weakness for exploitation. Frankie Machine (Mr. Sinatra) is a professional card dealer, a former drug addict and aspiring jazz drummer is a born victim. When things go wrong, he goes back to Eagle. Despite the fact that he refuses the habit of eating a cold turkey, there is absolutely no guarantee that he will not go directly to her further down the line. The image of Mr. Sinatra addict in the throes of abstinence divided critics, but the fact is that even fifty years later, most of us probably never saw it in real life, so we don’t know how accurate When I first saw the movie at the end 50, I was very impressed, recently watched it on the video, it would seem, to put it mildly, Hammy. Perhaps he became a victim of his own success, as many actors subsequently “made” a cold turkey, over the years, took his work and improved it a little. Arnold Stang is an outstanding friend of Sparrow, whose performance he surpassed only in "This is a crazy, insane, insane, crazy world." Try to watch it on the big screen and look at it as a cinematic vision of a real author, a giant among modern pygmies - Otto Preminger.
