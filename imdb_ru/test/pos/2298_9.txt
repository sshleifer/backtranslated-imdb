After reading more than just my review of a huge number of different films, I noticed a certain tendency, people judge what they expect to see sharply. I believe that if you go to the cinema in an open-minded way, not expecting anything specific, you will have better feelings for it than if you try to watch, but you have pre-created standards that you want to achieve. <br /> <br /> As I try not to be hypocritical, I watched this film from a very clean sheet and with an open heart and was very pleased. Since this is not a major title or reward in this regard, I did not know what to expect, but, in truth, I enjoyed it much more than the Ninja Scroll. Wonderful animation, deep history and always joyful hack n slash ninja very well combined with one of my favorite anime ever created. <br /> <br /> I do not promise that you will like it, but this is just a chance, and you can get a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> - “Before you speak, make sure that what you say will be more beautiful than silence” - a Chinese proverb
