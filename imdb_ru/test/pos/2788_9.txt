As a former Erasmus student, I really liked this film. It was so realistic and fun. This really lifted the spirit that exists among Erasmus students. I hope that many other students will also follow this experience. However, Iâ€™m wondering if people are interested in watching this film without international experience. But at least one of my friends, who never went to Erasmus, also liked it very much. I give it 9 out of 10.
