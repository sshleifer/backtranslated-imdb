One of my favorite Hartley movies. (As if it could be “bad.”) Although, it may be a little more religious things than we usually expect. Nevertheless, he still maintains the slope of Hartley to which we are all accustomed. <br /> <br /> First picture: Jesus and Satan discuss their ideas, opinions, hopes and regrets about the approaching end of civilization. Now imagine that the whole conversation takes place with a few drinks at your bar next door. And as an additional conversational (not to mention visual) distraction, let's throw in PJ Harvey as a sultry companion (aka Magdelen) to Mr. Chist. Then, just for the sake of a smirk, in the background is always the existing Salvation Army orchestra (played by Yo La Tengo), which serves as an additional diversion. The path to moral justification has never been such a pleasure. <br /> <br /> It is possible that there are more questions than answers, but this is where the fun lies. And Mr. Donovan, as always, is captivated by the brilliance.
