There is no denying it. Science fiction on TV is complicated. There are so many problems in this genre. I liked the need for a good budget, a competent letter, a decent acting game. Perhaps the budget and script writing are departments where I feel that most of the attempts failed. Is the "Surface" doing? Not completely, but more than most. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, a good science fiction show doesn’t really require a lot of computer graphics and doesn’t require a lot of money. What he needs is the ability to create a sense of more than life. The feeling that there is something more than it seems at first glance, something that makes me curious and want to try to understand how this will end. Add puzzle pieces and sometimes say "Aha!" this is what makes or breaks a show like that. <br /> <br /> Surface had several flaws. Firstly, its basic premise is not as exciting as it could be, nor is the revealed story as exciting (or audacious) as I had hoped at the beginning. In addition, TV sensations are present in most cases. Starting from a crappy CGI (from decent to terrible) to a rather changeable quality in the acting department. In addition, he sometimes feels too family-oriented, because sometimes he accepts the edge and becomes almost pleasant. But besides these drawbacks, this is a pleasant show. Perhaps not as impressive as some other fantastic shows. But I manage to keep me posted all season, and he also offers a couple of pleasant sensations between shows. The ending for me is not so attractive. I do not like shows that end without end, so to speak, leaving the story unresolved. This is especially regrettable in this case, because the show seems to be canceled after the first season (it has not yet been decided). <br /> <br /> For me, HBO is a benchmark for quality television. In their series, the best actors, the best production values ​​and, above all, the most solid letter. This is not an HBO quality, but it is good for what it is. Good enough to want another season without a doubt.
