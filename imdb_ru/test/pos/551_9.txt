Neitl Portman and Susan Sarandon play with each other like a symphony in this story of youth, who is sentenced to life for life as the daughter of one of the silliest women you have ever met play some of the most unusual characters and bring their humanity to the forefront of any film she makes. Being the mother of this obviously brilliant and future outside of her young girl, Sarandon alternates between being a mother and a child, with the ease of a ballerina. More importantly, she does it with force and flash, not stomping around the whole image of Portman's daughter. The question is always asked when we deconstruct the plot of the film, who changes? This film is, of course, about a daughter, but if you look at the dreams and sacrifices that your mother makes you realize that she is changing in step with her daughter. I bet it changes all of us in the audience. Distinctive feature of the beautiful drama
