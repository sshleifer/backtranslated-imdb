Before WWF became a caricature where Hulk Hoagan led the way, the events of WWF television programs at the very beginning of the 1980s resembled a wild, wild west with all sorts of grievances and violent acts of violence committed by some wrestlers who are known today to be WWF’s favorite stars. . Some of these seemingly very real moments stand out. Manic Sergeant Slaughter beat the then champion Bob Backlund when Backlund showed him at a fitness test. The Welts were everywhere, Backlund! Sarge made Iron Shiek look like a kindergarten! Slaughter also challenged anyone who could break his terrible grip on a cobra. This led a legendary and bloody match in the side street with commentator Pat Patterson. Hall of Fame member Blackjack Mulligan with Freddie Blassi came to the WWF with a claw claw that was censored on television. He claimed that he was a real giant at 6'7 "and challenged Andre long before the Big John Stud in 1984. Adrian Adonis used his sinister sleeping" Good Night, Irene "to take part in the competition. New Yorker dressed in black skin, he was an ominous figure. George “The Animal” Steele was far from pleasing the crowd. Even Jimmy Snook was a terrible sight when he expounded his main opponents until Ray “Crippler” Stevens brought the carrier onto the cement floor, leaving Snuka - bloody mess. All of these meetings took place in ten years before the hardcore fight ever talked about.
