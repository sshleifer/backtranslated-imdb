You really need to remember the Apes and have a clear idea of ​​where and how they fit into the second half of the 1960s in order to fully appreciate this film. <br /> <br /> There is no plot as such. In fact, this is a crazy mixed mix of different, unrelated sequences. But it is interesting and interesting in its own way, as soon as you get to its wavelength. In short, it was a classic, thoughtful and well thought out example of an experimental film of the late 60s. It contains some good songs, some ultra-cool cinema and many other useful ideas from the point of view of the film technique. <br /> <br /> I give it 7 out of 10 for several reasons. First, it took a lot of courage to make such an unorthodox film in the commercial mainstream, where both its stars and its producers were strongly supported at that time. If a feature film falls through at the box office, the consequences can be dire for all parties involved. Secondly, it was, for the most part, a creative success. And, finally, as already mentioned, this is certainly a classic of the genre and, as such, is now historically important. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the “Head” came too late in the career of the Monkees. But, again, they would not be allowed to do this before, because it was a very sharp and cynical satire of their own image. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the members of the group knew all too well that the entire Juggernaut of the Apes had almost finished their race when they began work on this project. In a sense, it was their swan song, and they were determined to let it all hang out. They are tired of being treated like simple pawns in a powerful corporate game in which they manipulated and exploited over the previous few years. In short, they “wanted to leave” and were going to say a few things before they left. <br /> <br /> History, however, confirmed the group. Let the critics be damned. Monkeys left behind some of the best, most polished and successful pop records of the decade. Yes, they had a lot of help. But in the end, THEY stood in front of the studio microphones, THEY watched movies and television cameras, and THEY did concerts. They were funny and a little crazy. But, unlike some of his contemporaries, they never threatened. Feel free to introduce the Monkey to your elderly aunt. <br /> <br /> The “head” probably borrows too much from the Beatles for a night of a hard day, but it’s still worth a look at those who were then or for younger retrofiles who can appreciate value. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
