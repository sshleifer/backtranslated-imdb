The historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. It has never been intended to be a serious story, but an entertaining saga, and there it succeeds. Errol Flynn was never better, as this role was especially for him. Olivia De Havilland has never been more beautiful. Arthur Kennedy is never more villainous. Anthony Quinn was never as noble as Crazy Horse. He had a lot of humor and pathos, and he aroused your interest. One historical aspect, which I found most obviously inaccurate, was the last “Last Battle”, which occurred on the shores of the Small Big Horn. The film version was filmed in the desert without a river. However, I still think this is an amazing entertainment typical of the golden age of Hollywood.
