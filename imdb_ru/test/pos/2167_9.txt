I'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (I don’t consider the budget of super-bugs and the Batman storyline either) <br /> <br /> A few of my favorite movies are “The Ghost” and the budget movie “The Destroyer.” Black Scorpio can be added to this collection. <br /> <br /> If you saw the Destroyer, then get this movie. This is basically a copy of this heroine. (In both films, even the same boys are shot). <br /> <br /> If not, let me explain ... the cop's father is murdered and she is looking for revenge. She will lace up a black outfit (sexy, feline, feminine, scanty outfit that looks great on Joan Severance) and come out to kick some prey. <br /> <br /> This is a fun, action-packed movie, mind you, you may not want the children to see it ... without looking at it first, to see if you approve of the pretty graphic sex scene that has Severance. Which, in my opinion, was a bonus (well, give it an extra star <smirk>)
