This movie is just great. I do not know why. I always have a weakness for Damian Chape. This is not a Scarface, but still I really enjoyed myself. I see this film more than ten times. He is really trying to make a good movie, but he just can't do it. I feel sorry for him, so maybe this is a voice of sympathy. I can't help it, but I just can't give it less than 9 stars. Everyone had to see it once in their life. To see how to make a cheap movie work. I live in Holland and bought this film for just one euro! This is 1.50 dollars. I would also buy it for ten euros. Great Great Great. On a small Dutch website, this film gets 101 votes. There are only 260. It is not much more. So people all over the world. Buy this movie!
