I think it was a pretty good movie. This shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful person, but unfortunately, because of his ambitions and the people around him, this led to his destruction. This shows that you cannot trust anyone, especially in a world that deals with a lot of money and envy. The character that I liked the most was Sebeva. She was another ambitious, powerful and ruthless woman in the world of men who loved and respected Kilo. She also knew that business was business and dangerous. Everything she did was risky, but did the job. She helped Kilo become rich through her connections. In general, I really liked this film, and it is in my collection and is waiting for El Padrino 2.
