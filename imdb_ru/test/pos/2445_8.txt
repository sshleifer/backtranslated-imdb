Outsiders are undoubtedly a classic Australian TV series. Clearly defined characters, complex scenarios, diverse and interesting locations, wonderful guest stars and a cinematic atmosphere - all together to make this series special. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Andrew Keir passed away and Sasha Hen from Germany does not seem (unfortunately) to enjoy the success of a small screen in his home country. The ABC has repeated the series many times, but the DVD release has not yet taken place. <br /> <br /> The series is eternal. Today, viewers have the same resonance as in our days. Come on ABC ... release the Outsiders to DVD !!!!!
