Although perhaps not as interesting as some of the Duke’s works, “Little Dieter” is another excellent film by one of the greatest artists in the world. In contrast to the usual themes of the Duke, "Little Dieter" is a fascinating and inspiring study of the character of a bold man and his attempts to continue living after a traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Dieter Dengler wanted to fly from an early age, and the Vietnam War gave him that opportunity, but instead of waging war in the cockpit, he spent most of that time at gunpoint. Dieter tells most of his history eloquently and passionately, occasionally resorting to the help of the Duke. During this time, Herzog voiced very little, but introduced many subtle sound effects and visual effects - which should not surprise those who are familiar with him. <br /> <br /> Dengler is a charming and extremely pleasant person. Despite the fact that they are alive and alive, I found that the story of his life and his hopelessly optimistic personality inspires. Thanks to the Duke for introducing him (re) to us. <br /> <br /> The scale of the film is not so large, and the drama is not as fierce as in many of the early films that caused the Duke to become reckoned with. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this to my fans and to those who love documentaries. This is a very interesting and well executed film.
