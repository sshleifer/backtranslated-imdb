Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I start? The years of hard work paid off in what is without doubt one of the best documentaries ever made. <br /> <br /> The kinds and sounds presented on the Blue Planet, like most Attenborough stamped documentaries, are rare and not even experienced by most people. This reason alone should be enough to buy this series, especially if you are a curious type who “wants to know.” <br /> <br /> However, the Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary. It gets a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode. How many ways can different sea creatures swim, kill, wet, mate and lay eggs, and is it really necessary to learn all these ways? But if you have a deep interest in marine life, this repetition should not be a problem for you at all.
