When I look at the “Boy next door” shorty, I have a bitterly sweet feeling. On the one hand, I am happy. I look at what was well thought out, flawlessly executed and bold enough to be interesting. On the other hand, I mourn the generally accepted level of comedy. Television and movies are so consistently filled with light, indulgent crap that we appreciate excellence on the scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who has no “benefit” from studio notes or a substantial budget; can create a really cool little comic gem. Producers and network claims should contact Travis Davis for materials and stop making deals with people simply because their resume or agent may require them to do so. We hope that the Boy-Next-Door attracted the attention of the right people to facilitate the work of Davis. It is really fun and very well done!
