This is a worthy movie. Although for me this is a little lack of time, during this period of time many actions, sand, common sense and emotions have been collected. Matt Dillon and the other main character do an excellent job in this film. Emotions and intensity were convincing and intense throughout the entire film. This is not the typical expensive Hollywood CGI action movie, but itâ€™s really a very nice movie for the price. My evening was wonderful because of this movie. This film is a traditional traditional action movie with great acting, history and direction. I would recommend this movie. The character development of the characters was good and makes you believe that they actually saw what was happening. Since this film, I believe, was made with a cheaper budget, the game and the quality were much higher.
