This is the best part of the underrated Kelly Martin. Based on a true story, he tells the story of Fusia’s attempt to save members of the Diamond family and other Jews whom she meets over time. One of my favorite scenes of the film is the heroic act of Fusia’s younger sister. All children should see this role model scene as it is very small and far from each other. The film is well written and shot. I am a movie lover, and in this film I rate 10 rated imbd. He is in my 25 best films of all time and should be filmed. <br /> <br /> Mike Porter
