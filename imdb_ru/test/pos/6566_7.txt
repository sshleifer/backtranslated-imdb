I recently saw several films from the Far East ... some were excellent (Battle Royale, Infernal Affairs, The Eye), and some were not so good (Versus, The Triple Cross). In addition, there are people like Uzumaki and Return, which, despite the shortcomings, I still liked them. <br /> <br /> The basic premise includes the mysterious and terrible effects that the spiraling obsession has on the community. Sounds silly? Yes, this is what I thought. First, good things. The direction was top notch, of course, in some places, but no less interesting and stylish. Secondly, the story was original and, like other writers, commented very lovelace-esq ... it was interesting. Most of all it reminded me of the early Cronenberg; films such as Schivers and Videodrome. <br /> <br /> The acting was not very good, but not too terrible. Honestly, I was really bored on several occasions ... I felt that the rhythm was especially a bit slow at first. My main problem was that it was too stupid and ridiculous to be a real horror, and yet not enough to be considered a comedy. * SPOILERS * below. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * Some good scenes (washing machine =)), and I liked the final shot / voice-over. At first I thought it ended too suddenly, but after about 20 seconds I understood the meaning and I liked the end. However, due to the lack of seriousness in the plot, combined with such major plots as the news report at school, I did not really care about the characters at the end. The final scene, which perhaps should have been a bit poignant, while in reality I could not take care of the girl or her boyfriend. * SPOILERS END * <br /> <br /> In general, I liked this film, but it upset me, and I think that in addition to some good scenes there was real potential. A couple of other moments: the main girl is pretty pretty and sweet, and the song that plays in the end is also good. I rated it 7/10. <br /> <br />
