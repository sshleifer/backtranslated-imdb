As it turns out, Chris Farley and David Spade starred in just three films (“Coneheads”, “Tommy Boy” and “Black Sheep”), but it was really “Citizen Kane” of their couples. Farley plays Thomas Callahan III, the stupid heir to an auto parts manufacturing company. His father Big Tom (Brian Dennehy) hires the moderate Richard Hayden (David Spade) to look after him. Big Tom is getting married to the “top ten” (Bo Derek), so everything should be in order. After the sudden death of Big Tom, Tommy and Richard have to try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy. Since then, the film has become an excuse for Chris Farley to do what he does best: to mess things up. <br /> <br /> When this film first came out in theaters, I saw it with my Grandfather. He realized early on that the characters of Bo Derek and Rob Low hide something. But you can completely ignore it and just bask in the antics of Chris Farley. Nothing is insured around his belly, and hell has no rage as his nonchalant attitude. The scene where he sets fire to the car, and then the deer scene, turns into a violent laugh. Chris Farley and David Spade were really John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd of his era. It's nice to always be able to think about “Fat Man in a Small Coat” over and over again.
