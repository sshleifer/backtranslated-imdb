Well, guys, here's the deal with this movie. This is not the best, but for all of you children of the 80s, it will bring pleasant memories of your childhood. Personally, I love this movie. I still love rainbow bright and caring bears. so in my opinion, if you are not a child now or were a child who loved and / or loves a rainbow bite, you will not like this film at all
