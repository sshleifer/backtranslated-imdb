I thought this movie was really good. This ends up by showing the viewers that Leila was supposed to save what she had. Leyla was bored with her husband Jim, who was more worried about work than about her. He was so passionate about his business that he forgot their anniversary. He was also very casual. She couldn't take it anymore, so she left to see if he would miss her. The film shows that he misses her, he even tries to catch up on the lost night. He goes to her and tries to bring her home. In the end, she finds another man named Schuyler. He seemed like the man she always wanted, neat and notices her. In the end, she seems to foreshadow when he looks at Schilers â€™shoes and how he let cigar ash fall to the floor, like Jim did the same. Jim ends up making a lot of money and tidying up. In the end, Leila thinks that she should leave her husband, because that's all she really wanted, and he changed.
