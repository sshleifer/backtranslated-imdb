"Planet" - an amazing part of the film industry. For only £ 8,000, production has long been one of the most original science fiction films. <br /> <br /> Starring the physically awesome Mike Mitchell, the film is a mixture of great special effects, strong story-telling and well-planned actions. Starting from the battle in outer space and ending with the finale, everything in this film goes beyond its budget. <br /> <br /> Let's start with special effects, although they are certainly not the standard “Revenge of the Sith”, they are included Level, if not higher, like Babylon 5 and Farscape. And for a small price. The details and the movement are excellent and captures the imagination from the very beginning. The design of everything, ships, weapons, entities is unparalleled. Imagination and creativity are a real surprise for a movie with such a budget. <br /> <br /> Another surprise was the power of the plot and the arc that he needed. There are several twists, most of which are well written in the script, amazing and well played. I was surprised that in two years of work and for the first time I imagined 15 years ago how relevant some aspects of this history are for modern society. With events around the world, a certain resonance may arise with the lengths that mercenaries have to go to in order to survive. <br /> <br /> Even sound effects are noticeable, as is atmospheric music. The use of light and costume complements the professional look. Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen looks like a deserted and lonely place. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film looks 10, if not 100 times the budget, and this shows a creative, hard-working team of people from the director, actors, effects through the producer and the sound team. Wonderful effort, I recommend that you get a copy as soon as possible.
