Dexter (Kurt Russell) returns from The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes for a new adventure that can be left alone. Dexter, ever a college student prone to an accident, has the idea of ​​a formula that will make things invisible. Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn) is less than impressed and hopes to win a science prize with a bee disciple. However, the bees burn the pupil and he is allergic. There is an IT chance of winning. But wait, Dexter does it! He actually composes the fluid that makes him invisible. The problem is that an unscrupulous businessman (Cesar Romero) finds out about this and decides that he can use this formula, thank you, for something illegal. Can he steal a bottle from under Dexter's nose? This is a companion film for TCWT, but you don’t have to watch the first film to enjoy it. Russell is a genius leading failure that passes when it really matters. The rest of the cast is also a dream, with Flynn, Romero, Jim Bacchus and others showing why their comic abilities are still highly valued today. The script is just an innocent fun, charming, with special effects, somewhat simple, by today's standards, but, nevertheless, effective. If you want to sit down and experience a bygone era, or simply share a high-quality G-rated movie with your family, this is a great choice. Although he is more than 30 years old, it’s likely that even now you will see your loved ones giggling with the blues while showing this beautiful film.
