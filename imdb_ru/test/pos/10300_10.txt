Outside, this film is better thanks to Vincent D'Onofrio (Law and Order: Malice), but this film is equally good as the 1982 version. In a sense, the 1999 version is better because it is more modern (a decade compared with 27 years). The actors in this film were great, like Terry Kinney (McManus from Oz, HBO) as James Daley and Tony Shalhoub. (Monk from the USA) and Gary Sinise (CSI: New York). Obviously, the dialogue for the modern audience has been changed, but most of the writing remained the same. There were things that were not in the 1982 version, which gave a push to the drama and comedy, but in the end, this film was as great as it was in 1982. Character: Vincent D'Onofrio played by Phil Romano, was excellent, better than Paul Sorvino. This is a coincidence between Stacy Keach and Terry Kinney in terms of James. As for George, I would praise Shalhoub. And between Martin Sheen and Sinsiz in the role of Tom, I would say that Sinise is winning.
