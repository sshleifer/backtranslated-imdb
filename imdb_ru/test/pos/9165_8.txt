The Italian concept of “sprezzatura” consisted in grace and carelessness in social manners, which led to success in love, as described in the 16th century “Court” manual. The film "Autostop" is worth a look at the embodiment of the concept of "sprezzzatura" in the dynamic performance of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Smith plays Alex Hitchhiker's character, Hitchens, who is a professional dating consultant. those who lack luck and confidence. The best scenes are when Hitch trains the painfully shy and unscrupulous Albert in his quest to win the heart of the New York socialite and in Hitch's own attraction for Sarah and a surprise during her visit to Ellis Island. In these scenes, Smith is supported by the good work of Kevin James and Eva Mendes. But this film is based on Smith’s charisma and attractive personality. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, Smith rises above the usual humorous script to make "The Coupling" an extremely watchable and entertaining film. I do not believe that today another actor is working, able to convey the charisma and the perfect time with such comic moments as Will Smith in this film. And his secret is in "sprezzatura"!
