I expected a lot from this movie and I can say that I was not disappointed. First of all, this film, as a world tour of winemaking, will allow the viewer to enjoy the beautiful places. The people interviewed are also very interesting and funny, in particular Hubert de Montil. Shooting can be confusing, the camera is always unstable and often focuses on the background background elements. You may not like it, but I do not consider it a disadvantage. <br /> <br /> The topics covered in the film can also be quite confusing, since globalization is not the only problem discussed. But Nossiter was able to bring consistency to his film from the very beginning. The great achievement of this film is the disclosure of all the characters of the wine industry as they really are, avoiding the good vs. evil cliches. This may be the main difference of the documentary film "Mondovino" from Michael Moore; Nossiterâ€™s point of view appears subtle, through the opinions of his favorite characters. The richness of this documentary relies mainly on the characters, the history of long-standing wineries, such as De Montilles, Mondavis, Antinori and Frescobaldi. Nossiter allows the viewer to discover that wine is somehow related to families, and not just as a business or industry. This film does not make you want to drink wine, but it certainly makes you want to discover vineyards and winemakers. <br /> <br /> I watched this film as a student in enology, and let's just find a lot of ways to teach. I give this documentary 10 out of 10, despite its technical features.
