I totally disagree with other comments! I also saw this film at an early show and found it quite enjoyable. Robin Williams in great shape. True, the tone is familiar, but this is Williams from Good Morning Vietnam: smart, funny, in fact. After too many dark turns, Williams finally returned to what he did best. Supporting actors give excellent performances, especially Laura Linney and Chris Walken. Chris plays himself as usual, but as an “agent” for the next president he was fascinated every time on the screen. Lewis Black plays mostly only himself, but he is beautifully used here. There is also a funny turn of Jeff Goldblum. The film is not just what the trailer offers. The film is funny, but it is not a pure comedy as suggested. It has a bit of a thriller line that everyone should seriously consider, especially if you pay attention to the newspaper.
