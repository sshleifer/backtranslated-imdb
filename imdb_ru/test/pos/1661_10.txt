There are not many films that I would call perfect, but Rififi definitely meets all the requirements. No other predatory film approached him either before or after. The plot is simple, but it captures you. It never ceases to amaze me how exciting the film is every time you watch it. You take care of all the characters, even if they are bank robbers, because they are presented as people with all their problems and shortcomings. It’s hard to imagine another actor other than Jean Serva in the role of Tony le Stefanua. When each member of the team talks about what they’re going to do with their money and finally get to Tony, his answer and his expression speak about everything. While the 30-minute sequence of robberies is the most famous part of the film (and rightly so), the film actually gets better after that. Directed by Jules Dassin, he knew what he did when he decided not to have any music during the scene of the robbery or finale. a shootout, but instead put in an excellent score during Tony's last trip to his fate. If you think that if Dassin, an American director, was not blacklisted in Hollywood and was not forced to work in France, this masterpiece of cinema would never have become what it was. Of course, it would not be so good if it were shot as an American film of that time. It was absolutely terrible that Dassin had to survive, but thanks to him he achieved his greatest work for the benefit of all of us. I'm just cringing at the thought of the upcoming Al Pacino remake. Most films with robberies, starting with Rififi, are already somehow borrowed from him. There is no reason to redo this masterpiece, except money. Leave the classics alone!
