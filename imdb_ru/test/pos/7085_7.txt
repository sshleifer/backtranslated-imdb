One True Thing puts Zellweger in the midst of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to take care of her dying mother (Strip). Dark and foolish, the film explores how an adult child reconciles with the adult gaze of its parents, as they gradually unfold as less than the ideal she grew up knowing as a child. "OTT" offers an excellent study of the characters and the search for objects with minimal flaws. He offers three excellent performances by a trio of leading actors and a few plaintive thoughts about life and death.
