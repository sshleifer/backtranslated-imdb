This is probably the second best film about the movie "Death Wish." Death Wish 5 is the best. <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 reminds me of West Side Story with a new twist. Even the recent Gangs of New York cannot compare to one New York quarter in Death Wish 3, which suffers not from two rival gangs, but from one big gang. A gang that is ready to do something, for example, to kill a man to death with an ax, if he breaks the rules of his life. <br /> <br /> Deborah Ruffin, who plays a public defender, gently plays in this exciting film filled with great violence in shooting. So, as Jerry Nichols in “Death Desire II”, “Death Desire III” amazes with its tender, romantic moments and cruel moments. Only scenes of love interest in James Bond could be much better. <br /> <br /> And in addition to his .38 Kersi playing with this new weapon called Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of the films “Dirty Harry” when Callahan used his .44 Magnum in the movie “Magnum Force”, “Sudden Impact” and “Dirty Harry”. Wildie's gun deals a big blow, and when Kearsey kills him, he doesn't care if there is a big blow in him. <br /> <br /> And this anti-tank missile that killed the leader of the gang? Well, this is something. Quersey will not use an anti-tank missile as his usual weapon ... this is too military for him.
