Unusual, revisionist western, worth seeing. Despite the slow start, is the movie building ?? almost without dialogue and without subtitles ?? an increasingly exciting and intense, almost existential portrait of life in the harsh conditions of the western desert. The growth of the main characters is worth the wait, and a strong central composition instills a real sense of despair in the struggle for the possession of the most important horse. How interesting that a British director did it. I hope he smiles now: I got the impression that the film was largely ignored by his contemporaries; but time works in its ordinary alchemy, and hidden gold shines as it inevitably should. One note stuck to me: revisionism just arrived. Sam Waterston as an Indian? - Of course, he plays his part with real emotions and energy, but can not an American Indian actor be found? But his scenes with Carolyn Langrish have an affinity that contrasts beautifully with the vast landscape around them. <br /> <br /> Forget about big, bankrupt Hollywood versions of the past, men with big chins and spinning music; It's all about the primeval struggle of the main characters, who, deprived of all the attributes of "ordinary" life, come to understand what it is worth fighting for. Impressive.
