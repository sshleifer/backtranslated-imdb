This three-hour epic (it seems much shorter) explores the will to power and conquest and the contradictory motives that underlie this quest by tracking two parallel lives: Emperor Qin, whose desire to unite Chinese feudal states is based on noble goals, but turns into violent oppression isolation and absolute powerlessness; and Jing Ke's killer, a mercenary killer who finds out about the unintended consequences of a murder and finds a form of salvation. Like all great art, this can be understood on many levels. The film summoned for me the images and ideas of Homer, Euripides, Machiavelli, Shakespeare and Freud. <br /> <br /> The story itself is true (I checked it on britannica.com!), Therefore, this movie will appeal to history buffs. Ironically, Qin spent most of his last years in a vain search for immortality (not shown on the screen, but consistent with the plot). <br /> <br /> The film can also be seen as an allegory of Maoism and the cultural revolution. Thanks to the film, one can understand that the last 50 years of Chinese history have had their precedents in the last 3000 years. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for the audience, these complex ideas are developed in a film that is rich in images. , action and pagent. Battle scenes alone are worth the price of entry.
