Our Sex, as a ghostly guard in this, is more terrible than most of its faces with fur and shoes. The story is not something unfamiliar, a group of children is going to a party at an abandoned school. The fact is that one of the fathers of these children did the same thing a few years ago, but now he is dead, and the last group of children seems to be experiencing an event 23 years ago. It's pretty well done for films of this type, and there is something mysterious about what is happening, because, obviously, what happened to the children before is something of a mystery and perhaps the truth has not been revealed. So no, not just your standard piece and bones. This moves a pretty good clip and does not allow you to lose interest, as many films do, and the strange story is convincing enough to interest you, and there is some uncertainty that many films lack in these days, The ending is quite sharp, and I guess that this is mainly for your imagination, but, again, it did not go unnoticed. 7 out of 10, check it out.
