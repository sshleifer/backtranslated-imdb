Despite all the comparisons with the House of Frankenstein, this film is superior to its predecessor and is one of the funniest monster films in the Universal Monsters series, and, unfortunately, the last. Good. so it's not quite like Frankenstein's Bride as a classic revered by fans of all films, but you can't help with the actors Dracula, The Wolfman and the Frankenstein's monster (What? No, mommy?) this schlock fest! And unlike the House of Frankenstein, the monsters in this film interact much more. But this film also offers some unique storylines for both Dracula and Wolfman, which both turn to Dr. Adleman for a cure for their suffering. Although Wolfman does find medicine, Dracula injects his blood into the doctor, and then the real fun begins! I highly recommend this movie to fans of classic horror movies. But remember, I never said it was good, just fun.
