This film changed the art of filmmaking, telling a complex story in new ways. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy, mixing modern war with strange scenes full of technical smoke. In the film, music is used not as a score set out later, but as a practical part of a scene played with speakers, radios, etc. Coppola uses classic literary material as inspiration, taking scenes and characters and putting them in a completely different environment . This is a cunning and courageous act. Then he takes a superstar, Brando, pays him a fortune and takes it off so you can barely see his face. The pure courage that such a step requires is astounding, and it works great. This film is in the top ten.
