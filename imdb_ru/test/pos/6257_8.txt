* Minor Spoiler * <br /> <br /> Dwelling is not scary, but creepy. This is an interesting "little" story with a good acting game and great makeup with special effects. <br /> <br /> Main story: a little girl blames strange things happening in her familyâ€™s new home and the theater accompanying them as fabulous friends. <br /> <br /> The film does not waste time moving, although the final could be more difficult. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film to those who expect / want terrible horror, but I recommend it to those who want a chiller and not necessarily a thriller.
