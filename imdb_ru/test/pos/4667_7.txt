Italian work requires bright hours and experience is required. This is a great matinee and a good day at the cinema. The plot is good, but the actual reproduction of the plot is very simple and does not require a thinking process. These are car chases, explosions and everything for a simple goal - to defeat the “bad guy” played by Edward Norton. It seems that for Norton he is pleased with the image of the same characters as in his previous films, such as “The Score”. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve the best scenarios. Warning: if you saw the trailer, then you saw the movie. If you are looking for entertainment at affordable prices, then you need an Italian job.
