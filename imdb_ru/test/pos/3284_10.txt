First of all, ignore the comment about how South Park should make fun of Republicans. Everyone is doing it now, why should South Park blindly follow what other media are doing? And what Republicans are doing is more serious and less ridiculous than Al Gore and his hysteria about global warming. <br /> <br /> But, among other things, this episode is just fun. The image of Al Gore should be one of the best caricatures of a politician I have ever seen, it was original and based on people's opinions about the person. I do not want to give anything, but it made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> There are also some of the best moments in Cartman / Kyleâ€™s life. <br /> <br /> All In all, I would say that this is one of the best episodes in the history of the show, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
