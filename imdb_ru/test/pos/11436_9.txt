This is a wonderful new film, which is still shown in the cinemas of my country. Its director, Calabrian Gianni Amelio, in my humble opinion, is perhaps the only modern Italian director, along with Nanni Moretti, who deserves the title of great (that is, except for old masters who are still nearby and occasionally still produce films). This is one of my biggest regrets about the fact that modern Italian cinema has been sick since the mid-70s, mainly due to the acute lack of funding and education of new talents, which can be transferred to most areas and which makes Italy one of the most static industrialized. developed countries of our time in terms of production (in both the industrial and cultural sense) ... unlike, say, China. And this, by the way, is the theme of Amelio’s last film. Few directors can talk to me about the true, current state of my country and the world, as Amelio does, but his paintings also have precious timelessness and versatility. And for those who are already worried that they can be slow, heavy and worthy - be sure: of those that I have seen, they are certainly not, at least, if you are accustomed to high-quality European cinema. <br /> Main plot plan: Vincenzo Buonavolonta is a technician at a factory of obsolete steel mills somewhere in Italy, probably in the north. He is played by Sergio Castelllitto, one of the most versatile and talented actors of modern Italy. When a large Chinese steel company acquires a piece of industrial equipment from an Italian steel plant, Vincenzo, who is trying to deal with a non-Italian-speaking Chinese director, tries to tell him that the machine is faulty and its converter needs replacing, the element he is working on creating custom. He warns them that failure to comply with this requirement can have very dangerous consequences. Meanwhile, a young Chinese woman named Liu Hua acts as a translator between the two men, but seems to be struggling to find adequate translations for some technical terms of Vincenzo. As a result, the Italian loses her patience, actually pushing her aside and asking her to give him the Chinese-Italian dictionary so that he can translate. <br /> <br /> Despite Vincenzo’s warnings, the next morning he finds that the director of a Chinese factory and his staff returned to their country, not listening to his advice regarding the adequate use of industrial equipment. Thus, Vincenzo, armed with his great honesty, is sent to China. And here begins the endlessly fascinating road film in China, the very current “Odyssey of the 21st century” in the “Asian Giant”. Looking for Marco Polo in recent days for the mysteries of a mysterious nation? Not really. As with all Amelio films, the journey itself becomes much more important than fulfilling its ultimate “mission” or not. In fact, the way the point of view literally returns home, not without a touch of humor, is a wonderful, sharp paradox and irony that made my eyes heal while I was smiling at the same time. The viewer reveals the secret that Vincenzo’s trip was ultimately completely useless, but he himself doesn’t know this and a happy man is going home, a deceived innocent man. At least you think he is happy. Somewhat. <br /> <br /> Travel in which the heroes of Amelio make attempts to completely eradicate them and deprive them of the most necessary, human being. For a moment, they have no name, no status, no one who could say a word to them. These themes, like Theo Angelopoulos, are also explored in Lamerica, actually my favorite film Amelio, followed by Stella Che None Che in order of personal preference. In the 1994 film Lamerica, two Italian racketeers travel to Albania to "go into business." Just like Vincenzo, they are going to go there, do what they must, and then return home. Instead, one of these two Italians happens to be on an almost Homeric journey across this desolate land immediately after the fall of communism. <br /> <br /> But let us return to La stella che non c'è: once Vincenzo in China, he, as expected, discovers that the seemingly “simple” task of transferring the converter to its new owner is not at all straightforward. It seems that it is almost impossible to determine the new location of the car, unless it goes on a difficult journey through China. When he meets Liu Hua, a young translator with whom he mistreated, now works as a librarian, he tries to talk to her, but she reacts with hostility, telling him that because of him she lost the job of an interpreter in Italy. Played by relative newcomer Lin Tai, Liu Hua soon becomes Virgil for Dante Vincenzo when she reluctantly believes she could do worse than act as a guide and translator for an Italian on his trip (obviously, for a fixed amount of money). This young Chinese actress may not have either the beauty of Ziyi Zhang or the glamor of movie star Gong Li, but her charming, expressive and beautiful face exudes a combination of daring strength, intelligence, dignity, and wry humor that will complicate her features. forget as soon as you see the movie. In addition, she and Castellitto have excellent emotional chemistry as colleagues. <br /> <br /> Amelio weaves dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realistic and funny at the same time, while retaining the warmth of the soul to explore the fleeting essence of humanity in everyday, ordinary circumstances. The naturalness of such a documentary hides what is in fact an elaborate tapestry with faces and places, a perspective that also manages to include cinema of stunning beauty. The photo here is functional, but gorgeous, as in the film about displaced people in the industrial and emotional wasteland. <br /> <br /> Amelio’s observant gaze is an adult, frustrated, but never cynical and not misanthropic person. Skillful camera angles also often give Vincenzo aloofness in the eyes of the Chinese, returning a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality, which is very rare is found in films about a "familiar" western man exploring a "unfamiliar" non-western country. I can not recommend this movie enough.
