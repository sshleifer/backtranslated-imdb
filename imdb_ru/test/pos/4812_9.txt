If you are familiar with the work of author Johnny To and his group of filmmaker friends in the Milky Way, you know what to expect from this latest production. All the familiar elements are in place: a strong camaraderie between two characters: usually a policeman and a villain, coincidences and chances, which include a dime and generously pay off at the end, and humor, which occurs even in the most difficult situation. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau plays a man who has 72 hours left to live and decides to rob an insurance company. Lau Ching-Wan (also brilliant in other Milky Way films such as “The Longest Night”, “The Hero Never Dies” and “Where the Good Man Goes”) portrays a negotiator / policeman who stands on the back of a robber, even when a series of tricks and tips he must follow in order to get his man. <br /> <br /> Funny, sharp and cool, despite its refinement, “Running” is actually one of the most interesting Milky Ways films to date. Do not miss the performances of the two leads, especially Andy Lau, as a rule, is considered the average actor, who is rarely so natural and fun to watch. This movie is one of those to watch.
