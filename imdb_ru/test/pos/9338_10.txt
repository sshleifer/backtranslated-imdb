Without a doubt, this is the biggest mom of all music videos !!! Unlike most music videos that are either “dance videos”, poorly recorded and / or badly interrupted lyrics, this was done correctly. Jackson was a co-author and, according to the testimony of VH1, strongly choreographed and directed this masterpiece. In fact, you could say Thriller is worse than most horror movies with this latest sparkling eye. For me, this music video is what you judge from all the other music videos. You can easily see the ominous influence that M.J. had an early breakdance with the number of the march of zombies. Because of the dance, comedy, plot, and, yes, horror. I give it 5 out of 5.
