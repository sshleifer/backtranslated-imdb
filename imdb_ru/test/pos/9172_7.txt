Although the concept of “doctor on a date” is the only thing that saves this film from the usual romantic comedy with a standard plot for the genre, I found it pleasant enough to raise my opinion about it, so I ended up enjoying it much more than if it was just a mediocre conspiracy without many turns. Will Smith, as always, does an excellent job with the role of Hitch, the man who devoted his life to advice for men, how and how not to defeat women ... since he failed in trying to keep his girlfriend from college. There is a lot of laughter when he tries to help his latest overweight patient, the awkward asthmatic Albert Brennman (Kevin James), to successfully look after the wonderful employee Allegroy Cole (Amber Valletta). In addition, when he decides to spare the woman he meets at a turkey bar, who seems to simply not understand that she does not want him around, he discovers that he is attracted to Sarah (Eva Mendes) - this seems like a big deal for him, so I think that since college he never practiced his own rules on himself. Unfortunately, Sarah is a gossip columnist who is interested in “doctor dating,” who, along with Allegra, appeared to have a seemingly daring boy like Albert — especially after player / moron Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan) broke her best friend's heart ( Julie Ann Emery) and hints that the doctor he saw is disgusting to him when she does not understand that he refused to see him. However, the problem follows, and Hitch is stuck wondering what to do with his own relationship, and he has not given any great help to Albert when he tries to figure out what else needs to be done in his relationship. The game is good, there is a lot of humor and some other subtleties with meaning. The Hitch character is witty and wise, sometimes he manages to be at the same time. True, a misunderstanding when a woman is offended because of something that a man really did not do (why do they always show it?) How common and annoying - I think it would not be if it were the 1st, not 5 i time i saw it - but the rest were brand new. I only wish this film was longer - I remember I could watch 3/5 of it when he once played on TV in a restaurant - but I still approve. It is definitely worth the money to pay for its brevity.
