What, ho! It is very good. I speak very well, old man. Or should I say "bob"? My knowledge of British terminology is a bit dusty. In any case, my biker boots and I entered this show without prior experience viewing Wallace and Gromit. I am pleased to report that my shoes and I came out happy to have met them. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that they are not as accessible to adults as Toy Story, W & G still manages to be smart enough to provide adults with a little humor that will surely soar over the heads of young adolescents who too busy griffing in burping a werewolf rabbit to realize that something is wrong. I strongly recommend that you pay close attention every time you see books or words on the screen, because there are quick glimpses of words that you will miss if you don’t pay attention to it. My favorite monster book, which calls the Loch Ness monster "tourist trapp". If you ever knew what you were saying, “I can really communicate with Kevin Federline,” or if you're just illiterate, you not only miss these jokes, but you should probably take the time to learn to read. to go to the cinema. Consider it a public announcement. <br /> <br /> The most impressive aspect of W & G is its clay animation. Thanks to the tedious process, it took FIVE YEARS to complete the film! According to press reports, there were some days when the optimal goal was simply to perform 10 seconds of the finished film. People, I sometimes have trouble finding the motivation to end up responding to several emails or add captions to photos for my reviews (a point of view that is confirmed by the lack of images in this review); therefore, I cannot even imagine that it takes patience. <br /> <br /> I really like the coarse practical quality of clay figures. The fact that you can see fingerprints in clay is a pleasant, personal touch. How can you not be impressed by clay characters that show more expression and emotion than Paul Walker and Keanu Reeves combined? The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, as director Nick Park calls it, the world's first vegetarian horror film, which should entertain both children and adults. Relying (and as a man who is proud of his shaggy, bearded masculinity, I do not dare to use this word) cute and (oh, damn it, I probably should not use this word) attractive characters, not outdated MS. According to Hammer, W & G is proof that DreamWorks can create entertaining animation when it chooses a trick, not a cheap joke.
