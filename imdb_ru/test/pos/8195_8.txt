This is a great movie. No, this is not Mel Gibson in Braveheart, but it is not. In fact, The Emperor and Assassin probably has (fortunately) more in common with Shakespeare’s production than with a Hollywood blockbuster. <br /> <br /> In the third century BC, King Qin tries to unite (in other words, "conquer") the seven kingdoms of China. He has already overthrown the Han kingdom. Now he needs a reason to invade the Kingdom of Yang. <br /> <br /> It is here that Lady Zhao enters. She and the King have been friends since childhood. They obviously love each other very much, but cannot marry for political reasons. Together they come up with a plot. She will pretend that she fell out of favor with the king and flee to Jan. Once there, she will convince Prince Yang to send the killer back to kill the king. When the murder fails, the king will have a reason to invade Jan. <br /> <br /> However, once in Yang, Lady Zhao begins to reconsider. Hearing and seeing more and more examples of the relentlessness of her old childhood friend, she begins to think about whether to really kill the king. <br /> <br /> One sure sign that you are not watching a Hollywood production is the final meeting between the king and the murderer. Unlike the Hollywood film, in which the hero and the villain are clearly defined, and the final result is already predetermined, this is a fight that can really go in any direction. <br /> <br /> This is a well thought out and well thought out history of a turbulent history. time in the history of China. This is a mixture of incredible beauty and incredible disgrace. However, the most beautiful of them is Gong Li in the role of Lady Zhao. Each time, I become increasingly convinced that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world. <br /> <br /> However, I must say that in this film she has one unintentionally funny line. Early Gong Li asks one of his servants: “I have a beautiful face?” <br /> <br /> Spirit !!!
