Elmer again faces a dilemma of who to shoot. Duffy's mistakes. He's not sure what time of the year it is, and the Bunny and Duck argument doesn't matter. Although Bugs proves that he is again the smartest, repeatedly using Duffy's reverse psychology in more and more subtle ways. And when it ends, he makes his signature clothing for sneakers. Duffy goes crazy and demands that the rabbit be shot. Although Elmer is too stupid, he is hopelessly in love with a bunny girl. Elmer is really to blame for all this. If he had not been so stupid, he would have known that it is REALLY this season of a duck and just blow Duffy. But poor old Duff cannot believe the total absurdity of the situation. His cruel plans of wrong direction were thwarted by Elmer's dumbness. Duffy is so shocked that he even goes home with Elmer to be blown up in his living room. <br /> <br /> Poor Duff. He taxis!
