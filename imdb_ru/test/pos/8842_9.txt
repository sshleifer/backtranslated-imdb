"The Thing" is the best John Carpenter movie. Combining his talents in creating tension and upheaval with decent production value, he has become a superbly designed sci-fi horror film. <br /> <br /> Removing in really difficult conditions, it creates a very plausible isolated research base, which sets the tension. even before something happened. The ensemble works great with Kurt Russell, showing a charismatic leader even under this whole beard. <br /> <br /> By building tensions slowly with horrible moments (effects courtesy played by Mr. Rob Bottin - currently directed by Freddy vs. Jason) Carpenter creates a film that rarely fits. Considering that it came out in the same year as ET, it could not have been more excellent! <br /> <br /> Worth a look / reread. 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> DVD pages are excellent. Lots of extras plus the best DVD comments (with Carpenter and Russell). Plus a remix in Dolby Digital for even sharper sound effects.
