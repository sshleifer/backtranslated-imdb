We caught this movie on TV and I watched it again. I told myself, I have not watched this movie for a long time, so why not. And again this movie excited me. It is so easy, so watchable and so human, that I don’t know why some people don’t like it. <br /> <br /> John Travolta shines like Michael (his dance and every movement), an angel who can hardly be associated with this word. He smokes, drinks and eats like a savage, but he has a big heart. Along the way, Michael helps everyone he meets. Dorothy Winters (Andy McDowell) in her singing and searching for the right man. Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) develops himself as a good and decent person. Michael even helped the dear old Pansy Milbank (Jean Stapleton) - this last scene is beautiful when they dance outside. <br /> <br /> Travolta was a great help to other actors. Andy MacDowell is so beautiful and pleasant, William Hurt is great as usual, the late Robert Pastorelli shows his talent. Gene Stapleton and Teri Garr are also good, but my favorite supporting actor in this film is Bob Hoskins as the owner of the tabloid. <br /> <br /> So, we have a solid film about people with a warm history and an attractive cast. Just do not take this film seriously, and I can guarantee that you will have fun.
