Here we have the unique Charlie Chaplin, who left his past to deal with the serious problem of anti-Semitism and intolerance in general. He portrays two characters — a sweet, innocent Jewish barber — a war veteran and a violent and ruthless dictator Adenoid Hinkel. The Jewish ghetto in this country is unreliable for a long time, because of the whims of Hinkel and his armed thugs, who usually buy up their inhabitants or leave them alone, depending on his mood that day or week. Among them, the barber, but made friends with his former commander, Schulz (Reginald Gardner), who seemed to be silent for a while until Hinkel sentenced him to concentration camp. He seeks shelter for Jews in the ghetto, especially for a hairdresser, and the brave young woman of Hannah (Paulette Goddard). The package will be - who will be from these Jews, who will threaten their lives in order to get rid of Hinkel and his minions? We do not need too hard to guess the answer; the barber is a dead bell ringer for the dictator, and he is supplied with his own image, accompanied by Schultz, also in full military equipment. Hannah escapes with a few friends from the ghetto to the country of Osterlich, where Mr. Yakel’s cousin (Maurice of Moscow) has a farm and they can live peacefully for a while. At this point, Hinkel himself was arrested by his armed forces, considering him to be the notorious barber. Meanwhile, the latter is escorted to the podium with Schultz to give a speech announcing the conquest of Osterlich. The next ten minutes is pure Chaplin, who speaks with all his heart tolerance, love and freedom, and diminishes greed and hatred. Although Chaplin began production of the film in 1937, it can be forgiven for some naivety. He was allegedly not aware of the seriousness of this persecution and hatred, and said that if he knew fully, he would never have made the film, because he most likely believed that it could have simplified the situation. He has an amazing cast: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniel as Garbisch, his adjutant, always great Billy Gilbert as awkward herring, Paulette Goddard, Jack Okey as dictator Napaloni, his opponent for conquest, Europe veterans David Gorsi (Leo's father) , Maurice Moskovich and others. The stage he staged with the globe, with just musical accompaniment — clean, bright inspiration, and also glowing — is Paulette Goddard at the end of the film, smiling through tears. I have seen this film before, but there is always something new for me in it. Last night, when it was all over, I sat there in tears. I challenge no one to be touched by it.
