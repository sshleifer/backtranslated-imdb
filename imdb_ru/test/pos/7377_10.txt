I would like to say that I really loved Tales by the fire! For me, it was one of the original horror films with a distorted ending. As if the content of the film was not scary or strange, you have an end. This is a very cool movie, and I'm so happy that it will be released on DVD on August 30th. I will not hesitate to receive my copy that day. because all these other films came out shortly after that and were recognized, but if it wasn't for my brother who told me about the film, I would not have known. Which stinks because, in my opinion, it is much better than any Scream, “I know what you did last summer,” or any other horror for that time. Therefore, I hope that you can watch the movie yourself and at least see the difference. I liked it, and, being a junkie from a horror movie, “Fairy Tales by the Fire” was like dessert for me!
