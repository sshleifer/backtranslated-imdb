Leland follows the story of Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), a disgruntled teenager who apparently killed a very backward peer, the brother of the girl with whom he met. The question is not whether he did it or not ?? Leland recognizes this right away ?? or rather, why. Interestingly, instead of the crime drama, Leland becomes a character exploring why people do what they do ?? not necessarily the easiest soil to process. <br /> <br /> And Leland has the indie group of perverts we need. In addition to the title character, there is Pearl (Don Cheadle), who is his teacher in a juvenile correctional facility and immediately notices that Leland is different from others. We meet Leland's distant and selfish father (Kevin Spacey in extended cameo), who never seems emotionally agitated by what his son has done. But real tastes come out when we dive into Pollardy, the family of a backward child. First, there is Leland Becky's girlfriend (Jena Malone), a drug addict who can't keep herself clean; her sister Julie (Michelle Williams), perhaps the most normal person in the film, who is just trying to get away from it all; and Allen Harris (Chris Klein), a young man who lives with Pollards and is a Julie boyfriend. Finally, there is Ryan (Michael Welch), whom everyone else calls a fool who cannot communicate and seems to be barely aware of his surroundings. <br /> <br /> Leland focuses mainly on his eponymous protagonist, but the film is slow ?? sometimes it breaks into everyoneâ€™s lives too slowly, asking the main question: why do people do what they do? While Leland openly discusses this in a magazine, which Pearl allows him to save, studying the concepts of good and evil and personal responsibility, all the characters in the film at some point face the moment when they have to make a fundamental choice of their own or others' happiness, perhaps , the easiest choice anyone can make. And the film looks good at what is included in these elections, and their consequences. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film you are simply amazed at the depth of the cast. Spacey. Cheadle Gosling Michelle Williams. Even Chris Klein ?? these are people who for the most part seek to raise any film they are in, and combining them together leads to a reckless brew. For the space in the middle, the film seems to stop, splashing while it unfolds; For a while he looks as if he will just ask questions and not give any answers. But when we get to the house and the movie starts to gather momentum and get together, Leland becomes quietly powerful cinema. The explanation of the world by Leland and his actions finally draws attention to each story, and all the investments you made in the film pay off. <br /> <br /> To say that Ryan Gosling is great, it's like saying a sunny day is good. At this point in his career, is it too much ?? This is one of the best young actors working today, and I am pleased to see how he turns what could be an unpleasant character into a protagonist that makes you think. Gosling uses such subtlety here that it hardly seems like an action; he has to confront most of the film against Don Chidl, who, as we know, has goods, and he not only keeps himself, but also enhances Cheadle's play. Is Chudle himself in great shape, filling the Pearl with fully rounded humanity ?? good and evil. Spacey is one note, but it's a character, and he does a great job of it. I was surprised by Chris Klein; with that level of acting, I thought he would be buried in the mix, but he probably still ends his career. Everywhere is awesome work. <br /> <br /> Leland is a little depressed, and, again, in some places he pulls. But it ends a lot and has a lasting impact on the viewer (this one, anyway). There is also a subtle commentary on racism in the film (on the first day of Leland in the juvenile class, he is the only white person in the room), which, like most of the film, is very efficiently processed. I would not go so far as to call it compulsory viewing ?? Some may find it too slow or too strange? but I thought it was one of the best films I've seen lately, much stronger and more enjoyable than most. I would recommend it ?? with the above reservations ?? if only for some other reason than to observe how Gosling improves his skills.
