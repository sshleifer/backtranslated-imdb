The debut, which wrested one of the brightest stars of modern noir from obscurity, is a confident, albeit limited, blow to a fraudulent game and an obsession. Filmed for zero money, Nolan could not choose a better topic than the dull and vile lower part of London to do his own thing, given the lack of funds. This short (67 minutes) at best plays with the expectations of the audience and the main character as to who is deceiving whom, although the initial setting is indeed alarming in the trust department. Dirty cinematography (he often used natural light due to budget) can be mainly attributed to noir styling, although limitations sometimes appear. <br /> <br /> One can easily see how Nolanâ€™s style develops in this fledgling work; In MEMENTO and INSOMNIA, many of the same themes of blurred identity and shattering expectation recur. Not a masterpiece, but good and certainly worthy of attention for modern fans of noir and nolan.
