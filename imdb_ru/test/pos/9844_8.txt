James Cagney, a racketeer and political trustee, becomes deputy commissioner of correctional institutions and attends a school for reforming boys. The hitch is that Kagni is not needed for bribery, he sincerely wants to change the lives of children, because he comes from the same sources as theirs. <br /> <br /> The villain of this work is Dudley Diggs, who is a graft cutter and a sanctimonious hypocrite. One of the implications of the plot “Mayor of Hell” is that these children are mostly immigrants, and those who judge them and are in power are those who have been here for several generations. Pay attention to the scene in the dining room: Diggs is grateful for the food they are going to get, Diggs eats well, but the children get a quality that you will not feed your pet. <br /> <br /> Cagney has his problems in the city with some of his minions, and he has to take it on the run. This forces Diggs to lead and prepare the film for the climax. <br /> <br /> Mayor of Hell was a typical product for a working class studio. And because it was a preliminary code, it gets pretty awful from time to time. A later version of The Criminal School featuring Humphrey Bogart and the Dead End Kids was a more refurbished remake. <br /> <br /> Although Cagney is in the lead role as good as Madge Evans, the school nurse, the acting. honors are given to Dudley Diggs. It is hard to believe that one and the same person could portray a drunk, but graciously, surgeon on one leg in the Mutiny on the Bounty. But Diggs is a good player and a joy to watch in every film he makes. <br /> <br /> This film is not often shown because of the racial and ethnic stereotypes that it portrays. A number of minorities would be offended today. However, this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, several years ago, the film "Sleepers" was released, which dealt with the same problems. I think movies about reform schools never change.
