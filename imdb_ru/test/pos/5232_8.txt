I put this film 8 points compared with other feature films of the 1930s. By the standards of films made only a few years later, this film could get only 6 or 7 points - mainly because the sound quality was so poor. Now it is possible that the film sounded better, and the Fox Movie Channel did indeed have a damaged imprint (there were many lines and scratches on it), but I assume that the problem with sound has always been a problem. This is due to the fact that the sound in the films in 1930 was still a novelty, and many Hollywood conversational pictures of the 1930s sounded awful - the background characters often drowned off the leashes, the characters got together to make sure that they were matched with microphones or incompatible quality ( such as what they saw in the murder of a bishop, angels of hell, and other films of the day). In BIG TRAIL, everything was much worse, because most of the film was shot on the street - something unheard of at the time. This is an innovation, but also something that really expanded the talents of sound engineers! So, although it was very difficult to listen to the film, I understand that they had to start somewhere, so I can forgive this - especially since outdoor scenes are breathtaking - the main innovation of 1930. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite similar to CIMARRON - Western, released next year and received an Oscar for the best picture. Unfortunately, CIMARRON is not such a wonderful film, and I prefer THE BIG TRAIL because of the scale of the film. While someone may interfere with the slow movement of THE BIG TRAIL, I regarded it as a great lesson in history about the difficulties faced by those traveling westward in wagons. In addition, it all looked so beautiful, as the director Raul Walsh put a lot of effort into making the film on the spot, and the BIG TRAIL looks almost like the film of some Ansel Adams prints. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it was pretty good. It was a major breakthrough for the young John Wayne - since his previous appearances on the screen were, at best, insignificant and unremarkable. Here he was given the lead role and he did an excellent job - although he was obviously young and a little less “John Wayne-ish” than he was in later films, as his character on the screen was not yet firmly established. Another interesting role was played by Tyrone Power II (father of Tyrone Power). He did not look like his extremely beautiful son and looked and sounded almost the same as Blue from the cartoon “Popeye”! He made very few sound films - he died only a year after the creation of this film - so this is a rare opportunity to see and hear this once famous actor. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is worth seeing, despite some problems with the sound and some excessively long scenes here and there. For 1930, it was a remarkable achievement — more than the much better known and award-winning CIMARRON the following year. In many ways, the reason that BIG TRAIL did not win an Oscar, most likely because ALL THE QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT came out that year, and this is truly one of the best films.
