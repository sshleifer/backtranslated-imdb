This is not a video of the nasty Demon Night, as there are more than one. In fact, there is only one, but it multiplies. <br /> <br /> After he inhabits Susanna (Queen of Cries Linnie Quigley), she passes her gothic girl Angela (Amelia Kincaid) through a nice long kiss. <Br /> <br /> Then we see Linney showing us her whines in the bathroom. She shows a lot more because Jay (Lance Fenton) thinks he wants to have fun. <br /> <br /> Soon everything literally goes to hell when the bodies fall one after the other and are obsessed. Judy (Katy Podwell) and Max (Philip Tanzini) are the last two trying to escape. Max doesn't help much, leaving Judy to find a way out. <br /> <br /> The makeup was absolutely fantastic, and the only thing that prevented it from being even better was the extremely long build-up to the action. <br /> <br /> The old man (Harold Ayer), who appears at the beginning, will come back and bring his desserts. <br /> <br /> Linnae Quigley may have been the Queen of Screams, but Katie Podwell most certainly showed the greatest lungs in this film.
