This bastard in the tradition of Hitchcock. You are kept in the dark, as suspects come and go. Dennis Quaid is the wife of Dexter, doomed to death, and Meg Ryan is a great baby. In this little wait, there is not much that is not pleasant, and all the pieces are neatly combined with each other as they should. You will not regret watching this movie if you like suspense.
