Master Kislovsky came up with the idea in 1993. The idea was to portray how human relationships exist in the modern world, moving from Blue (created a visual masterpiece about the life of a woman) from White (a visual comedy film about marriage) and finally arriving at Red (A Masterpiece relating to human interaction ). <br /> <br /> Although I am not going to spoil the move, I can easily say that Red is the best film of the 90s, because it contains one of the most powerful messages in the script I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film starts a little slow, but finds its rhythm early enough to keep you informed about the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The performances are immaculate, sublime. since the characters are absolutely realistic, and they are by no means cliché, and no less can be expected from the actors, and no one is disappointed ... seriously, I think that Jean-Louis Tringtina deserved at least an Oscar nod. <br /> <br /> Zbiegnew Preisner’s music is simply amazing, it’s one of the best songs ever. Petr Sobotsinsk Cinematography is also outstanding, he received an Oscar for it (and deserved the victory). <br /> <br /> In general, the film is a perfect ten, and people who love foreign cinema and people who do not like it will love it. t. Do not miss. <br /> <br /> How awful pulp fiction won this masterpiece in Cannes, I do not understand
