Located in the 1970s in Los Angeles, Christopher Beuys just dropped out of school and returned home, where his father got a job, where he controls intelligence documents. His old friend Donton Lee is an abnormal drug dealer, he is caught on a setup, and he has to choose between drug addiction or a long stay in prison. When on bail, he jumps and heads to Mexico City. Chris offers Lee to become a messenger for the sale of secret documents to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in partnership because of the shame he has about controlling the US government over weaker countries for his own benefit. But over time, these two begin to conflict with their motives and find themselves in something more than they originally planned. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger has released such films as the respectable Midnight Cowboy, Marathoner, Sunday Bloody Sunday and Locust Day. Although Falcon and Snowman may not rise so high, there is no doubt that this grim spy drama (inspired by this incident) is an unfairly missed portrait of the character. All in this, a rather muffled romance without real qualities of splendor, striking a massive imprint. The moving factor in the film should be the wonderful versatile lead roles of Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as two ambitious young guys Chris and Donton. Penn is especially good for its uneasy intensity, which blends well with Hutton’s superbly steep course. What begins just as easily, we observe how the situation is gradually collapsing, since two lovers find themselves really outside their league. A strongly detailed and symbolic (predatory behavior) plot mainly focuses on the relationship of the couple and their arguments regarding their actions, which ultimately shows us the intricate events that led to their fall. The plan opens like a wound that never heals properly, due to Donton's addiction, which really causes him to get off the rails and leaves Chris to take up all the slack. There is a burning political aspect, but it focuses on the themes of idealism (Beuys) and greed (Lee) in order to convey his thoughts. Both do not mix and the results show. The suspension is justified by his stimulating scenario of the pot boiling and character interactions then that of any visual gimmick. The action is very small, but still there is a pressure-induced style to Schlesinger’s guaranteed and realistic dark direction. Basically, the rhythm is well handled, although some sequences seem to fall too long, but, nevertheless, it captures you when it plays in its genuinely paranoid tone in order to slowly grow to an explosive, tight, last end. Musical and heart-rending musical score and professionally sharp cinematography are adequately embodied in technical production. Auxiliary actors are exceptionally good with Pat Hingle, Laurie Singer, David Suchet, Boris Leskin, Jerry Hardin and Joyce van Patten. Also notice Michael Ironside as an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> Mostly an outstanding spy movie, which mainly wins thanks to talented leading performances and the lack of regular bets. This is more an emotional ride than a difficult turn. Featured.
