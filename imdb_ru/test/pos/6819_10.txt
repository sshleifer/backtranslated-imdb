I watched this short instant back at the Sundance Film Festival website, and I must say that it is simply amazing. I expected it to be interesting - like all Sundance shorts - but I was not ready for such a deep sadness and yet a sense of passion and beauty. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen a single record of this year for the festival, I suggest you go to the site and see these mini-masterpieces - I saw them all and I can honestly say: “Youth is in us” what touched my heart the most. I'm not the weakest viewer when it comes to romance in films, but my eyes are so flooded that I'm surprised that I can still see the screen. <br /> <br /> I agree with addicted2you really is the workshop part of the director's work, and the cinematography is simply breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I can't think of a better way to spend the extra 12 minutes.
