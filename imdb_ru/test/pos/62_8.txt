A fun, exciting film about how a German spy of the Second World War (Julie Andrews!) Fell in love with an American pilot (Rock Hudson), trying to get secrets from him I understand why. It is beautifully shot, has beautiful costumes and interiors, and breathtaking air battles. Andrews also performs a striptease (strictly PG material) and sings a beautiful song - “Whistling in the dark”. The film does have problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the filming of this - and it shows. Their love scenes lack a spark, and they do not have sexual chemistry. However, they turn into good performances. The film is a bit long (even as directed by the director in 105 minutes, which I saw) and becomes too dark and serious at the end. Still worth catching. Try to see the cutting directors ... the other one works half an hour longer!
