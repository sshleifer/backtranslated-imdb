The filmmakers made a rather boring story of each person interesting and complex, focusing on his wife at home. At the same time, we are faced with a truly original, existential French loner. <br /> <br /> The film is more than a documentary. I hardly ever feel that I have experienced something so deep that it makes it even deeper. <br /> <br /> The film has visually interesting interior moments. Absolutely liked the journey in which the directors took me. (Quite a lot of Europeans in loans). Hopefully PBS will show this in order to reach a wider audience in the USA.
