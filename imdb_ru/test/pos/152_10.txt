After watching “Oldboy”, I was a little disappointed with the other works of the Park, some of them are good, but never close to the level of humor and originality that Oldboy had It does, it does not look like Oldboy in plot or style, but the same level of quality exists. <br /> <br /> The game is good with Kang-ho Song, OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin. great performances. Kim, in particular, manages to switch from horrific horror scenes to a surrealistic comedy without the slightest mistake. <br /> <br /> The plot is strange, with many twists and turns, and makes a big hit on the vampire cliché. <Br /> <br /> Directing is accurate, with tons of tempo and humor, as well as with some of the most memorable scenes I've ever seen. This boasts perhaps the strangest love scene you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie.
