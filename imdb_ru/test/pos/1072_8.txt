Our reviewer from Toronto told you what you need to know about this film (except for the fact that it needs editing - the manual technique becomes very old, very fast). I saw this film last night in Menerbes, France - we are in the Luberon Valley, which is covered with vineyards and, of course, winemakers. They were all there, in the Hall de Polivalente, for the show wedged. Polite, patient, brilliant. Despite the fact that I speak French, I understood the essence of the film, but noted that the audience liked the "old" terrors interviewed - especially. one of the communist village in Languedoc. He got a lot of laughter. It is unusual in France to laugh out loud. There is no doubt which side of the war on terrorism and globalization they are on! SM
