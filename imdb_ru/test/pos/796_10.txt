I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem, except to say that he represents young Buster Keaton at the height of his powers and certainly should be counted among the half-dozen best short comedies ever created. The GOAT is twenty minutes of a smooth, skillfully photographed, beautifully executed gag; two videos of a non-stop comic invention, driven by the unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending - which has not always been the case with Buster’s comedies. (See COPS for one case where Fatalism eventually defeated him, or ONE WEEK to win Defeatism.) If I had to describe this film in one word, I would call it “easy”, but if I were allowed two I I would call it “seemingly easy,” because, undoubtedly, a lot of hard work goes into creating any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease. However, it was not for nothing that they called him the Great Stone Face: Buster never allowed the public to see him sweat. <br /> <br /> A sardonic title card tells us that our initial sequence is “along the Millionaire Line”, “That is, on the bread line in gloomy urban environments where Buster waits patiently at the back of the line and, as a result, does not gets fed up. But it must be emphasized that he does not play for pathos for a second; Buster has our sympathy, but he never asks for it. Soon, thanks to a series of accidents, coincidences and absurd misunderstandings, Buster is believed to have escaped a killer named Dead Shot Dan and pursued by every cop for many miles, and yet, although he is clearly alarmed by this turn of events, there is never a hint of self-pity or even surprise; we understand that he always knew that this is what awaits him in life, and that he still does not have time to feel sorry for himself, he must find new ways to evade these policemen and escape from the last trap. <br /> <br /> Just as Buster refrains from playing because of sympathy, he also seems never to strain himself from laughter, which is especially impressive because THE GOAT must be one of the funniest comedies in history. This is a film that shows this iconic picture of Buster, riding on the train cow catcher right up to the very lens of the camera, which is not a gag, but definitely causes laughter in its own strange way. Meanwhile, there are jokes with weapons, dogs, policemen, an incredibly fluffy mustache and a clay statue of a horse that melts under Buster’s weight (a truly surreal spectacle), but some of the biggest boffos are saved for the final when Buster tries to escape his main curse enemy , Big Joe Roberts, a round cop who also turned out to be the father of leading lady Virginia Fox. Buster Big Joe locked in the dining room, Buster jumps over him and swims through the transom, turns the phone booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear and eventually uses the elevator itself to get rid of the pursuer and in time to conquer the girl for the last fading venture. <br /> <br /> Saying that more is a bad service for beginning viewers. The only pity is that I will not be able to see this film in a theater full of people who have never seen it before, and go laughing. Live music is also suitable; and by the way, the musical accompaniment provided by Kino for their home video / DVD version of THE GOAT is top-notch, serving as a icing on an already delicious cake.
