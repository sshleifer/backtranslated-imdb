Thorn-BMI doesnâ€™t work before they stopped making films, they made a chiller from the movie. Use of E.S.P. and telekinesis as the basis of a daughter, whose father possessed terrible power. Only after the death of her father, Olivia discovered that her father, who was dubbed "Raymar" from Raimmarkovich, actually killed 6 girls and planned two more, using the "Mental Vampirism" technique. <br /> <br /> Our picture begins with 6 coroners and music wagons approaching to match the horrible discovery of 6 girls. Dead all with wide eyes in the closet. There were all sorts of objects in the walls, the investigators pulled up the old man, when blue lightning struck the ceiling, which caused a round hole, and the film became even more bizarre! <br /> <br /> If you like extremely frightening scenes this is for you. If you cannot see dead bodies many years ago at every level of decomposition, do not look at it without a friendly companion. Like the Changeling, it has some kind of horror. I gave this rating 7 points, he is in color, actress Meg Tilly made her debut in this film, if you can find it.
