Crossing the Bridge: The sounds of Istanbul received one of the most enthusiastic applause from the audience when it ended and very worthy. I did not expect too much from a musical documentary, but the film turned out to be much more than that. It was also a visual documentary on Istanbul with sharp contrasts of the old and the new, western and eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional. Black and white photos of old Istanbul, the world-famous Armenian photographer Ara Guler were exceptional. But, of course, the main theme was music, and how the hell was it diverse! It was like the social club Bueno Vistas; The interviewer's love and respect, Alexander Hack, who replaced Ray Kuder, is for the sake of the musicians coming from the screen and embracing us all. The music was mostly very interesting. The jazz session of the Roma-Gypsy group in a small western Turkish town was simply amazing. I would not be surprised if travel agents start receiving requests for group reservations for Kesan after the release of the film. But what I liked the most was Muzeyyen Senar, who looked remarkably elegant in some burlesque style and, shaking her “Raki”, bravely declared: “My voice and I are 86 years old! Well done Vera Akin. I bet there are still many Turkish musicians who feel left out: go to the second volume, please.
