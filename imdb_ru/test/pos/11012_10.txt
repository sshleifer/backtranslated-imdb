When I first saw this film, I was very impressed with the atmosphere that the director creates. It is also very interesting to see how they envision the near future in 1974. If you watch a movie, you will see many sets and customs, which today are again called fancy and modern. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is devoted to the old question “What is real and what is illusion?”. If you see the "Matrix", you will find a lot in common. But these two films are completely incomparable, because “Welt am Draht” is an art, and “The Matrix” is entertainment. If you prefer the first. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I lost his video copy. <br /> <br />
