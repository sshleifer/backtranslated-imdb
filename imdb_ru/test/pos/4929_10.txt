It was one of my favorite movies from childhood. I watched it so many times, in the end my tape wears out. I was a big fan of this show and still love it. In this film, I like most of all that he likes many people, young and old. I now watch this movie and laugh as much as I did the first time I saw it. Now I can appreciate all the adult jokes that I never received as a child. My favorite characters are Elmira and Fulmut. Almost fifteen years later, my dad (also a big fan of the film) and I still quote lines from this film. I like the part where Foulmut and Shirley go to the movies. “You will save space, Shirle, and I will catch snacks from dudgama.” I also liked the story of Pluki, Hampton and his family going to the Land of the Happy World. Wade Swine really reminded me of my father. I like this role when they finally get to the Land of the Happy World, and all they do is drive along a monorail. This film is fun and attracts children and children. Animation, jokes and everything connected with it, at the highest level. If you have not seen it, rent it. You will not regret.
