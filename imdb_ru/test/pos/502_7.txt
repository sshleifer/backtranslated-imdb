An interesting twist on the Vampire thread - fast, loud and naughty. Despite my initial concerns, Chris K performs his role quite well, and Snipes, aka Blade, provides an amazing physical presence. A lot of blood, steel, silver, burning and exploding bodies provide pleasant entertainment. 110 minutes. If you like the black look of the Matrix, then Blade will turn to you, Blade even has the “dodge bullets” sequence.
