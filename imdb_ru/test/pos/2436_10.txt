Almost missed it. When I visited friends in Philadelphia in the early 1980s, I surfed the canal after everyone else went to bed. It was not just Bogart, with whom he was obsessed; rather, the entire era of those old films that I know well. Add to this a plot similar to the Maltese Falcon — where so many different characters interacted with Sacchi — and you have a work of art, as far as I can tell. About ten years later he appeared on television and I recorded it on tape. >
