Charlie Wilson (Double-time Oscar-Winner: Tom Hanks) is a calm congressman ... Who loves parties, loves the company of women and especially drinks his drink. When Charlie's old friend and former girlfriend Joan Herring (Oscar-Winner: Julia Roberts) want Charlie to visit Afghanistan, and this country certainly needs help. Charlie is shocked by what he saw, especially due to the fact that he was killed or wounded during this war with the Russians. He decides to help the people and the rebels fight the Russians who started the war. Charlie, Joan and one CIA renegade agent named Gust Avrakotos (Oscar winner: Philip Seymour Hoffman) will start a good fight for the largest secret operation in history. <br /> <br /> Director Oscar-Winner Mike Nichols (“The Birdcage”, “Concerning Heinrich, Wolff”) shot a lively, fascinating, sharp military comedy of satire based on a true story. Hanks, Roberts, Hoffman in the Oscar nomination and Amy Adams in the role of faithful assistant Charlie are very good in their roles. Despite the beautifully believable premise, “Charlie Wilson's War” never ignites, and it is not as terribly funny as you would like. Directed by Nichols and screenwriter: Aaron Sorkin (“A Few Good People”) makes people move forward, and people like characters everywhere. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a clear Pan & Scan (1.33: 1) and a good Dolby Digital. 5.1 Surround sound. The only features of the DVD are tacit fittings with actors and film crews and a real trick with Charlie Wilson and others. Charlie Wilson's War is a good film that could be really great, but it’s not. But this film is smart enough to appeal to those who loved well-written or well-played adult comedies.
