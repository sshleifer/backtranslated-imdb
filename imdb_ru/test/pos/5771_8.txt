This Knotts walk includes one of his best friends, Frank Welker. Welker makes a movie. Knotts and Welker are fighting for laughter, and both get a lot. Notts works for a small “no where” city where the city is run by some of the most ignorant officials. When things go wrong, fathers of the city, let Notts take the fall. Frank Welker's character is friends with the Knotts, and together they stumble to clean up the mess and good name Knott. In this film, the usual Nott character, scared to death, is shown, who for many years glorified him on television and in movies. This may have been the last good exit of Knotts. When you have the extra 90 minutes, you will get the good old-fashioned laughter of a great icon, Don Notts.
