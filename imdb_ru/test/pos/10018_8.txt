I, of course, have not seen all of Jeanne Rollin’s films, but mostly they look like bloody festivals with naked female vampires, which, if you like such things, are not bad, but this is a serious care, and it can be almost Cronenberg, with the exception of mechanical nightmarish things. Except that it is in French with subtitles, of course. A man traveling on the road at night meets a woman in slippers and a bathrobe and lifts her, while another woman is delayed in the background, who wears nothing. When they drive forward, it becomes obvious that something is wrong with a woman: she forgets things almost as quickly as she does. However, this does not prevent a man from having sex with her when they return to Paris and his apartment. A man goes to work, and some strangers appear at his house and take a woman to this “apartment building”, a huge apartment building called the Black Tower, where its other people are (for whom things “without memory” seem to be the least problems) are held for some reason. Time and events go on in the film, basically it’s trying to find what is happening and get out of the building for this woman, and she really manages to call Robert, the guy who picked her up first, to save her. The revelation of what is happening, is happening in the last few moments of the film, which has a rather strange but touching ending. In order to avoid what seemed to be his “typical” formula, Rollin created in this, I think, his most exciting and exciting film. I like it a lot, check it out. 8 out of 10.
