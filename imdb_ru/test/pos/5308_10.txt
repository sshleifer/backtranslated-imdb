The United States of Leland was an amazing film. I continued to transmit him on the guide on TV, not knowing what it was, and never had the opportunity to sit there and enter it. One morning, when I woke up early, I saw that it was just beginning. So I decided to watch it. I had the time and interest to watch it. When I saw that Ryan Gosling was in the film, and then he was the main character, I was sucked right away and I could not move away from my sofa. The struggle Leland is undergoing is such an inspiring story. Everyone has to deal with the same type of thoughts for some time in his life, be it small small details or something more than what he experiences. I have to sit and watch the film again to catch everything that I might have missed the first time. As a general comment ... I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Gosling, or to those who simply like a good movie with a really good story. The fact that there are so many other big stars who also had great performances is just a BONUS! So do your best to spend the time watching this movie, I'm almost sure that this will not be a waste of time.
