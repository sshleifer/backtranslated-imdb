After watching Desperate Life, I got hooked on John Waters films. I heard about the Pink Flamingos and had to watch it, and the boy was worth it! Believe what you hear is rubbish! It is full of everything dirty, which is actually the main plot of this film. It contains the following: incest, cannibalism, rape, chick fucking, nudity (as you have never seen before - beware of a birthday party), eating poop, arson, trailer garbage, perversion, transsexuality, fetish from eggs, dressing up .. ... you get the picture. First of all, this is a definite necessity! Just beware of a birthday party and divine wonder around the park!
