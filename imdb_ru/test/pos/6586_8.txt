For Estonians, Finland sometimes seems like a dream country. A land where many of us want to go and work there or start a business. Find love, start a new life, etc. But ... Aku Louhimis created this wonderful play, which shows that things are not so good in Finland. This Finland can be the same Paha Maa (Bad Land) as any other country. This shows that people can be as miserable in their lives as we are everywhere. That sometimes there is nothing good. This film beautifully shows why Finland is one of the best suicide countries. It is not easy to live in the North. A cold climate is changing us. I'm more attracted to Finnish films, and this is very good. The game is also great. Jasper Pyakk√∂nnen has become one of the best Finnish stars. Watch out for the sex scene (if you have small children) and a little depression that may occur after the movie! 8/10
