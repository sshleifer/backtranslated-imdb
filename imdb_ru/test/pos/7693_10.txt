It was an incredible film, with an incredible cast, music, singing, history, etc. It is a tragedy that some arrogant families (Gerswhins or Premingers) can prevent it from being available for generation to generation. I wanted to see it all my life again. I just found this site and read why it was not available. Shame on these families for their pettiness. My wife is from Germany and she never watched the movie. Neither my stepchildren, nor my grandchildren. It is very sad that a film of such depth and quality is not available for viewing. From where these families make such a conceited, selfish, selfish, indulgent decision to ban generations from enjoying this film, these stars, these performances, this music! Release the video and let them judge and enjoy!
