Clive Barker out of HellRaiser's fame has written and released a fantastic horror film, funny and exciting. <br /> <br /> The make-up made by Bob Keane and Jeffrey Portass was fantastic. It took imagination to come up with these mutants who lived underground. It was really nice to see the quality of the work. <br /> <br /> This was not particularly terrible, since the worst creature was in fact a human serial killer. <br /> <br /> I just saw Craig Schaeffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day, and he did a good job with this movie. Nothing impressive, but fair. It was only Anna Bobbyâ€™s third film, and she was also good. <br /> <br /> The ending was impressive, and the redneck got her desserts, like David Cronenberg. Ha!
