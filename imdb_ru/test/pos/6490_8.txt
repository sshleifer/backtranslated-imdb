I'm a big fan of $ 5.50 for a DVD container at my local WalMart. Hope you have one in your local branch. You can find a bunch of hiking movies, a bunch of trash and a random surprise. This film is one of the surprises. A friend of mine recently bought this one, and, thinking that it would be another riot of ridiculous kung fu laughs, I was genuinely surprised at how good he was. I watch a lot of films, and as a result I can almost always name how the film will turn out; and if there is a plot twist, that will be. Not this movie! The direction is great, the plot is amazing, and the fight is incredibly inventive. If you see this one sitting somewhere at a dirty cheap price, get it! If you see it at full price, I still recommend it.
