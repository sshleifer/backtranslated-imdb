I am a history teacher, and in general the film pleased me. My teens enjoyed it during the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and in some places a little juicy? Yes ... but my children walked away from the computer and the game console to spend four nights watching all this. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes were spectacular, and we met many historical characters. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrooke as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Kaznoff as Bent was angry and charmingly brilliant. We all thought that Charles stole the show from Orrie and George. <br /> <br /> We will love the movie again!
