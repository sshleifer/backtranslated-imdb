Mr Bean has always been my favorite. No matter how many times you watch the same thing, the show is never monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't even need to talk to make people laugh. His gestures, the expression on his face and the face itself is so funny to watch. The situations he encounters on the show are ridiculous, and the way he handles them is even better. There is simply no reason why this show will not get 10, because it's unbelievable. This is something that would even laugh the most serious or sad person in the universe. Here are some of my favorite episodes of the series: 1) When Mr. Bean stops at the hotel 2) The one where he watches a scary movie 3) Remember the baby (especially the diaper scene). In fact, all the episodes are so good that it is really hard to criticize the show. Mr. Bean can go to any height to prove that he is funny, including completely undress in one of the episodes. the way he handled this situation was simply overwhelming. 10 out of 10.
