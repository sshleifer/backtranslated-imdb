This production was a surprise to me. I love little-known films of the early 30s, but I was not ready for the last 25 minutes of this story. If, for any reason, you are not sure in the first half, hold on to the final. Of course, you should look at blatant racism as a purely topical issue. A thrilling viewing experience, but I think THE CAT'S PAW is not yet available on video / DVD. See your PBS listings!
