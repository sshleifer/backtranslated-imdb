Best cinema I've ever seen? Considering the year in which the film was made, I was completely amazed at the attention paid to the scenes and what seemed to be genuine. Although I am not particularly a fan of Western cinema - each scene is given with maximum detail, and this is haunting. There is a sincere connection with nature. Sometimes I am amazed at the number of actions that pass through the scenes, but Iâ€™m never bored. It seems to me that I really peer into the time machine and look to the old west. I recommend this film to anyone who studies scenography, terrain planning and, for that matter, photography as a whole. It can be a humiliating film that can be seen in terms of visual effects, given the era of digital processing that we are currently experiencing.
