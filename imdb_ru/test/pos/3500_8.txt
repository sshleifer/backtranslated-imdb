Convincing the prime minister to support the absolutely inappropriate Ali Ji as a candidate for the role of Staines in the local elections, nasty Chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit the current leader of his party, which will allow him to seize power. To his surprise, however, the plan backfires, Ali embraces the nation, and Carlton is forced to look for other ways to try to guarantee his political future. <br /> <br /> Careless, rude, misogynistic and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the debut on the big screen for Berkshire gangsta middle class Sasha Baron Cohen - all these things and much more, that is, this is my film !! <br /> <br /> Obviously, those who are just not going to get a joke, and, of course, people who find risky jokes about oral sex, homosexuality, recreational drug use, hardcore pornography and the underworld of the queen offensive to extremes ( it goes without saying that they have to stay away!), but if you find such youthful humor insanely cheerful, love Baron Cohen as a whole or just want to see the beauty Ron Mithra in her underwear (and you, damn, she's a good fit!), then I fully recommend the pro to lead an hour and a half in the company Ali G and West S Tyne Array. <br /> <br /> They are evil!
