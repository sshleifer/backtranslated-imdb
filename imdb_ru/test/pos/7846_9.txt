Beguiled is a pretty nice movie for those who follow the things listed above. For loyal fans of Clint Eastwood, this will be a disappointment. Although Eastwood is trying his best here in his so atypical role (except for the fact that his character is a charming womanizer with whom he is not so unfamiliar), his characterâ€™s ambiguous character comes from a kind of fallen hero for a manipulative and insatiable woman - an affair (to put it this way) with time will be too difficult to cope with the situation if someone saw him playing heroes in the best Western traditions, morally unclean, but still without this dark side. I think he manages to deal with this unlikely part, but those who really steal the show are two rival women, school teacher Geraldine Page and head of the students played by Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> We see that there is a potential devil in every man and a potential witch in every woman, especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire. Edwina Hartman is the sweetest, most innocent girl in the world, until she is carried away by John McBurney and takes possession of him. This is what causes the tragedy, as well as the secret lust of the director, the forbidden fruit. She carries a great and ugly secret about her incestuous relations with her brother, whom she has so far clearly worshiped. The fourth factor in this "unholy" love spiral is the evil Carol played by Jo Ann Harris, who lures John because of his fascination with Edwin in her bed. <br /> <br /> The whole character of this story gives This film is reminiscent of Gothic, which makes it quite rare in the Western genre, but popular in films of the 70s. The unique achievement of the Siegel / Eastwood team and the film is not for the faint of heart.
