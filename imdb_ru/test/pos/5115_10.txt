This film brings me so many memories! I was very young when he left, but I remember seeing it for the first time! My dad and I always watched Ernest Films together. We have not seen one of them for several years, and I found a couple of them very cheap. We looked at them and could not stop laughing. I love all the "Ernest films," but this one is my favorite. <br /> <br /> Spoiler! <br /> <br /> The part I remember the most is the “magnet” part. My dad still does the electric chair scene! <br /> <br /> End Spoiler! <br /> <br /> This is a very funny movie ... but great! This is ideal for families (there is not much garbage there), but at the same time, adults can laugh too! If you like physical humor (for example, facial expression and how people move), then this film is for you!
