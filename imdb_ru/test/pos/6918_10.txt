This movie is completely underrated. <br /> <br /> This film is similar to Will Keenan and Patrick Hasson’s “Waiting”, as well as Adrien Brody’s restaurant and the classic film “Running Away”, dedicated to young people who are stuck and know they are stuck, and practically no chance of breaking free. <br /> <br /> Pizza Death (delivered) is about an intelligent, free-thinking, artistic young man (Will, played by David Stringland) who was stuck and waiting, bitter from world hypocrisy and bitter from his own lack of leadership and desire. Will meets his sworn enemy, Reed (Ron Eldard), another intelligent young man who is so bitter that he chose the path of crime. Both end up helping each other to break free from their bitterness, which gives them the opportunity to get unstuck. <br /> <br /> For these young people, loosening or liberation can mean both moving into life and plunging into death. <br /> <br /> Will’s life is filled with the trademarks of a young “stuck” adult: heartbreaking, sweaty, underpaid work, rude clients, a former girl who left him because he was unmotivated, incomplete college education without a degree, home, filled with art made by himself, and, of course, a new friend, whose godless choices help him save himself.
