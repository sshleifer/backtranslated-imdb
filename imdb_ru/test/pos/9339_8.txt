I donâ€™t really care about Michael Jackson. In addition to being a pedophile, I really dislike his music, with the exception of a few songs from his iconic album THRILLER. This is one of them. I really like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever made. <br /> <br /> It was filmed by John Landis, most famous horror fans as directed by AN American WEREWOLF IN London. This music video is not so much a musical, as a more or less short horror film. M.J. and his date in the werewolf movie. When they come out of the film, they are attacked by a crowd of bloodthirsty zombies, when Michael Jackson performs his famous dance "Thriller". <br /> <br /> You know, in fact, this is a pretty good song with good synthesized beats. This and "Beat It" are probably the only two Michael Jackson songs that I can tolerate again and again. I especially love Vincent Price's cameo as a narrator. His distinctive voice is perfect for a horror music video. Even if you don't like the music of M.J., you need to watch this video at least once. By the way, he was good before he became a creepy white woman with a fake nose.
