I saw this episode of the Masterpiece Theater and immediately went to IMDb to watch it. I was greeted by a comment from another user who thought that there was nothing special about this, 6 out of 10, and that was not impressive. I would feel morally lost if I did not agree. <br /> <br /> Now I am an avid fan of the Masterpiece Theater, but on television it is often a little silly, for example, “He knew that he was right” was absolutely terrible. I’ve seen so far. The whole cast does an excellent job, and he got me interested more than any other piece I’ve seen recently. or the garnet ring my opinion of him changed from bad to deys really good. Indeed. His final demise and the story of how everyone around him left him a cold, tough person — that was what caused the bittersweet in me in this story. <br /> <br /> The end pleases in every sense except for one, that everyone did not get what they deserved, but on the whole everything turned out. I absolutely recommend it to everyone.
