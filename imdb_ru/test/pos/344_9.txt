I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is the first Indian film that I saw in Tamil, and although it has some similarities with other Indian films (great music and choreography, broad storyline), the director tries more than just to entertain. The film tells about Amud, a nine-year-old girl whose parents sooner or later tell her that she was adopted, and thus begins an odyssey that takes them all from India to war-torn Sri Lanka. Gorgeous visual effects are mixed with horrific scenes of violence to express a thought, albeit simplistic. Amudhu plays ps Kirtana, and she is one of the few child actors I have seen who can be premature and not annoy. Her charm and beauty fastened the film.
