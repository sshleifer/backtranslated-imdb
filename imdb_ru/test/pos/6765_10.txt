This is actually a brilliant movie. The story is grotesque, but the actors are brilliant. Especially great is the game of Mads Mikkelsen in the role of Svend. This is a simple story about two guys who want to do it on their own, but unfold into a strange and absurd story when a lot of people are accidentally killed and served as chicken steaks. If more people understood Danish ... It could be an excellent candidate for the English version. It is also worth mentioning Ole Testrup, who always brings this extra twist to the plot with her slightly crazy character Holger. I can only recommend this film to the Danish audience. Also take a look at the Adams Abler film (2005), shot by Anders Thomas Jensen, also with Mads Mikkelsen, accompanied by the well-played Ulrich Thomsen.
