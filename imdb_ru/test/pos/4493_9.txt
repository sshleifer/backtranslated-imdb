For the curious, this episode is based on the plot of Pirandello’s play “Six Characters in Search of the Author” and Jean-Paul Sartre’s play “No Exit” (which is most obviously indicated in the title), but, of course, with Sterling turn. <br /> <br /> Five completely different people find themselves in a round room, not knowing who they are, other than pointing out their clothes. The bell tolls periodically (possibly also Hemingway’s allusion?), Increasing the agony of their conclusion. A newcomer to the group, a major, is determined to escape, and the rest have accepted their fate. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pirandello, these characters don't even have a story. They have nothing but the experience of the room in their minds, and there is no one who could write their non-existent history, so their position is even more hopeless than that of the characters in the play Pirandello. Unlike Pirandello and Sartre, there is no connection between the characters, and therefore there is no real conflict between them, although the topic of personal responsibility against apathy is noticeable in this story. <br /> <br /> Although this is significantly different from the plot of the authors referred to, the themes of Sartre and Pirandello (and many other authors of the twentieth century) are traced with absolute clarity. It is very obvious that part of the postmodern perspective is in the context of the cold war era. Special attention is paid to the issues of personal nullity. <br /> <br /> This is easily one of the best episodes I've ever seen, and is still extremely relevant to the current experience (like Sartre and Pirandello). Exactly what makes a good piece of writing a classic.
