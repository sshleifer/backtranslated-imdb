When I went to the video rental store, back in the days when the DVD was still next to the unknown to me, I saw all the movies in the store that interested me. Or I thought so! The man behind the counter told me that he had something for me that I definitely would like. He gave me "Plunkett and Macklin." At first I doubted that it would be good, but I trusted his advice and ... dude, I am very glad that I took this jewel with me! This is one of the best adventure films in recent years, if you ask me! Of course, when Robert Carlisle plays the main role, how bad can a movie be? Of course, Liv Tyler again does what she is good at and nothing more: to be beautiful. But, nevertheless, you can very clearly feel that the actors, apparently, had a lot of fun playing in this film.
