For 21 years, the film version of the play by Ruth Gordon, which described in detail how she tried to save the marriage with Garzon Kanin after he left the service, gives Irene Dunn one of the best roles on the big screen. This is also consistent with the fact that back in America there was an optimistic spirit that we would not break the peace, as we did in the First World War, and sow the seeds of another global conflict. <br /> <br /> The game Ruth Gordon wrote and starred in herself, participated in 221 performances in 1944 on Broadway and was timed to the bungalows, which Gordon and Harvey Stevens, who was the lead man, had at the training base. If you look at the list of Broadway titles, it means that the production was “staged” by George S. Kaufman, not the director. I'm not sure about the difference, but I can imagine that with such wit and will, like Kaufman, it was an interesting period for the production of the film before the opening of the evening. <br /> <br /> When Colombia bought Sydney Buchman had to make a serious reconstruction of the script to move the action outside the bungalows. The film has very few traces of its stage origin. <br /> <br /> Alexander Knox plays a husband, and Charles Coburn plays Dunn and Knox's employer, who are writers. Knox received the title of not only the editor, but also a well-known browser. His words and thoughts help sell the newspaper, and Coburn is in a bind. But Knox feels that he needs to go to war, to the peculiar event of his time, in order to speak authoritatively about the kind of world he wants after the war. It was not a rare topic in those years. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunn has a few good comic moments she had when she appeared opposite Cary Grant. In fact, Garson Kanin sent them both to My Beloved Wife a few years earlier. Coburn is his usual strange old buffalo from a boss who ultimately has a good heart. <br /> <br /> More than 21 years has been an optimistic picture, which, unfortunately, is not entirely accurate with regard to what the allies, and I mean all of them, can bring to peace conferences in order to create a better world. I still hope that the new generation will get this right.
