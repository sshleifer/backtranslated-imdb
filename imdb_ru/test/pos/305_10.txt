It seems that films fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing social values ​​and beliefs, and films that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree turn from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in sentences such as The Longest Day and The Green Berets, which in comparison with him are more like Disney's fantasies. "Apocalypse Now!" The project, the production and the resulting film, is the "Heart of Darkness", turned into a psychological horrible story of the postmodern variety of the end of the 20th century. The cast and the team that worked on it probably could have related to the terrifying places that the human mind can reach. This is the plight of the original character of Joseph Conrad Kurtz, who entered the literary being in 1901 and was later mentioned in the book of TS. Eliot "Empty People" (Mista Kurtz, he died) in 1925. Although none of the direct statements of Conrad "The Heart of Darkness" (1901), as well as first-hand about the Vietnamese experience "Apocalypse Now!" It stands as a masterpiece, which put forward an envelope of cinematic potential. “Apocalypse” is not only the “horrors” of war as such, such as Platoon and The Deer Hunter, but also the darker feelings of human nature, which manifest themselves in a rough and humiliating confrontation of violent conflict on a massive scale. Apocalypse today! not so much perceived as experienced. <br /> <br /> The main part of the film is the journey of the trained secret killer, captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen, tour de force), aboard the US military. The boat crosses an unnamed river in the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia, where when -or few residents of the West. His mission is to destroy Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), an officer of a special-purpose army unit who was a favorite of the US Army, until he fell backwards and retreated into the deep uncharted jungle between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official secret message says that the colonel went crazy, but with the development of events something even more terrible happened to him than just madness. Tire's mission is to kill the colonel with the American public, not wiser. <br /> <br /> The film is quite episodic. A river trip consists of several vignettes, as Shin and his team encounter various autonomous "aspects" of war at ground level. The 1970s American audience has probably never seen this kind of filming before, with the possible exception of Deer Hunter, which was released last year. The first and one of the most notable ones is a helicopter battalion led by Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duval in an Oscar-nominated performance), which is a cross between General Robert Lee and Richard Wagner. He likes to play "Ride of the Valkyries" from Wagner's "The Ring" when he is bombarding helpless villages. His line “I love the smell of napalm in the morning” is one of the most frequently cited lines from the annals of cinema. Other meetings include the amphitheater, where enrolled privates will be entertained, such as rabbits Hugh Heffner and Playboy. <br /> <br /> Despite all the production disasters that made it difficult to place these shots in a jar, a remarkable aspect of this film is its pace. The original release (not a later version of Redux) does an excellent job of assembling until the viewer is emotionally prepared to withstand the climate confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. A weird conversation between Willard and Kurtz costs one price to enter. And some of the pictures of Tire and Brando in some places are some of the harshest and most scary images ever taken on film. Even those like Clive Barker, Wes Craven, or David Cronenberg have nothing to do with Coppole in terms of terrifying images. Kurtz Brando in one scene, in particular, is so terrible that most other horror films seem tame compared to him, which is explained by the realization that the horror is not from the outside, but from the inside. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much, Coppola's decision on the climax is one of the most innovative cinematic discoveries. According to the Heart of Darkness documentary, Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would turn into a melodrama, and the atmosphere of the darker shades of the film would be compromised. He was not sure how he could make it work until his wife pushed the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox, as the local residents practiced, with whom Coppola used as extras in scenes with Kurz in his village. After viewing, Coppola had its end, and this is one of the most simultaneously exciting and beautiful scenes in the history of American filmmaking. Love it or hate it; not a single Western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene. <br /> <br /> This film is not for every taste, since Conrad’s original novel is not the book that will be read in airplanes. It is difficult for most American viewers to perceive not only violence and the senselessness of violence. This is a naked revelation of aspects of the human condition that seem so far from suburban American life that make this film difficult for an ordinary moviegoer, as it should be. Coppola did not take a family photo. However, if the viewer can understand his great point of view, much of what can be obtained from the Apocalypse Now!. If you are looking for a film experience to confirm a pre-existing attitude towards American sensitivity and heroism, better stick with John Wayne. But if you are ready to go to places where you have never been, even outside the rhetoric of the “evil of war”, “Apocalypse Now” will take you into a world that you thought you had never visited before, and the alarming part is that you can find out.
