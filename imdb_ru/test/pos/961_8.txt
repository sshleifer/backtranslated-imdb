Who said it should be believable? Do yourself a favor and turn off your diet before you sit down to watch this movie. You will enjoy it much more. You will find that you forgive some of the more outlandish plots of the film and simply accept it for what it is - an excellent family film. I appreciated the lack of having to worry about “dubious elements” in the children's film this time. It costs me a ticket. And he manages to preserve his utility, without being in this obvious - this film will appeal to older children. Enough of a good mood to interest adults. A very good movie.
