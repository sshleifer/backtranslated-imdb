I'm not a fan of musicals, but I'm a big fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I made this film on a whim and was pleasantly surprised, even expecting greatness from a classic director. This film is beautiful. The pictures are similar to oil paintings with motion, as many directors aspire to, except Renoir MASTER. I cannot express how much this film surpasses itself ... This is not a musical, but just a pair of well-placed musical numbers and a grandiose dance final. But there is something special about this film that makes you feel absolute JOY when you watch it. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of foreign feature films, but I'm also a fool who loves things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger movies. It is very easy for me to turn off things that are overly happy or in “la la land”, but this film has tremendous positive energy that is simply irresistible - not to mention that every frame is great and the plot is good. 10 out of 10.
