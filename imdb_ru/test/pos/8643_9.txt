Originally filmed in 1999 as the Dr. Mulholland television pilot. It was refused. The following year, David Lynch received money to shoot new scenes to make the film suitable for showing in theaters. He did it - and created one of the greatest, most strange and nightmarish films ever created. <br /> <br /> There are no main characters in the film, but if there were main characters, they would be Betty (Naomi). Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a cheerful blonde who lives in her aunt's apartment while she goes to the movie role. She finds Rita in her aunt’s apartment and decides to help her. You see, Rita lost her memory. She has no idea who she is. She takes her name, Rita, from the poster "Gilda" in the bathroom. So these two intended to find out who Rita really was. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is famous for shooting some strange films, but this film is a strange definition. This is strange, nightmarish and absolutely indescribable. It's like a dream, filmed. By the 100-minute point, the film has become extremely confusing - but if you watched closely, it would make sense. After watching the film, and then reading an article on the Internet, which tells about what is in the film, I now fully understand the film. <br /> <br /> The game is very good. Watts is awesome. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director who has problems with the local crowd. The music is great. Angelo Badalamenti delivers one of her best results. And directing - huh! David Lynch is the same masterful director, as before. <br /> <br /> Is this your movie type? Well, it depends. You should probably watch more of Lynch’s work before watching this movie. You need to be patient with the film and, perhaps, watch it a second time to understand what Lynch left behind throughout the film. For Lynch fans, this is a dream. <br /> <br /> “Dr. Mulholland” is a masterpiece. It is brilliantly, mysteriously and expertly shot. I like it.
