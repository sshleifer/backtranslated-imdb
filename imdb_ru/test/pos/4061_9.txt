Dad (78) and I (46) had a good time watching the film today. For a guy known primarily for serious roles, De Niro is a comic actor. Of course, it helps to play with his past films. Consider that one of these roles, 15 MINUTES, was a policeman dealing with media intervention, and you have an interesting set of comparative / contrasting speeches. <br /> <br /> Murphy plays another Axel Foley like character. Shatner plays himself in a burlesque, in a parallel world that is best known as TJ HOOKER, and not as STAR TREK. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how the film comments on the contrast between the reality of the police and its work. Fictional analogues in TV and movies. Shatner lectures on how to properly slide on the hood of a car; De Niro points out that the holsters are scratching the hood. Ironically, as the film progresses, the character of De Niro begins to incorporate the illusions of reality of a television cop into a real case he is working on. <br /> <br /> The film draws inspiration from a multitude of sources, so it was possible to comment this derivative. Well, so what? Satire must extract its humor to exist. And besides, the film has strange moments of originality. For example, I am quite sure that the villain’s death method has never been done before. <br /> <br /> Another argument about the reality of weapons - didn’t these guns have any recoil? To penetrate steel, these bullets must have sufficient inertia for penetration. And the highest level of inertia of the bullet at the time of the shot. So ... shooting a bullet from these killer tanks was supposed to drive the shooters back into their asses. Oh, what the hell ... is it satire. Perhaps the lack of recoil of the weapon itself is a satire on the B-F-Guns, which are so casually used in thrillers. <br /> <br />
