No film will ever be able to pay tribute to Faulkner's English. but they did a pretty good job here. Lucas Beauchain - exactly the way I portrayed him in the book, like Chick. What actually could not understand the film was the fact that the Negro people also did not like Beauchain, because he was just as stubborn. Not that it was bad, but because of my view of the book, which was his relation to the world (nevertheless, I felt that the racism of the white society laid the foundation for this, and he spread to the Negro society until it became his attitude to all). <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is that you can see the district of Yoknapataufa (in fact, Oxford, Mississippi) exactly as Faulkner wrote about this (the film was shot when Faulkner was alive and wrote) . Today it does not look so different. Just because of this, the film is worth seeing because it was shot in Faulknerâ€™s backyard. Truth must see Faulkner fans.
