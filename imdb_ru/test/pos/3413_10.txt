Of all the seasons and episodes of the Twilight Zone, after watching all the great, stunning, thought-provoking stories, this one stands at the top. Like this. This story, entitled “HUNTING”, spearheads a large number of the best scenarios in the history of television. <br /> <br /> True, there are no interplanetary space flights, there are no unexplained time cracks. There are no living nightmares, no sudden changes in the situation. It would seem that there is nothing unusual in the fact that our main character is dealing. <br /> <br /> The main character, played by veteran actor Arthur Hunnicut, comes out of his hut in the hills, accompanied by his faithful dog, to hunt a raccoon. Because the raccoon is mostly night hunting for animals in the moonlight. <br /> <br /> A man and a dog will soon encounter a large raccoon that jumps on the dog’s back and tries to drown the dog in the pond. A man jumps to help his dog. This kind of almost blackout, after which the pair can be seen on the beach in a lying, almost sleeping position. <br /> <br /> Call your dog nicknamed (I think Rip) The old man goes home. When he arrives, he discovers that his wife is crying and does not respond to his conversation. He also observes visitors who come and go to his house, offering respect and giving words to console his wife. <br /> <br /> Still looking puzzled by the strange reception and movement around the house, the Host and Rip take off during a long walk along the road, where He loudly notices that he did not remember such a long fence in these places. In the end, he meets a rather large guy dressed in clothes similar to his jumpsuit, hat, work shirt. They are at the gates that lead to an area where a lot of smoke rises freely. The Guardian of the Gate is trying too hard to force a person to enter. Rip sounds displeasure. The Gate Man tells the Old Man that he can enter, but the dog will have to stay outside, offering to watch the animal for him. This person will have nothing, and the two will continue on their way down the path. <br /> <br /> After a few more hikes, they face the second entrance to the gate, where the Gatekeeper recognizes a man and greets him. When the Old Man reports on what happened in the future, he tells him about how the guy at the other gate tried to separate the Man and the dog, and adds: “No dogs allowed, it must be Hellish!” The guardian of the 2 gates said that he was right! "This is exactly what it is!" <br /> <br /> Our family lost our first dog, the Lady Mixed Lab, in October 1981. After about 6 months, by a lucky chance, my wife (Dina) and I together with our 2 daughters (Jennifer 9 and Michelle 6) watched this episode on TV, WGN TV, Channel 9 of Chicago. Well, then it all made sense to us. <br /> <br /> We are sure that anyone who has such a relationship with a family dog ​​will agree.
