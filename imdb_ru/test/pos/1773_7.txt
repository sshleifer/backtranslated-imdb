It is one of several periodic sea threads of its era, which has the additional difference (though not unique in itself) of the female pirate at its center. At first, both leaders, Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan, may seem erroneous, but ultimately they fit perfectly in their roles, no doubt thanks to the talented players (Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice) who support them. Marshall with a velvet voice is uncharacteristically presented as an obligatory philosophical pyramid of the ship, and Gomez is correspondingly larger than Blackbeard Pirate. <br /> <br /> The cast is completed by Debray Paget as Jourdan's wife, who incurs the jealous wrath of a broken title character, to whom Jourdan instills the first love shots (which, however, does not save him from accidental flogging or wounds from the sword); by the way, the film became the second exotic team of Jourdan and Paget in one year after Delmer Dave's “Paradise Birds”. The immediate result of this unexpected mitigation of Anna’s character is her quarrel with Blackbeard’s team and her incredible sacrifice of the climatic consequences in order to save the lives of the Murldan, Paget and Marshall. <br /> <br /> While the film is not a particularly prominent example of this type, the energetic leadership of Jacques Turner and the grandiose score of Franz Waksman provide above-average efforts that move at a fast pace; By the way, the Tourneur has already served in the genre with the superb car Burt Lancaster, FLAME AND ARROW (1950). As usual with the old productions of Technicolor, cinematography makes the film luxurious, which invigorates. By the way, for this film different work times are given (81 or 87 minutes), and, for your information, the version I watched was shorter.
