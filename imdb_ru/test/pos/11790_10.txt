I thought this film was excellent, bizarre and different from the usual screening of the film The Serial Killer Shot by the Mill. Kiefer Sutherland, as usual, was great - I really didn’t think I had seen something he did, where he didn’t act brilliantly. The dialogue was amusing, at times lightening the mood, and the plot took. Thanks to other reviewers for showing us the connection with Alice in Wonderland - I didn’t pick them up. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Kiefer Sut Netherlands (like me), and anyone who wants to see an entertainment film for a few hours. It's a shame that it was not released in cinemas for a wider audience.
