I just called my brother Paulie on the phone, and he said he was looking at Hood, and it was funny. So, as I said, never go against the family! The need for more lines is fine, as I like to express my own opinion quite often. If something is written with an error, most likely it is my vision, not my brain. This gives me another chance to take pictures in the "Departed." When someone knows exactly what will happen in the last scene, without prior knowledge, this usually means that it wasnâ€™t that long. All you need is a good director, the same guy who, I believe, made my favorite film about Good Mates, but in a completely different way. And then just add Jack the Great and you will get an Oscar. I have to see the hoods to make sure that this is no better than Gibbs "The Departed"
