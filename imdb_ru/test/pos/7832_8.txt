Well, first of all, if you are not a fan of the low budget horror genre, don't worry about it. You really have to be a fan to get a gag. <br /> <br /> Movement is mainly about snakes .. in the train. Many of them. <br /> <br /> This is an ancient curse and a crazy ending that I wonâ€™t ruin. The bloody effect is full and very unpleasant ... but the film is basically one big bloody joke about snakes that frighten the hell out of a group of people trapped in a train. <br /> <br /> Uncertainty accumulates well, and there are some memorable and well-composed scenes ... some of them are a bit hammy (look at the surfing, dude), but this is not the main thing ... Give this movie a try. Know what to expect and you will not regret it!
