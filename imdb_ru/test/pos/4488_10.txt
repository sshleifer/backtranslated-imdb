It seems there are two types of people in the world: those who consider Five Characters to be one of the best episodes in the series, and those who are so cool that they know it sucks because they are so smart and have already predicted Lame turn at the end (which, apparently, in their small minds is the only reason for the existence of the Twilight zone: to come up with turns). <br /> <br /> There are many episodes in the series, and I am not alone to rate all the episodes of TZ ten. But this is definitely one of those that deserve such a rating. He is claustrophobic and colorful. Waiting accumulates, and we can not wait for the disclosure of secrets at the end. But whatever this secret is, what kind of people it is, it doesn't matter. Most of this episode is to lead to this. It would be just as strong if we never knew what these strangers actually represent in an unfamiliar place.
