For me, “Anatomy” is definitely one of the best films I've seen. I do not think that “Anatomy” was originally intended as a horror film, but as a film questioning the ethics of science. If you watch it with this in mind, it will turn into a really good movie. The only annoying point was the horrible voiceovers for the English version. How can you expect any non-German person to listen to these unbearable German accents for two hours? Let English speakers speak or use subtitles!
