Avoiding cliches is one of the main achievements of this film. When do you hear the vague outlines of the story? Erasmus students of different nationalities live in an apartment in Barcelona. You predict a set of Eurostereotypes in a farcical tangle. Pas du tout! In fact, this is a well-thought-out comedy about a young Frenchman Xavier trying to understand human relations. There are some perfectly observable supporting roles (arrogant French neurologist, unbearably irresistible brother of an English girl, unhappy mother Xavier) and some excellent visual humor, especially in the first scenes, making fun of the complicated application procedure. So what does Xavier learn about the relationship? Nothing positive. Instead of the traditionally happy ending, unfortunately, is there a final ending about “identity” ?? Xavier became “all the friends he made. However, this very nice movie deserves a lot of success. I saw it in Luxembourg with a mixed European audience, which enjoyed immensely and even applauded at the end.
