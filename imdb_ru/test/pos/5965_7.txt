Many animation lovers consider Vladislav Starevich to be a great forgotten genius of one particular branch of art - puppet animation, which he invented almost alone. , and, as it happened, almost by accident. In his youth, Starevich was more interested in entomology than in the cinema, but his unsuccessful attempt to shoot two fights with beetles led to an unexpected breakthrough in film production when he realized that he could imitate movement by manipulating beetle carcasses and photographing them with one frame at a time. This discovery led to the creation of the amazingly well-thought-out classic Shterevich's film “Revenge of Kamern”, which he made in Russia in 1912, at a time when all kinds of animated films were in their infancy. <br /> <br /> The political noise of the Russian revolution forced Starevich to move to Paris, where one of his first works - by chance? - was a dark political satire, variously known as "Frog" or "Frog that wanted a king." Black comedy can be found in almost all the films of Starevich, but here it is really very dark, and it is aimed more at adults who can appreciate satirical aspects than at children, who are likely to upset the climax. (I am middle-aged, and it seemed rather frustrating to me.) Indeed, the prints of a film intended for English-speaking viewers of the 1920s received title cards filled with puns and jokes to help soften a sharp bite. the final. <br /> <br /> Our story takes place in a swamp, Commonwealth of Frogland, where citizens are dissatisfied with their government and convened a special meeting to find out what they can do to improve the situation. They decide to ask Jupiter for the king. The crowds liven up impressively in this introductory sequence — it would not be easy to make so many frog dolls look alive at the same time — while Jupiter, for his part, is depicted as a funny white-bearded guy in the clouds who looks as if he would prefer to take a nap. When Jupiter sends them a tree-like god who stares at them impassively, the frogs decide that this is not an improvement, and they demand another king. Irritated, Jupiter sends them a stork. <br /> <br /> Delighted by this menacing-looking new king towering above them, the frogs greet him with a delegation of officially dressed dignitaries. The mayor takes a step forward to hand him the key to the Commonwealth when the newsreel records this event. To everyone's dismay, the stork quickly eats up the mayor and then goes berserk, swallowing citizens at random. On the title page is dryly written: "The news of the royal appetite is distributed throughout the kingdom." When now frightened frogs again beg Jupiter for help, he loses his composure and showered them with lightning. The moral of our story, told by the unfortunate frog shortly before it was eaten, reads: "Let us alone." <br /> <br /> Considering the period when this striking little film was made, and the fact that it was done by a Russian émigré at the height of the civil war of the besieged country, and it would be easy to see it as a parable about these events . Starevich may have had or did not mean the Russian turmoil when he was filming Frogland, but no matter what prompted him to choose the material, the film is a warning story about universal application. “Frogland” could be the Soviet Union, Italy, Germany or Japan in the 1930s or any country of any era that weakens its defense and is suppressed by tyranny. This is an exciting film, even charming in its dark style, but its message is not a joke.
