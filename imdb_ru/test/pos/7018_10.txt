I have seen this movie 50 times already, and it seems I will never get bored. I always watch it with my best friend, and now it has become a tradition for us to watch it almost every month. every time we see this movie, we both become really emotional, we laugh and weep in front of the TV together and sing all the songs in a loud voice, and in the end we always dance. now we practically even know the whole dialogue of the Heart and watching the film - it's like seeing our old friends on TV. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect! although I have to admit that the story itself is a bit silly, but the characters, the dancing, the music, and even the place where it all happens, make you forget about all this, and you start to believe that such things really happen and that the song " you need is love ", actually has some meaning. <br /> <br /> I’m really a normal person and don’t take my comment too seriously, but I just can’t wait until the next time we can see Dirty Dancing.
