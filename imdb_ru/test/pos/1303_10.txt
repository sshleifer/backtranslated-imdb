GLORIFYING is not GLAMORIZING World War II. <br /> <br /> We had a lot of documentary series about the Second World War according to the usual television programs. Without searching for any information in any encyclopedia or book of films, it seems that this old memory can fully recall most of the names. <br /> <br /> There was CRUSADE IN EUROPE, which was the title of military memoirs by one army general, and then the 33rd President of the United States of America, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He told the story of the conflict in Europe in terms of the Supreme Allied commander. <br /> <br /> Then there was a TOURISM ON THE TOURIST (not requiring explanation), about which I remember little. Newspaper Man / Author, Jim Bishop was the moderator / navigator of BATTLELINE. <br /> <br /> And there was an excellent WINSTON CHURCHILL, VALIANT YEARS. * This series was a joint production of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the American Broadcasting Company. She first went on the air in the 1960-61 season. In the States, and boasts that Richard Burton speaks the words of Sir Winston. <br /> <br /> Today, our television show on NBC television in 1952, this VICTORY ON MARINE, which wins a cigar, hands down. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the production had to take several years of carefully and literally sorting thousands of hours of film. The footage mentioned here is the official video taken by the United States military, independent newsreel, motion pictures of our other Union partner countries, as well as Axis photographs taken from Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and other countries. Imperial Japan. <br /> <br /> After this was done, the various relevant films had to be cut and edited into a series for half an hour. This was done with great skill, because there were so many changes to the scene, either suddenly or as a break. The appearance of any episode looks as smooth as if it were one movie. <br /> <br /> The writing of the “Speaking Word” accompanied by this best of real films was no less surprising and unique. Very refined and meaningful eloquence does not waste a word and sometimes even understates the description of the action, rather than exaggerating it. The story goes to Mr. Ralph Graves, who was a talented actor in theater, film, radio and television. He definitely received a measure of immortality due to his golden tone of writing descriptions of written episodes. <br /> <br /> Finally, VICTORY AT SEA enjoys the luxury of an original musical score, both the opening theme and the random music written by Richard Rogers from Broadway fame (Rodgers & Hart, Rodgers & Hammerstein). His works are intricate, complete, variable, and even "classical" in the true sense. <br /> <br /> The classic arrangement was played by NBC Sympphony Orchestra under the management of Robert Russell Bennett and as a soundtrack / cassette / CD, it has been constantly available and in demand since its first release, 55 years ago! And, indeed, it is not surprising, because it is this musical score that fascinates the viewer / listener so much. It really amazes this cake. <br /> <br /> * Sir Winston Churchill, VALIANT YEARS, also had a beautiful and memorable original score. This was also written by Mr. Rogers. <br /> <br /> ** We had another “Ace in a hole” in our house in the person of our Father, the late Clement J. Ryan (1914-74), the Pope was in the US Navy during the war Inaugurated in 1943 or 44 Our Pop was always on hand to explain and additionally find out any of the situations that were depicted in the series. <br /> <br /> He and our Mother, now 90-year-old Bertha (nee Fürst), Ryan has already given birth to my older sister. Joan (1942-90) as dependent.
