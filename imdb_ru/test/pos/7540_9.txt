Awesome entertainment in both the film and as an excuse to relax and play the game “Oh, this is the name of the chassis.” It seems that in this film every star of the golden age of English films is present, and it was great to see them. And the greatest of them, Richard Wattis, was more amazing than ever. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is a plot that develops perfectly, there are also some great jokes and comedy moments, but the key to the triumph of this film is the characters in it. Alastair Sim is great and somehow convinces you that a six-foot Scot with large bones could become the director of a women's boarding school. George Cole, Beryl Reed and Irene Handl have their moments, but with Alastair and Richard the star of the series is Joyce Grenfell. She is an absolute loner and brings a smile whenever she is on the screen ... her moving movement and plum emphasis are made to perfection. <br /> <br /> And for those who play the game called “chassis”, you can even notice Arthur Mulard, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle, if you look closely.
