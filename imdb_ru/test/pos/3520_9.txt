Shortly before dawn, the film's slasher appeared during the golden days. The slasher in the deep woods began with films like Friday 13, Burning and Mad. Just before dawn, one step ahead of the usual clicking slash. Cinematography is great. The game is top notch. The heroine of the film is not your typical “last girl”. <br /> <br /> Constance is a “forest” girl, but when it comes to the primary survival instinct, she is a step behind. Until we are talking about saving her life and her boyfriend, the original idea of ​​survival begins to spread. The subtle transition, which gradually focuses on the latent sexuality of the final girls, coincides with her desire to survive. br /> Just Before Dawn is not for everyone, but for a slasher fan, he is as close to perfect as you can get. The killer is very menacing - almost like a game to mutilate and kill anyone who crosses their territory. The final scene is a little crazy. For the first time for the viewer, this can be a bit shocking. I would recommend this to anyone who is a slasher fan. Even lovers of non-slasher will find something they like. The atmosphere is creepy and makes you feel awkward. The death sequences are not particularly bloody, but I'm not sure that the film needed blood. See it!
