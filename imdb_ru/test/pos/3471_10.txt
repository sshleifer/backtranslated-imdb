I think that this film was recommended to me by a woman from the store from where I hired him! This time she hit! What a great movie! First of all, I was convinced that James McAvoy and Romola Garai were Irish, so their accent was convincing; and halfway through the movie, I was completely convinced that Stephen Robertson was a disabled actor and was sure that James McAvoy was that too! When I watched special features on a DVD and saw both actors in their “normal” guise, saying that I was amazed would be an understatement !!! I can remember all the recognition of Dustin Hoffman in the 80s for his portrayal of autism in the film “Rain Man” - frankly (in my opinion, of course!) Stephen Robertson’s performance / performance hits Dustin Hoffman’s rights right out of the water - and he deserves recognition as such ! In general, one of the greatest images of human friendship / love / relationships in the entire history - and this was done in Britain / Ireland with domestic actors - stick it in your pipe and smoke this Hollywood!
