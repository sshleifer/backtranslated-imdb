This film is a Latin American godfather. An unlikely gangster bridges the gap with some unlikely alliances and forms an empire. I enjoyed the action and the shootings along with the daring play and the colorful characters. This film is not an Oscar winner, but definitely an interesting one. Hey, who needs an Oscar? <br /> <br /> Chapa has several balls for staging and acting (I think he also produced it?) in this film. Reminds me of another director who likes to do all this, Robert Rodriguez. Keep it up, is there any continuation in the works? There are a bunch of strings to link. Is the son returning and taking revenge on the pope for death?
