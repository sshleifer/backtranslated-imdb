The main reason I fell in love with this film was that it contained IMx (previously Immature). They were in House Party 3 when they were 11, but they all grew up already! I was a little shocked by some of the things they did in the film (almost ready to pull my hair out), but I should have realized that they were no longer my little boys. I think Chris Stokes did a pretty good job, considering that it was his first movie.
