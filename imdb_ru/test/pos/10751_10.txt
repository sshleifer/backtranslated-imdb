I really liked this old black and white radio. At first I did not recognize Harold Lloyd as Mr. Cobb, a missionary in China, who came home to find a wife. There were many twists and turns in Mr. Cobb's attempts to bring order to the city hall. His methods of bringing punishment in line with crime would probably be illegal, but this is not a film based on reality. It would be an ideal film for children, except that there is almost female nudity (cakes only on Grace Bradley)! Old phones are charming. The only mistake - a typical problem of the time - Caucasians are used to representing Chinese men. This is compensated for in a positive way by the Chinese. They are wise, kind and friendly guys. Quizzes - Bekins truck appears in the movie when police rush out of Black Marias.
