Wow. When I went to this film at the Toronto Film Festival, I had no idea what I was for. This film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster in the best sense of the word. Sigourney Weaver was better than I had seen her for years; Emil Hirsch was great, and Jeff Daniels broke my heart. I can see how this will not be a cup of tea for each person, as sometimes it deals with some rather harsh things that can happen to a family. Don't get me wrong - this is also very funny - at my show the audience burst into applause, laughing again and again. I just think that if you are open to exploring your own life, Imaginary Heroes will sincerely touch you. I can't wait until it comes out in cinemas.
