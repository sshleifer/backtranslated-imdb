Opera in the death camp: right here, right now! <br /> <br /> Ten years ago I read that a very special film was made about the polarization of our society. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. Did any non-professional actors like you and me play in his film? other. Atmosphere violence has been described as extremely realistic. Was it a film, a documentary? Both are in fact. <br /> <br /> Over the years I realized how hard it was to find it. Maybe I would, by coincidence? In any case, this is not an old story. I saw it recently. Impressive. My favorite world of art: Park of punishments is his name. I love this “documentary fiction”, this “true cinema”, this “reality show”, whatever. After all the shock films I saw, I achieved the best with this strong and intense cinematic experience. I found a masterpiece. Online enough information about the film. It is even bought on DVD, with extra things. The only words I want to add relate to my own experience with this film. I can only trust such a sincere and involved world of art about people and people, those who direct, act or look. Cinema, which is just a real human experience in an artistic adventure ?? or vice versa. <br /> <br /> So, I'm not talking about all the "torments" that we see on TV, especially about the "real show show" in which the concepts of people playing themselves are interesting, but are used foolishly and perverse . In the Park of Punishments we can see some real people living the way they are. We put them only in a very specific context, with a few lines to follow, and we allow them to be who they want to be. This is a kind of therapy, a way of "individuation" for those who are inside the film, as well as for active viewers in front of screens. Then, to finish, the director's touch edits a short and sweet film about the apocalypse, a desperate cry, “Opera in a death camp,” where some people run after cruel trials. The park of punishments is intended for those who want to grow. Watch this movie and get the opportunity to choose your moral. Grow and harmonize with it! If you can feel it! If you can see it !! In my case, the Park of Punishments stuck in me forever, with all my love, consciousness and will.
