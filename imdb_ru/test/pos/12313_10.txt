I believe that John Houston's “Dead” is a real classic. Not only was it the last Houston film, it is quoted as follows: “Everything I know about making a film in this film.” The story, closely adapted from the “Dubliners” by James Joyce, is a magnificent ensemble play, which presents the sterling performances of Angelica Houston, John’s daughter, and the cast of English and Irish actors who make history happen. This is a film that should be part of any serious collection, not only because it is visually elegant, but also because the story is timeless and very attractive. The film is in no hurry and is not charged with action. Rather, the story unfolds from within the characters, which bring light and meaning to the dialogue. The end of the film is stunning, poetic and haunting. I recommend The Dead, unconditionally, as one of the best films ever made.
