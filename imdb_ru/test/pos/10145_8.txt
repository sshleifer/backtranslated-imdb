This is another nice and interesting Hitchcock movie. James Stewart and Doris Day are incredible in this film. Bernard Herrmann seems to be close to climax himself. <br /> <br /> Landscape and locations are great, except for one scene at the beginning, where the background was clearly fake, which makes no sense to me, since the scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real shots locations I heard that Hitchcock did it on purpose. <br /> <br /> Reviews of this film seem mixed. I think this is Hitchcock's best movie. Very interesting, and at the end he has a great light comedic scene. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie as 8 out of 10. <br /> <br />
