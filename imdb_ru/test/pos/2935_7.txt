After wandering in the model industry (as a model), I watch this show with a slightly different look than most. Although I admit that ANTM can be a fun and exciting spectacle, it seems that it continues to move away from any reality as the season progresses. <br /> <br /> The show seems almost pure advertising to the participants, seeing that none of the show winners (or other participants) made a name for themselves from under the show umbrella. Perhaps this is because it’s true that any girl with real potential to be a high fashion model should not have much difficulty in applying to agencies (you can do this by email or regular mail if the distance does not allow you to take part in an open call agencies) signing a contract with an agency and starting a modeling career. Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but, obviously, ANTM. And participation in a reality show seems to give less impetus to the modeling business than concluding a contract with a leading or decent agency (which in any case has only one participant in each cycle). <br /> <br /> However, I found that the show could not hurt, of course, can be fun, and has a kind of magic that is especially suitable for teenage girls. Although, I have to add, ANTM can get a bit tedious and boring after watching a few cycles, as it has become for me. And besides some unrealistic situations (each one is more outrageous than the previous one), the only other annoyance is the excessive use of "Tyra, Tyra, Tyra!" Tyra seems to sincerely want to lead these girls to success, but is it necessary that the temporary excavations of each model be reflected in Tyra’s photographs; For almost every panel and task, include the story or scenario that “Tyra” has experienced and overcome? I think not. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, take away some of Tyra's, return to a little more reality, and ANTM can be a show of 10 stars instead of 7.
