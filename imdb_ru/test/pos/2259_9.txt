I saw it last night and voted for this "8." Since then, he grew up on me, and I would give him the number "9." <br /> <br /> The film has (at first) a slightly torn facade between the first and second halves. The first half is a comedy, and there is a small hint at the torn truths of the epochs, life, wars, religious intolerance, which will manifest in the second half. Although at first it may be a little embarrassing, because it is a bit of an unfamiliar narrative sequence, it works when thinking. <br /> <br /> The game was good (Halz as Alex, the translator, was especially good). <br /> <br /> I scanned most of the other “user comments” and I see that some who read the book are happy with the film, and some are not. Both feelings, of course, are valid. <br /> <br /> For me, the pensioner family psychotherapist and the corelord, the film was relevant at two different levels. <br /> <br /> First, as a story, gave a powerful reminder of how often polarizations occur - with demonization and an attempt to destroy any of those who have a slightly different system of moral values ​​than ours. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the demonstration of the first also showed something in common for EACH of us, ALL of our families - that each of us must return to our roots in order to more fully understand ourselves. <br /> TS Eliot gracefully expressed it in the 4th of his "Four Quartets" when he said: - "We will not stop research." And the end of all our research // Will come to where we started // And know the place for the first time. "<br /> <br /> Jonathan goes on an exciting journey that any of us can find fantastically illuminating - explore and discover their roots, what were the people who they really were! - before, when and in the first years before and after our birth? And so on. <br /> <br /> So the film first gives the impression of a comedy and then gives us a lesson in history and human shortcomings, but through all this he gives us - subconsciously - a message about each of All of us would have been richly rewarded to return and understand the place from which we first started.
