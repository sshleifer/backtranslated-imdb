I started watching this show by chance, but I like it. The fact that the main character is in a wheelchair is something that is lacking on television, especially for children's shows. My five-year-old nephew (like most children) just looked at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of disability, but after he watched Pelswick, it seemed normal to him. Every time he saw a wheelchair, he simply said “Like a Pelswick” and continued to do what he originally did. And yes, the animation is a bit rude, but if you can watch the Simpsons first season, it's not that bad. The genie is actually an angel that helps Pelswick learn from life. He CANNOT walk, someone else said that he could walk for a while, I saw every episode, and he, according to my recollections, never walked, he has paralysis that has no feelings under his armpits (he mentions this in episode). As for humor, if you can get a copy of the “Ntalented” episode that ignites boy bands, you will immediately love this show.
