Ocean 12 <br /> <br /> "If you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you." (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, “Die Hard”) <br /> <br /> This adage surely rings true in this sequel. Terry Benedict was told that Danny Ocean and his comrades were the ones who ripped him off, and now he wants it all back. The ocean gang needs a lot of money and fast, but it cannot work in the states, because Benedict made it impossible for them. So go to Europe to commit acts of death, defying theft, trying to avoid the super-police officer Catherine Zeta-Jones, the old flame from the past Rusty (Pitt). <br /> <br /> During their first robbery in Amsterdam, they find out that they were attacked by the Night Fox, a super smooth thief with a complex of legends. He challenges them, which can completely write off their debt or put them in some sequence of the Uma Thurman-Kill Bill type II-buried-living-type. Interesting? Well yes. Slow? It seems, as it were, something like. Entertaining? Basically. Unnecessary character development scenes? Lot. <br /> <br /> Ocean and his group of cheerful people are charismatic, to say the least, and since this is a continuation, and we are all old friends, we see much more “friendly” situations and conversations. Lots of. Linus Damon is more nervous than before; cousins ​​bicker as we knew; Bernie Mac speaks too much, and Don Cheadle's bloody accent is worse than ever (I really like Cheadle, but I couldn't bear it). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, filling each other’s glasses and reading each other’s thoughts. However, in the last film, the lack of character development worked so well compared to how smooth this whole damn opera was. And while these actors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tough 11-sided hole. She just does not fit, and her chemistry with Pitt does not exist. <br /> <br /> However, the stars of this film for me were Vincent Cassel as the Night Fox and Soderberg. Cassel plays pompousness and wealth, as if he was born in both. His Night Fox is arrogant, “a terrible gentleman with other people's lives” (Danny Ocean) and contrasts completely with the Ocean gang. This is where I think the film loses its way. Cassel and European locations provide too realistic a contrast with American actors and the style of the first film. We want a smooth, daring and quick-witted; not sandy, thoughtful and intelligent. This is where the movie doesn't work. <br /> <br /> It must be admitted that you cannot repeat the same formula twice to the letter, but going to the extreme left or right position usually does more harm than good in such a popular film
