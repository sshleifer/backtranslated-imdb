This, of course, is not the best movie. But this is definitely worth seeing for people with a special mind. So, those who love sadness and depression, scary fairy tales at night, wolves and real madness - welcome! If you find a copy, of course :) As for me, I could only endure it once ... But since then, Wolves, and Saint Lucy, and children's drawings, and headless Christ live in my nightmares.
