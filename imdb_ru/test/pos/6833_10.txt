Surprised to learn that the director (Sebastian Gutierrez) was a young Venezuelan (28) and he was tired of so many predictable films, I was delighted with the script showing so many little stories and clues distributed here and there. Directed with black humor and taste, I liked the tension between Boggart Rickman himself and the very natural, but beautiful Thompson. Every gang member deserves attention, Jill Bellows is at his best. Gugino is wonderful.
