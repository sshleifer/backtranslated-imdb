Brilliant Chuck Jones, the master of the comedy of comic strips Warner Bros., brings us the first (?) Pepe Lepe cartoon. Lane, tired of being pushed, paints himself in the colors of a skunk and with a healthy dose of Limburger turns the tables on his tormentors. Then Pepe comes, and you know the rest.

This cartoon of 1947 is one of the few examples of how Mel Blank puts his absolutely insane voice into Pepe's mouth. But the kicker is the final, where Pepe turned out to be an American “wolf in skunk clothing”! Must see! Classic Warner Bros ...
