I am impressed that "Greetings to a woman" was done altogether; This drama, released just a year after American women received a vote, makes a serious call against the double sexual standard, which judges women’s sexual behavior more strictly than men’s. <br /> <br /> AHEAD. The prologue, established in the Plymouth colony in 1621, depicts a pilgrim girl, sentenced to a duck's chair for flirting with a boy; The boy is not punished. Now we come to Flint Hill, New Hampshire in the present (1921). Oliver Beresford (Theodore Roberts) is a pompous interpreter of the Bible: what we call in Britain and Australia "God-fighter". Beresford is convinced that his son David (Lloyd Hughes) will become a preacher, no matter what David feels about this. As for Beresford's daughter Judith ... well, Beresford is sure that women are not so important as to be anything more than wives and mothers. Apparently, God told him this personally. <br /> <br /> David’s evangelical career is compromised when he infiltrates Nan Higgins, the stepdaughter of a local casual worker. (The character Tally Marshall is identified in the credits exclusively as “Strange Man,” but a close check shows that his name is Jake Higgins. The prejudices of 1921 require him to be a stepfather, Nan, not his biological parent. To save his son from scandal , Beresford redeems his stepfather Nana with a check. Nan leaves for the big city to forget herself as another unmarried mother. <br /> <br /> Judith is naturally alarmed at the restrictions imposed on her by her gender. (Or rather, according to the perception of others people.) She meets Gray's indhema (excellent performance by Edward Martinel), the author who encourages her to go beyond sexist stereotypes. But Judith is unofficially engaged to the local cad Joe Hurd, who will not tolerate such nonsense. Hearda plays Vernon Dent, a major performer who is now exclusively remembered on comedic roles (like the second banana for Harry Langdon and the villain in the films Three Stooges). He gives an excellent game here, in a role outside his usual range. Unfortunately, in real life Dent has spent his last years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. <br /> <br /> In the end, Judith ended up working in an orphanage. In 1921, I expected the orphanage to be only for whites, so I was pleasantly surprised when there was one Chinese boy in it. (And unpleasantly surprised when it is used as a butt for a racial joke.) The film makes one strange mistake here. In the Christmas episode, we see the hostess tell “The Visit of Saint Nicholas” ... but (in the title of the dialogue) she attributes six Deer to Santa Claus, not eight. Then follows a short animation sequence showing Santa with six deers tied to his sleigh. I assume that the animators (either by accident or to save money) left two deer, and the poem was corrected in the title page so that it corresponded to an error. <br /> <br /> Lloyd Hughes, as a rule, was a soft and not impressive actor. His most famous performance is his role in The Lost World, where the frantic Brontosaurus easily plays him out. For his climactic scene in “Greetings for a Woman,” Hughes gives an unforgettable performance, finally rising against the tyranny of her father. In the role of the father screaming at the gospel, Theodore Roberts is accused of replaying himself to such an extent that he makes his role a caricature. I do not agree: unfortunately, decades later after this film was shot, I continue to encounter "holy" fools, exactly the same as this man ... who wants to destroy the lives of everyone who surrounds them, and is firmly convinced that they have the authority of God for this. /> <br /> In the lead role Judith Beresford Florence Widor plays sensitively, realistically and intelligently. I usually don't like Widor, who usually starred in glamorous roles, but wasn’t good enough to justify them. Here the appearance of her character is less relevant than usual. <br /> <br /> This entire film is impressively produced by John Griffith Ray, a director who deserves to be known much better. Unfortunately, Ray died at the beginning of an era of colloquial speech, in his mid-thirties: if he had lived for another ten years, he would undoubtedly become the wheel of several early classical sounds. In Greetings to a Woman, there are several very beautiful on-screen tracks: I was particularly impressed by the scene in the New England forest when Vidor and Dent quarrel in front of a huge tree torn from the root. (I wonder where it was actually filmed.) “Greetings, woman” deals with an unpleasant subject, but it deserves to be much more famous, and I appreciate this ambitious drama 9 out of 10.
