I finally managed to see this film ... after so many years of waiting ... <br /> <br /> I was so curious to see how bad this film is, as some people say ... <br /> < br /> And I think that this film was not bad at all, on the contrary, it was AWESOME ... <br /> <br /> I enjoyed every second of this film ... from beginning to end ... <br / > <br /> The actors were great, they gave me the feeling that I live on the plot at the same time as the movie ... <br /> <br /> Landscapes were so beautiful when they were making a movie ... and he really fascinated me. In addition, the music was extraordinary, and I have nothing to blame <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I think the plot was very original, I don’t think that I saw such a film ... <br /> <br /> It’s a pity that it is not recognized all over the world ... badly for those who have not done this there is no opportunity to see it. i give this movie 10/10
