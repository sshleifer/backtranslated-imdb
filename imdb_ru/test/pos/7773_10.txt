This is necessary for everyone, but especially for African Americans. It's time to show the film, which tells about the problems arising in relations between African Americans. It also allows other cultures to see in a fictional, humorous way how positive African American relations are and their results instead of the undesirable stereotype from which the African American community suffers. I love this movie, which is a must see!
