When I went to see this documentary about the musicals of the communist bloc, I was expecting something completely insane in the spirit of the communist cop-rock. In some scenes this worked, including an encouraging video from the Soviet film “Tractors Drivers.” <br /> <br /> One might think that filmmakers set the task to create ideologically correct musicals that sing, dance and support the party line. face insurmountable odds. And yet, one of the surprises of the "Eastside story" is that some of the films presented really look promising. One of them was in eastern Germany in the mid-1950s called “My wife wants to sing,” in which, as the name implies, the unfortunate housefrau is trying to start a singing career because of the objections of her traditional-minded husband. <br /> <Another really interesting film, also from East Germany, was called “Midnight Review”. In this film, inside the film, the producers fake their own creative position with the story of a group of filmmakers on the orders of the party to make a musical. (The filmmakers themselves shoot a musical issue on how to avoid “too hot” plots, very much reminiscent of the 1957 film Silk Stockings.) fun to watch. (Look for the final dedication to the person who made it all possible.)
