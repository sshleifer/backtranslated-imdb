Forever Strong is a type of film that we have seen many times before, just in different genres. Anyway, I really thought it was a great movie, Sean Faris demonstrates the kind of potential that usually puts the actors on notice. Obviously, this film received a limited release, because I didnâ€™t even know about it, but I saw it in the video store and decided to take a chance with it after I remembered how Sean played Never Back Down. In the end, I made a great decision, I'm not a fan of rugby, but the film is not really entirely devoted to rugby, it's about how to take a decent position in your life, challenge yourself, achieve your goals. this is much more than a simple plot. First, we don't care about what is happening with Rick, he is talkative, full of himself and utterly arrogant; we feel that he completely decided his fate as a source of problems. As we see changes in his character, he begins to hang out with the best people, he begins to feel better, we find out what negative impact his father had on his life, this is just a great turn, and the film did a great job of turning Rick from the daring injection in a kindhearted man. <br /> <br /> Rugby in itself is not so bad at all, unlike what I played and saw in high school, in fact it was quite fun to watch and beautifully set. The gorgeous young cast, combined with some veteran experiences, helped this film a lot, it just did an incredible job of preventing what could be the tiniest, to a sharp and effective drama. I also liked the controversial contrast between The Coach | Garry Cole | and Rick | Sean Faris |, it created a very interesting storyline, and I liked to see how he helps Rick, while it was emotionally and warming at the same time. This is a real hidden gem, and I'm really glad that I discovered that it made me think about my life, and I often had something like that. <br /> <br /> Performances. Sean Faris is known as Rick Penning. He reminded me of an awful lot of young, daring Tom Cruise, but very charismatic and talented. It was a difficult role to turn from a talkative teenager to a kindhearted youth, but Sean managed it with sheer perfection. He clearly put his heart and soul into this film, so much thanks to Sean for putting so much effort into this wonderful film. Gary Cole is excellent as a preaching but cute coach who wants to help children. I have always found him pleasant, he is always present in his films. Neil McDonough is fantastic, as selfish, but under pressure father Rick. In most films, the script makes you believe that he is nothing more than a selfish bitter man who wants Rick to be exactly the same as him, but in the end you start to see how real he comes out, I felt sorry for him a bit. Julie Warner is a good actress, and she plays well a kind-hearted, but ignorant mother. Penn Badgley has to play a real jerk, and the boy, he ever, does it well. Many times I wanted to show him one, so I must say that this is a great performance. Ariel Kebbel - love interest is not so much, she did everything well. Nathan West plays a somewhat mysterious character, he coped pretty well. Shauna Astin is considered the main player of the film, but he barely does something, he does a good job with what he had to do. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Forever Strong is a great movie for well-being. will definitely make you stop and think that your life was much better than you thought. Do not let this pass you by, you will not regret it. <br /> <br /> 8 1/2/10
