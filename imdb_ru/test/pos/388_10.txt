Alfred Hitchcock shot many brilliant thrillers, and many of them were named as one of the greatest films of all time. One film that tends to be a little lost in Dizziness and Psycho is this film; Strangers on the Train, the most exciting movie Hitchcock has ever made. The story follows Guy Heyns, a tennis player and a man who will soon marry the daughter of a senator, if she can divorce her current wife. One day, on the way to his wife, he encounters the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony on board the train and is soon drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stop; and one that could end up costing his life. <br /> <br /> A train conversation between Bruno and Guy is one of the most intriguing and thought-provoking cinemas ever. What if two people “exchanged” murders, thereby eliminating all suspicions of a crime and making their motive inappropriate? Could this be a perfect kill? What makes this film even more frightening is that the events Guy leads to can happen to any ordinary ordinary person. Everyone has someone they would like to get rid of, so if you meet a crazy man on the train who will kill you for you and then force you to commit him? The probability that this will happen is unlikely, but the idea that anyone can be a murderer is central to the message of Strangers on a train; and in this situation, anyone could. <br /> <br /> Is there an actor on earth who could portray the character of Bruno Anthony better than Robert Walker? The man was just born for the part. He manages to catch only the right mood for his character and absolutely command every scene he is in. Bruno's character is crazy, but he's not crazy; he is a calculating, cunning man, and Robert Walker makes him believable. His game is extremely vicious, and yet understated enough to keep the hero firmly within reality. Unfortunately, Robert Walker died just a year after the release of "Strangers on the train," and I think this is a big loss for the movie. No one in the cast shines as much as Walker, but it's worth mentioning his film colleague Farley Granger. Granger is never particularly impressive, but his performance is good enough, and he opposes Walker. Also notable for his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person; and so it should be. Ruth Roman - Guy's wife. In fact, she is not in the film enough to make a lasting impression, but she makes the best of what she has. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, plays the last four main roles as Barbara, sister of the fiance Guy. In this role, she is pretty pretty and inclined to steal the many scenes in which she is. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock’s direction is always sublime, and this film is very noticeable. In particular, there is one shot in which the killing of the film takes place in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant frame that creates a great atmosphere for the scene. The direction of Hitchcock is capricious and very much in line with the style of the film noir. The culmination of the film is both spectacular and exciting, and I do not think that anyone other than Hitchcock could cope with the effect that was shown in this film. It is really bloated, and out of turn from the rest of the film; but it works. There is a reason that Hitchcock is often called the greatest director of all time, and the reason is that he not only uses the script to tell the story of the film, but he also uses the camera to do it. Strangers on the Train is one of the greatest thrillers. His story at the same time intrigues and makes you think and will surely please any movie fan. Masterpiece.
