At first it seems like a topical romantic film where a girl meets a boy and falls in love, but the point is that this film has a feeling that others do not have. When I first saw him, I could not see it complete, because I had to leave. But as I walked, I thought I should see it again, but I had no chance at that time. A year passed until I saw this film on a non-free channel, I saw it and recorded it too. I saw it once, twice ... up to 200 times and not kidding. I knew all the dialogues by Hart, and I donâ€™t know why, but I saw it every day and never missed. And I must say that I am not used to watching a movie more than twice. Actor is very good. Gerard Depardieu is a talented actor, and Katherine Heigl too. I would like her to make a good movie because I think she can handle it. This is a film that I can not get out of my head.
