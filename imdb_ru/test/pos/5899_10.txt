I watch this movie every time he plays on TV. Just a brilliant movie. Three men are returning home from the war and with great difficulty trying to return to a peaceful life. All three led the opposite life during the war (the executive banker became a military corporal, the moron became the captain of the Air Force, and the hero of the Higher School of Football loses both hands in battle), and now everyone must restore his life and connect with the new reality. The houses they return to with adult children and independent working women, together with a depressed economy, only exacerbate the conflict. These are scenes taken from the camera, and an unspoken dialogue that sounds the loudest. The embarrassing closeness of Frederich March and Mirna Loy and his struggle to return to their place as leader (both at home and at work) are heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews fusses like a handsome, decorated captain who fights to keep his life together without uniform. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with honest characters, and each is depicted as a gifted actor. <br /> <br /> This film, however, took on a whole different level upon seeing “Salvation of Private Ryan”. The reality and scope of what these people experienced for the sake of love and the country ... and, obviously, it did not end on the battlefield. <br /> <br /> This is important for any collection. <Br /> <br />
