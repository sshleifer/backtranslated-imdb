Mishima - life in four chapters, in my opinion, the best film of Paul Schrader so far. Hypnotizing cinematography, accompanied by Philip Glass's mystical musical score, added a completely magical aura to the story of one of Japan’s greatest writers, whose originality and pictorial narrative are beautifully depicted in this picture. Like any gifted character, Mishima was concerned about serious conflicts with himself, the main one being the conflict between the “pen and the sword,” as the director talks about in his last chapter, or the sensitive poet’s struggle with homosexual feelings living in centuries-old military traditions, thus widening the gap between the sensitive and belligerently traditional side of Mishima himself. <br /> <br /> All Schroeder films (and those for which he wrote scripts) are mostly stories about internal conflict within a person who does not belong to the environment in which he lives. This also applies to Mishima, who, besides his upbringing in the Japanese military school, was brought up on the love of the theater and the words. His demise consisted of both of these key moments in his life, the words were about the words and theatrical ending of all life. Such films appear from time to time, and most will have to wait a lifetime to achieve this beauty. 20 out of 10 !!
