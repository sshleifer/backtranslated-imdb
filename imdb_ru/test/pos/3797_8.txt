In this era, when almost everything is on DVD (I expect to see the collection of My Mother the Car now), this film is undeservedly neglected. There are countless silly comedies from the 60s, as well as many other epochs that have received at least a quick preview of the DVD. As far as I know, this film was not even released on VHS, despite the talents involved in the creation (Arthur Hiller, Eli Wallach, Ann Jackson, Murray Shisgal (later known for co-writing Tutsi), even Dustin Hoffman in his debut). This is obviously a product of the sixties, but just like everything else from that era. All films reflect the tastes and customs of those times in which they were made. It was released the same year as Presidential Analyst, another absurd masterpiece. This film was finally released on DVD and received a cult of fans. There are many unforgettable, bizarre, wacky moments in this film. Sure, it is painted in broad strokes and has silly go-go music everywhere, but this is part of its charm. He creates his own absurd universe. If the person responsible for producing DVDs for Columbia Pictures releases (I think Columbia released it) takes part in surveys for new releases, it gets my vote.
