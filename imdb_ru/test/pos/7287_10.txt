I really liked this movie! This is my favorite number one. Although there were a few flaws (which film has no flaws?), This film was very well written, directed and produced. The characters in this film are very real and believable. They made all the characters fit a certain role. I think the most obvious thing in “Here on Earth” was a love triangle, as well as other emotional situations that were brought into the film. This is not one of those films in which you simply can not relate to anything, because in such situations, all are or were in it. There are so many different things going on in this film that it’s hard not to have to do with it. I am only 18 years old and I can even relate to this. It was warming and heartbreaking at the same time. "Here on Earth" will make you laugh, cry, and sometimes get angry. I give this film an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion!
