I know that many people said that you don’t need to worry about this movie, because it’s not a good combat movie with hardcore subtitles. This is really a lazy way to think about a movie. If you want to focus on this part of the film, you must find something else, and also learn to respect cinema as an art form, this is a workshop. If you want to watch it, it's not a fight. Sometimes there are good battle scenes that are filmed fairly well with good camera work, but the story itself is what unites the story and is an important part. This is not the main Kung Fu movie. The plot is really the center of attention, not fights, and their combination makes an excellent film that is worth seeing, and even better in the original language with subtitles.
