Hello from the dark again. Based on a mega-bestseller by author Khaled Hosseini, the film gives us the pinnacle of the ugliness of the post-Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the Taliban terror. Directed by Mark Foster adds the pearl to his resume, which already includes "Monster's Ball", "In Search of the Neverland" and "Stranger than Fiction." <br /> <br /> The story of the young friends of Amir and Hassan and the unknown link they share in the next generation. This is a story of honor, courage and loyalty, and this is an unusual story of adulthood. Several wonderful scenes with the boys when they were children, and then a couple of truly amazing scenes when Amir, as an adult, returns to find the imprisoned son Hassan. <br /> <br /> This is a tough, convincing story telling a message. Acting is everywhere, no actor steals a screen. Although it is not a pleasant story to unfold, it is certainly significant and felt by the heart. Plus a quick shot of Midnight Oil playing in a billiard room is a welcome gift.
