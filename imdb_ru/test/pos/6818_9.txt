This short film has all the elements of a great movie. Every time I show it to my friends (on the DVR), they love it too. The dialogue is real. The game is great. Although the effects / details were not so convincing in themselves, taken with everything else in the frame, they are skillfully placed / used. The music is so intrusive, ideal for such an "instant" movie. People who value their beliefs and thoughts are shocked to the depths of the soul by what they see in this film. Most of them say: “That's it?”, But in the end they bloom with new understanding and leave the film in one word to describe it: <br /> <br /> “Great.” The beauty of the film is also deep. I like the fact that there are no contradictory views, no other voices, and the voices that you hear agree with each other. there is no conflict, but at the same time there is one. And the final made me love it more! The harsh reality is sometimes more worthy of a movie than any plot device or twist. <br /> <br /> (wasn't Joshua Leonard a guy in the Blair Witch project?) :) A fictional dead guy movie .. Great!
