An extremely constricting vision of a military situation where a couple from Vargtimmen (okay, they have different names and starting situations, but the actors are the same) gets caught in the crossfire of two fronts. The portrayal of the belligerents as faceless, higher authorities is often imprinted on sublime surrealistic paintings and draws interesting parallels with Orwell 1984, even if Bergman violates this context on a personal level with a slowly growing spousal war. That is why countless fundamental and philosophical questions concerning the marriage of Eve and Yang are relevant and significant, while the threat and danger from external tears open up the abyss in the inner part, which used to be heavily covered with bragging. Intense allegory on the fragile facades of civil conventions.
