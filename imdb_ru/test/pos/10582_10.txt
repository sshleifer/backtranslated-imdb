Well, let me deal with this for you ... Haggard is probably one of the funniest and pointless movies you've ever seen. It has a mixture of a unique storyline about a guy who has problems with a girlfriend and what happens to him in the opposite direction, mixed with countless humorous scenes that will make you laugh throughout the movie, mostly if you saw a donkey or the CKY series, you would know what to expect from humor, considering that there are most people from those films in it. All in all ... I just had to give him 10/10, because this is one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> ~ F0rs4k3n <br /> <br /> (P.S.) Haggard rules!
