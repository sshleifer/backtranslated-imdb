In my analysis of Trois couleurs: Blanc, I wrote that his tone is much lighter than Trois couleurs: Bleu. I think the same with this movie. This time it is not because of the tragic comedy element, but much more because of the main character, Valentine. Although her boyfriend lives abroad and is ridiculously jealous of her, she manages her life with ease and optimism, it seems to me that she may be the image of Kislovsky for carefree youth. The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, grumpy old man, who is experiencing great solitude. In my opinion, Valentine and the judge are very similar to each other, the judge is much older and survived even more disappointments. They have different naivety, and they both discover that they can learn a lot from the other. Finally, I would like to highlight the performance of Irene Jacob, she completes a series of amazing female contributions to the Three Colors trilogy.
