Gray can make English jump through hoops like no other. He talks about a number of events related to his writing of the manuscript (the “monster” from the title), some sad, some ridiculously funny, all in his characteristic sarcastic manner. If you liked "Swimming in Cambodia", you will like this one. I actually thought it was a little more interesting and better narrated than "Swimming in Cambodia." A real masterpiece.
