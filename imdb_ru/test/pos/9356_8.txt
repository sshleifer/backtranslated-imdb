A man named Joseph Samuels was found brutally murdered in his apartment. It seems that Samuels was visited by a group of drunken soldiers the night before, and with one of them seemingly missing, the evidence would undoubtedly point to the missing soldier. But when Detective Finley goes into this business, he discovers that they can bark on the wrong tree and that this crime is dealing with something desperately sad and nasty, anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> Crossfire was born of a novel written by Richard Brooks, adapted by John Paxton and director of the insightful Edward Dmtrick, “Crossfire” (originally titled The Cradle of Fear) —a tight and exciting picture that bravely fights anti-Semitism. The fact that the creators were forced to soften the story from the original source, the novel about homosexual hatred as opposed to anti-Semitism, and what remains, thanks largely to Commander RKO Dore Shari and producer Adrian Scott, is a kind of creeping concern that drips from the Noir style. <br /> <br /> In the cast of three Bob, Young, Mitchum and Ryan, and dear Noir Gloria Graham adds an emotional female heart. That is only the third account, this is a picture of Robert Ryan completely, his image as an intimidating, indulgent Montgomery - from the main draw and perfectly demonstrates the talent that he had in abundance. Ryan had a good reason to give Montgomery a better job, since he served in the Marine Corps with Richard Brooks himself, both discussed the possibility that if the novel should be turned into a movie ?, Ryan wanted to play Montgomery, thus Ryan’s career was born as a caress like! Gloria Graham also makes a wonderful and soulful turn, which is all the more remarkable since at the time she was tormented by her abusive husband. Stanley Clements was known to have abused her, and his constant presence around filming irritated others in the cast, but Graham, perhaps conveying real-life emotions, became Ginny's character and really shone very brightly. Both Bob Mitchum and Bob Young come out in bright colors to really make a deal about which Crossfire is actually a clever picture. <br /> <br /> The fact that Crossfire was released earlier than the other anti-Semitic picture of 1947, the Gentlemen Agreement, and raked more than a million and a quarter dollars at the box office, part of its thunder was stolen by the winning Studio Oscar film from Fox Studio. Nominated for the best photo, best supporting male role, best supporting female role, best director and best screenplay, he won nothing, but critics of that time rated him as a brilliant shift in American cinema, and today he stands proud and dark. as a bold and excellent piece of work. 8.5 / 10
