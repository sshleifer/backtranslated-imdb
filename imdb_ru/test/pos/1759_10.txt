I first watched it in black and white in the early sixties, when it was shown on British television. I was completely intrigued and watched it again when it was repeated on TV (perhaps only two or three times, as it happens - if then we had video recorders!). <br /> <br /> As outlined by other participants, the plot describes the return of Khoppiti the Grasshopper, after a period of time, to the American city of the forties. He believes that everything is not the way he left, and his good friends of insects (who live in the "lowlands", right behind the garden, owned by the songwriter and his wife), are now threatened by "people" who trampling down the broken a fence that precedes the property, using it as a label. <br /> <br /> Homes of insects are smoothed with their feet, and often burned with discarded cigar stubs and matches. Old Mr. Bumble and his beautiful daughter Hani (baby Hoppity as a child) are in grave danger of losing their honey store to this threat. <br /> <br /> In order to exacerbate their problems, the treacherous insect property magnate C. Bagley Beetle has romantic pictures on the honeybee itself and hope with the help of his minions "Hit the fly and smack of the mosquito" to make Bumble stretch out his hand in marriage. <br /> <br /> Will the heroic and fearless Khoppity win the day, and will the beetles be able to save the community from their mean fate, and especially its precious honey from it? Enjoy classic songs (“Katy Did, Katy Did't” is an excellent, swinging, upbeat example) and colorful visual effects that unfold in a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Time has not dulled my fascination with this masterpiece of animation and storytelling, and I was very pleased to know that it was released for video, although I later learned that it was in NTSC PAL format. Never mind, I immediately sent for video, and only then I bought a portable TV / video combination (complete with NTSC playback). <br /> <br /> Since then, I have enjoyed many nostalgic screenings, and even found that television rights have changed from the BBC (which told me that it’s unlikely to ever show a film on any of its stations) on FilmFour which (finally!) showed it on its digital stations in early 2007. <br /> <br /> My granddaughter (at the age of three) was absolutely fascinated when we watched her together - and this is a child who was influenced by the digital age and the products created on the computer! <br /> <br /> I would like to Carefully recommend this film for any age, especially for the youngest viewers. <br /> <br /> Give Max Fleischer a posthumous Oscar!
