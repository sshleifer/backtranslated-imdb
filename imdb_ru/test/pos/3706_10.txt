Mom really needs to be given a different name to distinguish it from all other films called “Mom” or with the word “Mom” in the title. <br /> <br /> This is a film about a zombie that far surpasses most trash. it happens from time to time, and everything ends up just like any other zombie movie. <br /> <br /> It is so different and refreshing that it almost defies classification. <br /> <br /> A kind old woman who takes a creepy guest who just turns out to be a flesh eater who then infects an old woman who also turns into a zombie eating flesh or a ghoul, which is not exactly defined. <br /> <br /> In this story, there is pathos, as her son understands who she has become, and, at first, terrified, tries to help her by supplying “food”. (I will not talk about this anymore, for fear of inserting a spoiler!) This is one of those “silent” films, as opposed to weapon explosions, raging explosions, car chases, etc. , but still with enough bloody moments to satisfy horror fans, while at the same time bringing sadness to the story, along with pleasant touches of humor, as opposed to the sheer stupidity of some so-called horror films. <br /> <br /> There It is a particularly pleasant atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film, where an elderly woman sits alone in her room alone with her Christmas tree for the company and looks so “innocent”, but how she becomes !! Oh my God! <br /> <br /> The pearl of the film, and even if not your thing, should be viewed at least once by any true fan of horror.
