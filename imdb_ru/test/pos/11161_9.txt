In contrast to the previous correspondent here, I thought that “Shoppen Munich” (as announced when it was shown with English subtitles here in London at the German Film Festival in November 2007) was very funny, very well played and well written. > <br /> It’s pretty bold to invent a 100-minute film that consists solely and tirelessly of talking heads. But I think Ralph Westhoff has succeeded with wit and Alan. There are no standard cinematographic techniques, for example, following the heart-rending pronunciation of a character with some meditative minor seventh chord music and long cuts of nature. But when someone said something that opened their souls - well, a man with a timer for another superficial presentation forced us. This, of course, is the essence: the assertive tick of the superficiality of thirty-year-old city dwellers, where it all comes down to a quick question and answer. <br /> <br /> Perhaps most of the films are so stupid and stupid that we, the British, are ready to laugh at any vague and unbridled cinema, but I can promise you that tonight at the show (Curzon Cinema, Sun November 25, 2007 d) most of the viewers burst out laughing for most of the movie. Thus, I was not the only deceiver! <br /> <br /> My girlfriend (who speaks German and lived in Munich) thought it was fun. I (who do not speak German and were not in Munich, I think) thought it was fun. I would recommend Shoppen (Munich) to all (especially couples ...) looking for an intelligent, witty, original, wise film about the superficiality of modern relationships and the bewilderment of a generation who feel they have missed a happy first time. <br /> <br /> nb. On the show with English subtitles in London, the subtitles (which were very good) were shown completely under a slightly smaller picture, and not inside it. I thought it was good.
