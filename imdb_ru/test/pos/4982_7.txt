The Violent Men is a pretty good Western, which certainly benefits from its excellent line-up. <br /> <br /> Edward G. Robinson is a big rank owner, trying to squeeze out smaller ranch owners, one of whom is Glenn Ford. Ford is ready to sell to reassure his fiancé (May Winn), until Robinson’s ambitious brother (Brian Keith) will kill one of Ford’s hands. Then you know what happens next. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwick, as Robinson's schemer, plays the same role she specialized. Dianna Foster plays her daughter, who admires Ford. <br /> <br /> “Violent people” - no more than the plot of “B” with the actors from the film “A”, but this is very well done.
