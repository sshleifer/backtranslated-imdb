If you are in the middle of a brutal war, and it is still not clear that you are going to come out on top, among the things you’ll worry about is to maintain the morale of civilians ... to demonstrate that our troops have the courage, resourcefulness and dedication , to overcome all the chances of a noble cause. And this is exactly what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with the 1943 naval film Immersion at Dawn. After more than 60 years, it is not surprising that some films are dated. It does not help that class stereotypes that help identify military officers from among officers can be confusing. Here, as in many other British military films, men invariably stand out strong accents of the regional working class, while officers speak with an educated fluency, which allows them to stay at home in the best institutions of the ruling class in England. In this film, Freddie Taylor (John Mills), captain of the Sea Tiger submarine, intelligent, confident, resourceful, aggressive, controlling, good with his people, humorous towards his peers, quick to make a decision. And it helps that he was lucky. His people are funny tars, mostly competent in their work and always ready to joke when the situation becomes tense. Although we spend the first third of the film, getting to know these people while they are on vacation, after that everything quickly strains. <br /> <br /> Taylor and his submarine were ordered to destroy the new German battleship Brandenburg. They just miss the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and heads for the Baltic. Taylor assesses the risks and decides that the Sea Tiger will follow him through minefields, anti-subnet and with a real risk of lack of fuel to return to base. After several tense situations, opposition occurs. The sea tiger produces six torpedoes, but he has to dive, not knowing if he has done his job. After a tricky trick, Taylor outwitted a couple of German destroyers, but then he realized that there was not enough fuel. He plans to flood his submarine and surrender when at the last moment James Hobson (Eric Portman), a sailor who was moody and lonely and speaks German, says that there is a small Danish coastal village that was the fuel depot. He thinks it may still be for the Germans. The last third of the film is an inspiring sequence of actions, as the submarine crew is trying to delay the Germans long enough to pump enough fuel to deliver the Sea Tiger back to the UK. This is a wartime propaganda film, so don’t expect failure. And did the Sea Tiger really crush Brandenburg? Are men reunited with their wives and lovers? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and little son that left him smiling this time? Did Freddie Taylor finally have the opportunity to use all these female names in his little black book? You will have to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> There are propaganda films about the war and propaganda films about the war. Some, such as “One of Our Planes Has Gone” and “The 49th Parallel” by Powell and Pressburger, still stand watching today, because the stories are hard and unexpected, and the creators did not use obvious shorthand cliches. Others, such as We Dive at Dawn, were made with enough clichés, and when we watched, we had to remind ourselves how awful the time was when the movie was made. However, Asquith can create a lot of uncertainty even with a few cliches. The sea tiger made his way through the subnet was tense. The Brandenburg pursuit and plot required to fire a torpedo was realistic; The disgusting attitude of John Mill, when he was preparing to attack, was well handled. The fake preparations for the Sea Tiger to look as if it had been destroyed by deep charges were as realistic, both inside and out, as you might have hoped, and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war movie, but it is a well-made, well-played example of its type and time. <br /> <br /> John Mills, it is worth noting, had a long and long career. Especially in the fifties, he played in many serious films, recalling those days of World War II. He had the quality to show firmness, resilience and perseverance, but also to be a trustworthy person whom England could be proud of when he fought in the war. The main thing in this film was Eric Portman, a wonderful actor with a unique voice and the ability to look so cold that you want to wear a sweater. Everything in the subwoofer is very humorous, but hard, but Portman manages some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman did a great job on this movie.
