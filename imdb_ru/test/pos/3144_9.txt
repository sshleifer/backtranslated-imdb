I saw this movie the same night when I saw 6 other shorts. This one was one step ahead of others in terms of the quality of the action, the direction, the filming, and the originality of the story. This is combined with professionalism, which is often lacking in short films. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent short film for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Amazing performances. Two actresses are both compelling and believable. Their chemistry is palpable; the depth of their relationship is transmitted, although the film lasts 10 minutes. The play and direction are very powerful. <br /> <br /> 2. Beautifully shot. Lighting, framing, and overall shooting are astounding. The 35 mm film distinguishes this film from other shorts. And what a difference. Filming is worthy of this film. <br /> <br /> 3. Strong story. Often short films try to do too little or too much over time. Or they are trying to tell a predictable story. This is a good balance to tell you an interesting story, not delaying it for too long and not leaving you unsatisfied. You are wondering what will happen next, and at the same time you feel that you have seen something happening. <br /> <br /> Good score too. Compliments without frills. <br /> <br /> If you can find it at the festival, try to see it.
