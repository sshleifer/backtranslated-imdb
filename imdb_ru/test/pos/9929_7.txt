Often regarded as the last “great” film by Argento, this recording in the Jallo channel is undoubtedly better than any subsequent film by Argento (although I haven’t yet watched “Mother of Tears”), but to call it his last “great” film is perhaps a little stretches. <br /> <br /> The directorial and stylistic flourishing - the hallmark of all Argento films - is indeed present, with some of his sequences of obscurity standing on par with his best (“peephole” sequence) is especially memorable), and Ronnie Taylor’s cinematography is outstanding (fluorescent lighting is great). <br /> <br /> However, the narrative, which is a hit in all the films of Argento, is missing here. Indeed, there is a powerful sense of mystery and intrigue, but the plot resorts to what is essentially a sequence of murder sequences, one after another, without leaving real time to completely build a correct, targeted secret that needs to be solved. All this leads to a climax, which is ... well ... anti-climatic, because the film did not show enough interest to make us really care. <br /> <br /> Despite this, it is recommended simply because of the masterful direction and beautiful images that Argento causes. However, I would not recommend this as a starting point for Argento films (for this I would recommend either “Deep Red” or “Suspiria”), but if you liked them, or even some giallo, then this is a very good addition. to your viewing repertoire.
