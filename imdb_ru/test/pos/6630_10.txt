This is a heartbreaking film, and it moves tirelessly. Nevertheless, it is completely unique among war films, because it focuses solely on civil experience, the loss of humanity to ordinary people during a war. Two young married musicians undergo a slow, painful process of degradation at the hands of both sides of the civil war. This film, completely devoid of sentimentality, offers a dark vision of the modern world, and I believe that many Europeans will especially recognize it. With bold, intense speeches, Liv Ullmann (never better) and Max von Sydow (also). For my money, the most indelible film that Bergman ever created.
