This film is fun, bright and insightful. Although, perhaps, the story will work well with the participation of almost any ethnic group, the inherent Jewish characters gives an additional sense of the generosity of a wonderful dialogue. There were so many social issues in the story that for this reason alone it would be worth seeing; But the real treasure was in a warm laugh that spread throughout the grateful audience. A mixture of complex characters with their various strengths and weaknesses plays their roles with all the pathos and humor that one would expect from Shakespeare's drama, their life seems to parody. This is a film about the family; - about the often fragile, sometimes invisible combination of various personalities and lifestyles, first among brothers and sisters and parents, and inevitably among a large family of friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film gave the film a pace and development that keep the viewer intrigued to the final scene. Peter Falk, as always, is amazing in his role as patriarch of the family of Morris Applebaum. Strong performances of excellent composition include an unexpected guest. Do not miss this movie!
