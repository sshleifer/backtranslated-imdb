I was not sure what to expect from “driving lessons” - I didn’t know if Rupert Grint could play such a role, but in the first few minutes I was completely hooked. The music, acting and scenery were absolutely amazing. Julie Walters, as always, perfectly played the eccentric old actress Evie, and Rupert Grint is equally good as the romantic Ben. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, I was forced into involuntary bells, bursts of laughter and fanning joy, when Ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend, Evie. A very controversial story, perhaps rather exaggerated, but nevertheless one of the best films I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a good British film and evening to fight back and just enjoy
