Quite a funny parody with great attention to detail: the appearance of spy movies of the 1960s and how the action took place then. The sequence of the fight in the hotel room was a whistle, and the cast was perfect with Peter Lorre's twin added to the mix of villains. A big plus: Jean Dujardin is hot, and the scene in which he is shirtlessly connected was the highlight. Plus, his eyebrows deserve some recognition for their excellent work. <br /> <br /> It's funny: people behind me in the theater continued to choke after each plot twist, as if they were watching a “real” spy thriller. <br /> <br /> Before the beginning of the movie, the trailer for "Get Smart" was shown on the screens. The preview made the film look embarrassingly bad with unsuccessful attempts to incorporate jokes and jokes from the series. It looks like a bomb and quite contrasts with the relatively elevated jokes and gags of the OSS 117, although, of course, there was a fraction of misfire in the OSS. The overall tone of the OSS, however, was not an insult to the audience, and the material did not feel as if it were “dumbfounded.” I had the distinct impression that if I understood the language, I would have caught more jokes, and one of them (the pistol prefix) was misinterpreted when interpreting the subtitles.
