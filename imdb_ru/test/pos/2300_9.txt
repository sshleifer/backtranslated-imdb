This particular title is very interesting. the whole movie was like watching a ninja rpg that is really cool. three magic swords, three clans, a terrible demon, political power, yotodena has everything. the animation is decent but slightly grainy, the story is top notch, and the battle scenes are really cool. One thing that really looks good in this movie is monsters. they are pretty fancy. If you like the rules of the blood and the ninja scroll, then you should look at iododen.
