Meatballs penetrate conversations like no other movie. Especially in summer. Whether it's a song about CITS (Counselors In Training), abbreviations, Rudy the Rabbit's inspirational talk or “It just doesn't matter” ... it appears! Poor Mickey / Morty, who knows where he will wake up next time!?! Such a great picture of the seventies and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand that non-PC is really fun, whoever you are! Wheels and Spaz are favorites, as well as hot dog eating competitions with the famous line "what ..? No mustard?" Oh, how many times I repeated this line and was the only one who laughed! Thanks to the writers, actors and directors! Applause, applause!
