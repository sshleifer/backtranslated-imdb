This is a wartime drama - World War II, with the French, Jews and Germans, but this one is somehow fun, sincerely like that. Directed by Jean-Paul Rappenau co-wrote the script for his well-deserved film “The Good Way” (2003). Unlike “Safe Behavior” by director Bertrand Tavernier, known as “Laissez-passer” (2002), “Gloomy Sunday” by Rolf Schuebel (1999) or “Lucy Aubrac” by Claude Berry (1997), “Good Way” is also cheerful, as its name sounds - C'est La Vie (whatever) - and we have to thank wonderful talented Isabelle Adjani. It was her delightful performance everywhere, as the center of attraction (and attention), the cause and effect of all this, that made the film as enjoyable as it is. Damn it, that another undermining of her plan and expectations - will worry about it another time. The basis of the story revolves around a pair of young enthusiasts: Gregory Deranger as Frédéric and Virginie Ledoyen (from “8 women” by François Ozon) as Camille. The incomparable Gerard Depardieu, the witty Ivan Attal (from “My wife is an actress”) and the universal Peter Coyote (juggling French, English and German here) are some of the star compositions involved. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of characters coming and going in this plot of the film, and how all this is juggled is a skillful skill that does not require analysis - Rappeno is just a genius. The story is simply built on itself, one episode after another, or even on overlapping events, but never confusing - this is all charm, for some reason, every detail is right on the screen, and we just collect everything as a delicious French dessert, literally So. There are thrills, trills, tender hesitant moments and tightly ominous shoots, everything is played out before our eyes. <br /> <br /> After reading the Director's Note on the official website of Sony Pictures Classics Bon Voyage, Rappenau declared that this was his most personal and successful work in history. The image of Bordeaux in 1940 from the memories of his childhood years is very close to his heart, and he "worked and reworked the script for almost 3 years." This film - the work of love everywhere, the actors and the film crew complement the director's passion and the formidable script of the joint authors, together with the director and his son Julien - efforts to adapt Gilles Marchand, Patrick Modiano and Jérôme Tonnerre. <Br /> <br /> Gabriel Yared's music (different in sound from previous scores in films such as The English Patient or The Talented Mr. Ripley), which provided a suitable theme that kept up the pace and rhythm of the plot - almost like a train , going non-stop, reflecting Ajani Vivian’s lively energy (even when she is tired), maintaining her movement when she meets everything that comes, walking with her head high and stylish outfit always, without looking back, not to mention time for regrets. <br /> <br /> Ah, don't forget about the wonderfully translated skillful subtitles of Jan Burley, who also did subtitles for films in Italian: “Bread and Tulips” (2000) aka Pane e tulipani, “Last Kiss” "( 2001) aka L'ultimo bacio, and Tom Tykwer's "Heaven" (2002). <br /> <br /> If you think this is too light a drama about wartime relations, try Mex Faberbeck's "Aimée and Jaguar" (1999 , in German, based on a true story) with brilliant performances by Julian Köhler as Amy and Maria Schroeder as Jaguar.
