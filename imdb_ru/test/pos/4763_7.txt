I think that cinematic origin can go like this. Please note, because I had to see it. In 1967, Peter Yates, a former race car driver, shoots a film of the English caper "Robbery", the most exciting part of which is a car chase through the streets of London, through the alleys, where crowds of children and all that play. This is a success. <br /> <br /> A year later, Yeats directs the “Bullet” with Steve McCul in the lead role, I mean McQueen, with another even more impressive car chase up and down the hills of San Francisco with stunningly authentic engine sounds . which seem to include dual clutch, all-wheel drive cams, silencerless, 12-cylinder engines under 40-foot cowls, supercharged, supercharged, and all five thousand horsepower running at full speed. Lots of shots of McQueen's chewing gum, frowning as he tries to drive another car off the highway, although a passenger of another car pulls a gun. Persecution delivered by Philip D'Antoni. Bill Hopkins drives a crime car. <br /> <br /> After a year or two, feeling well, Bill Friedkin runs the French Connection, chasing between the commanding police car (Jean Hackman) and the overhead vehicle. train in new york. A lot of Hackman's cursed shots when he fights with a battered car through the streets. Persecution delivered by Philip D'Antoni. This is followed by Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> Feeling good, another year or two will bring us "Seven Ups", where you will see the chase between the car, driven by Roy Shader, with a lot of cursed faces Shader. He is trying to crash into another car driven by Bill Hopkins from the road, although the criminal car, of course, carries the passenger with a shotgun. There are no hills in New York, only bumps, but they are still sharp enough to lift cars a few feet. The chased car shouts around the corner and rushes along the street on which dozens of children play. Pictures of screaming children who scatter along the sidewalk and allow the car to pass. But one time is not enough. The children immediately run back into the street and must repeat the retreat for the pursuing police car with Shader. <br /> <br /> I once witnessed high-speed pursuit on the streets of Philadelphia. Both the criminal and the policemen drove through the streets at a speed of about 25 miles per hour, approaching the stops at each stop and red light sign - very boring compared to this film. <br /> <br /> By the way, about this movie, it's very good. "Robbery" and "Bullet" were great. All dressed neatly. But New York films are dirty. There is rubbish everywhere, and the subway cars are covered with graffiti. Skirmishes and beatings take place in free sites surrounded by destroyed brick buildings or in landfills for industrial freezers. <br /> <br /> The game is also pretty good. Roy Shader seems to be a whippet smooth. Other actors have faces made for the camera, especially Richard Welch. And the story is interesting, if not completely unfamiliar. What is best in the film is how it captures New York in its almost total indifference to human depravity and nobility. At the funeral, the limousine drivers stand with their collars raised, butts sticking out of their mouths, squeezing cold legs, which are completely bored during the ritual. The film wants us to believe that The Seven Ups is an elite group of untouchable police who stop at nothing to get the job done, and here it is a little sold off. It seems that they always threaten to do something unethical and illegal - to beat a suspect or cause physical damage to a hospitalized and helpless hood - but they always manage to avoid it. (If they really did, their characters would become realistic and ambiguous, and we would prefer that our heroes and villains have a more biblical character.) Very nice, even if you saw it before, and you may well have one or another of his previous incarnations.
