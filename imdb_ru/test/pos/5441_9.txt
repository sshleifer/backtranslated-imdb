Robin Williams is a genius. One of the best comedians in the world. In this, he really boasts jokes left and right in the role of a comedy talk show Tom Dobbs. From the previous one, it looked as if it was a ridiculous celebration of laughter. And it was funny. But there were many serious roles in the film that I did not expect. I would describe it as a drama / comedy. But it still costs money to see, and I still found it almost everything I expected. Robin Williams at his best with the famous Christopher Walken. In this film, they play a very good team, and I was shocked to see how well they both can work together. I recommend it to anyone looking for a carefree movie.
