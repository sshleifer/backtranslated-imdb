In 2023, in a world ruled by the economic interests of great corporations (not people or the will of politicians), Kam (Bobby Phillips) is a hybrid of a person and an agent of IBI (International Bureau of Investigation). She is designated as “sub” (from a subman), and her genetic makeup is 80% of humans and 20% of animals. She has a combination of puma genes that gives her strength and flexibility; a falcon, which gives her an increased ability to see and hear; and a chameleon that gives her camouflage power. In the first film, she was a very seductive and immoral woman using sex to get information. I have not yet watched the second, but in this third the story is full of action. A group of scientists for fifteen years is developing a new and dangerous form of electricity production. The study is not yet complete when one of them betrays the other and steals the study. The problem is that because of its molecular instability, a black hole will be created that will suck the entire planet. Kam saves Dr. Tess Adkins (Teal Redmann), who survived the team of scientists, and is trying to extract a dangerous invention from the hands of the "bad guys." There is a very strong "sub" in this gang that gives Kama many difficulties. This action and science fiction television film is better than the first, reminding Terminator in some parts of the plot. Bobby Phillips is a very beautiful actress, and her outfit is very cool. I become a fan of this good entertainment. Fans of sci-fi movies will not be disappointed. Now I am trying to buy Chameleon 2. My voice is seven.
