This pleasant French film tells about a millionaire, the owner of a tobacco factory on an African island near Madagascar named Louis (Jean Paul Belmondo). He is a single wife, then advertises the bride and gets a gorgeous woman named Julia (Catherine Deneuve). When it appears spontaneously, it turns out to be much more attractive than expected. He marries Julia, but she suddenly disappears. The French Eye (Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julia's sister, and he soon follows the trail of his previous spouse. Later, Louis meets her in the dance hall under a different name. Despite romantic delusion and all that, Louis continues to admire his mysterious wife. <br /> <br /> This film is a great drama, a lot of betrayal, deception, murder, theft, and Hitchcock waiting. Good performances by Jean-Paul Belmondo as the young owner of a cigarette company, who seems determined to fall under the spell of the femme fatale and the wonderful Catherine Deneuve as a suspected heroine. The film received several references to American cinema, but Truffaut (400 hits) was an ardent movie lover, such as: Johnny Guitar, Colorado Jim, Bogart and Hitchcock. The American version was cut many minutes and deserves urgent restoration and remastering. Freely based on the novel “Waltz in the Dark” by Cornell Woolrich (“Rear Window” and screenwriter “Alfred Hitchcock”), which was also adapted to Truffaut's “Bride in Black”. Colorful cinematography by Denis Clerval (“Stolen Kisses”) and musical score with the atmosphere of Antoine Duhamel, an ordinary musician Truffaut. This is one of his best-known films, along with Fahrenheit 451 and Shoot the Pianist. Redone by the worst version of Michael Christopher (2001) with Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie and Jack Thompson, full of erotic and lustful scenes.
