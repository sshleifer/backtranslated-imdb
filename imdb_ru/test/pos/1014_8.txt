I finally saw the ENT, and I must say that I equally enjoyed it and was alarmed by it. What is good about this is the atmosphere, the music, the location, the cinematography and the beautiful cast. The story does not exist for sure, but with these films it does not matter. The pace is sluggish, and the settings are exotic. The film has a lot of things. Unfortunately, it also has several things going against it. First, the gorgeous Annie Belle and the beautiful Al Kliver have no chemistry. Since these two play a couple and are on the screen almost throughout the entire film, the lack of chemistry between them is a certain responsibility. According to IMDb, Al and Annie were a real couple when they made this film. They are sure that their attraction to each other is not shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> Another problem with LAURE is that some sex scenes are simply ineffective or even funny. There's one sex scene that stands out as one of the dumbest films I have ever seen in any soft porn movie: our young blonde couple in a helicopter shot by a pilot who happens to be a cross-tumbler! The pilot flies over the city to pick up his girlfriend (!), And they have some kind of orgy in a helicopter, in the air. And Al Kliver shoots it all with his 16 mm camera! I am not kidding. Funny. Later we will see that 16mm frames are edited on moviola. As the frames roll, Al and Annie begin to take apart. This scene is really good, but the shots on the screen behind them were sometimes too much. When I watched footage of a transvestite that turned on him when he piloted a helicopter, I almost rolled on the floor, laughing out loud. Should it be erotic or believable anyway? The last thing I want to see is a woman who rejoices in a man in a dredge, of course, when a man in a dredge makes piloting a helicopter for such an ugly woman, no less. Al and Annie wore it was cool, like music throughout the scene. I wish the footage on the editing screen was not so stupid. <br /> <br /> Speaking of dragging, another boring plot point in LAURE that really pulls the film to crawl - all these moments with the great Orso Maria Gerrini and his two wives. The family trio is an interesting idea, but it is unlikely to be recorded here as hot or even interesting. Two women are pretty boring, and we rarely see three having sex. In fact, Orso holds almost the entire film for his clothes, even when he is with Annie Belle. This is another minor complaint about LAURE: there is a nude here, but this is not as much as in other films of the same era. Just need more skin to stab. <br /> <br /> With the exception of these minor complaints and moments of transvestites, LAURE is really very watchable. I like such erotic films of the 1970s, when attention was paid to the mood and atmosphere, and not to the rude things that we see today. <br /> <br /> ps: be sure to take a look at Emanuel in Egypt, where the main role is played by Annie and Al, and also another famous pair of screens, Laura Gemser and Gabriele Tinti. The music in this film is great too.
