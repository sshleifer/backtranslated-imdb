Ed (coincidentally editor) is hired to cut horror films to be favorable in Europe (where the standards are much more stringent). But he finds films very destructive and starts to go a little crazy. Well, a little can be an understatement. <br /> <br /> Let me first say this: best of all. opening. scene. Ever The man in the office who blows up his head with a grenade. Then his boss says - with a deadpan face - "you are fired." The whole film does not support this level of intensity, but it certainly tries. <br /> <br /> Take a shotgun scene, beheading, clips from Lost Limbs (which, as my friend Jason wanted, were a real movie). ). The author of this film came up with the idea of ​​a woman who was raped by a beaver, and then immediately shot a bazooka in the face. You will not find this in any other film (at least, I doubt that you will do this). <br /> <br /> The biggest disadvantage of this film is its quality. The image is not as sharp as it should be in the 1997 film, and the sound can be corrected (although this is not bad). I thought I was watching a film from the 1980s. Although it gave me some impetus - the film also had a writing style and direction from the 1980s: a sense of fun and giving the audience something extra. I miss those days. <br /> <br /> I wish I had something to say, although now I can’t think of anything strong enough to compliment this film. I think you should see this. You saw a box in your video store with an ax splitting your head ... you may have missed it several times. Maybe you thought it would be stupid. Pick it up. Enjoy it.
