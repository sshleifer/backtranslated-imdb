I believe this is a film that draws a heart. Richard Donner (director of the box office movie Superman) did an excellent job directing this movie. Some of the Segemets were good, and some were terrible, because Bobby (Madzello) was beaten by the King (Baldwin, and especially their dog, Shane attacked the King, which meant he paid for what he did with Bobby. <Br / > <br /> Elijah Wood played a good role in this film. In this memorable scene he dreamed that he took the advice of the buffalo that Bobby was beaten. I give this film *** out of four !!!
