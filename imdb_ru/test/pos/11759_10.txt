Homebrew is one of those films that seem to have failed, but they deserve better. When I first saw this, I had a warm reaction. But over time it really grew on me - not a pun ;-). The more I see it, the more I appreciate it. The letter is first-class, as is acting. Add some amazing cameo roles and good direction, and you’ll end up with a great little movie. <br /> <br /> It’s also good to finally see how Hank Azariah will get a chance to prove himself in the lead role. And Thornton provides his usual quality of performance. Even the relative newcomer Ryan Phillip copes by playing the friendly innocent with wit and subtlety. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Homegrown is simply “must see” if you are a fan of Billy Bob Thornton. It seems that Steven Gyllenhaal was influenced by earlier Thornton projects, such as the One False Move and Sling Blade (although Homegrown is, of course, much more mocking than both). And the role of Thornton as a complex and practical character is ideal for an actor.
