An adolescent girl gets the horse of his dreams and is trained by a former jockey to attend the Great National Steeplechase in London. A wonderful adaptation of the classic children's book, with Taylor's excellent, starting performance as an energetic but polite youthful Rooney is fine as her coach, although he has some excessively melodramatic moments. Crisp and Revere are pretty good, like Taylor's loving parents. Photographed in Technicolor, it looks beautiful. The problem is that there are banal elements, nothing interesting happens, and it takes too long. The race is exciting, but it could be much more.
