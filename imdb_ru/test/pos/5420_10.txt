This incredibly interesting short is considered one of the best in history, and I certainly will not argue with that. Even in a country where top-notch animated shorts are regularly created, this film still manages to stand out. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, do it. It's only ten minutes, and yet there is a man in it who is obsessed with a saw, a woman who vacuums a bath, and a nuclear war. What else can you want in a movie?
