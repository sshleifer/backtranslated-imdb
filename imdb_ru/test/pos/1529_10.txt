Rarely does a movie capture such intense drama and emotion. What makes this film so disturbing is that the drama seems so real that it’s hard to remember that this is just a film. This is certainly the work of Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman in their careers. The film is almost like a theatrical production, as it is delivered and illuminated. The only bad thing about this film is that it’s very difficult to get a copy of it. I have not seen this yet, except on Laserdisc. This really powerful film deserves a digital transmission and special edition on DVD. It really is so good.
