Rosie Perez - leading the way in this very exciting business, as Mercedes, a young woman from Brooklyn who decided to become an actress, although she doesn’t like her circumstances, she lives in East Los Angeles and struggles with a series of fruitless auditions for any kind of part in general . Mercedes befriended the married actor Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel), who at one time appeared on the Western television series in the 1970s, and since then has rarely accepted him as his lover, partly because of his loneliness, and also from hope, that parts of the film will come to her because of his "contacts", but these latter are not of great importance, since Harry is simply self-deception in his attempts to restore what he perceives as past cinematic fame. To adequately support herself financially, Mercedes works as a taxi dancer in the Skid Row dance hall / bar in downtown Los Angeles, while she continues to make efforts to succeed in the film industry, and it is there, in the dance palace, a young immigrant from Mexico, Ernesto (Michael DeLorenzo), falls in love with her, and most of the narrative tells of his attempts to please the object of his feelings, even if they can mean the loss of her as a whole. This essentially rooted melodrama tradition is given only by a moderate budget, despite the presence of a significant number of famous players, including Steve Buscemi, Anthony Quinn and Stanley Tucci, and was kept in the bank for about a year before it became rather disorderly. efforts to distribute and lead marketing on his behalf, it is more regrettable that his robust production characteristics are firmly complemented by Alexander Rockwell’s superbly managed leadership, the consistent merit of his work, and the film’s introductory scene in this film, with the image of Perez on the Fifth and Main Street of Skid-Row. Rockwell has often demonstrated that he really works very closely with his actor, and in this case this is true because he allows his actors to create their roles, while any advertising campaign is beautifully processed during the editing process, which leads to the artistic success of the director. on the negative comments of some major appraisers. Sounding the film is aesthetically accurate with much of this one made by Tito Larriva, who also plays as a group boss for taxi dancers. Actual honors here should go to the ever-vital Perez, although in no way inferior to the performance below the nominal. A fair test for the quality of any film is given when the viewer watches it twice in a short period of time. A visit to this undervalued work will be a great pleasure for many.
