Well, well, I have to admit, I am a bit like Peter Liapis, and I admit that this is not the best continuation of Ghoulies. I mean, yes, he had his flaws, for example, NO GHOULIES themselves. But the two ghouls that came to earth were really funny, I think their name was Dark and Light. I liked the plot of the film. And even at the end of the film, both Guli meant that there would be a sequel. Still waiting lol. Peter Liapis repeated his role as Jonathan Graves, this time playing the detective, how cute! Ghoulies IV may not be scary or stressful, but it is definitely funny. I thought I would comment on this film and just say itâ€™s not so bad. Worth a look, although it does not have ghouls.
