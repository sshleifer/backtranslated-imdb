If you have not heard of this film, it follows two Sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in Africa to America, where they convince themselves that they will find success and wealth. Life in the States is more complicated than expected, and this film perfectly reflects the frustration that is felt when things go wrong. Life is captured so well that many moments seem like scenarios because they are so perfect. Whether at work, at school, or at another time, two boys, Peter and Santino, are very honest with filmmakers and make some very suggestive comments about life in the states. This is one of the few documentaries that I can remember when it ended, I wanted it to continue for another two hours. It may be difficult to find this film because it hasnâ€™t been widely distributed, but check your local art-house or independent theater and try this film definitely worth renting). Rating: 28/40
