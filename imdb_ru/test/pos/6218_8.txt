My favorite story from "Tales from the Crypt". Brion Jones was born to play the role of a woodcutter maniac, mad ax shooter Steve Dixon. Seeing him earlier in Tango & Cash, I can say that this actor never received the due credit he deserved. The jealous husband takes offense at his wife, showing interest in the crazy young worker he has just hired. And you know when Dixon finds out that there will be hell to pay! Young worker Ted (Billy Wirth) receives an all-powerful beating from Dixon who left him. blind. How does a blind woodcutter work? Tribute to black humor, if he ever was! Colleagues are doing a good job too, supporting Ted when Dixon suspects that his wife wants another person. Dixon's behavior strengthens communication between colleagues. One even declared that he became a different person when he got married. Although Ted had to do a wise thing and leave when he could!
