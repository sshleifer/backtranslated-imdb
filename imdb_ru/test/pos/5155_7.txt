A large bell at the bar rings intermittently for recent orders, and the inevitable rush to the queue forms at the counter. we want what we need only when it is too late? Or the irony of crying Cassandra in the first scene - a more resonant reflection of our perception of individual existence? There is an infinite fascination with where writer-director Roy Andersson wants to take us in his fourth film, You, Alive. Fifty or so semi-related vignettes are interconnected by their inclination to the tragicomic hyperreality, its thoughtful interpretations and the symbolic instances of life that bind us all in this great, great cosmic war of Sisyphus. The sheer simplicity of these vignettes dramatizes the insignificance and tremendous value of being apart from the symbiotic relationships that we have with each other. Andersson could nullify the complexity of a personâ€™s condition through abrupt and rapid cynicism than he should, but he also reminds us of the innate, reassuring glory of awakening every morning to a new tomorrow, when we all realize our own form of retarded development.
