Brad Pitt sticks his index finger into the wound on Diane Kruger’s leg and holds it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, terrible so. Invented yarn takes the “Dirty Dozen” for a walk and sometimes refuses it to pay tribute to other films. Lots of fun. Even “Paris when it sizzles” is mentioned in the delightfully organic part of the dialogue. I was delighted with the character of Christoph Walzer and his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the acting lack of vanity. This character has the oddity of Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately his hand. his brain and his heart are visible everywhere.
