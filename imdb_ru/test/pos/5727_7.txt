OK. In general, this three-part documentary film will introduce most of the interested people to the events in the world of physics and the last 300 years of discovery of our universe. If you read Stephen Hawkins’s brilliant book, A Brief History of Time, and understood it, then you might need a visual description of certain concepts ... which I did to a certain extent. Green is tolerant, but obviously, for the sake of the masses, tends to explain things a little patronizingly. This, of course, is intentional and ideal for almost everyone who watches this show. <br /> <br /> Invited scholars were good. (no Hawking, but I guess he has his DVDs), I kept waiting for him to appear, but they rotate through the same almost 3 parts ...) I bought the Nova 2 Disc (NTSC) edition, and there were several inclusions that really distracted from the overall experience. <br /> <br /> 1. “This was brought to you ...” at the beginning of EVERY part was an inevitable evil for the first part, but seeing it 2 more times before everything ended was very ordinary. <br /> <br /> 2. I suppose there is nothing you can do about it, but at the beginning of 2 and 3 there was a rather frequent coincidence, because of which I reached for the FFW button several times. <br /> <br /> 3. This set of discs was straight from the TV .. (i.e., advertising, what is happening the last time for those who missed it, and frequent "goto pbs.org for more ...." ) appearing throughout the presentation. (not at all like the material BBC, which has no analogues for the presentation. "Planets", "Blue Planet", etc.). My 7/10 is based on content only. Neagles were there, but I coped with them. If this were done with this classic British accented speaker (you know that one), then, in my opinion, this would be the perfect set of discs. <br /> <br /> If you saw this and want more ... then I highly recommend Hawkings’s book A Brief History of Time ... I wish it was also a film. <br /> <br /> Enjoy your viewing.
