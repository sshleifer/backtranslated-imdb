As part of the initiation draw, Julie (Meg Tilly from Psycho 2) should spend the night in a mausoleum, but Karl Ramarevich, a telekinesis master, recently died and was placed there. When Julieâ€™s sister-companions defile the place where he is, real terror begins. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of atmosphere in this little movie, and I enjoyed the process, plus the last twenty minutes are great. Anyone looking for the lost jewel of the '80s horror movie should not look further. Highly undervalued. Plus, Elizabeth Daily is amazing. <br /> <br /> My rating: B <br /> <br /> Additional materials for Media Blaster DVD: Disk 1) Comment with director Tom Maclaflin and co-author Michael Hawse; and trailers for the film "The Creature", "Frankestien's Bloody Terror", "Shortly Before Dawn" and the disc "Devil's Dog"
