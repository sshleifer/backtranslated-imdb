For those of you who have previously commented on this film and hoped to see it again, I hope you did. It was shown today (November 28, 2004) on the Lifetime Movie Network. I subscribe to the dish. <br /> <br /> Karen Arthur masterfully directed William Petersen and Barbara Hershey in this southwestern gothic story. Lighting, editing and dialogue made a significant contribution to the film, and Hershey and Peterson played a great role, playing sensitive, bold and intuitive characters. The scene was great, as were the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> Without knowing in advance, I correctly guessed that the story is based on truth, and now that I know this, I must go into the past. Santa Fe - jump, leap and jump from Tucson. <br /> <br /> As an engineer, I was fascinated by the theme of the unique construction of the staircase and the person who designed and built it (who was he? Angel?). But the storyline and a few stories about how it originated are what fascinates you most. You undoubtedly feel that God in His heavens was in every detail of all this drama in history. For those who have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. For those of you who don’t have one, I won’t spoil a minute ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy your holiday, <br /> <br /> Bob Schenk Jr., Raytheon Rocket Systems, Tucson, Arizona
