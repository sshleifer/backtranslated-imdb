This film was my first encounter with the talents of Chris Cooper. I was deeply impressed with the character he played. When I saw the film, I knew that this talented actor should make even more wonderful things. He plays the captain of the Union, which, along with a pair of soldiers, is hunting in Eastern Kentucky. They happen on a Sisech farm of a woman whose husband decided to go to the Confederation. <br /> <br /> The image of Eastern Kentucky and its seriously divided feelings during the war are very accurate. If you are looking for a war film with a lot of blood and courage, this would not be. If you are looking for a drama that explores the psychology of peoples in a war, in fact, philosophically, then this is the best study of how divided loyalty affected the interaction of peoples in the border states during the American Civil War.
