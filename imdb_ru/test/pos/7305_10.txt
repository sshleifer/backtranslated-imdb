I was very touched by the gentle power of this film and the mood he created. I think he should have received far more credits than he did. I agree that Michelle Pfeiffer should have been nominated, but I think all the performances were outstanding, and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange portrayed the intimacy and conflicts of the sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity. Although I did not read the book, I found the modern concept of King Lear very cool. I, of course, will never again look at the play in a completely different way!
