I have not written reviews here for many years, but I reviewed all the lower television shows, live shows and this, I felt I had to make my views on this film famous! I think this is the perfect comedy movie. There are no nice storylines about Davey (I wouldn’t call Richie’s passion for Gina Carbonara’s love, would you? Or him and Eddie going naked there ... not with love) that make the rest of comedies go from good to crap? there are not enough common dilemmas that need to be overcome in most other comedy films ... unless you think that they poisoned the guests and have to run away from the green vomit of the guests, like a dilemma like other comedy films ..... No, this film just sets out and succeeds in doing one thing and only one thing: make you laugh. What is required from comedy films? Laugh. This film just laughs from laughter to laughter, without filling the laugh with serious shit, like other comedy films! Thus, I call it so far the only perfect comedy film, and I will never stop watching this beautiful film! I applaud Rika and Ade to such a fantastic genius!
