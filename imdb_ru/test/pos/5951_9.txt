I liked this film, and I recommend it to anyone who loves a good spyware deception and thinks Johnny English is embarrassing. This is the film JE was supposed to be. But it is based on the old French film series, so it has nothing to do with Bond. <br /> <br /> The production is great, you can almost believe that the movie was shot in the 60s. He even has the same pastel colors that were in those days. Jean Dujardin plays his part with the right amount of stupidity and naivety, and not with the stupidity of pantomime with fists, like Rowan Atkinson. And even if you do not like the movie, you will want to watch it for Berenice Bejo. Oh la la! She is hot ...
