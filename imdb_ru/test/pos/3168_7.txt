I thought it was very “different” from most modern interpretations of Shakespeare, and I liked it very much. It would be useless for those who study him in school, etc., since it does not show the traditional interpretations of Shakespeare’s characters (i.e. Miranda is depicted rather strangely compared to your traditional Shakespeare lady), but to understand the game and for the basis of the story is a very strong piece and a fantastic look. It also does not include the correct format, both in the mock action and the scenes, since I am currently playing Miranda in the production, and most of her lines have been cut, and some scenes are divided and mixed, but this is very useful, and I definitely recommend it as a must-see, even if you just say you saw it! Shakespeare fans will love this!
