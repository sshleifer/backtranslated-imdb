This film is a great example of why the Shaw brothers are some of the best directors (probably the best in the kung fu category). The film unfolds well, the story is excellent and intriguing, and, although the humor may not be reflected on your face, it is embedded in the interactions of the characters. As soon as the plot unfolds, and the characters begin to assess the situation, is the whole tower falling apart in one of the best fighting scenes (the tiger, the crane, and the Hung Gar crab are very much present). There is even a scene that mocks the western social events of the 18th century and ends with a smart and fascinating struggle. The film ends with an unexpected, delicate moment, but if you are a fan of the Show Brothers, you will understand that cheese is just the top, not the main course of the movie.
