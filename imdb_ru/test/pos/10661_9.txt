Eisenstein created the Russian Theory of Editing, and this film is his best example. It took years for someone to use his ideas and make them work (The Limey, 1999). However, the stroller scene does demonstrate the erratic nature of RMT. Of course, as in most films, in some places it becomes longer, the beauty of the film is amazing. One of the best silent films I've ever seen.
