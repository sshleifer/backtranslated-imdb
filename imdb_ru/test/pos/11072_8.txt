I lived in the area (Hoboken and Jersey City) for about ten years. This film certainly conveys the feeling of that time and place. The dialogue is very good, the music is correct, the scenarios are realistic. As another author said, it looks almost like a documentary. I love how he humanizes these children, who would probably prefer to be born in Westchester, but fall into what children fall into. It just so happened that the area is rather rough. <br /> <br /> They demonize the cops too much, but that was to be expected. I would say that acting is also good. <br /> <br /> This gives the viewer some insight into how this idiocy is caused and inflated disproportionately. Hopefully the new mayor of Newark is making progress.
