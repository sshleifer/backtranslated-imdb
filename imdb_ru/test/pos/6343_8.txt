I had doubts about watching the movie “Return to the Lonely Pigeon” after I saw and enjoyed the original so much. If Tommy Lee Jones did not repeat his role as Woodrow Cal or Angelica Houston in the role of Clara, I thought that it would not be authentic enough. After watching the "return" I can honestly say that this is a worthy successor. The actors really do the shows with John Voight, Rick Schroeder and Oliver Reed, who all perform at their best. I admit that the story may not be as exciting as the first one, but the “return” definitely has its share of excitement and reflects the romance of the old west like so many other films do. Anyone who still has reservations can be sure that “Returning to a lonely dove” can capture the “feel” of the original and will not disappoint. Do yourself a favor and check it out, Ol Gus would be proud!
