This movie was awesome. This is a documentary about how surfing influenced skateboarding in the early days. He has interviews with skaters such as Tony Hawk (my idol) =) and Stacy Peralta to name a couple. Dogtown is the so-called part of the ghetto in California, where previously there was a demolished amusement park. People began to ride along the dangerous ruins of the park. Soon, the Zepher Surf team was formed. This led to the first real start of Skateboardings in Dogtown. The Z boys were a team of obscene teens who loved skateboarding and started a phenomenon known as skating. They began this by skating in drained pools. This is just a small part of the story. It even contains rare footage from the movie “Angels of Stacy Peralt” Charlie in the role of cameo. I think you should buy this movie if you're a skater. This will teach you that skateboarding has not always been popular. Even if you are not, BUY!
