Well, now at first I thought it would be another funny romantic comedy that held off the comedy, but it is not. I mean, how could this be with the fabulous Amanda Bynes staring at it! She was amazing, really funny and still stunning! The boys in it were also in great shape, and this is one of the main reasons why the girls went! The plot is strongly based on Shakespeare's play “The Twelfth Night”, as it was extremely similar, there was even a spider named Malvolio who belonged to the Malvolian character. The script was really well written and compiled, and it was very witty. Football skills in him were also amazing, I even thought about playing football myself! In any case, if to sum up, this is a frivolous film about a young novel, which is very confusing! Go and see!
