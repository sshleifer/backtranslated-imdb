Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a hardworking, womanlike Texas congressman with no noticeable legislation. In 1980, he began to be interested in the plight of Afghanistan, which is in the midst of a fierce war with the USSR. Under the auspices of his old flame, the arch-conservative Texan socialite Joan Herring (Julia Roberts), he travels to Afghanistan to assess the situation, and is stunned by what he saw. He is returning to the US, determined to help the Afghans, but found that his colleagues are extremely indifferent to the situation - and he himself is being investigated on charges of drug use. Without being distracted, Wilson recruits Herring and the vulgar CIA agent Gast Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to start a complex deal involving Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the largely unsuspecting US Congress. Ultimately, Afghans defeat the Soviets, but while America celebrates its victory, Wilson and Avrakotos find their warnings about the instability of post-war Afghanistan, which cannot be heard. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is a deft brain candy, a really neat movie for a more intelligent viewer and fun entertainment for the average viewer. The film collects an amazing array of talents, both in front of and behind the camera, and promises to be a hell of a good time. The film has only one drawback, to which we will come later. As an example of the incredible way of conducting the largest secret war of the 20th century - and, perhaps, of how it is done by the CIA and other special services - this is fascinating. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting on several levels. The story depicted in the film — with all its outrageous double relationships, cunning clandestine operations, and perhaps most of all with its success — would be as outrageous as an artistic work that it could be easily dismissed from satire. But everything really worked out, at least within reasonable limits. The film portrays our three main characters in an interesting way that emphasizes their strengths without hiding their flaws. Wilson as a person who does not regret his vices (even embraces them), but still wants to accept a righteous cause. Herring is a bit of an elite, and its revived attitude toward righteousness repels, but it is deeply committed to the cause of the Afghan people. Avrakotos is a CIA outsider with a relationship problem that is looked down upon because of his "street" background - but his love for the country and the hatred of communism are unchanged. The fact that this strange trio could play an important role in the collapse of the USSR is not only proof that someone can change something, but also that truth is weirder than fiction. It is also very interesting that all this is played as a comedy - not too surprising, considering that our author is Aaron Sorkin, but this is an interesting way to approach this story. <br /> <br /> The film, however, has one drawback, which is a bit surprising. The film seems to shamelessly celebrate the achievements of Wilson & Co. This is good - there is nothing wrong with defeating the Soviet Union, is it? - until they think that the Taliban and ultimately al Qaeda emerged from the ashes of the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan. Regardless of the level of responsibility of the United States, it happened, and the image of the film about the success of Wilson is almost not gone. To be fair, the film does solve this problem at the end, with Wilson’s rather relevant speech about the US inability to clean up after itself, but it is made in such a third way that the average viewer probably won’t take much from him. The general impression is that these three wonderful people helped the Afghans defeat the Soviets. Note, this is not a fatal flaw, but it is one of the unpleasant moments in another brilliant film. <br /> <br /> The talent of the film is wonderful. Legendary Mike Nichols delivers a great, great looking production; The material is perfect for his understated, crooked directorial style. Sorkin set another brilliant script; The film has dozens of quotes and classic exchanges of Sorkin (the best of which is the Scotch Bottle Bottom between Wilson and Avrakotos), and it has a political and historical perspective. The cast of the film is a miracle: Tom Hanks perfectly plays the role of an attractive cheater with a reason, Julia Roberts is alternately charming and disgusting, as disgusting, but devoted to Joan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene (as usual) as an abrasive Gus. Always beautiful Amy Adams takes another step toward glory as Wilson’s long-suffering assistant, and Ned Beatty, Om Puri, Emily Blunt, Christopher Denham and Ken Stott exchange the cast. <br /> <br /> “Charlie Wilson’s War” is a smart and funny movie, great entertainment, a little more light. The fact that he decides not to be something big should not be considered against it; that's fine what does. <br /> <br /> 8/10
