Well, it was just great. I wish the rest of the first season was so strong. It really needs more episodes like this. <br /> <br /> The cast worked perfectly, although they were all nobody else in those days. The writing was fantastic, as was the editing. Excellent work in all accounts. <br /> <br /> The episode was exciting, tense and made you guess until the very end. This is what most MOTW series have tried, but so far has not been possible. <br /> <br /> The first fifth episode for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I don't even remember it being that good. I think it's even better than a great horror movie called “The Thing”.
