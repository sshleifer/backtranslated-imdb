As one who goes to the movies often, I have to say that it was one of the most impressive films I saw this year. Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. gave outstanding performances that allow viewers to immerse themselves in various emotions and truly feel the characters. It is pleasant from time to time to watch a movie that does not depend entirely on special effects, but allows the characters of the story to affect the human psyche on many levels. I would like Hollywood to release more films of this magnitude.
