This one started out great. Photography and audio are the best I've experienced over the years (well, months). Especially surprising is the use of "warm" and "cold" colors in separate sequences. Also, forcing Jennifer Lopez to whisper most of her lines is an idea in itself, but I'm not sure that Singh wants to accomplish this. <br /> <br /> Now for the cons. The script was terrible. The participation of Lopez turned out to be inappropriate or completely useless for the plot. She seemed to be acting in a film just to sell herself and the photo. Three beds seemed too obvious. The baptism of the child Karl was a psychologically too stressed way to understand the motive on which Karl “worked”. And so on. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film had a great way to show where Singh was from. Why are the most talented directors currently appearing from India?
