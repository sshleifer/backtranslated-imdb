Ghoulies IV may not be the best of the series, but it's not that bad if you don't take it seriously, then you will like it. <br /> <br /> It’s nice to see Peter Liapis returning to Jonathan Graves, who abandoned magic and became a detective, but still thinks about what happened in Guli. <br /> <br /> The story tells about a woman named Alexander, a former girlfriend of Jonathan, who breaks into a museum and takes a red gem using a gem that her boy named Faust awakens, which is Jonathan’s dark side, but you need a gem so that he can enter the real world, and John goes to hell. <br /> <br /> Something goes wrong and Alex loses the gem, so she needs to find a new one, as she leaves the gate still open and two small ghouls appear, whose names are Light and Drac. They are not real ghouls because they look like guys in a masked troll costume, but that doesn’t matter, as they are ridiculous in details. <br /> <br /> Light and dark need to find Jonathan, as he can bring them home so that they can cause unrest, trying to find Jonathan. Another difference is that these two ghouls are good guys, unlike those in previous films. <br /> <br /> I think that Gulia IV is good, but everyone may not like this film, check it out if you like the low level. budget films like Troll 2.
