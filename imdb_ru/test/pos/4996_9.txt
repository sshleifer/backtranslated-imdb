This film hurt everyone, and their aunt Matilda compares it to a renowned predecessor who will always hurt any show. If you take it as a western, it's a damn good show. We learn how our heroes of the “Lonely Pigeon” find themselves in situations in which they appear (for example: why do two Texas Rangers who live in adventures end up in a dead city? And how did Gus lose his love? , and we see exactly the same manners that the characters will have in the future. The actors did an excellent job. The cinematography was excellent, and although the music did not match the legendary score nearly two decades ago, it was an impossible task, and it was still good. <br /> <br /> It also helped that we had three episodes that you no longer see in the miniseries. Damn it, these days it’s absolutely impossible to see a two-part TV movie. <br /> <br /> Fans of the West, rejoice!
