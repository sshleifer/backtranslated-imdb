First, let me review the movie. This movie scares me, and I do not even believe in aliens! However, the film has its drawbacks. <br /> <br /> There are three actions in this movie. The first act is perfect. This adjusts the film, and really increases the creep factor. I must say that the rating is excellent! Everything is set up and set up perfectly. <br /> <br /> The second act begins when Gillian, who plays Sherry Burton, goes to psychiatry. They hypnotize her, and she recalls the abduction. The second act destroys the film when the aliens appear. Screaming Crazy George made effects for aliens. I must say that they did a good job, except with the image of "gray" aliens. No offense, but the Grays looked like inflatable prizes on the doors. <br /> <br /> By the way, I liked the way they treated hypnosis in the First and Second Acts. If you paid attention, you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories. In the husband’s story version, blue light kills them, and his wife says, “Someone is here” or something like that. It makes sense. Husband cares about his wife. “Someone” can hurt her. This is his problem. However, in her version of events, she says: "Help me!" She does not say: "Someone is here." It also makes sense. Aliens pursue her. Her husband’s desire to help and save her is her problem. Now back to the film. <br /> <br /> The third act turns the film into a bloody feast. The "strange" ultrasound procedure begins. This is a typical feast of blood, but it has an unexpected ending. I will not spoil it, because it is a really interesting development. <br /> <br /> DVDs and comments take themselves too seriously, but if you think that Wilford Brimley says “Horse **”, it's funny, you can check it out in the interview section for actors. Now to my praise Gillian McWirter. <br /> <br /> I could only hope that Gillian read it. I've never seen her before, but wow, what an idea! Let me tell everyone else. First of all, it must be a serious film. The details that I am going to describe may seem obscene and funny, like Humanoids From The Deep (1980), but in reality this is not the case Got it? Good. <br /> <br /> Gillian is hot, naturally beautiful. She is naked for many films and that is good. Unfortunately, she is usually attacked, terrorized and raped, which is very bad. However, she must be filmed in many parts of this film naked. She gets points for overcoming this. She should be happy, sad, excited, scared and physically hurt in just a few minutes. The turn of emotions is amazing! She should be encouraged by joy when she finds out that she is pregnant. She must scream in horror when aliens clean her guts. She must be very angry when her husband assumes that the child is not his. She should act as if she denies, saying that her child is fine, and her husband says otherwise. I must note that the denial that is really imposed on her by the aliens controlling her. I'm talking about the Oscar performance here. <br /> <br /> Then there is the rape scene. It's anxious, but since it's just some kind of rubber alien, it's not that bad. In this scene, the alien is not a "gray" alien, so I will describe it. The stranger has tentacles, and he is like a table. Gillian on the table-like part held by tentacles. She has an alien head. The stranger’s head is long and it goes down, so his head is now taller than Gillian’s legs. Then the alien hey-nana-nana comes out of his forehead. This is a forehead! Sounds pretty polite, right? Well, Gillian plays straight and she copes! She must behave like an alien, and her hey-nanu-nanu, coming from her forehead, rapes her, and she copes with it! This is a very tense scene, but it’s not what it does. You see, this scene is made in memory. What makes the scene is the work of Gillian, reminiscent of these events. She just lies in a hospital bed under hypnosis, recalling the abduction by aliens, but her actions here are more intense than the actual rape scene! How many actors can shoot in a scene that describes rape, which is more intense than a rape scene? Little! However, Gillian does it. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. Gillian, if you ever read this, I want you to know that I, (name not disclosed) under the pseudonym MegamanX-1, think that you are the best actress of all time. You are the best actress in history! I could only hope that you read this and always take with you. <br /> <br /> Like everyone else, “Progeny” (1999) is “Good Good.” I would recommend this.
