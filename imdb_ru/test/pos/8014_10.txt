Therefore, it is important to talk about the release of the DVD, and not just about the film. Tales from the Crapper is a film that only one studio in the world can deliver. The one that brought us innovative and original REAL independent films for over 30 years: Troma. This is indeed a very special film, because it is certainly not my favorite from the productions of Troma, but released on the disc, which, because of what I just said, is one of my most valuable and favorite DVDs. Not only counting the countless Troma discs that I have, but also my entire movie collection. The film itself is the result of an ill-fated production plan for a television series directed by a director who was entrusted with considerable funds (especially for “Tromy”) to do something wonderful and deliver a lot of incomplete and incomprehensible material before the exit (or dismissal, I'm not sure at the moment). To avoid having to invest heavily in the toilet, Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Hertz decided to put together a team of directors and actors and use the material as the basis of a single film. One film, which actually consists of two, in the good old style of the anthology "Tales from the Crypt", shot by the Host, played by Mr. Kaufman himself. But, as I said, not quite my favorite from all my films. This is largely due to a strange sense of discipline on various film sets, forgetting about Trom's hard-to-drink rule on the set, which was discovered by enraged Lloyd and other less respectable employees than Trome did during the shooting. from the added scenes. All this made it almost impossible for Mr. Kaufman to make a decent product in the installation room. But Lloyd Kaufman is a genius, and with problematic scenes added to an already ugly starting product, he created a little less than a masterpiece. The film itself is as good as the circumstances allow the most brilliant director to merge together, and he is certainly very interesting, completely confused, filled with those elements that have made Troma great, certainly unique and one of a kind. Like the film itself, not as brilliant as in many other productions of Troma. The Independent Cinema genius, however, made the DVD of this film much more than the release of a film with some additional films. The film, when the impetus comes in motion, is in fact only a part of the entire DVD, which in general is a document about a difficult situation in which serious directors find themselves forced to survive in a world that is monopolized by a few very large people who do not really allow others players to their market. Document about the problems that people have when they trust to be on a level, only to find out that it is sometimes difficult to achieve freedom, and the realization that access to the budget for a film, when there is no boss, can spoil even those who really should know better The brilliance of this DVD is that the film is not perfect, and that Lloyd KNOWS him, and does not want anyone to think that he believes it is. A full-length commentary is a show in itself (as is often the case with Mr. Kaufan’s audio commentary), which mixes humor, ridicule of those who deserve it, and very interesting information for anyone interested in independent filmmaking, in such a way that watching the movie again with this comment immediately after watching it is essentially so interesting that it is difficult to stop. A full-length documentary THE THICK BROWN LINE tells us about the different scenes where Lloyd visits film sets to sometimes take over and get the most out of what he finds there. We see him somewhat disappointed, sometimes different from his appearance in other documents “Making Documents”, such as “Leap of Darkness” and “Soon Apocalypse”, which can be found in the obligatory set “Make your damn movie”. <br /> <br /> Added scenes with James Gann (who started his career in Trome only to succeed as a writer and now director in Hollywood) and Trey Parker (again someone to start working with work released by Tromo). Later he will become a national hero in the South Park series. This is funny and probably (like so much else in this release) the reason for acquiring this disc alone is for those who are remotely interested in the work of these two characters. Loaded much more than I could mention here (including the SECOND audio commentary), this is one of the best releases of Troma-DVD.
