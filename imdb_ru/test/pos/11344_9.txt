SPOILER WARNING !!! <br /> <br /> You can listen to Wong Kar-wai's films as a radio show: invisible vibrations between the characters, the rooms in which they are located, the rhythm that pushes them forward, attractiveness and hostility - the entire spectrum of the atmosphere is played by the sound track. The dialogue is basically completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> The narrative is like a child's love look at a beautiful woman and a sad man, whose sorrows are noticeable but helpless. “In the mood for love” is told from the point of view of the child, but the child never acts as a narrator. The aesthetics of the film are developed with the help of extreme light and color dramatic art, sharp cuts, an unattached, almost documentary camera and a complex, unobtrusive sound. <br /> <br /> The ingenious use of Nate King Cole's book “Perhaps, Possibly”, “Perhaps,” whose mysterious power increases, the more often it repeats, and the melancholic waltz helps with the elegant choreography of the two main characters. Maggie Cheung in her beautiful dresses is gorgeous, perfect for the beautiful, stylish Tony Lung. The audience suggests romance between them, but Wong just sees a sad resignation. Two potential lovers revolve around each other like satellites, knowing that they will never share the same orbit. You want them to find each other. They won't do it, and the emotional power of their non-love-sex relationships makes the film incredibly exciting. <br /> <br /> This is about broken luck and unspoken love. In all Wong films, these are leitmotifs. Love, whether it comes too soon or too late to take one and not another person. The longing for characters that is never satisfied, their loneliness, grief and luck, which they experience when it is too late.
