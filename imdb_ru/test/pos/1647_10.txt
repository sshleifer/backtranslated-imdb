The penal battalion, the Criminal Battalion, is a touching and mostly honest look at the life and death of Soviet soldiers convicted for washing their crimes with blood during World War II. It can almost be called the Russian equivalent of the famous mini-series "Brothers". <br /> <br /> Formed in July 1942 on the eve of the Battle of Stalingrad, the penal battalions were considered expendable and suffered terrible losses. (sometimes up to 90%). GULAG prisoners (political prisons / concentration camps), deserters, soldiers who were captured by the Germans but managed to escape, soldiers accused of violating the protocol, got a chance to join the Shtrafbat and prove that there were no "Traitors to the Motherland". with their life. Those who were injured and those who died in battle were considered rehabilitated and were restored in the eyes of the law. <br /> <br /> This mini-series features one such Shtrafbat commanded by Tverdokhlebov, an honorary officer. who was captured by the Germans, was shot and left for death. It is a colorful and diverse group of people who find themselves in a situation from which there is no way out. An authoritative but honorable criminal authority of Antip "Fist" (Fist) and his small gang of unreformed criminals, a young Jewish intellectual who hit his anti-Semite officer, father (Orthodox priest) Michael, who joins the battalion when his parish collapses into home fights , political prisoners who hate the regime that sentenced them to the Gulag, but who are nevertheless ready to fight for their people and the country for the last time, must find the courage and the reasons to continue to live, and about must fight <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the scenario unfolds during the war, not every episode depicts the fighting. In fact, what are the scenes of the fighting, they are often chaotic, sporadic and short, which is probably what the director intended. Between them, the miniseries focuses on the various relationships between actors, their origins, their thoughts and tragedies. The rape of a young woman by one of the Soldiers of the Fine Battalion, and then his execution, execution for alleged AWOL, periods of boredom on the march, celebration (and subsequent consequences) of the search for a German bunker, equipped with food (and champagne), the moral dilemma of officers unable to save their people from their bosses, betrayal of the spouse and other situations, occupies a prominent place. The camera is unswerving - it does not turn away from the ugliness of war, nor from the ugliness of human nature, nor from raw human emotions. Dialogue also does not censor curses. <br /> <br /> The game is great and deep, and the script is also well written. Everything from anger, fatigue, to humility, from finding a piece of joy, which you can hold onto, is almost unmistakable. One complaint may be that some Russian language and cultural characteristics cannot always be understood by someone who is not familiar with the language and culture. Since in a sense this is a historical drama, some terms and situations (military rank, mention of other battles, certain historical references) may be lost for some viewers. This understanding does not need to fully enjoy Shtrafbat, but these links are a pleasant touch of authenticity. Another complaint that may be imposed is the occasional anachronism and the bending of the story in accordance with the plot, but, frankly, this is such an exciting mini-series that you can forgive these small failures.
