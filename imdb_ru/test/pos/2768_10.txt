This film is very good, and the whole family would love to watch it. When Suzy K is going to have a big prom party, she dies in a car accident on her way to the prom from children who are drunk and high. Over the years, Susie's House is for sale, and the family moves to a house she loves. As a boy, who now lives in the house, sees Suzy and the only one who can. The two teams, together with their little sister, are trying to save Susie's parents from Amy Joe Johnson Begins as Susie. This film will hit your heart with comedy, sadness and laughter. I hope you watch this movie because it is very good. But no one seems to have it on DVD or Vh's, and he no longer comes on TV.
