Fulci ... Does this man bring one of the scariest and strangest films ever made? The answer is yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as the Nightmare Concert, is Fulci's latest masterpiece. Yes, no matter what some people say about it. There are several facts why this film is one of the best Fulci films. <br /> <br /> Fulci mocks himself and his films with this. The leader in this film is none other than Fulci himself, who plays ... well, a horror director who thinks that he is gradually going crazy. It is filled with black humor, which, unlike most modern horror films, works here. Being Fulci, you should know that this is terrible. How many? Well, pretty much. I have always loved blood in films and never enjoyed it, but “The Cat in the Brain” actually stopped my thirst for blood, and, believe me, the archive is difficult. Even Braindead didn't stop it. CITB is all about blood. Almost every scene revolves around Fulci, who, being hypnotized by evil psychiatrists, sees all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him, or everything he sees. In some scenes, he accidentally dropped his temples, and instead he sees a rotten corpse lying on the floor, which begins to spit out the silt from its wounds. Forget the Beyond or Zombie 2, this is the most terrible movie Fulci! Now I like the way Fulci manages to apply all these comic roles in the Gorefest movie. He is such a brilliant director. From time to time there are some funny moments and plots, for example, when Fulci says that “making horror films is a disease”. The ending is very good, considering that Fulci (and most Italian horror masters) know that making an ending is meaningless or a lot of plot holes. If you like Fulci, be sure to check it out. If you have a weak stomach, avoid it and repeat “This is only a film.” Some of the bloody scenes in this film are: chainsaw dismemberment (complete), torn tongue, eyeballs torn out, dead bodies infected with larvae, zombies, decapitation, face put in boiling water, blows to the shower (head), throat cutting, many pieces the bodies and organs of the toast to the side, the face broken with a hammer ...
