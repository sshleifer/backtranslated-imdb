“In the mood for love” is a teasing allegory of loneliness and longing. Here is a movie without sex or even kissing - and this is without a doubt one of the sexiest and definitely the most provocative and psychological novels I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Tells the story of two people. who are coincidentally living in the same apartment, and are far from each other. The film, as in contrast to Random Hearts, tells how two people get together according to the novel of their two lovers. Only after receiving this news, they find time to think about the consequences of the novel and about each other's feelings about what they just broke up, and whether these two people are ready to fall in love again. /> <br /> What is surprising in the film is how director Wong Kar-wai presents a way to overcome loneliness for each character. With the character Maggie Cheung, he will show her in a repetitive installation: leaving home, going home, watching her neighbors playing games of chance, go to the noodle shop, get out of the noodle shop and run into her attractive peer played by Tony Leung . This is a clever, if not subtle and knowledgeable technique for representing solitude. Because it is when you are alone, when you fall into a loop. This film worked for me because I can identify with this feeling.
