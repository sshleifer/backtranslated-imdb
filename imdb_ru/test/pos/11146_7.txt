Reviewers who have complained that there is no credibility in this film or that there are problems with construction are missing the point. This is a wonderful camp romance, with a lot of games, gypsies! Dance, gypsies! music that simultaneously creates exotic love stories and celebrates them. Button Ray Milland makes a funny foil for Dietrich with black hair, torn scarves and tons of jewelry. The character's desire to feed Milland and look after him more closely resembles the good German Hausfrau Dietrich, who was not on the set than her mannered vampire roles. By virtue of the current censorship, it becomes clear that they divide the caravan only on platonic conditions, and Milland discourages Dietrich's successes by standing out as a heterosexual bachelor who can be killed any day. His only excuse is that it smells, so perhaps the sultry, fastidious Englishman could really be pushed away. <br /> <br /> In the small role of Milland's young companion in his secret mission, Bruce Lester adds a camp note: a different look. At first we are told that he is a hero who worships Milland, and, indeed, he likes him very much. When, after they split up, he meets Milland, who now turns into a gypsy woman with brown skin and a shirt that is open to the waist, and his luminous disguise rating further indicates that Millen is not just romantically fascinated by Dietrich. <br /> <br /> Despite the surprisingly incredible characters and sequence of events, Millandâ€™s growing love for Dietrich and his acceptance of the non-rational aspects of life are quite touching. And when on the last night before escaping, he says that each of them now contains half of the other, both have become one, and then darkness comes, I think we can assume that the censor decided to give them a break. ! One folly - at the beginning of Milland, who must be English, speaks to the lieutenant using American pronunciation. (The English say "left-handed.") Since Milland was British, he must have said that, because American filmmakers feared that the American audience would be distracted and embarrassed by the British style.
