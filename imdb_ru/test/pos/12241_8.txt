Or maybe not. Whatever anyone may think of Broadcast News, for good or for ill, almost all of the credit for this “thinking” belongs to the writer-producer-director James L. Brooks. As a screenwriter (from which he was for a long time one of the best), it is not easy to wildly conduct all business - in this case “business” - television news - but do it with a smile, wink, knowing a nod and laughter at almost every step. To do everything that requires real talent, Mr. J. Brooks has something in abundance. <br /> <br /> One of the users of this site asked his musical question: “Did Walter Cronkite act like that? "The answer is: no! Of course not! And the reason for this on Walter's day — well, Mr. Cronkite — the only thing that mattered was the news report to the people. The same goes for John the Chancellor and Chet, and also David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Of course, they had to pay attention to their ratings in order to please their bosses, but all that they REALLY cared about was the MOST NEWS. <br /> <br /> Now, of course, everything has changed. For the last 25-30 years in the field of network news, the only thing that really mattered is ratings, rei tings, ratings. Essence. How many dollars will our news department deliver for the network? Don't believe? <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at the “big three”: Tom Brokaw, Dan Ratzer and Peter Jennings (aka Stanley Stunning). All three have already worked on the corresponding anchor tables for the last 15–20 years (Peter actually got his first experience at the national anchor table as early as the 1960s, but was completely unprepared for this work). Of the three, Dan is the most experienced reporter in the field. Personally, I think that all three of them are doing an amazing job as leading news and deserve their positions. All this has nothing to do with why all three are actually in these jobs. All three are now over 60 (Dan insists on a big 7-0), and all three still look very good. And if you think they still look good now, imagine how good they looked when they were 40, when all three were hired (say, “to work”) for their current job. But you truly believe that any of these three would be “inserted” if he looked like, say, Fred Gwynn (“Herman Munster”). Or how - heaven protect - I !!! Not only that if Dan were retiring tomorrow, the younger (than he is today) Walter Cronkite would not have been able to return to his old job. What for? Not pretty enough. And it would not matter that he or was once "the most trusted person in America." <br /> <br /> And this is exactly what Broadcast News is about. Tom Grünick (William Hurt), the next handsome, leading national news, who has problems with some little things, such as thinking for yourself, the ability to write and know things. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a brilliant news producer with business news standards and ethics that everyone throws to the wind, even when she falls in love with a pretty boy Tom. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, no relation to James L.), a first-class journalist and field reporter who has no hope of a national job because he “flops” for the anchor stance. And many other such incorrect characters that you KNOW really exist in the news sections of various networks. <br /> <br /> Network has paved the way. Eleven years later, Broadcast News carried the torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, what will be the next film, which will destroy the business network "news that you can use" ..... maybe. Or maybe not.
