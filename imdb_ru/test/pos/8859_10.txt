John Carpenter shows how much he loves the original 1951, showing him the greatest respect he could possibly make, the only difference here is that Carpenter prefers to stick to the paranoid core of John Campbell Jr. The secret to the success of this version lies in the unbearable tension that accumulates when a group of people begins to suspect each other, and the tension of literally waiting for the seizure captures fear. Carpenter manages to deliver both the blows and the secret necessary for the film to go in the right direction. Whether it’s a terrible scene or an episode of “what’s in the shadow,” the film for me is the perfect combination of horror and science fiction. The dialogue is aimed at a group of people trying to keep him together under duress, and Carpenter’s account is a wonderful eerie pulse that increases the feeling of doom and paranoia that seeps through the film. The actors are gorgeous, a cohesive group of actors led by Carpenter, beloved Kurt Russell, while the effects used give the necessary amount of exposure. But most of all this is the end, which is the crown of glory, the end that does not condone the norm and is incredibly suitable for what happened before it, let's wait and see what is actually happening, 10/10.
