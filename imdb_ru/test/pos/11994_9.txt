Everyone has the right to opinion. The only critic who thinks is you yourself. I think this is a great movie. Much better than the original. <br /> <br /> In Caddyshack, Rodney Dangerfield is funny, but disgusting. He was asked to make a sequel, but things got in the way. Jackie Mason shows the saying that "less is more." He is funny, but a person with real family problems, a more rounded person. This is not a drama, but a movie that makes you feel. In fact, in some moments you feel sorry for Jackie Mason, especially when his daughter goes to him. <br /> <br /> He has a good soundtrack, and in general, very sorry. Good end of the series. <br /> <br /> In the television show "Alf" Alf says that he wept in the Rules of Affection. Wife Kate Tanner, played by Ann Shedin, also says that he cried in "Caddyshack 2".
