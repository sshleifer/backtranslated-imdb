I saw several films in my time, but this one is exceptional. You will have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate it, it is very emotionally complex, it explores love and passion in the most extreme way, and its cinematography is simply breathtaking. The character of the graph is extremely passionate and tragic, without the need to raise his voice or even leave the bed, the film is perfectly played out and well played. The film has a kind of mathematical precision and perfection, which is rare in our days. It combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics. This film should not be missed, all the hype around it and all the awards can not start to do it right. Hats off to Michael Ondaye for writing the incredible book on which it is based.
