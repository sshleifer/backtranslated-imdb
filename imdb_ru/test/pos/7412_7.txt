I just saw this movie in the preview, and before reading my comment, you should know that it is very subjective, because I love techno, trance, club, house and such music. <br /> <br /> The film is dedicated to Karl, whose brother Jason (or whatever his name was) died in an accident: he fell from the roof, "drunk." Carl meets her brother Sunny's girlfriend, and two of them conduct some kind of private investigation into Jason's death, completely unmotivated, and Carl gets involved in Jason's old life, which was filled with clubs and drugs. The film itself, when viewed from an artistic point of view, is nothing more than a big pile of shit. The plot is predictable, all the characters are extremely stamped and two-dimensional (a silly boy from a small town, a young pretty innocent girl, a big bad drug addict ... the list is endless) and most of the characters like the story are simply not credible. Matthew Rice's idea of ​​how a stupid boy comes to big London and suddenly takes drugs from people he doesn’t even know seems not very likely, unlike his female colleague Sunny performed by Sienna Guillory, whose behavior seems more realistic to the viewer . Nothing else, like a joke, was Tim Curry's game with the drug king Damian: a fake caricature, too “eevil” and just too ridiculous to be true. <br /> <br /> BUT: If you like club music (club scenes) for example, the selected tracks are great), if you like a simple love story with a cute girl such as Sunny (yes, I confess, I lost my heart ;) ... this makes my comment even more subjective, I suppose) with some (predictable) turns, you will definitely like this movie. <br /> <br /> Someone else: FORGET .... THIS! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (objective view) <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 (my personal opinion, as well as my final voice)
