I just finished watching Marigold today and start by finding this DVD on the shelves of Blockbuster. Walking around looking for something new and good to see, Ali Larter's picture caught my attention. <br /> <br /> After drooling on Ali Larter, I lifted the lid and continued to look around the lid. Apparently, I thought the costumes were a bit overpriced. And then I saw other Indians on the cover and realized that it was some kind of fake film or something like that. <br /> <br /> When I turned over the synopsis and saw Salman Khan, I made a double take. , Salman Khan in an American film with Ali Larter on a blockbuster DVD? Since Salman Khan refers to Bollywood films, like Mel Gibson to Hollywood films, I was very much looking forward to this film: it MUST be good! I am very pleased to say that Marigold is a phenomenal film! It far exceeded all my personal expectations! <br /> <br /> I suppose that such a film happens when you have a decent script, a talented, experienced, knowledgeable and goal-oriented director, playing leading roles of two incredible actors and just a very hardworking cast and crew! Khan and Larter have very good chemistry, and they both shine on the big screen: they look very good together. The musical numbers were not at all bad, which was surprising, considering how meager and long Indian musicals these days are. And you will be glad to know that Indian costumes are very far from being gentle as you get. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film was kind of slow, the middle was really good, the scenes leading to the climax were pretty dramatic, but the ending was just awesome! I have a few complaints and complaints on the DVD, however. Although I liked the widescreen aspect ratio of the DVD, I did not like the fact that some other things were left on the DVD. There are no subtitles to start with Now English is my native language, this is not a problem. However, when some Indian actors and actresses spoke, it was (sometimes) difficult to understand what they were saying; Subtitles would help. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I would appreciate on a DVD is a video with a checkpoint or some sort of collection of excerpts. And finally, what about the menu function that would allow us to go directly to the musical numbers? Dude, some of these songs were really good! On the other hand, I really enjoyed watching the creation of Marigold. <br /> <br /> I still have a ton of words to say about the amazingness of this film and how much I liked it, but I have neither the time nor the I want to continue writing, why I liked it so much. I hope that Salman Khan makes more English films in addition to his Hindi films, and I certainly hope that this Hindi film will not be Ali Larterâ€™s latest Bollywood film. And I urge the director to continue releasing Bollywood movie hybrids with Salman Khan, Ali Larter and other well-known actors - just make sure the scripts are original and good. <br /> <br /> 10/10 is just a great movie about a love story that your whole family can enjoy!
