Let's face it, there is no perfect production of Hamlet, it’s just too long and varied and cerebral to be completely perfect in all directions, especially with the problems of Elizabethan English and Shakespeare’s complex dialogue. In any production, there must be certain moments, scenes or intonations with which you disagree. I have seen many productions in Hamlet: Olivier, Gibson, Brana, Scott, and now this BBC film with Jacobi. In terms of accurate, full-length productions, this is one of the best places. <br /> <br /> Most of Hamlet’s performances have been drastically reduced, because it takes four to five times to play the entire piece. h. This statement seems to be complete, that is, ALL of Shakespeare’s original dialogue is intact, and therefore it is important for scholars and amateurs of Shakespeare. And although in rare cases, the lines seemed to be hurried (for those who are not quite familiar with the text), for the most part the script is well developed, well thought out and well executed. Subtitles are available and very useful, although in some cases they are a little behind. <br /> <br /> Jacobi performs remarkable work with the longest and most impossible role of the theater. I actually cried when Hamlet dies, and I don't think I did this before. Patrick Stewart (as Claudius) and Claire Bloom (as Gertrude) are excellent, as are Lalla Ward (Ophelia), David Robb (Laert) and the rest of the cast. The sets are minimal, so we, fortunately, can concentrate on the game, without being distracted and not paying attention to secondary subjects. <br /> <br /> After 3 hours and 45 minutes this full-length Hamlet is a long way to sit down, but again, if you want to get a real deal, it is 100% worth it, even if you need to take a break for yourself. I highly recommend this work to all lovers and scholars of Shakespeare.
