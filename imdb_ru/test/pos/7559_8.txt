This is one of the best presentations of the 60s, filmed on film. Arthur Penn, director of Bonnie, Clyde and the Little Big Man, saw that the outstanding screenplay of Steve Tesich sounded believable, and from these two talents there is a solid movie. "George Miles" Jodie Thelin gives the viewers the male pain of nostalgia for archetypal beauty, which is almost in our hands, but always just out of reach. Just look, otherwise your cinematic education will be incomplete.
