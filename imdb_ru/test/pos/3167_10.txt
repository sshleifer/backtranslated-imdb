At first I could not tell whether it was a feature film or a documentary. The next day, I had a unique film about taste or perhaps revelation. The film is a human desire to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. Lead is ignorant and cold. He, like all of us, wants to get rich, laugh, travel, eat and have fun. He moves from one place to another in a gigantic RV with no direction or motive just to pass the time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late. Since I first saw the United States, he has grown on me like a dream, where life on earth is nothing more than a strange experience. I am an artist and a Buddhist, and this film came to my senses. It was the perfect incarnation of impermanence. It may sound strange, but somehow this film could touch me as deeply as anyone else. I recommend it.
