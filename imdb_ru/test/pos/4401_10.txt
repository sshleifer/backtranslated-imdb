I came out of the Coen movie earlier and didn’t quite know how to feel. The two best examples of this are Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so full of strange humor that I liked it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary delusions with flying people and killing bowling balls that simply did not fit into the shape of the film. However, I liked the film, and now I have a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysteria, sometimes I wasn’t sure why I laughed so hard that it made me cry, but I was nonetheless. Fargo had a lot of seemingly weird characters, but after further investigation they were actually just real people who talked about real situations. That's why a man with a shovel (or it was a broom) was so ridiculous when he told a police officer about some funny-looking man at a bar that night. And that is why the theater burst into laughter when he said that some funny looking clouds appear. (I also have a copy of this film) The Coens have a way to disguise their film and their characters as somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look at the same characters that seem crazy, you will always find that in some strange way they all ring true. This is something quite exceptional in brother, where are you? This is the film that is there. I mean, it's not even on the same level as in a traditional movie. Last summer I watched the film “Mine”, and in it I said that “Mine” is a good film that I saw a thousand times earlier. But you cannot say this about the film of Brother Cohen, and you most certainly cannot say anything about this film. <br /> <br /> In this film there is everything, starting with prison, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to I can only assume that these are historical figures, baptisms on the banks of the river, bank robberies, violence against animals, singing of flocks religious fanatics, kkk, crowds of vigilantes and so on. Obviously, there are also many references to Homer's Odyssey, but I would not know this, because I never read Homer's Odyssey and did not even know one thing about it. It seems that every newspaper reviewer knows all about it, and they think that this cynicism and almost like parody quality make the film much better. Well, if you come from a guy who knows nothing about it, I can say that it is still an entertaining film. Sometimes again, as usual for the Cohen film, I wasn't sure why I was entertained or laughed, but I was. <br /> <br /> This is a road picture where three men travel along the path. to find the hidden treasure, which, according to Clooney, he hid in front of two other inmates. He should take them with him, because they were also chained to him when they had a chance to escape. <br /> <br /> I like all the main actors in the film, and many of them are Cohen’s close friends. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro, who seems to have a place in every Coen film. It is a pity that they did not find a place for Steve Buscemi, but this is a completely different story. But back to Clooney. The man just charisma. He is also a hellish actor, and here he is not as evil as the others, but even he has his own peculiarities. His work here is simply amazing, and I really hope that it shows that he is capable of playing any character. <br /> <br /> Now, after having collected all this praise in the film, let me also say this. At first I didn’t really like the movie. I found it quite tedious and a bit boring. There were too many ideas here, and not enough attention was paid to using them for everything they cost. But then the film began to grow on me. It took some time, but it grew on me. I don't think this is their best film, but it's still a good one, and I give it 8.5. But the reason I recommend this film is for one reason only. <br /> <br /> Every day you can look in the newspaper and watch movies that play, and talk to yourself, see, see o, see last year, it's the same thing as this movie, and the same as this movie. Most films have been reworked in one form or another. Not Cohen's films. They have not been recycled, and if they are, I do not know about it. This is reason enough to see what they have released. Originality is very important in my books. Cohens are original and good. And this is not common in today's cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. Because in many films you do not have such a vision, so when you do it, enjoy it!
