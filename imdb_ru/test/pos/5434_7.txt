Not every line in a comedy is funny. This film raises a serious topic - powerlessness of voters and shows it to the light, telling jokes about it. This is a film that the Daily Show would do if they wanted to turn it into a movie. I found that Robin Williams is much funnier in this film than in RV. And although my wife and I share several opposing political views, we were both laughing in two parts of this film. Script writers could give Fox News some lessons in a fair and balanced manner. Lewis Black was fine on his part, but never seemed able to show his particular comedy for his role. Christopher Walken was also good, playing his rather usual low-key supporting role, pushing the story forward.
