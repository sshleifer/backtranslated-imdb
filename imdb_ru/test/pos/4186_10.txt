Very strange, psychedelic, esoteric (and did I say strange? :) experience. <br /> <br /> But at least on the same level - he did exactly what he had to do. This made it possible to bridge the gap between the stupid, fictional Hollywood look at teenage pop idols, which was the Monkey TV program, and the adult, musically growing and developing, and at the same time still a little stupid Monkey . <br /> The most important line in the film is Mike Nesmith: "If they think we are plastic, wait until they see how we do it." The fact that Monkeys are tired of all the negative comments about their image and their work is a record. They said it again and again in an interview. They needed to remake themselves, and what could be better to get out of bed and have fun to set fire to the car itself that created them. And at the same time, they commented on our entire society (news, films, art, everything else) and said: “Hey, why touch us - not all these things are produced at one point or another.” These are the Orwellian “tests” (“Monkeys” represented the pursued “average man” even in their most stupid TV shows), the “Big Brother” tightening pants and kicking him in a very decent ass. <br /> <br /> Loved ideas, loved music, loved effects, loved movies! But then, as Peter Tork says in the film: “But then why should I speak, because I don’t know anything?” :)
