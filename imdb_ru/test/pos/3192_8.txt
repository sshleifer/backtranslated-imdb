I first saw Love in Limbo, playing late evening on free-air television about five years ago, and since then it is a film that I will always remember warmly, as one of those films that you see and that always influences. <br /> <br /> For the uninitiated, the Australian film has a long history of creating original comedies about attractive losers, and Love in Limbo is a great example of this. While Russell Crowe is the only actor in this film (although he currently needs a film), the rest of the Australian actor is good - he still steals the show as a nervous, boring, virgin loser. <br /> br /> The general premise is very similar to the American pie. A group of friends wanting to be laid and become men. As expected, the entire film focuses on this (with a story about the leaderâ€™s matter and various other incidents) and is full of humorous situations that push him to an inevitably pleasant ending. <br /> <br /> If you liked the American pie, do not expect that it will be the same, but expect that the same agreements will appear. Love in Limbo is not just a romantic comedy, but it certainly has a bit of laughter, strong moments when a good guy wins, and situations that every guy, Aussie or someone else can face. <br /> <br /> Look if you liked: an American pie, almost famous. Strengths: A good Australian cast that is easy to relate, good value for perverts. Weaknesses: predictable in points. My rating: 8 out of 10
