Some people do not appreciate the magical elements in ROS, but it is they who distinguish this series, and the fact that the producers actually decided to dress the actors in proper vintage clothes and armor - not anachronistic feathered caps, colorful tights and plate armor! <br /> <br /> But I do write to comment on the authorâ€™s earlier article. Hmm, Michael Praed didn't leave ROS to make Jules Verne! Between these two series of 15 years. Yes, I agree, and Michael may well agree that leaving ROS was not a good move - but it was a welcome Broadway role that seduced him in 84th, and then in Dynasty with megabucks of salary ...
