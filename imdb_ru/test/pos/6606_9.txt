A dozen bored surfers, mostly children in Venice, California, not only reinvent the skateboard, but also turn the once-forgotten suburban fad of the 1950s into a revolution of active sports. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn narrates, Dogtown portrays life in the more worn out beach communities “Only for locals” around 1974, which consisted mainly of surfing in the early morning tides and hanging around. The Zephyr team (or Z-Boys, as they are called) spend one summer fighting boredom, creating their own boards with the help of a local who owns a surf shop. After taking part in the re-emerging skateboarding competitions at SoCal, they turn it all into their own scene; one that awakens a generation of skateboarders made up of such great people as Tony Hawk, Shaun White and the creators of the X-Games. <br /> <br /> Dogtown puts a chronological perspective on skateboarding and bootstrapping a story you never knew about. <br /> <br /> by Andy Fry on MySportsComplex.blogspot.com
