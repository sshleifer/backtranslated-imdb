This film is amazing because it showed how good cartoons really looked in the 80s, the animators were not lazy, as today, the cartoon had so many details with very little resources that they have compared to what we have today. If more and more people demand to retransmit these cartoons, then perhaps all the other 80s cartoons will be shown again on television, so to complete the sentence, I just wanted to say that it was a cartoon with which i grew up and really x bodies would have it to be on TV again.
