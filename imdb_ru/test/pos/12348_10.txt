From the way he looks at the other comments made, it seems that many people did not understand the meaning of the film. He is not centered around zombies, in fact they are not zombies at all, this device recreated by a magician to scare girls to death, his main focus is on Meg Tilly, whom he wants to help him finish the work he died by doing first and what you get is a great movie with a terrific end, it's hard to find in the video, but from time to time it appears on HBO or Cinamax, watch it, I gave it 10 and highly recommend it.
