I was lucky that this film appeared on TCM, so I had the opportunity to watch it. It is quite difficult to find, despite the fact that this is a classic Hitchcock. Unfortunately, he also has his flaws, some of which Hitchcock repeated later. First, the finale is too neat and “perfect.” In the last few scenes, up to the last five minutes, there is a striking tension; then, five minutes just clear everything ... very unsatisfactory. The ending is also too dramatic for the Hitchcock movie. He is, was and always will be the master of the unknown ... why would he descend to something as low as a cheap sequence of actions for the final? In addition to several shortcomings, the film is great. The plot is great; one of the best and versatile in history. Theme? Simply. You meet a stranger. Perfect stranger. He offers to kill someone for you ... you know that you have someone you want to kill (if not more, subconsciously). Trick? He asks you to do the same for him ... will you accept this strange but ingenious agreement? You are free from suspicion, just like he ... after all, none of you knew the victim. And you also do not know each other ... you are just "strangers in the train." A brilliant concept that can affect almost every person. The pace is good, you never lose interest or patience. Cinematography is good, but not nearly as good as in other, better Hitchcock films. The game is flawless. Characters are well written, authentic and realistic. Hitchcock uses some of the elements he often uses; the dominant mother, the mother boy, etc. The film is very good, but it looks a bit relaxed. It was not that famous extra mile that would make it big. It stopped before crossing the line between what is common and what is bold. This is the main reason that the film did not turn out great, but mostly remains good, with the potential to be greater than that. The end leaves you unsatisfied and disappointed. However, everything that leads to the end is very good, so the film still deserves 8/10. Good, but not great. Any Hitchcock fan should see this, as he is one of the best ... somewhat far down the list, but still there. I recommend this to any Hitchcock fan. 8/10
