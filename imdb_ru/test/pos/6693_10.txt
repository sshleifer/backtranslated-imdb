Life consists of endless possibilities; some know, others - a mystery and destined to remain so. And what about the huge unknown, areas beyond which knowledge has no fixed boundaries or parameters? Who can say what exists or what is possible? Actual questions, all of which are raised and explored in the history of a particular person’s personal journey, a strange and dramatic odyssey that challenges facts and logic in K-PAX, directed by Ian Softly, and starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges After the incident at the New York City Central Station, a man named Prot (Spacey) was taken to a mental hospital in Manhattan, where he was taken into the care of Dr. Mark Powell (Bridges), who is trying to uncover the truth about his patient He claims to be from the distant planet K-PAX. This is quickly becoming a problem for Dr. Powell, since Prot, with his calm, rectilinear manner and penchant for the product (he eats a banana peel and all that, and his favorite red tasty apples) is convincing enough. But Powell’s work, as well as his nature, is a skeptic. Prot’s statements, however, remain unchanged and remain in place even with the most intense research and the careful look of Dr. Powell, who finds himself in something difficult - Prot even tells him the exact date and time when he goes to K-PAX, the planned return trip , which allows Powell, but for a short time, to understand everything. And Powell just cannot think that he is dealing with a real alien creature; and this is what he will need to quickly decide if he ever finds out the truth. And he should know. In the end, truth is the only thing that will free him in his own mind. <br /> <br /> Softly created and released a sensitive, thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer, supporting the secret by surrounding Prot, forcing you to reflect on your own ideas about what is actually possible. And since you will never know for sure about Protea before the denouement, you can identify with Powell, seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the riddle with him. Softly creates an atmosphere of surprise and a real sense of collision with something that is truly unique when the story unfolds, and you begin to understand that Prot may be what he says. And in the context of the reality of the film, this is an exciting thing to try to wrap your mind around. How do you react when all the evidence contradicts the physical limitations that we set for ourselves? While at the heart of the film there is a tremendous depth of humanity, which is evident not only in Prot, but in Dr. Powell, as well. All this creates an incredibly exciting and exciting drama. <br /> <br /> As we expected, Kevin Spacey brilliantly plays the role of Prot, presenting his character from the inside, emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. This is a unique personality, and Spacey animates his life and provides an opportunity to share those moments that are particularly revealing, which increases the credibility of the character and credibility of the story itself. In order for this film to work, it is important that we believe who and what Prot is; we do and it does. Spacey is doing great. This is a memorable performance, from which the character develops, who will stay with you for a long and long time. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges, meanwhile, appears on an equal footing with Spacey, skillfully turning a person into a doctor. Powell This is a fairly simple role, and the Bridges' task was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make it unique in its own right, which, unlike the character of Prot, was not a small task. And, again, in order for this film to work, Bridges had to approach this occasion. And, possessing exceptional skill and being an unsurpassed professional, he succeeds without question. Bridges give Powell the main difficulty and are so inferior in his performance that they make the interaction between Powell and Prot bright and sometimes intense. This is a demonstration of the two best actors in the business who do what they do best, creating a dynamic that is lively and inspiring. This is a great work by Bridges, who never tries to steal the spotlight from Prot, who serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher level. <br /> <br /> The support team includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfre Woodard (Dr. Willers), Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell (Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). The entertaining, emotionally exciting film “K-PAX” is a dissertation about the possibilities, as well as a study of the ever-changing complexities of the human condition. This is a film that requires impartiality and rewards those who are able to approach it on their own terms and accept it. In the end, it makes you realize how real K-PAX is; and it makes you appreciate Prot's journey and how much we share and have in common with those around us, people or aliens. And it might just make you think about your own journey - where you were and where you go. And this is the magic of movies. I rate this 10/10. <br /> <br />
