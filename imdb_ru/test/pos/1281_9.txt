Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is memorable. The film was very well received and will help to issue contracts for the creation of "Memory" and quite rightly. <br /> <br /> Below is a great example of film making. No fancy effects or bleeding blood ... just great writing and a good game. Nolan manages to charm us with his letter again. The actors, all unknown to me and, I suppose, most of the people did a good job helping the characters live. They were all believable, and that was all they needed. The film is confusing because it plays a lot with chronology, but in the end it is very useful. The film is a bit short to be a full-length film, but any extra length would ruin the style of the film, and the brilliance of the letter would be reduced. Although the film is short, it has all the aspects that make the film attractive (IMO): an intriguing start, an exciting middle and an unexpected end. <br /> <br /> I dare say that “Follow” is almost as good as “Memento”, his best film to date. Scrambled chronology is equally masterfully used in both films, amazing plot twists are present, and the game is very good. <br /> <br /> This film was made for as little as $ 6,000, but the quality is much higher than most (almost all) box office hits for a million dollars. Using b / w can be a difficult pill for a large audience. First of all, Nolan demonstrates his skills to studio bosses :-) And what skills they are ... rarely did I like to write so much, as in "Follow". Even Pi doesn't even come close to the IMO, although this is also very good. <br /> <br /> This film is surely not to be missed by any self-respecting movie lover. If you like Memento, “Follow” is definitely for you.
