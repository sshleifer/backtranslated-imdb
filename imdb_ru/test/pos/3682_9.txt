Dude, I had my doubts. I love Kathy Bates, but I thought how good it could be, I never even heard about it ...! You know, it was one of those things, we gave her "20 minutes, and we turn it off if she sucks," and we were locked in from the beginning. This is a very attractive, fun movie. Do you know this strange? I mean, you have a lounge singer, a killer (and believable), you have a farce, then Katie Bates in all her acting glory, Rupert Everett finally reveals her real potential, Dan Aroyd, and the dwarf who make you laugh out loud. I tell you, you will laugh / you will cry. <br /> <br /> I may have had a strange week, but I think this film is at the level of roasted green tomatoes. If you donâ€™t like this movie, you may not like it, but I think it was a great movie. I went out and bought a DVD.
