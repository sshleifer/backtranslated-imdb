I don’t have to say much about how good this documentary is - it’s really an amazing piece of real narration. The story is quite simple: a white pensioner tourist was killed by a young black man in Florida, and the arrested boy was mistreated and brought to justice, with only the public defender and his family on his side. This is very exciting, and the public defender is a joy to watch all his human ways - you cannot but strive for the victory of justice, and the ending justifies more than you would expect from a real story. <Br /> <br /> It is a pity that more people have not seen this documentary, but hopefully you will find a way to watch it. For those interested in race relations in the United States, as well as the actual work of law enforcement and the legal process, this documentary is worth your effort and time. I give it 10.
