The Captain and Tennille have released a very good package of 3 DVDs with minimal editing. Unlike most variety shows, these shows were not hacked. Music and dance numbers are included in the parodies as well as during the first broadcast. I suspect that some of the DVD music numbers may have been edited in a show where they didnâ€™t appear at the beginning, but could not verify this suspicion. I noticed a few inconsistencies between what is on the DVD and the program information I found on the net. I could not verify whether the information on the network is inaccurate or the musical performances were edited in a show on DVD. Anyway, I am very grateful for the efforts made by the manufacturing company. I would like every released variety to show the same respect for the format. I suppose that about half of the gears are included. I believe they faced rights issues for the show, which were not included. We hope that these problems can be solved, and Volume 2 may be released in the future. There are several separate music videos, as well as a dance rehearsal. I recommend this DVD to any C & T fan.
