This movie was awesome. Never before have I seen a film that brought me to the harsh reality of drug use, like this one. There is no glamor, sugar coating or glorifying heroine. This film shows the real struggle, pain and loss that people face when faced with this drug. A good film, worthy of emotionally rich acting and a great plot. Many hours! <br /> <br />
