This is a great family film telling about mundane people who like their local interests, mostly about horse racing. Lloyd Burdell (Walter Mattau) is a farmer who also grows four-legged horses, and he has a little son named Casey Burdell who loves horses. Lloyd can raise an adult horse, which he calls the "Shadow of Casey" in honor of his son, and this horse beats all speed records and is a possible winner in a million-dollar race. Sarah Blue (Alexis Smith) became interested in this horse and offers to buy a horse for $ 500.00, but this horse suffers serious injuries to the legs, and Lloyd gets a serious failure, which grieves the whole family. Walter Mattau gave an outstanding presentation, and this is a great movie to watch and enjoy.
