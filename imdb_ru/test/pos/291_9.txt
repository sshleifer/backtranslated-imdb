This is a classic war movie. One of the best, stunning images with flashing lights, agonizing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades turning into ceiling fans. A star-studded spectacle of immense power. <br /> <br /> Martin Shin is a mercenary sent upriver to kill a stray general, a sadistic dictator whom the great Marlon Brando played incredibly. In addition, Robert Duval as an excellent DI with a tendency to “napalm in the morning” or at least its smell. Dennis Hopper is an energetic photojournalist with slanting views of the war and his leader. In addition, in this amazing film, you will see rising stars such as Laurence Fishburne, R. Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall, and also look at Harrison Ford ... <br /> <br /> Behind Francis Ford Coppolla shoots a film with more, perhaps more intensity and drama, than in the famous films “The Godfather”, it emphasizes war in its basic form, which for the most part you cannot see, you can only feel it as the boat goes upriver, the feeling of dragging out the war is completely unbearable. The feeling is quite a claustrophobic feeling and really causes unusual moods in the audience. Honestly, no film ever made me feel that way. <br /> <br /> Hard to find criticism. The biggest dissatisfaction of some is that Brando made a lot of money in ten minutes of the role, but, frankly, this is unjustified. It was a well-earned money, a role that physically limited him, being an unhealthy man at the time, and a role he really made his own. I can not imagine anyone better for this role. And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version, there are some additional great features of a great man, and I think Redux really makes the movie a mile. <br /> <br /> Last impression - if you’re lucky enough to get the Redux version, then you will be blessed with a perfectly satisfactory film with an additional 49 minutes of footage. If not, then, nevertheless, you will not be disappointed, this film is there with the best, and deserves a lot of recognition, and a solid place as one of the 50 best films ever made ...
