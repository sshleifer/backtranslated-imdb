I always heard about this wonderful mini-series, but I watched it for the first time this week, in July 2007. I understand why he began the career of so many young actors. The story is intriguing and gives an excellent insight into the period before and during the civil war. I took care of the characters and how their lives developed during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they still helped me see how people thought in the 1800s. Many historical facts were thrown into history, and it was interesting to see how history books come to life. The costumes and decorations were great! I really enjoyed watching both parts I and II. Part III is disappointing.
