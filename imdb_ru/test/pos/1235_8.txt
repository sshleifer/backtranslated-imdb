While cartoons and / or references to people in the entertainment industry or things or even product brands are usually basic in shorts like this, they are not used here in quantities. Most of the individual jokes are quite common. As I am going to give examples, below are the spoilers: <br /> <br /> I noticed only three (well, technically four at the very end of the caricature) caricatures, which is rather low for this type of shorts, although one of them is a characteristic character with sufficient activity. These are Jack Benny (in the role of Jack Bunny), Leopold Stoukowski and the inimitable Ned Sparks (in the role of crabs on the can-chance, chances are very high that if in the 1930s and 1940s the Warner Brothers crab participated in crabs, a caricature was used) will be Ned Sparks). There are also references to the Bakai Rose Aquacade and the radio show character riff called Henry Aldrich (Soon, Mom!), Superman Play (Superhero), and the villain taking off at King Kong. That's it for this kind of gag. <br /> <br /> The products themselves are mostly general in nature, and gags are more of a game on basic items in unusual situations, such as turtles, coming out of soup cans to attack a villain like a tank tomato soup cans labeled “Can- can ”, gingerbread men turning into paratroopers, using napkins for parachutes, etc. Jokes are very good, and this is a great example of the cartoon by Bob Clampett. Clampett achieved his success by the director, and although this is not the best thing in his best work, there’s nothing to sneeze on either. This short can be found in Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 3, which is an excellent collection that I highly recommend. This short self is also recommended.
