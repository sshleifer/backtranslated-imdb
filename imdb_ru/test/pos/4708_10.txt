My ex-wife and I saw the trailer for this film and were intrigued. We waited until it was released, but when this happened, he did not stay in the cinema for a very long time. A few years later I bought it on VHS and transferred it to DVD to save. <br /> <br /> I discovered that he is very touching. It is about real events in a real country. BURMA received such a bad reputation for the political oppression it had created that they changed their name. <br /> <br /> I think women with a little makeup are very sexy. Patricia Arquette in this film. Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray are in it for a while. <br /> <br /> Arriving home and finding that her son and husband were brutally murdered, Laura (Arquette) is afraid of blood. Bad trait for the doctor. Her sister (McDormand) persuades her to go on vacation to Burma. While there, she witnessed a peaceful demonstration and stole a passport. In a bold (or stupid) step, she asks the tourist guide to show her something from the tourist route. Her guide is wounded by soldiers, and she spends the rest of the film, trying to protect him and herself. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch it, it reminds me that in the United States we forget about this peasant living under military rule, SOCIALISM, where at least food is guaranteed, it looks damn good.
