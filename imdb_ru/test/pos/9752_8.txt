I found this film educational, interesting and very exciting. I was impressed when I found out how much Justice Arbor did during his time in Kosovo. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is very undervalued, and I am pleased to see her again in a Canadian production. Other easily recognizable stars are Leslie Hope (24 years old) and John Corbett ("Sex in the City"). <br /> <br /> Although the plot line of this film may not be entirely actual, I had a desire to learn more about the word Arbor. Great movie for inspiring young women. <br /> <br /> I say that the film "must-see".
