This is probably one of those films that comment on too much, but they did not find ... This is probably one of the masterpieces of Spanish cinema, such as one of Bunuel’s works. “15 days with you” could be better “now and they” by visiting other films a long time ago: maybe “Midnight Cowboy”, but maybe also “Les amants du Pont-Neuf” or realistic and not-the-spot (but the most realistic) "training". This difficult story has a place for humor, love and a clearly dramatic meaning. In the new social Spanish cinema, this small diamond can be the resurrection of Italian neo-realism, mixed with the best films of Ken Loach. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best film I have found in the last 10 years.
