So glad that I have now HBO. I didnâ€™t plan to watch the movie today, but when I returned home and saw that the next film on HBO was exactly that, I decided (based on the description) to at least give it a chance. I'm so glad I decided to watch this movie! Maybe this film just caught me in a vulnerable moment (I'm a little tired, I have a huge exam to study on), but it definitely gave me a pretty good look at friendship, not to mention what taught me a valuable lesson empathy. Currently, I am in the same year after graduating from the school of pharmacies, and the whole scene with the participation of a doctor and a nurse, of course, has become a learning point for me! <br /> <br /> In any case, I just wanted to publish to inform the world. This is an amazing film that should not be missed. In this film, everyone will find something for themselves!
