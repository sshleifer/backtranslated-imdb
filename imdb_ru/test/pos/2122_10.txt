Grand Champion is, at first glance, a little old-fashioned fashion. Andrew Morton from the telegram "The Star of Fort Worth" said that best of all "If Walt Disney was from Texas, he would have become the Grand Champion." <br /> <br /> There is no video or special effects in the film, but it has a soul. Children are wonderful, and many stars are incredible. I bet Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts are proud of the fact that in the film that their children can actually see :) (With rating) <br /> <br /> This is a masterfully created “simple” little film made in Texas Barry. Tubb. Take your children, take the children of your friends, take your grandmother too ... they will all like it, and you too.
