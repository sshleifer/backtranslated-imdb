A team from Scully and Mulder, two other scientists, a pilot and a guy who plays Bana on Seinfeld, held different positions: they climbed to an Arctic research post, where all the participants died, killing each other or killing themselves. They discover that there is a worm - a virus that parasitizes to madness and death. The problem is that after a certain dog lash out, someone can get infected, but who? This is not only my favorite episode of the first season, but also one of my favorite TV shows. The Arctic environment surrounds the characters, and, of course, as the “Carpenter's Thing”, it is a lot of fun to watch these balanced characters suddenly begin to emerge in dramatic scenes. And the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are cheesy, I did not mind them at all. The drama between the characters ends up working more than usual because of the tension and the fact that all the actors (including the Bana guy) understand what's going on in the story. And, as usual, I liked the uncertainty of the ending. Highly recommended.
