“Black Rain” by Shohei Imamavry was released in 1989 just at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, which makes the film about the slow deterioration of the radiation victims in Hiroshima even more acute. Black rain in the title refers to a combination of ash, fallout and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion. There were other books and films about dropping the atomic bomb, but not as unique and powerful as this one. Based on the novel by Masuji Ibus, who collected information from interviews and diaries of victims of real bombs, the film shows how the bomb is exposed to psychological and physical effects on the whole family years after the initial explosion. This is a terrifying vision, but it evokes deep compassion for humanity. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, when soldiers and civilians do their usual daily activities. Suddenly a blinding light flashes and a thunderclap resounds. Almost every building is destroyed or damaged without the possibility of repair. The first atomic bomb dropped on the city has now become part of history. Survivors must somehow resume their lives, unaware of the devastating effects of the bomb. Filmed in a high-contrast black-and-white plot, the story is centered around Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka), a young woman caught in radioactive rain when her boat heads back to the city in search of friends and relatives. In Hiroshima, Imamura shows us the indelible images that remain with us: a boy with skin hanging from his body begs his brother to find him, an elderly man in tears because of her inability to free her son from piles of garbage, the Mother Tormented when she shakes her blackened body your child. <br /> <br /> When the family returns to the farmhouse, Yasuko’s life changes forever. She sees her friends dying around her and is waiting for the inevitable attacks of radiation sickness that have already affected her uncle Shigematsu Simuza (Kazuo Kitamura) and aunt Shigeko Simuza (Etsuko Ichihara). Pretending that things are done only as usual, the family denies that the bomb affected Yasuko. “She forgot how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed. Everyone forgot about it. They forget the hellfire and go to rallies as an annual festival. I'm sick of it, ”says Katayama's friend (Akiji Kobayashi). Yasuko learns this tragedy, feeling shame that it is different from others, and guilty of being infected. <br /> <br /> When her aunt and uncle try to find her husband, suitable men refuse to marry her because of health suspicions, although Shigematsu copied her diary to prove that she was not directly affected by the bomb. The only fan with whom she feels comfortable is another injured man, Yuichi (Keisuke Ishida), who has a panic attack every time he hears the roar of the engine. In the end, the beauty of life manifests itself fleetingly when Yasuko walks to the pond and sees the sight she has dreamed of all her life - carp jumping in the water, playfully, as if saying that despair is still joy Unfortunately, we hear Radio statements by politicians about the use of bombs again in the Korean War. “People don't learn anything,” says Shigematsu. “They choke themselves. An unjust peace is better than a justice war. Why can't they see? ”I hope that the“ Black Rain ”of the Imamura allowed us all to see more clearly.
