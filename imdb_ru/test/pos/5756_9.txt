Well, this may not be the most difficult movie you have ever seen. In fact, this is nothing complicated. It's childish, teenage, harmless, idiotic .. And totally ridiculous. Basically, Richie and Eddie run the worst hotel in Britain. Tell us about the ridiculous antics with the guests, while they are beating each other, try to get rent from a single resident who is stupid enough to stay, have a drink with friends all night long from the power station next door ... to stay to avoid the press. Try it if you are a fan of Rick and Ade and their work. If you don't ... Don't get a movie. It's simple. <br /> <br /> * I’m not fat, this word comes from Rick’s other stunning journey into the world of cinema ^ _ ^
