The fun team, which brought you CNNNN and Chaser Decides, has returned to ABC with its new series War of the Hunter for Everything. Filmed in front of a live audience, the Chaser team, once again, does what it does best - sets fire to key political figures, international celebrities and media representatives. <br /> <br /> Satire is priceless and nothing is sacred. In recent weeks, a team of pursuers stalked alongside the queen (during her visit to Australia) to try to dismiss John Howard, and Kim Beazley ) threatened to stab them. <br /> <br /> A particularly funny segment is “Mr. Ten Questions,” featuring an overly enthusiastic reporter who addresses celebrities (recently Charlize Theron and The Backstreet Boys) and asks them ten such silly questions: rice grain? ”Just for the record, Theron ignored him and left, and one of the Backstreet Boys got angry and“ refused to deign this answer. ” <br /> <br /> The segment in which I was recently at the seams was when one of the team decided to become a “street musician” in order to win some money. When he realized how hopeless he was, he put a real statue in his place. The perfect scam! He got thirty dollars in twenty minutes! <br /> <br /> A brilliant satire of the entire Australian society. Two thumbs up! <br /> <br /> (By the way, the show will not be shown for three weeks after Easter, because "although the team is all atheists, they are also hypocrites.")
