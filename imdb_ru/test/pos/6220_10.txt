Jäniksen vuosi is one of the most political films of Järva. He strongly opposes the status of the authority of modern society in the life of the common man and how he completely removed people from nature. It challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society. <br /> <br /> Vatanen (Antti Litzha) - choking, buying concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations - trying to break the chains of society, avoiding all this in the desert of northern Finland - only to understand that the concept of “free countries "is not so unambiguous, in other words, society has a simple man by the balls. <br /> <br /> However, what makes Jäniksen vuosi so exceptional, besides its visual and humorous splendor, is how it illustrates the whole political atmosphere of Finland in the 1970s, as well as the identity of Finland as a nation. . Vatanen is similar to the archetype of a classic Finn in his solitude and social remoteness. Since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us, the Finns, the very idea that modern society is gradually taking it away makes Jäniksen vuosi emotionally extremely exciting.
