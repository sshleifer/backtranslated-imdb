This film has been “chasing” me since I was 8 years old. I did not know what it was called, so it was so pleasant to me at last to track him. I remember being very scared, because I was just at a tin mine in Cornwall when I watched it, so I could imagine it all. Fortunately, I did not see any ghosts of dead children there, but I found this film really very disturbing and scary when I was much younger. I certainly never forgot it, although I could not find it anywhere. I think I remember that the films of the Children's Film Fund were generally good, but they no longer show them. I also remember programs such as Children of Green Knowledge in the same era on the BBC - equally disturbing in their own way.
