It was much better than I expected, the film was oozing with professionalism compared to other B-motives of this kind of budget. The script was good, if a bit formulaic, but the game was surprisingly good for everyone, including Lorenzo, and you always expect good standards from Scheider and Bousey. As well as a good plot and action, the action is good, especially car chases and A-class accidents. In general, this is an increase compared to other thrillers of B-movies, and it should not rely on constant nudity or the flow of silly puns to compensate for the shortcomings of the budget and scenarios.
