Yes, this is Sean Connery, who is again playing Bond, who is watching more vividly and from his side than ever since they first shot this film, in 1965, when it was called “The Stormball.” But the tongue is so hard on the cheek that it is interesting if Connery doesn’t use a few tricks from his friend and the more humorous successor Roger Moore. <br /> <br /> Moore is my favorite Bond, but Connery makes a strong case for himself in this unusual walk. The only serious Bond film, filmed under the auspices of Eon Bond's classic series, “Never Say Never”, is an disrespectful return to the well. Gentle in action, he is nonetheless strong in character and intelligent dialogue. <br /> <br /> Bond, it immediately became clear - a man in trouble. No matter how many times he has saved the world, his new boss thinks little about his fat lifestyle. "Too many free radicals, this is your problem ... Due to eating too much red meat, white bread, too much martini." “Then I will cut off the white bread, sir,” Bond replies cheerfully. <br /> <br /> An early fight in the spa is a film with a bright fighter, when Bond and the attacker make their way through them. the kitchen, the bedroom and the lab, before Bond finally sinks his opponent, ironically, with the help of these free radicals. Humor is widely used in the film, more cunningly than most of Moore’s walks, although Connery seems to have fun sending himself out of Moore’s less selfish example. <br /> <br /> Was it because he was making a good piece as a whole? Or does it work for less stingy manufacturers? Be that as it may, the script well serves his casual style, and the result is richer and more interesting than the previous two walks of Aeon Bond Connery: “You only live twice” and “Diamonds are forever.” The 1980s were not a good decade for Bond, be it Connery, Moore or Timothy Dalton. Leg warmers, video games and ugly sports cars are all there, and Bianca Jagger sunglasses, which Klaus Maria Brandauer wears in his first scene, have no benefit to him. Forget the first impressions. Brandauer's role as the main villain, Maximilian Largo, is one of the best in any Bond movie, and Brandauer is pleased to demonstrate the threat and mania of his character. At some point, he lets Bond wander around his room with a martini situation, and his dancing eyes and insane, attractive smile create an overwhelming company everywhere. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film, apart from Connery, Bond girls, shot with more attention to personality than usual in Bond films, is testimony by filmmaker Douglas Slocombe and director Irwin Kirchner. Barbara Carrera was nominated for Golden Globe for her role as Fatima Rouge, as crazy as Largo, and even more pleasing to look at. It does not last the whole movie; You almost need her to leave to focus on others. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger’s chest and buttocks should have had agents at the time of the film’s screening in this film, but I’m not complaining. The rare beauty of Basinger, who in this early role of Largo's mistress mixes incredible fervor with childish vulnerability, which makes me Bond and many others I suspect. (Her lips and cheekbones are also very cute.) <br /> <br /> This is not a well-constructed film. This is a fake best Bond movie with a sloppy storyline, a terrible score and a flat ending. But he has Connery, proving that he was the final capture of the final secret agent of the movie, even if he stole one or two pages from my 007, Mr. Moore. The end result is quite interesting, so I'm not complaining.
