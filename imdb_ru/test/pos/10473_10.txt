I cannot recall a single film that would better reflect the concept of grace in a theological sense. The well-intentioned religiosity of a small community that lost consciousness after the death of their leader, deprives them of what they preach: grace. The dear gift of the humble Parisian culinary genius returns them to the call to love each other and humbles the aging general, worried that he wasted his life. ELECTION is the central theme as well as grace. At the same time, artistic talent is believed to play an important transcendental role in everyday life and in the hereafter. Impossible to improve or ignore. This is a life-changing film for those who hear his message.
