Pola X - a great adaptation of Pierre Herman Melville; or, ambiguity. Comments here surprise me, surprises me, which led to an extremely negative reaction. <br /> <br /> Shocking value is the least attractive thing in this film - a minor detail that was out of proportion. The story of Pierre’s fall — and the subsequent destruction of the people around him — is openly demonstrated in his features, behavior, and idiocy. Dialogue and soundtrack distinguish this film from others that I have seen, and turn a fundamentally traditional storyline with controversial turns into an unforgettably emotional epic. <br /> <br /> I can not emphasize the importance of ignoring everything that you have heard about this film and watched me with an open heart. I hope you will be rewarded the same way as me. I was on the verge and nervous because of the half hour mark, but the film is far from terrible in any traditional sense. This will leave you with 1000 thoughts, each of which simultaneously causes anxiety and excitement. I know that I poured here, but I feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film. This is the best I've seen for the whole year.
