The classic “top” or “independence day,” when it comes to the excitement of a fighter, is not too great. Yes, the film from top to bottom is based on a truly fictional example of how anyone can accomplish salvation, but it's cool because it breaks all the traditional rules. The child does what he wants, on the plane, the way he wants. <br /> <br /> I can't understand what I like about this movie, but others I know have seen Kino feel the same way as I do. I think this is basically a lot of fun, but perhaps too unrealistic for some to buy. <br /> <br /> Again, regardless of whether I liked it, people I know saw it, loved it, so it’s definitely worth seeing to make your own decisions about it. Simply put, I thought Top Gun was one of the best fighter pilot movies, and I like this movie the same way, if not more, than Top Gun. Don't miss it, watch this really inspiring movie.
