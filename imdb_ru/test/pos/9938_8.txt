The young theatrical actress reluctantly accepts her first lead role in the staged play Lady Macbeth due to an accident when the production diva fell in front of a moving car. Betty (Christina Marsillah), having achieved success in her awards, instead finds horror, because the one who is responsible for bringing her to this moment, severely terrorizes her. <br /> <br /> Her first boyfriend-manager Stefano (William McNamara) brutally stabbed him with a knife while she had to look, tied with a rope to a post in his uncle’s huge mansion, not allowing her to close her eyes thanks to needles, scotch under her eyes, with a shot if she blinks. Allowing her to escape, Betty finds herself in this unfortunate position again when a special gold chain is found in her wardrobe of Lady Macbeth, torn apart by a madman after killing crows who escaped from their cage in a room with equipment. from the designer of clothes, who was first knocked down from the floor with an iron and then a knife with a knife (and then with a knife) (... to close this unpleasant scene, the chain falls into her throat, and the killer has to cut her throat to find it, although Dario not specifically devising this act, he uses the sound of scissors for optimal effect, when the camera often returns to the victim’s dead face). Without a turn, Inspector Alan Santini (Urban Barberini, at his request, Dario cheating and irritable) promises to catch a psycho, because Betty relies on her few remaining friends for consolation, theater director Marco (Ian Charleson, GANDI AND CORONA Fire, who died later AIDS: a sad footnote, Dario said in an interview that Charles told him at the end of the shoot that he was HIV positive), trying to take the stage after a successful career in a horror film, despite being rejected by critics and a friend of Peace (Dariaikolodi, former crush Dario), her agent and self-confident. But the serial killer is quite obsessed, and in the theater, of course, there will be a clash between them, as Marco added an interesting change to the production, using the raven at his disposal. <br /> <br /> I think this Dario is the wildest and nihilistic. Although he undoubtedly made more horrific films (for example, such as his recordings of The Masters of Horror and HAPPENESS), this film does raise the stakes in pure violence against the victims of the psychopath. His method of forcing Betty to view was admittedly Dario gagged about the type of audience that likes to look away from the more horrible parts of horror films. I rubbed my eyes every time she just needed to blink (... brilliantly, Dario shoots tingling from the point of view, achieving a painful effect from our point of view, as if we were the ones who had needles with scotch eyes kept open)) . I love how Dario will show Betty’s wide eyes, frightened by the fact that she is forced to watch as little blood tears off needles when she has no other choice but to blink. Ronnie Taylor's photographic works are impeccable, such as the crow look in a movie theater at the end when he is looking for a murderer. Or, when the camera "travels" through the rooms in the theater after the killer who wants to see his muse from the seat in the box. Or a dream episode in which we recall how Betty recalls the case of her mother's death from a certain killer who puts on the same mask and gloves as the one that is currently hurting her. The main point, in my opinion, is the sequence of shooting from the peephole, skillfully set by all participants, when the camera follows the bullet that shoots into the victim's eye, explodes from the back of the head, passes through the phone, which Betty planned to use to call for help. We even get a crow that bites the eyeball from the killer (... to add to this vicious scene, the crow is shown with an eyeball rolling in its beak). The only aspect that didn’t bother me, which skeptics of the film often point out, is the “final” final, which I personally thought was a bit unnecessary, but I think Dario wanted to point out that Betty really didn’t look like her mother, a woman with sadomasochistic inclinations which, whatever one may say, is connected with why the killer torments our heroine. The rock music used during the cruel scenes did not bother me, because I felt that these moments of evil graphic attacks needed a sharp blow, which can often be given by heavy metal.
