OK. Is Barney the best kids show of all time? Of course not. But in some comments left by other IMDb members, you might think that it was a multimillion staged with high-profile actors and a ridiculous budget for special effects. Well guess what? For God's sake, this is Barney. It shows children good behavior, good estates and what is normal, to be who you are. For those of you who find it annoying, this is because you are not five years old and the show was not meant for you. To the IMDb member who wrote the review on the first page, I think you have gone too far. Did you really describe the character of Sesame Street as “going down to Earth”? Grow everyone, this is a great show for preschoolers and actually helps children learn in a fun and creative way.
