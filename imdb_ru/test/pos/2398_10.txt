I just looked at Eddie Monroe and was very impressed. The story was easily changed as the plot turned to an unexpected ending. Mental performances, action, humor and drama filled the entire screen. Topnotch, played by some talented Long Islanders. Great script. This is the best film Fred Carpenter has made to date, he should be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's account is at mark. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. It's hard to believe that this is a low-budget, independent film. Just imagine what Carpenter can do with a Hollywood-level budget. The last film by Paul Regina, and he is very bored and loved by all. He was a wonderful, successful, talented actor and a great man. He will look after all of us, and we will never forget his dynamic smile and spirit. Great job for everyone who participated in this movie. A few cherished scenes with theft and humorous cameos to smash serious content. You'll love this movie, watch it!
