Where this film is true to Burroughs’s vision, it is superb; where he departs from Burroughs, he is magnificent. This is a story about a family, about finding a real father and an emotional orphan. Lambert says about one of the most painful lines in the whole movie "He was my father!" enough to cause tears in the eyes of the most cynical critic. Not a perfect film - McDowell’s notorious overlap of Glenn Close’s is dishonest and explicable only from the point of view of a very British mistake - but a wonderful, albeit erroneous masterpiece and a noble farewell to Sir Ralph Richardson
