Gene Roddenberry never let down his fans. His death marked the end of a sci-fi legacy that never compares. Earth: the last conflict was evidence! His pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well written and carefully prepared, but somewhere along the way Roddenberry's touch was lost. The loss of leadership, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely hurt the series, as he was an important part of what made it work. The story includes the human race, which is visited by Taelones, an extraterrestrial race that calls itself "Companions". After 3 years, they gave the earth new technologies, useful information about the Universe and much more. Many question their intentions here on Earth. The main link between races on Earth is Daan (Leni Parker), and for many it is the most trustworthy Talon. There are questions: why are they here? What are their goals, does Daan know about any suspected conspiracies against people? There is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist Jonathan Doors (David Hemblin) who uses his millions to research teloons. By the end of the first season, things are going well, Daan seems trustworthy, Boone assists Durs in his investigation, working with Daan and the Talons as a link. In the middle of the 2nd season, everything starts to unfold, and the once stunning and fascinating series goes down, mainly due to the fact that Roddenberry died and was not around to lead the producers, co-produced by his wife Madzhel Barrett-Roddenberry. However, the first season remains intriguing and interesting to watch.
