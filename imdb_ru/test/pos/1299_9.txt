I didn’t like this film, and the first 10 minutes or so didn’t do anything to dispel my fears. It all starts with the fact that two high school gangs are fighting each other with bad kung fu. The script, found in countless other Korean films. Ho-hum Add the fact that this story was written by the same guy who wrote “He was cool” (which was barely passable), and, well, I thought that an indescribable 2 hours were waiting for me. <br /> <br /> But don don’t give up so fast! “Their own romance” was filmed by Tae-Gunn Kim, who also starred in High Volcano (which, it seemed to me, was a lot of fun). In any case, “Their own novel” will soon change a lot for the better. A high school student who has just moved to Seoul is at the center of attention of two potential suitors. Each guy has his merits, and it is unclear which of them (if he has one) will be the right choice. <br /> <br /> What follows is not your usual teenage love triangle. Emotions are complex, and although you may not agree with certain options or actions as the film progresses, you can certainly understand why the characters make them. <br /> <br /> The film asks questions to the heroes and the audience. Whom to choose? At what point does a person even have to make a choice (and is it really unfair to him if he thinks he is being pulled)? After you (or your heart) have made a choice, how do you react (and how * should you react), when does new information appear that sheds new light on the situation? There is one scene, closer to the end, which is very subtle, but perfectly reflects what, I think, will be a real reaction, and not an excessive “film reaction”. The subtlety lies in the character in the background of the scene. Recent events and revelations have led him to confusion and emotional turmoil. In fact, he does not know what to do with things. Instead of forcing him to "play" something or looked dazed by the mouth, he simply looks at some fixed point that is unable to react or say anything at all. It’s as if someone just pressed it. His reaction sounded believable to me, and I highly appreciated this scene. <br /> <br /> As in most Korean films, there are a mixture of action movie, bravado, farce and melodrama. Korean films often make sharp turns (see “Sex Is Zero”, for example, a great example), which can be a shock for the uninitiated. Go ahead and dedicate yourself to this. Like it, like it or hate it, I think most viewers will be able to evaluate and evaluate the actions and reactions of the characters.
