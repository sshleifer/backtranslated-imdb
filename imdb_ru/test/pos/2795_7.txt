** SPOILERS AHEAD ** <br /> <br /> It is a pity that such a well-prepared film turned out to be <br /> <br /> such a disappointment. I thought it was a lot of (stupid) cliches and <br /> <br /> that he basically tried his best. <br /> <br /> (American) guys: how much time do you spend your <br /> <br /> time to jump on your girlfriend’s bed and make monkey sounds <br /> <br />? (Married) girls: how many of you suddenly <br /> <br /> passed from hypocrisy to a nymph in one night - but not with your husband <br /> <br />? For the French: would you really ask that someone <br /> <br /> was "a la fak" when you know that he does not speak French? Wouldn't <br /> <br /> use a more common word, for example, "Université"? <br /> <br /> I lived in France for a while, and I seem to know and understand <br /> <br /> Europe (and I like it), but my (German) roommate and I found it <br /> Pretty annoying in general. It was like a film funded by the European Parliament, and basically he tried too hard. He had all sorts of differences that he tried to connect with each other (this is not bad in itself), but the result is awkward at best, but actually ridiculous - too many <br /> <br /> of many collisions would not really be. Then the end of the film <br /> <br /> - the last 10 minutes - destroyed everything else. Why doesn't Xavier talk to Erasmus students with whom he meets in Paris? Why <br /> <br /> he just left? Why did he just run away from his work, is that <br /> <br /> “freedom”? And in the end, should a new Europe rest in a <br /> <br /> group of people who smoke and fuck all day? Is this what <br /> <br /> consists of? <br /> <br /> Also, the game was pretty awful. I can not believe Judith <br /> <br /> the role and actions of Godres. Why is she so much like <br /> <br /> Emanuel Beart? At first I thought that Xavier was fine, but looking back, I think he was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> And all this is very bad, because technically (initial credits, <br /> <br /> scenes, when he asks what papers he needs), it was really <br /> <br /> (except for sound editing around British brothers and sisters), and the soundtrack <br /> <br /> was also great. So the form was good, but the content <br /> <br /> is pretty awful.
