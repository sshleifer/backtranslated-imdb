Ten years before “The Matrix” and the hot healings “They live,” this brilliant piece of low-budget science fiction film appeared. If you like a strange, unconventional, intellectual challenge, David Lynch will meet the director in the style of John Carpenter, you will love Split. There are moments of real genius in framing and cinematography. Look closely at the sequence, shot through the wine glasses at the party dedicated to the discovery of art, and immediately after this the scene with the cue ball. A person named Starker, who lives outside the community and wants to wake us from sleep, participates in the plot. Like “They Live,” “1984,” and “The Matrix,” it is based on the premise that we are constantly monitored by shadow government agents like Big Brother, who know everything about us and have invisible robot probes that constantly patrol the city. All this is revealed quite early in the plot. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker invented a medicine that, when placed in the aqueduct, will wake everyone from the illusion of reality. Along with cinematography and ingenious ways in which the director copes with his meager budget, the other highlights of this film are monologues. I urge anyone not to rewind, memorize and quote the classic quotes from this film for many years.
