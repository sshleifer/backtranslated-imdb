Vasily Rathbone and Nigel Bruce return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in this excellent story about Holmes fighting the 3rd Reich and the genius inspirer Professor Moriarty. The film opens in Switzerland when Holmes is disguised as an “old bookseller”. He must deliver Dr. Tobel and the Tobel bomb to England before the Germans can kidnap Tobel. Holmes succeeds, and the Germans gather an evil professor. Moriarty manages to outwit the Scottish Court and LeStrad Dennis Howie, abducting Tobel. The only hint left by Tobel is a list of "dancing men." Who is the first to break the hidden code of dancing men, Holmes or Moriarty? Can Holmes prevent the site of the explosion from falling into the hands of the Germans, thereby saving England from the exact bombardment methods developed at the Tobel site of the explosion? Watch and enjoy.
