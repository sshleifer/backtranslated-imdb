This film was just shown on channel seven - Australian television - today. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this was a very interesting idea of ​​how the Nazis treated Russian Jews as mercilessly as they did everywhere else. <br /> Kelly Martin did an excellent job, and her tears and frustration in the role of Fussia were pretty convincing. <br /> <br /> The Holocaust is part of our story that WE DON'T HAVE TO FORGET. The Schindler list was not the first — and not the last — report on survival and courage in this five-year nightmare. My family is Dutch, and I will always applaud all filmmakers who want to maintain the candlelight, talking about someone's courage to stand up and help those who have been subjected to violence, violence and murder for being “Jewish.”
