Blade is probably one of the best vampire / action movies ever made. It has everything: action, horror, blood. This movie is for action movie fans. Either you like him very much, or you hate him, and if you hate him, he means that you don't like action movies or vampire movies. Wesley Snipes is serious about his role, and he is the perfect guy for the blade.
