A brief history of time is not only a documentary about the beginning and end of the universal and reality, as we know it, this is a story about a man and a genius known as Stephen Hawking. This is his story, which reflects the history of time and change throughout the history of the universal. The style of the documentary / editing style of the interview begins and ends with a quick transition to black. Almost like blinking between segments and interviews, the documentary gives you a strange feeling that this is Stephen Hawking’s point of view, not the camera’s eye. Opening hours a little more than an hour. This is a short story, on the other hand, its subject matter can be discussed for days and days. An interesting and proud story.
