I gave this show a chance because of Jalil White, not because of his character Urkel, but mainly because of the voice of Sonic and the hedgehog XD. Somehow, as I said, I gave him a chance, and I loved him very much. I was never worried about the character of Urkel, so I was glad to see Mr. White in a role different from an annoying nerd. And his Calvin J. Fraser (at first his name was Calvin, but in the second episode, everyone began to call him "J") was very interesting and interesting. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite episode was when Jay met up with a former Cowboys fan with a snob child. (“Don't talk like that about my mom!” “These are grown-up conversations, stay there!”) The only thing I have is that there should have been 3 main characters in the show, but Mr. White’s character always had more attention , and the other two (who are married) have always had a background ... It is not at all good when the story that these two may be pregnant is relegated to the background. nursing my girlfriend's dog ..... <br /> <br /> Besides that, I really want this show to last a little longer. Unfortunately, it seems that people were not interested in Jalil White as something other than a terrible and annoying bore, a boring god known as Urkel .... <br /> <br /> I hope they at least release a DVD box to ask .
