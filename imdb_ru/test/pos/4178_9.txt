For a long time, I, a fan of the Monkey series, refused to watch The Head, because it was not about the heroes of the series who were warm and wonderful. “Head” instead was said to be a cynical, dark movie. Finally, curiosity made me collapse. Of course, I have not found a new episode for the television show, but an exciting movie that attracts my dark side. <br /> <br /> I was always fascinated by dreams, and the “Head” was very similar to watching someone’s sleep, with incomplete hints at stories and a small detail at the end of one scene, causing the film to unfold in a new direction much in a fairy stream conscious manner. Unfinished stories really make my imagination play out again and again! <br /> <br /> The film also has a very striking, beautiful cinematography, the embodiment of which is the black and white, white and black look “Daddy’s Song”. The music is haunting, especially the lush "The Porpoise Song" arrangement. (“The Porpoise Song” is the favorite song of my dark side, while my bright side prefers “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah”.) <br /> <br /> In the end, I think the series could use some of the drama, intrigue and intensity of "Head." But "Head" could use the warmth, humor and friendship of a TV show.
