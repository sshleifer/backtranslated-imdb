This is the movie that can bring you a nightmare, except that it is very fun. <br /> <br /> “Hardware wars” is the only good deception in Star Wars, other films such as Space Balls have failed. This is the only good fake film I've ever seen, it doesn't tear Star Wars, it makes fun of it, and this is what fake has to be.
