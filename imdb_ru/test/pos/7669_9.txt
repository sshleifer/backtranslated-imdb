It was with great pleasure that I recently watched this beautifully filmed widescreen adaptation of the 1943 stage revival (which differs from the original production of 1935), which included extensive conversational recitatives. It was fashionable at the time, so blame the film for a 16-year tradition. The film is worth watching at least for Sammy Davis Jr., a brilliant cat show called Sportin 'Life, crawling in the shadows. His seduction by BESS Dorothy Dedridge “In New York, the boat data will be released soon” is one of many bright events. Almost all the main music is intact and perfectly performed. This, of course, will never get tired of what the latest versions of PBS and MET have done. It was nice to see that time did not reduce the film, and hopefully it will be available in the near future for generations who have not had the opportunity to see it.
