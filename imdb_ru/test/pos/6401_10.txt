It seems we all agree. It was a great show, and let it die ahead of time. I decided that if I really like the show, it is often the kiss of death. I like fancy ensemble shows, and a great atmosphere always helps. I really expected to see many of these stars in other television productions, but apart from Marishka Hagartai, who played Fischer Stevens' crazy girlfriend, I did not see many of them, except occasional roles in cameo. What a disgrace. <br /> <br /> Key West, Northern Impact, Gilmore Girls and Veronica Mars ... all the great shows, all unfortunately a thing of the past. <br /> <br /> Listen to us loudly and clearly, we want Key West on DVD ..... please.
