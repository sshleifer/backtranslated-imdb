Lecture on the life of a tormented mage named Ray Charles. His piano impulses created fiery music, and his nostalgic voice created exciting, cool melodies. Every barrier Ray faced never suppressed him, and he found his way in all conflicts. This lesson. An excellent team of producers helps to recreate the era and is armed with magnificent costumes, hairstyles and setting, each of which will follow the story of Ray, believing in her true direct shooting! Ice music freezes and goosebumps around the audience with clever sound editing. But the most important part of the film is Jamie Foxx. His acting is really great, the most brilliant game with diamonds. He lives his role. He is the Ray of Light.
