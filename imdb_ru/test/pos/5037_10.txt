John Travolta was great in the role of "Michael" in the same film. I do not think that a better image could be made. The film was funny, but touching. Michael is very "human angel" (if they are). Andy McDowell is excellent in her role as a reporter, as she moves from disbelief to faith. Bill Hurt and Robert Pastelli are great reporters, each of whom seeks to prove an angelâ€™s deception on earth. A wonderful cast, especially an elderly woman (I don't know her nickname), who plays Michael's mom! One of the cutest movies I've seen in recent years ... I could watch this movie dozens of times!
