A few years ago, when I made several films, I came across Subspecies 4, I finally watched it and, in fact, I liked it, we need a good film about a bloody vampire that does not hold back. But when I returned to the video store, they said that they do not have any other Subspecies videos, unfortunately, the same thing went for any other video store I checked. I gave up until someone posted all of the Subspecies on YouTube, and I didnâ€™t watch them all last night, and I was hooked. Now I'm a fan of the Full Moon Subspecies series. I think because it was the type of horror movie I was looking for, I was looking for a good cheesy fear for a long time, and Subspecies filled this place. Radu is one of the coolest vampires on the screen and almost gives Nosferatu an escape for fangs! <br /> <br /> Radu is an evil vampire who pursues his bloody stone, his birth rite, the stone contains some blood that is incredible and gives him strength. Three American women who study Romanian history and culture face a man, Stefan, who offers help. They remain in the Rada Castle, where we learn that Stephen is the brother of Radu; Radu seduces and transforms two girls, but Stefan falls in love with one of the girls, Michel, and will do everything to protect her. <br /> <br /> A subspecies is a fun series, despite the silly effects, it makes it in some ways more enjoyable. Plus Radu was the perfect villain, because Stephen was the perfect angel, like a romantic vampire. The story is scary, and I think it was a funny vampire movie. It was also the first in the series, the best part, the continuation is just as fun. I would recommend it for a scary movie night, to watch it in the dark, Radu will surely cause a shiver on his back or even on his neck ... Well, a dirty joke, I could not resist. <br /> <br /> 7/10
