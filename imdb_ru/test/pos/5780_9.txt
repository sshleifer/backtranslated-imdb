I give this film 9 out of 10 just because there are not enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy needed to produce food in order to satisfy scientific haters. It seems that mdixon believes that deliberately biased commentators come up with this, but even an elementary understanding of the resources and laws of thermodynamics will show that at least they are on solid scientific ground, when they say that we cannot continue to depend on oil, we must go for different types of energy, and we don't have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we get from oil. Other civilizations refused to recognize the facts of life and died. Read Jared Diamond's Collapse, a popular book, or any elementary textbook on ecology or earth sciences, and you can check out the highlights of this film. Come on, play while Rome burns!
