and frankly, it just sums it up. <br /> <br /> This is a small computer animated series filmed as a documentary about animals .... <br /> <br /> The animation is almost flawless (It seemed to me that dinosaur eyes with long necks looked unreal. /> <br /> However, some model shots didn’t look very realistic ... <br /> <br /> and I thought that the Jurassic park did better than T Rex .. <br /> <br /> If this is something what we see in ordinary British TV shows, I can’t wait to see what they can achieve in films. <br /> I give this to 10/10 stars ... <br /> <br / > (and video "Delat "It was also great ..... the dinosaur on the skateboard was terrible) <br /> <br /> <..>
