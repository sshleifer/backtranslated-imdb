I have a good logical sense to know that oil cannot last forever, and I am acutely aware of how much my life in the suburbs revolves around petrochemical products. I was an avid consumer of new technologies, and I do not have enough space on the electrical boards - so I know that even the energy crisis associated with Peak Oil will significantly change my life. <br /> <br /> The end of the Suburbs shows, rationally and entertainingly, how much the lifestyle of the whole of my family changes in my life. I am particularly concerned about future generations who will have to take on our surplus, but the filmmakers give a glimmer of hope that they recognize human resourcefulness and determination - and the sense of community that is generated due to common difficulties. <br /> <br /> There is no point in pretending that Peak Oil is groundless propaganda - or to treat it as an approaching radioactive cloud in On the Beach (that is, with ready-made suicide pills). Even despite all our efforts, times will be harder, and I hope that we have enough compassion and humanity to walk around.
