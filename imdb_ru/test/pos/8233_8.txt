This is a very solid Randolph Scott Western. He plays Bat Masterson and travels to Liberal, Kansas to clear the city. He becomes good friends with Robert Ryan, who played a very straightforward role. Only after that Robert Ryan began to play much more gloomy roles. In fact, in 1947, Randolph Scott shot another film that was not a western, and after that he did nothing but westerns until he retired in 1962. This film has a good pace and is growing steadily to a climax. I can not say more, because it will distribute the plot. Be sure to watch this. 8/10
