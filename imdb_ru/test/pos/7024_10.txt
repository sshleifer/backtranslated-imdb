“Dirty Dancing”, one of the greatest films of the 80s, was a low-budget film with a high yield. With a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance, to the love story that we all want to live (at least if you are a woman), this is a movie that you want to watch again and again. <br /> <br /> The music that drives the film is optimistic and blends well with the emotions of the viewer. From classic 60s hits such as Otis Redding's "Love Man" and Frankie Valli's "Big Girls Don't Cry" to 80s net hits such as Eric Carmen's "Hungry Eyes" and Frank Zappakosty's "Overload", Dirty Dancing is a mixture of cheerful and sensual, showing the transformation of a young girl from a shy teenager into a flourishing femininity, against the backdrop of a beautiful summer romance, which, as we all hope and desire, has become something more. <br /> <br /> Dancing in “Dirty Dancing" should not be forgotten. Cynthia Rhodes shines in her role as Penny, a dancer who can challenge even the most agile and flexible gymnasts. Patrick Swayze does more than just a fantastic job and more of their skills, not only as an actor, but also as a dancer and singer. And Jennifer Gray in the role of Baby shines, while her transformation in dance reflects her transformation in status. <br /> <br /> In general, " Dirty Dancing "- one of the best films of all time, and it is worth at least to see. Once It is doubtful that the first beats of Ronetta “Be My Baby” in the introductory title will not attract your attention and will not attract you to the magical world of sensual dance and musical charm.
