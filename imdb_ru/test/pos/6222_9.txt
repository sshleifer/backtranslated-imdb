Wonderful film in the best traditions of Scandinavian magic, with a very farsighted analysis of most important problems that we are just starting to face. <br /> <br /> Must be a must-see for all politicians. <br /> Make your choice from privacy, nuclear sustainability, global climate change, quality of life. <br /> <br /> Reminds Walden Torea, but with a modern twist and considerable humor. <br /> <br /> I am not a Finn, although I went there and I had good Finnish friends, but I found it completely accessible, as well as culturally informative.
