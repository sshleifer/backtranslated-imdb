Joe is a film about the dark side of the 1960s force in America, and Susan Sarandon had beautiful tits. This film scared me so much when I saw him in the theater that I never liked Peter Boyle before Young Frankenstein, and he was still very suspicious of him even after this comedy. Now, looking back at today's experience, this film seems to be again relevant in that it is a direct and almost half-approved John McCain-like "Joe Plumber" electorate and their fear of electing a black man for the US presidency in the coming weeks, Black Prez will be perceived like the sweet revenge of the “blacks”, but will surely cause a fire again in many minds, if not on the streets, this time by Joe's enthusiasts. So, Joe's spirit in the movie resurrected in Joe Plumber's campaign! Nevertheless, I love being American and afraid of both, and the fact that they illustrate that, ironically, Gregory Peck said that our civilized law also: “living, breathing reality!” God help us.
