Mike Nichols' film Charlie Wilson's War, shot in the 1980s, tells how the main character (played by Tom Hanks) managed to wage a hidden war with the Russians, helping the Afghan forces. Of course, we know how well this worked in the long term, but, fortunately, the film does not obscure the unpleasant consequences. <br /> <br /> Starring Tom Hanks and Julia. Roberts is one of the most profitable stars in Hollywood. As a bonus, you will receive the universal Philip Seymour Hoffman in a characteristically memorable supporting role, for which he received an unjustified Oscar nomination. I'm not a big fan of Roberts, but Hanks is always reliable. However, I can't buy him as a drug addict womanizer, although the real Charlie Wilson seems as cute as Hanks. However, apart from the big three, it is not worth mentioning, even with such a recognizable name as Amy Adams. <br /> <br /> This story is fascinating and supported by an excellent script from Aaron Sorkin. The verbal interaction between the protagonists is superb and overflowing with memorable lines. The later events set in motion by the war are not ignored, although the scenes of waking up in honor of Wilson seem too serious to me to achieve the bitter-sweet feeling that was probably intended. In general, the leadership of Nichols is masterly and perfectly follows the actions of the script. <br /> <br /> This is a film that, like Charlie Wilson himself, is flawed, but nevertheless disarmingly cute. Certainly recommended for fans of the three stars and for those who are looking for an exciting political drama with a carefree feeling.
