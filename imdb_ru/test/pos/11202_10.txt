Like all good art, this film can mean different things to different people. For me, this means that failing to open your heart to others can deprive you of happiness and take your life. The convenience of selfishness is like junk food: it is pleasant to the touch, but can get sick over time. <br /> <br /> Almost everything I see in the USA is the commercial mass production of action films, small dramas and stupid comedies, and this sensitive, deep and poetic film really touched me. Thanks to Nuri Bilge Ceylan (and everyone else in the cast)! <br /> <br /> Ivan Yanachkov
