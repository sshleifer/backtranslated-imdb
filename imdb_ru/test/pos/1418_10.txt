I have been a big fan of Errol Morris since I saw the Thin Blue Line and heard that she saved a life. Today this film is his best work. <br /> <br /> The plot is a mixture of the book of Stephen Hawking with the same name, intertwined with human life. The story is told in interviews with family, friends, and Hawkins himself. <br /> <br /> Do not fool yourself; It sounds boring, but the whole package is dynamic and makes you wonder. The combination of life and theories is seamless and completely entertaining. I was particularly touched by how well they humanize this brilliant and all-knowing person. That which is physically powerless, Hawking's greatness and brilliance of brilliance are enclosed in a real living person, over whom we are allowed to laugh and wonder at the same time. <br /> <br /> Find this movie Watch this and enjoy. And if the studio that owns this picture reads this, the release of the 15th anniversary will be perfect NOW ...
