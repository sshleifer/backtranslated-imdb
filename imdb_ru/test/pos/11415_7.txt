Although I read all the complaints about this film before I saw it, I still had an interest in previewing. I don't know if it was because I was expecting a bomb or something else, but I really liked the movie. I was not very scared until the second half of the film, but even then it was not bad at all. I think that most of the scenes and false alarms were realistic, albeit a bit random, but this was necessary to advance the story. I think that the house and the surrounding area is an ideal place for this type of films, they are beautiful and huge, but then the same qualities that are attractive become scary. I also think that the lighting system worked very well, because not only did they turn on at the entrance, but they could not keep them, so the house remained dark outside the small section where Jill was. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Jill, I thought that her role behaved quite well, at first it was not so believable, but after several phone calls everything was fine. In fact, the scenes where she is scared are well underway. And finally, someone correctly understood poker on fire. I can't tell you how many times when I hear noise in my house, I take fire poker, and it was very pleasant for her to do the same, although she foolishly forgets about it when she needs it most. /> <br /> With regard to the holes in the plot, the film is not perfect, but almost every hole can be explained, and part of the riddle in how he got into ... exactly how long he looked at it? how did he go out to kill her friend? and when did the gardener die? In general, I liked it, and I was surprised how quickly everything went. It held my attention, and I wanted to see how it ended, although the ending was very short and left an unpleasant taste in the mouth. My only complaint, besides the ending, was the lack of character development. They could add ten minutes with her and her friends or something else so that we feel more ill because of her situation, so that we feel the taste of her personality and give us an idea of ​​how she will cope with the situation (for example, the scene where she argues whether to go back for children seems to be missing a scene at the beginning that said that she only cares about herself or something).
