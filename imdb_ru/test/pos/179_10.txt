Goldrush: Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great TV movie for all ages. The film tells about "Fizzy" (Alyssa Milano), who wants to go on a journey for gold in Alaska. The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). An adventure will follow, which she will never forget. This television film was just great. Acting No. 1 (especially Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano), and I also learned some information about Goldrush. I recommend this television film to everyone without hesitation. It is also based on a true story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
