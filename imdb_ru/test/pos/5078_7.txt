Nowadays and in an era when virtually every other piece of news is related to the discussion of water boards, images of Abu Ghraib or stories about forced detention in Guantanamo Bay, Gavin Hood’s “Transmission” is as timely and timely as possible. The film, as always, can come out of the mainstream Hollywood entertainment mills. Apparently, this is not a perfect film, but he does not deserve the nasty rage he received from critics from the entire ideological and political spectrum. <br /> <br /> The term “Transmission” means the CIA’s ability to arrest any persons suspected of terrorist operations, and then secretly drag them to a foreign country, interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time, all without due process. Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian who has lived in the United States for twenty years. He has an American wife, a small son and a new child on the way. He seems an unlikely candidate for terrorists, but once, without warning and explanation, Anwar was seized and taken away to an unknown place where he was brutally tortured until he acknowledged his connection with a terrorist organization, which Anvar claims to know nothing about. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, “execution” is sometimes interrupted from Because of his ability to tell stories, often biting off a little more than he can chew on in terms of plot and character.A clear coordinator is Douglas Freeman, a novice CIA agent who was brought in to monitor Anwar’s “interrogation” by Egyptian officials. The problem is that, as the writer Kelly Sane conceived and accepted Jake Gyllenhaal, Freeman seems to be too naive a “scout” to make him a very plausible agent, and he is not given time to screen, which is necessary for full development. like a character. We know little about him at the beginning and even less, it seems, at the end. He “goes through the movement,” but we know very little about the person inside. Thus, without a strong center of gravity that would hold it all together, the film sometimes feels as if it is falling apart, and the elements of the plot scatter in all directions. A similar problem arises with Anwar’s distraught wife, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman whom we will never know much about except what we see on the surface. Gyllenhaul and Witherspoon have established themselves as good actors in other circumstances, but here they are limited to a restrictive scenario, which rarely allows them to go beyond one repeating note in their performances. <br /> <br /> What makes the “Presentation” an extremely powerful film, however, is the extreme seriousness of the subject and the way in which the two simultaneously plotting lines of the plot gracefully fit into each other in the final segments of the film. Perhaps it would be a bit more contrived story than perhaps we would have liked this theme, but in the end it is Hollywood, after all, and the film should honor the expectations of the mass audience a little if it wants to get the green light, not to mention already to see daylight as a completed project. <br /> <br /> Two of the auxiliary performances are especially convincing in the film: Omar Metvalli, which makes the horror of a person caught in real life in the Kafkaesque nightmare he cannot wake up, and Igal Naor, who makes the surprisingly complex character of Chief Investigator / Torturer. Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also starred in small roles. Special mention should be made of the warm and rich cinematography of Dion Bib. <br /> <br /> Does the film make things easier? Probably. Is she assembling a deck for the benefit of the victim of torture and against evil government forces? Most likely. (I wonder how the film would play if Anwar really was a terrorist)? However, the film has the courage to go on controversial grounds. He is not afraid to pose dubious questions or risk disapproval of some because of the political positions he holds. He openly ponders the question of how a PRESENT nation adheres to its hard-won principle of "civil liberties for all" in the face of terrorism and fear. And how much courage does goodwill people need to finally stand up and say: “Enough, enough,” even at the risk of being branded by pacifying and non-patriotic terrorists in power? (The film also does not in any way deny the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism). <br /> <br /> Thus, rejecting “execution” from control would mean allowing the perfect to be an enemy well. “Presentation” may not be perfect, but this is good, and there is something important that can be said about the world in which we live now. And this in itself makes it very worthy of attention.
