I think I was not sure what to expect from this film, it had a good cast, an interesting storyline and a lot of other things going on it, but I still could not get rid of the fear that I had stomach about what it would be like. I am glad to say that I was very pleased with the result and regret that I worry about it all the time. The opening scenes of the film were extremely intriguing and sufficient to sustain an interest in the film at an early stage. As the film progressed, we were introduced to the characters in the film, as well as to what happened in the prison riots. Like most reviews of this film, I have to admit that there are some unnecessary cliches, but it cannot erase the full power of this film, which reads like a good novel. All the actors are great, especially Chestnut and McGowan, and this film is considered one of the best films of this year for television. Of course, itâ€™s worth a look if you are looking for good drama in the courtroom.
