At first I did not think that I would like this film, but as it developed, it became better and better. I love music, and I was impressed with how well Cage could imitate the movements when playing the mandolin. My son was with me, and he also liked the film very much because of his music, his story and how the story was unfolding - slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story was well done and well directed. At first, Corelli's bravado was annoying, but he soon grew up with you. Highlights in the plot are particularly intrigued by relations with the Germans. I would like to see it again to follow all the conspiracies. I also want to buy a soundtrack to hear the music again.
