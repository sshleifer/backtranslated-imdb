I remember when this movie came out and watched it several times on VHS. I was so glad when he finally came out on DVD. I was hoping for a widescreen screen, but at that moment I was taking what was available. I like the way they used color in the film, the outdoor scenes are so vivid with color. The trees are the greenest I have ever seen. Much of the movie was filmed in Stillwater, Minnesota, a beautiful city located on the St. Croix River. They must have really found a place to shoot because they did a great job. The story is well written and directed. I would rate it as one of the best Peter Horton. I'm also surprised that Andrew Dientenfuss (director of photography) did not do more. He did an incredible job. Acting also appreciates there. It's amazing to see two actors of such a young age shooting this type of film. Annabella Sciorra did a great job with Dexter's mother. Who would not want her as a mother.
