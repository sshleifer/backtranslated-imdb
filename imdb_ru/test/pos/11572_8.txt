Tesis, Open Your Eyes and The Others were proof of Amenabar’s talent and skill as a director, but (in my humble opinion) were also erroneous films in their attempt to outwit the public, always offering one turn to Screw too much, in favor of cheap thrills, twists and turns in depth and resonance. Fortunately for everyone, Amenabar chose a theme for his new film that would not allow an unexpected ending, focusing on the characters and the emotional connections that bind them. <br /> <br /> The result was a small miracle of the film, beautifully written, photographed, filmed, filmed and filmed. Everyone involved in this film demonstrates excellent performance, behind and in front of the cameras, from the great cast (Bardem shines, but Mabel River, Celso Bugallo, Clara Segura and Lola Dueñas give an amazing authenticity to the film) to refined Aguirresarobe with lensing. <br /> <br /> The film effectively affects many topical issues and emotions, it is equally powerfully drawn to the heart and mind and gives the final blow, which remains with you long after the release of titles. This is a brilliantly executed film that will not only become a landmark in Spanish cinema, but will also be a pleasant surprise when it opens abroad (Sony Classics paid a record $ 6 million for its distribution) Do not be surprised if he manages to get into the Oscar race ... Amenabar will not stop ... <br /> <br /> Buen trabajo, Alejandro!
