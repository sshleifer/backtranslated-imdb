Given that this is basically a low-budget cast, this is an amazingly good film about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey plays the role of Holly, who was one of the first to use electric guitar for almost all of his music. Backed by his Crickets, Holly had a number of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash with Richie Wales and Big Bopper. The film tells about his rise to fame, marriage with his lover and possible death. I love this movie, and I believe you too. Charles Martin Smith also does a great job in this film.
