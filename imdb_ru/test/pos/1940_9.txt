I just looked through another comment published here, in which the author discusses the alarming ways that teens in this film use the body of their dead friend. In this statement, one of them is missed, perhaps the most disturbing of all, and it is not surprising that this is what Crispin Glover (Lane) does. he is thrilled that one of his friends has killed his other friend, the murderer girl. not because Lane didnâ€™t like this man, but rather he was excited by her death, because it gives him something to do. this poor boy is bored in life, and he is dead inside, that a dead friend is something to worry about, because it gives him an opportunity to concentrate.
