Every time I watch this movie, I just want to go out and have a good night! My friend gives a speech "Weekend landed" to cheer yourself up before going out! and me too ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> This film is a great debut for a writer / director - well done! <br /> <br /> The acting is great, all the characters are believable and more life! “Strange” scenes are fun, a jeep with floppy memories / explanations / visualizations is all great! The scene in the pub huuuuuuuge, when everyone gets up and starts to sing a false national anthem, also laughs. There are a lot of comedy performances - Howard Marx's speech about the “ridiculous politics” is very funny! <br /> <br /> Oh god, you just need to see it. Keep in mind, I felt that the film really glorifies the use of ecstasy, but hey, is that true, eh? At least, the film does not shy away from this fact. I believe that the film also carries a worthy message - do not take life too seriously, you should sometime bring your hair. And, of course, the chat in the pub, when Moff tries to explain to his comrades that he stops taking drugs, is a sure reminder that when failures end in good times, you know that the party is over! /> Sometimes it is a very clever movie using camera, lighting, etc. It was a realized piece of cinema and a great story about friends, love, clubs and drugs. <br /> <br /> Get out of the rat race !!! <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
