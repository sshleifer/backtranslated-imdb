I have seen (unfortunately) a duplicate version of the encore. <br /> <br /> Student Paula Henning (Frank Potente, who was also the cult favorite of “Run, Lola, Run”) played a serious medical student who enters a prestigious school in Germany. But she soon discovers that some students are missing and that the bodies they are working on in the anatomical laboratory are incredibly fresh ... <br /> <br /> I was stuck after seeing the duplicated version of the encore. It is very painful (words that do not coincide with lips irritated very quickly), but I still liked what I saw. The acting was good, it was beautifully photographed, it was NOT TOO terrible, and I never got bored. Even more refreshing was the cute heroine who resists when the bad guys go after her. The (light) nude was masculine! The previous poster mentions that Benno Furman (who is great) showed his ass, but I do not remember seeing it. Despite this, this is a well-made, scary and excellent thriller. Of all that I read, the original German version is the best (I have no doubt that for one second), but the duplicated version is watchable. I give it 7.
