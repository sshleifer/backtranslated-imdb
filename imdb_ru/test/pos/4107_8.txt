It was one of my favorites in childhood. My family had a soundtrack for 8 tracks! It took us years (until I was 20 years old) to make a video about the film (my dad recorded it on tape from HBO or something else). Every summer, when we go to the beach (my mother, brother, sister and I), we lie on the beach and sing all the songs from this movie !!! LOVED THIS !!!
