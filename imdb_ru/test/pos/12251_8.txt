This is a love story against the background of television news. Three main stars, William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks, create a love triangle, working in the Washington Bureau of the channel. <br /> <br /> Tom Grünick (Hurt) is a handsome reporter who is prepared to be a star. Jane (Hunter) is a producer who admits that Tom lacks intellectual authority to be a real journalist, but he still falls in love with him. Aaron Altman (Brooks) is a person who shares her beliefs in journalistic standards, also a person who truly loves her. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, but lost to Cher (Moonstruck!). Her robbed! This is Hunter's movie. Her hero Jane is clever, ruthless and completely controllable. She is also a cheerful neurotic. Her performance is superb. Just look at her face as she watches the recording of Tom’s interview with a rape victim. Scales literally fall from her eyes. <br /> <br /> William Hert is not so impressive. He plays a man who understands perfectly well that he is a himbo and a crook, but smart enough to realize that his rise is capable of people like Jane. He gives small hints of a person who is extremely calculating. <br /> <br /> The film comments on celebrities, journalism, honesty, and commercial pressure on news in a Bottom Line environment. He predicted that the news would be dumbfounded, that standards would slowly decline due to pressure from commercial organizations. <br /> <br /> Think about it: this film was released before the end of the Cold War and before the reality show. However, this predicted a decline in the news. The release of Paris Hilton from prison was perceived as the main news! To see how prophetic this film is, just watch the evening news and pay attention to the set, graphics and presenters. Tom Grunyk and his clones are alive and well!
