Look at the first 20 minutes, although the wait has not yet come. We saw the super secret Los Alamos quite well just a few years after the big bombs trial, which helped end World War II. With the exception of strict security, it looks quite dangerous. Please note that this is a TV repairman, a regular guy who guides us through security. After going through all this, you will feel like in any other US city, good homes, quiet streets, children going to school, and family television in no time. Later we see little Tommy and little Peggy, frolicking around the streets, along which impressive rooms are lined up, separated by a locked gate. Looks like the movie says, “Well, we're cool, just because it should be.” But, in fact, we are still just people. ” <br /> <br /> Now I expect it to be comforting. The message for the Cold War audience is still not used to the government’s doomsday research. This is a clear effort on popular assurance. One darker note is when Tommy's mother (Clark) worries about her son's mental state. He does not say: “When I grow up”; instead, “If I grow up.” This note of doubt reflects not only the reality of Los Alamos, but also the national reality, which in 1952 just saw footage with an apocalyptic hydrogen bomb. Also pay attention to how professionally portrayed FBI agents are a standard feature of the McCarthy-era fare. When brute force is needed, it is not they, but a private person, Gene Barry, throws out information - I suppose, an early version of the “issue” of the modern era. <br /> <br /> After the abduction, the unknown does not. Intrigue beautifully handled by colorful locations in Los Angeles, which make us guess. Climatic scenes around rocky dwellings may not be believable as a shelter, but the view to the north of New Mexico is magnificent. In addition, the ancient stone apartments represent one of the most exotic backgrounds of the decade. Notice also the widespread use of the police helicopter, which is just beginning to be used as a tool for law enforcement. Nancy Gates among the overthrown actors remains in the role of teacher Ellen Haskell. Never a Hollywood glamor, she was a wonderful unnoticed actress and charming personality. I also expect it to be one of Hopper’s most successful films, and although people have since become accustomed to the nuclear threat, the film remains a revealing and exciting document of its time.
