It was! I would never have expected the final, if I did not yet know the backstage things. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hated was that Shannon was kicked out, not Alissa. I hate her, I would prefer her character to die like Shannon. What was funny was that in the scene when Piper was dying in a hospital bed, and Prue was crying next to her, I also cried. when it was broadcast, I was about 10 years old, and my favorite character was Piper from the very beginning, so I told myself that if she died, I wouldnâ€™t see the show again! LOL <br /> <br /> Then this whole story was a shock and really good. I also blame Phoebe for Prue's death, because instead of being with her sisters, she had to be a whore-bi *** and be with her good fellow demon. <br /> <br /> but I think that this episode will be now and forever one of my favorite and classic CROMET. <br /> <br /> FOREVER CHARMED! Blessed
