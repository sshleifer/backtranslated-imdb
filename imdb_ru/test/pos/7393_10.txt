So this is not what I expected. I made this film to see how it will be, since I still want to see the first one. But this movie had a B-movie in it all. But when I watched it, I realized that it was very funny. During the first 30 minutes, it was like a snowman was killing people, and one person was losing his mind. But in those first few minutes there were a few funny liners. When he threw the first of his little minions, I knew that it would be very, very funny. They all behave like gremlins in eighty-four hit gremlins, because of which he looked as if he had faked, and made me forget that it was a B-movie. So if you like laughing, rent this one.
