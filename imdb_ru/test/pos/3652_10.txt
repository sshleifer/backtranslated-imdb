I just saw this at the Philadelphia Film Festival. It was the most wonderful film - the best that I have seen in a long time. The seductive character of Isa is an open, exploring and (as noted in the film) person full of love — shamelessly portrayed by the beautiful Camilla Natta. Accompanying music soothes and transfers, it is a balm for the soul. <br /> <br /> It seems that each character is somehow in conflict - and their interaction (in / conflicts) creates a great story. The tale told by AK Angala, like the Old Man, was made in the most magical way - I wanted this to go on and on. <br /> <br /> The fact that Hari seemed to remember his “place” everywhere added to the power of history — a refreshing change in the bubble Themes of many contemporary authors. <br /> <br /> Great movie. Go see.
