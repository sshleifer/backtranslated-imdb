When, oh, when someone like Anchor Bay or Blue Underground will release it on a widescreen DVD? Le Orme, which I know only because of my rare / vintage habit of collecting videos, is a film from my collection that I would not only watch, but actually enjoy watching. The fact that Klaus Kinski is the main thing, but only in small parts of the film, means little to me. (Although several comments expressed disappointment about his rather limited screen time.) I cannot say that this is a good horror film, a good mystery, a science fiction epic or something like that. It is simply not classified in the “genre” sense of things. It’s more like a tangled, frightening (though not particularly cruel or bloody) dream filled with great visual effects and secrets. He relies on visual effects and emotions, just like Baw "Lisa and the Devil." Both films are beautiful in almost every sense, but they are almost impossible to describe in a logical way; they both occur in such a fabulous atmosphere. Do not hold back Force Video synopsis on the back cover. It is infinitely more complex and intriguing than this. Although the release of Force Video from 1986 (the only one I know of in the US) is cut to full screen on film, even in this format it is still great. Freeing this remastered and / or mailbox would make it great (hint, hint ... of the DVD company).
