Yes, I think this film is rather boring compared to some other Pam Grier films. The plot is too familiar, the dialogues are deadlocked, and some actions are not too good. But it is worth looking at the long section near the end of the film, where we see Mrs. Greer in a sexy blue wetsuit with a zipper unbuttoned. Yes, it seems a frivolous moment when you discuss the actress about the talent of Pam Greer, but she also turns out to be an incredibly gorgeous woman, and at one time she had a body that would not throw. It's nice to see how he is shown in a tight wetsuit. Hire a DVD, and then say that I'm wrong. Can't you right? It's because you know that I'm right! :-) And yes, I really gave 10 only for wetsuit scenes! ;-)
