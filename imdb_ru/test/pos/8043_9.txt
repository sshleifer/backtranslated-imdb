Smooth, neat and well-made old school version of how a big international thriller should be made. Determined to kill a dangerous world terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal, Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, Unlimited, Space Cowboys), the CIA operative and his Israeli counterpart Amos (Ben Kingsley, Gandhi). "Sexy Beast") to get a noble naval officer, Annibal Ramirez (Aidan Quinn, "Music of the Heart") to become Carlos and use him in a daring plot to force the KGB to kill the real Carlos, because he took an offer from the CIA. Sutherland and Kingsley are both good here, but the film really belongs to Quinn, who embodies himself here (in a double role). Director Christian Duguy and filmmaker David Franco present another great movie asset here with Hitchcockian-like suspense and the great sights of the world.
