FOUR FRIENDS were first exhibited on HBO in the year 82 as the hit of a sleeper. Having heard the term “sleeping” when I was 14, I really wanted to see it. (!) Boy - I was surprised! This movie! I really didn’t fall in love with a movie without special effects outside the TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE — far less than a hippie-flick ... but after growing up with a couple of hippies, I realized the full power of Mr.. Penn's film. FOUR FRIENDS are definitely one of a kind. The script is so personable - and it is cast !!! Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor so well! He simply personifies the "type of writer" - both clever and clumsy (the scene at the window ...), and strong, but very vulnerable. For me - he captured what it was like to be so passionate about agra that it lasts for more than ten years ... and I always found solace in the character - and in the film. During the 80s, FOUR FRIENDS were complicit in a crime for me - and I caught the film when I could on HBO - even if I had to stay until 5 am! And yet, always at the end - there is a sense of loss when all these wonderful characters part with the audience on the beach. Jody Thelen personifies "this girl" to the limit - it is so difficult for her not to be enchanted by her. This film really stands the test of time. From time to time I check my video about it ... or show it to a friend ... and it REALLY gets a strong reaction. I knew women who absolutely fell in love with Georgia! So many levels ..! Just an incredible little piece of humanity of the 60s. Very special, very magical. Recently, I found Robert Grossbach's “FURNING THE FOUR FRIENDS” - and this is even more detailed than the movie! Actual dates of events, etc. Real find! And moreover - haha, - I found a novel, leafing through books in a used book store ... in Omaha, NE of all places !!! I think you should look after her! When I was in Los Angeles in '92 and worked as an extra - I went to the ruddy store to remember - and there was a ton of pictures in the film !!! Unfortunately - I was broken and could not indulge ... but boy, these photos of Georgia and the guys all together just passed through me! I met director Joe Sergeant on the SKYLARK film set in Emporia, KS in the summer of 92 ... and we talked about FOUR FRIENDS - very cool! Also ... he worked in a video store in Omaha in 1998 - he was waiting for a woman who was a relative of Jim Metzler ..! I told her to pass the word that there was a child in Omaha who was simply fanatical about the film - and pulled everything possible out of it. Once again - the film captures everything that is in the heart of Danilo's character ... excellent, excellent work - one of the best works of Mrs Thesic and Penn. Steve Tesic is very bored. Incredible writer. "Isadora Duncan !!!" <br /> <br /> - C.
