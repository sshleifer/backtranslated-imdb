This film is without a doubt the best I've ever seen in my whole life. Star cast - only an extra bonus for amazing special effects, deep history and sublime choreography. The film tells about the ancient love that rolls into the modern world. Two lovers in heaven bring upon themselves the wrath of a great sage and are cursed. Subsequently, a woman is born again on earth. While she is in college, she is raped and committed suicide. The rest of the film mainly focuses on tracking down people who have been raped by her lover, who has superhuman strength and multilingual knowledge. Sonu Nigam demonstrates a very mature and deep performance in this film, and all other actors are almost as good. The active scenes with Akshay Kumar are awesome and should not be missed. You just have to watch this movie !!!
