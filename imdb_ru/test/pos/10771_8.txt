Sonny Chiba, as everyone knows, is a man. In this film, he portrays Masa Oyama (1923-1994), a true martial arts master who fought over 50 bulls with his bare hands and won (interesting guy, look at him). In any case, Chiba kills only one bull in the film, but this is an unforgettable scene, and, as the liner notes, right there with the zombie scene against the sharks in Zombies! The film also offers a lot of hand-to-hand fighting and a decent plot, although I do not believe that all of this is true. This film is the first of Oyamaâ€™s trilogy created by Chiba and is recommended for martial arts fans. Finally, three neat little tidbits; part of the introductory topic was used in the Kill Bill volume, volume 1, Oyama himself appears in the opening episodes, and this is because he taught Tiba in real life for five years!
