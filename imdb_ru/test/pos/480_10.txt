If you are tired of the same repetitive, unreasonable material that the mass film industry produces, you will love “You Are Alone”. It is thought-provoking, well shoots and riveting. <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything you don’t find in the first few minutes of the film, this is the story of a young white schoolgirl from the upper class of the middle class who works as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor. The vast majority of films take place in a hotel room, where he hired her. <br /> <br /> In the course of their discussion, you study two evolving views on prostitution, depression and loneliness. And yet the film is not depressing. It talks about dark things without being dismal. <br /> <br /> As a spectator, your emotions and preconceived notions move, but gently. You get out of this with a lot to think about. I like it in the movies.
