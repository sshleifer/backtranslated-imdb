Now I know that Sandra Bullock produced this film, but she needs to understand that sometimes you have to make certain sacrifices to promote the story ... for example, do not try to make the whole movie about your character! <br /> A story about two high school students (one rich and popular, the other smart and anti-social) who formulate a murder plan and follow him by number ... just to find out if they can get away with it. Enter Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin as detectives trying to solve a case. The boys planted clues, created alibis and cleaned up so well that the police fell for the whole thing. But Sandra has a feeling that everything is not as it seems. <br /> <br /> This film could be a great little Hitchcock style thriller, but the film spends too much time trying to get to know Sandra's character better. what to focus on the actual crime itself. You see, something happened in her past that continues to haunt her throughout the film. And we learn all about it ... ALL about it. After a while, it becomes quite tedious, especially when you are at the very center of an intriguing murder investigation, and then have to stop this investigation to find out what happened to her in the past. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the real winners of this film. They play their characters convincingly and with enough malice. If the script spent more time focusing on these characters and left detectives there just to do their work, it could be a very interesting thriller. With this way, much of the thrill is lost. They had to cut out all things with the character of Sandra and make it a separate television film for the channel Lifetime. But I digress. It is still an entertainment film, however. I recommend this movie ... but waiting for a video / DVD.
