As a European, the film became a good memory of my studies in the 1980s and how I lived abroad and communicated with other nationalities, although the circumstances were a little different. Klapisch (director) studied at the New York Film School from 1982 to '85, so one would think that he relies on this experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting how the film balances the idea that "one should not generalize" with the notion that "for every stereotype there is some basic truth." For example, an Italian character is more based on appearance than on any known Italian stereotype. The German character has a few more tested and verified stereotypes. But the most stereotypical aspect of the film is not the character, but the central theme of infidelity. As the critic noted, infidelity is just as important for a French film as the class for a British film. <br /> <br /> Both the protagonist and his girlfriend play are not exactly cute, which, in my opinion, is intentional and cool. <br /> This may be unintentional, but some citizens have elements that can be taken for a metaphor of the intended role of their countries in the EU. A British woman talks to an American (who is an entertainer - like the president of the United States of the 1980s), while a Frenchman shows himself as a natural leader (when the boss appears). <br /> <br /> Although Europe is not as diverse as New York, it is striking that we see only two non-white characters. One of them is a Chilean woman with fundamental traits, which, despite the age of our main character, does not seem to be a potential object of interest. The other is the Gambian-Spanish, or rather the Gambian-Catalan man, who looks a bit invented. <br /> <br /> Someone may ask why Klapisch chose the main characters, who were from long-standing EU member states in Western Europe. Although these nationalities reflect what he and I would have met as students in the 1980s, I believe that exchange programs in modern Europe are much more diverse. The Erasmus program covers about 30 countries from Iceland to Eastern Europe, many of which are not members of the EU. However, I understand that the choice of nationalities that are more familiar to most viewers may have been deemed necessary so as not to distract attention from the contrast that Klapisch wants to create between Peopleâ€™s Europe and bureaucratic Europe. <br /> <br /> Despite some minor troubles, a great movie made me think about returning to Europe to live. My French friend, who is also an expatriate in the United States, caught our shared feelings in this contradiction: "If Europe were more like the United States, I would have gone in an instant."
