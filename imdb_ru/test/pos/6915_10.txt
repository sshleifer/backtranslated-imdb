Inferno gives Los Angeles what it deserves - baptism in fire, death from above. The superb composition of the obsessed characters could survive and sweat after passing through a coronal mass ejection, but that would not be fun and, of course, not dramatic. A truly lame review in Variety criticized the heroes for caring for their personal ransom instead of banning them together in order to save the world. But what is refreshing in this great heat is that no one can do anything about it. Therefore, we, fortunately, are not subject to the “heartfelt” scenes of fascist presidents and other major extras who come up with incredible plots to save a chosen remnant of humanity (namely Deep Impact). Here, half a dozen sweats and muds of sweat work out their own redemption or face their personal oblivion in an old-fashioned way - together as individuals or ... alone with the Lonely. Great tv movie in general. Obviously, not denatured by the destructive interference of overly zealous Network Directors. I highly recommend.
