This movie is amazingly free from storytelling. This is a pure experience when music overshadows the visual impression. - Words, of course, cannot sufficiently express what should be expressed, but the requirement of chatter classes is advanced, introduced into production lines of mediocrity and, therefore, necessary to express any reasonable thought or opinion about something that be aggravated by chatter. Therefore, these carefully thought-out opinions are put forward to satisfy those empty minds that must be filled with noise that you will not find, no matter how hard you try in this film.
