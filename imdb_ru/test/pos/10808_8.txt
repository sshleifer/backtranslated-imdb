If there were two roles that the physically tall, ugly charismatic actor Gerard Depardieu had to play as a Frenchman to play, then it must have been Cyrano de Bergerac and the orator Georges Danton. Here he dominates the film and the breadth of his shoulders, and the strength of his voice; his charisma plays an important role, despite the fact that it is clear that the character has as much blood on his hands as the rest. Danton celebrates while the people of Paris are starving ... but he is the only one who can defy the tyranny imposed on the terrible Public Security Committee in the name of "freedom", and he is presented as the hero of the film - despite the fact that the original piece almost idolizes his opponent Robespierre ! <br /> <br /> For those who know the characters from the story, there is an interest in identifying secondary roles: Tallien with a froggy face, Couton the cripple, the prosecutor of the Fouquier-Tinville Tribunal, feverish police officer Saint-Just, legendary artist David. But the scenario in this regard is slightly weakened; names are often delayed if minor characters are identified at all, and there is no Hollywood-style “information dump” to ensure that the audience can place events in their historical context. The film takes it for granted that you know what happened before and what happens after — sometimes it takes too much for granted, such as when it relies on accurate knowledge of dates to bite the tail in the fact that Robespierre is soon followed Danton to the scaffold. <br /> <br /> This is believed to be a film, but it is not entirely satisfactory, because it is coming to an end. The structure of the story leads to some big confrontation of the main characters in the courtroom or some dramatic climax of the trial, which, thanks to the story, never really happens. Everything just runs out of steam: there is no rebellion, no overthrow of tyranny, no victory of power, no victory on one side. This may be historically accurate, but it is not entirely satisfactory, as the result of the screen script seems like a strange place to stop. As others have commented, it would be more logical to bring events to the end of Terror and show Robespierre in the fall.
