Great comedy from Charlie Chaplin. I saw Chaplin’s 4 main films (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times and The Great Dictator), and I think this is the funniest movie out of four. This film made me laugh more than any other I have ever seen. From the very first disclaimer (“Any resemblance between the Great Dictator and the barber’s owner is purely random”), the film is a minute laugh with a combination of wonderful farces and verbal humor. And at the same time, Chaplin manages to portray the evil of totalitarian persecution. Maybe a little about the end and the long timeliness of the subject, but it is easy for 9 out of 10 for me.
