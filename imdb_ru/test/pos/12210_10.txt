I am new to this, so bear with me, please. I'm a big fan of Surface. I thought the script and computer graphics were exceptional, as good as any Sci Fi movie I saw in the theater. In February, a television guide told Season Finale, the show host said something like: "... and now in the Surface season finale." The season finale, not the series finale! I could not wait for the fall to get here to see what would happen next. So autumn gets here, and it is nowhere to be found! If NBC is not going to pick it up, how about Sci Fi or the US? It seems to me that Bay Watch did not last long on ABC, and then the US caught it, and it went bankrupt! (I bet ABC was out of breath) Ha! If not a series, then at least a mini-series to give all of us loyal fans a closure. What happened to our guy locked in a church steeple? Was this being in Neem's chapel? Was he dirty fucked up? Cloned guy goes to our side? There are so many unanswered questions. Thank you for listening to me, babble!
