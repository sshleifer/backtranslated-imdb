This film deserves better. Mike Judge's satirical wit revealed something that too many in this country are trying to deny ... as a society we become dumber. <br /> <br /> Can there be round-the-clock coverage of Anna Nicole Is there more evidence? Mike Judge paints a frightening future where the dumb survive and thrive. Makes you stop, think and laugh. Can you look at the world and not ask if we are more stupid? Do we overtake both human trash and our own trash? (Beware of landslides). <br /> <br /> The film is really funny. I would tell you more about the plot, but I do not want to spoil it. <br /> <br /> So why release this film with the promotion of ZERO? Could it be that stupid ones are already taking over?
