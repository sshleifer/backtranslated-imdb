I watched this movie, probably more than 20 times. The jokes are already 10-15 years old, but every time I watch them, I fall off the chair. Two of the best actors are Salman Khan and Aamir Khan playing the main roles here. Even if Aamir Khan is a much better actor and got the best role (smart guy) in the film of the matches of Salman Khan, and sometimes acts even better as a stupid guy. All characters are remembered. This film is filled with fun line-ups and funny situations (perhaps too stupid). Do not try to look for logic in this film. Allow your brain to relax for some time. I promise it will be an experience to remember.
