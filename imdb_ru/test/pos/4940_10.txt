It happened when I was just starting to watch TV, and I was too lazy to switch the channel, and I finally watched it. Dude lucky. <br /> <br /> This film is more a fairy tale than a demanding drama, and sometimes frankly sentimental. This is definitely something that could be called a well-being film, and I usually find it boring or annoying. However, this film is very well made, I could not help loving it. The script will not twist your brain; it is conditional, but flawless. The actors are great, everyone is perfect for the role. The rating is small, but the musical fragments perfectly improve the film. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate other things besides expensive pyrotechnics, villainous murders, or saving the world in a film, see this if you ever had a chance. 5/5
