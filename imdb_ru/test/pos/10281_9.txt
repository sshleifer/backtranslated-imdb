Gorgeous, original, beautiful film. The game is great, the en settings are excellent (Paris at its best, but then real Paris, not the famous settings), and the music will work too. A brilliant story, very detailed, which I love very much. <br /> <br /> The best French film I have seen (and the French cinema is very good)!
