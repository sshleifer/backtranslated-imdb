My husband dragged me into this film because I was not interested in watching anime. I was just in awe of the simple story and amazing animation. In the digital world, where the effects are generated by a computer, it was nice to see the gorgeous, original hand-drawn animation. The world of Sosuke and Ponyo is a bright fairy-tale country mixed with minimal reality. I have not seen such an animation since childhood, and it is wonderful to see how it stands and succeeds. <br /> <br /> The actors in the English version were great. The duration of the film was PERFECT, especially for children who usually play squirrels in films. All in all, a delightful experience is worth the very expensive ticket prices that we currently have.
