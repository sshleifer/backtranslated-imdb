Thank God, not all Dutch are so ruthless. I think Jason is judged this way by most people, simply because he has a famous father. He may not be as good as some of those actors, but he is definitely not as bad as expected. <br /> <br /> I watched a movie a few years ago, and I really liked it. I knew Jason from other films and, of course, Robin from Sherwood. But I have to say that I really liked his game from this movie. It was really good! <br /> <br /> During the film I really forgot that he was a son. Sean .. who? <br /> <br /> And if you are a lover of Shakespeare, I can recommend this movie. I am sure you will like it!
