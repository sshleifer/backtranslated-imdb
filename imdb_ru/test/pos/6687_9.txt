I usually donâ€™t like movies with / about aliens, but K-PAX is different. The actors in the film are great - especially Kevin Spacey played his hero amazingly! The film never sinks to a lower level - the suspense is always present in the film, and you absolutely want to know how it ends, what about Prot ... You have to think a lot after the film on the film, because there are several open questions ... Robert Porter Prot or only Prot uses the body of Robert Porters as a means of transportation. How he can see the ultraviolet light and how he can know so much about astrology. But everyone can commit suicide and decide what he wants to believe. Very good movie with great Kevin Spacey!
