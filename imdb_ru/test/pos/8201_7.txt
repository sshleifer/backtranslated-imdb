Angela (Sandra Bullock) is an expert on computers, but being shy and partly a recluse, she does all her work outside her home. As soon as she is about to take a vacation in Mexico, an employee sends her a computer disk with alarming information on it. Angela agrees to meet with her work colleague, but she mysteriously dies in a plane crash. Angela goes to Mexico, but takes the CD with her. While she is sunbathing on the beach, an amazing looking gentleman named Jack (Jeremy Northam) makes her confident. She falls in love with them, and both end up on a boat to Cozumel. However, Jack works for the people who created the secret information on the disk, and he is going to get it. Even after Angela escapes from the clutches and returns to the United States, Jack complicates things. He changes Angela's identity on every computer across the country, forcing her to lose her apartment, her bank account, everything. Can Angela, the computer genius, defeat Jack in his own game? This very exciting movie has many advantages. First, Bullock and Northam are two very beautiful, interesting actors, and their presence adds immediate appeal. The script is very intelligent and confident in their knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in the modern world. The costumes, scenery, production and direction of the film are also wonderful. And, despite how it sounds, Angela takes the flight to defeat her enemy. If you love thrillers without too much bloodshed or violence, this is a great choice. It delivers twists and turns with great frequency, allowing the viewer to “arrange” a very good evening of entertainment.
