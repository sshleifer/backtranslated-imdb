What can be said about the "Pink Flamingos"? This is beyond criticism or even explanation, because it really does not aspire to be like any other film you have seen. You will either get it, or you will not laugh at it or roll your eyes with disgust (or both). John Waters is a strange director (to put it mildly) mixing innocent, childish humor with shockingly offensive moments designed ... well, who knows what his intentions were. It looks like a form of attack, albeit funny. <br /> <br /> Waters' humor makes him so infectious and effective that his characters dwell in a world that may seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer, like the petty rivalry that forms the plot of the Pink Flamingos. Of course, everyone once faced with such things, but almost certainly it was not about the name of "the dirtiest living person." What makes the film attractive to me is that Waters creates a light, independent environment and does not allow you to joke right away. People in his films are fully consonant with each other. For example, when Cotton tells Babs that she does not want to accompany her to the city, because Crackers takes her “girlfriend” to the trailer, Babs reacts with an understanding smile and tells her in a conspiratorial voice, “That the little barn is just IDEAL ...” At the moment We still do not know that Crackers plans to take his "girlfriend" to the barn to shove the living chickens into her naked body, while Cotton watches the orgasm through the window, but this oddity is a completely common phenomenon, and the characters from the fictional degenerate world understand it which the creates Waters. <br /> <br /> Another example is the conversations between the girls in the basement and Channing, the deviant butler of Marble. For the first time we see them, Waters moves from the stage in Connie's cozy office to Channing, going down to the basement where we see two women down there, one is dead and the other is very much alive and dead. Susan is not embarrassed by the victim, but is furious and insults Channing, bouncing to start a full-scale verbal attack on her jailer. Both of them have a strange understanding of a strange situation, and her abduction is not so much frightening, but cruelly insulting and viciously angry. She doesn’t give in for a second while Channing is in her field of vision, and the two scenes that show their crazy banter are two of the film’s comic highlights. Later in the film, when the Divine and the Crackers burst into the house of the Marbles and discover their crimes of keeping the abducted women in their basement, this represents a total lack of support that Deity and her family have for the brand of depravity that Marbles indulge. - there is something the Deity is not familiar with, corruption created by its newly minted rivals, and it despises it. In addition, although the abduction does not seem to be something the Divine could think twice about, she is outraged at the fact that the girls are being held there, and with joy liberates them, savoring the revenge they take on Channing. <br /> <br /> In the other end of the dirt spectrum, Waters sometimes reminds us of the line between his twisted world of fantasy and the “real” world. The first time we see Connie, she belittles a minor character named Sandy Sandstone who has never heard of the Divine. Cookies, on the other hand, reacts with an amusing factual evaluation of the title of the Divine as “the dirtiest man alive,” showing that she also lives in this world of unspoken and understood insanity. <br /> <br /> Something also needs to be said about how players relate to their respective roles, especially the Divine, which does not miss a single note. Never once did he flinch in the ridiculous clothes and character that he was given, and this raised the Pink Flamingos to a new level or oddity. People really believed that the Divine was so in real life, and it’s easy to see why, because when you watch a movie you don’t really think about the movie, you think about these people who made it. Because they really do monstrous things in the script, you start thinking that maybe this is not a story, but a strange documentary. <br /> <br /> But, the more so, “Pink Flamingos” is not so much. film as an event or something that happens to you. Even though its shocking value has largely disappeared for me (I say mostly because the scene with a ** hole and the scene with a chicken still make me flinch), I still find this film fun and addictive.
