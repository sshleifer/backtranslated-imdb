William Shakespeare's “The Merchant of Venice” about a Jewish usurer and his connection to extract a pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant Antonio, who was out of debt. The Jewish usurer, of course, is Shylock, and Al Pacino gives him such an outstanding performance that even outstanding actors such as Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins go to the background. The film takes place in Venice of the 16th century, and director Michael Radford relies on the setting, mood and realism to tell his story, rejecting luxurious historical costumes or the modern setting with rock music to attract a wide audience. <br /> <br /> Radford chops up a three-hour play to two hours and eight minutes, and also provides some historical background. In the first story, he tells us how the Jews came to England, were subject to growing persecution and eventually were expelled from England. They were forbidden to own property, they could make a profit only by providing loans at interest and were forced to live in the Venetian "heto", the forerunner of the upcoming grim events. In the film, merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons) publicly spits on Shylock, but is not ashamed to go to the usurer to borrow 3,000 ducats to help his friend, and suggested to Bassanio's lover (Joseph Fiennes) to properly care for Portia (Lynn Collins) the rich heiress. Although Shylock was insulted by Antonio, he agrees to borrow money without interest for three months, provided that the confiscation of the bond gives him the right to demand a pound of meat from Antonio's heart. <br /> <br /> The play is, first of all, a drama of hatred and revenge, but, like many of Shakespeare’s works, there are also broad comedies in it. Here in the comedy are three couples in love: Bassanio and Portia, Graziano, a friend of Bassanio and Nerissa, and Lorenzo, another friend of Bassanio, and Jessica, the daughter of Shylock. Portia offered itself to a person who can choose the right treasure from one of three boxes made of gold, silver and lead. The prince of Morocco chooses the gold, the prince of Aragon silver, and both are disappointed. Bassanio, however, loves her for himself and opens the lead coffin to find the portrait inside. Adapting Redford conveys a wonderful sense of time and place. The Portia Residence in Belmont offers one of these magnificent summer houses with immaculate gardens and art treasures hanging in each room, and contrasts well with the ugly view of the city of Shylock with its damp streets. <br /> <br /> When it becomes clear that Antonio cannot repay the debt, Bassanio returns to Venice, leaving Portia behind. When he arrives, the loan is in default, and Shylock claims his pound of meat. Even when Bassanio, relying on Portia’s wealth, repeatedly offers payment, Shylock intends to avenge not only the loss of money, but also the entire status of an outsider. The Duke, who makes the decision, will not intervene, since Portia acts as a lawyer to defend Antonio. It is here that the film reaches its dramatic heights, since all parties come to court to reach a final decision. <br /> <br /> The Venetian merchant is not only about the unpaid debt, but also about the alienation of Jews from the Christian society and their desire for belonging. It was one of the most controversial Shakespeare plays, and analysts have long debated whether this is an anti-Semitic game or simply a game about anti-Semitism, which reflects the prevailing opinion of Christian society in Elizabethan England. Although Shylock is definitely a caricature, he is an ambiguous figure, and there are many signs that Shakespeare sees his flaws as human flaws, and not as Jewish. The duke admits that he is simply a man who could not stick to the compassionate language of the Torah. <br /> <br /> In a monologue: “I am a Jew. Doesn't a Jew have eyes? ”If you prick us, are we bleeding? if you tickle us, don't we laugh? if you poison us, we will not die? and if you offend us, do we not take revenge? ", Shylock demonstrates the universality of humanity, expressing the equality of all men. Although we are terrified of the proposal he wants to fulfill, we can feel his pain accumulated over the years. The performance of Pacino introduces a new force into the text and his often overly strong personality is more gentle, more restrained behavior, which brings understanding of his case. During an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival last September, Radford said about Pacino: When you work with a brilliant actor, you have excellent machine. It's a bit like driving a powerful machine. You have to dare to do it. "He dared, and we are all the beneficiaries.
