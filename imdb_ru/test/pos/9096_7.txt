I was originally a fan of Tenacious D of their first album and, naturally, listened to several tracks from The P.O.D. and was rather disappointed. After watching the movie, my view changed. The film is pretty funny from the very beginning to the end, and I was involved in it, although it was really a stupid plot because of the relationship that KG and Jaybles portray in the film. <br /> <br /> Much more interesting and more pleasant than the films that I have seen in cinemas recently. ex. Saw III (boring and fun), Casino Royale (the path to homo-erotic), which I really enjoyed in previous releases <br /> <br /> If you liked Borat, you will enjoy the story of the Greatest Group on Earth
