I really don’t know when it was, when television stations preferred reporters to choose handsome men - regardless of their IQ - but this was a clear problem by the time Broadcast News came out, and the film did a really good job looking at this. The film portrays a love triangle between the handsome reporter boy Tom Grunyk (William Hurt), the clever but nervous reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and the producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter). Probably the best line in the film is when Tom says something like: “I don’t quite understand what I'm talking about.” And in the era of FOX News and things like that, such a film becomes even more important. <br /> <br /> In general, the film that I recommend. Also starring Robert Prosci, Lois Chillis, Joan Cusack and Jack Nicholson as the presenter.
