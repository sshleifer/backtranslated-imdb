Krajobraz po bitwie, like many Weida films, is perhaps incomprehensible to the "rest of the world." The story is based on several stories by Tadeusz Borowski, who was a prisoner of the Auschwitz, Dachau and Dautmergen camps during World War II. In his books, Borovsky describes the inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the point of view of Vadebateur Tadek, the porte of parole for the author, who also held a privileged position among the prisoners. Borovsky was merciless to mankind and merciless to himself. He describes human history as an endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. Ironically, after returning to Poland, he stopped writing prose and became a communist propagandist, creating a stream of anti-imperialist and anti-American publications in the press. A few years later he committed suicide. In the film, Waida changes points of view. Vorarbeiter Tadek - a character created by Tadeusz Yangzar - plays only a supporting role. The story focuses on the poet, destroyed, burned by war and imprisoned, and his one-day love with Nina, a Jewish girl who escaped from communist Poland, although in reality she hates Jewish life and way of thinking. As a background, we can observe the sad grotesque of the life of the so-called "dipis" (displaced persons), which after liberation are settled by the Americans in the SS barracks. Marches, patriotic kitsch, mixed with the hunt for an extra dose of food and / or prostitution of German girls. <br /> <br />
