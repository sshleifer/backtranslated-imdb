A silent film masterpiece by Victor Siostrom, The Phantom Coach, was recently released on DVD with a new KTL soundtrack. The duo, which includes American guitarist Steven O'Malley and Austrian notebook artist Peter Reberg, created an unusual collection of sounds to accompany and accent the original footage of the 1921 film. The ominous knocking sound represents each act and mix of drones, guitar chords, and feedback is cast and flows as the grim drama unfolds. <br /> <br /> As an impressive new soundtrack, the film remains a real star with an endless transmission of a grim and grim tale. According to this tale, the last person who must die before the midnight strike on New Year's Eve is doomed to spend a year following the occasion of the eponymous ghostly wagon collecting souls of the dead. Such is the fate of the anti-hero of the film David Holm, who survived the painful test of his life after his untimely death and the subsequent meeting with the coach driver. <br /> <br /> This film is often referred to as a horror film, and although it is an appropriate label, the real horror here is not in the supernatural elements, but in describing human suffering at the hands of others. Sjostrom gives wonderful ideas, like a drunken, angry and threatening Hill in life, and an unhappy, frightened Hill looking back from the land of the dead and evading its past actions. <br /> <br /> Striking images abound everywhere in the Ghost Carriage and more than compensate for the inevitably limited dialogue. The bad omen of midnight is powerfully illustrated by a dial that soars alone in the darkening night sky, like a second moon. No less impressively, the dead are depicted with the help of innovative translucent images, and the scenes of a ghostly carriage traveling by land and sea are still scary to watch. <br /> <br /> The Siostrom film deserves its place as one of the most respected silent films of all time and the new soundtrack from KTL - an excellent accent on its themes. You should see this.
