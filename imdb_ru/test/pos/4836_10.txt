I first saw this film about 3 years ago. I was shocked at how stupid the FBI was to prevent such a tragedy. It could have been easily prevented. This film was just incredible. <br /> <br /> Now, seeing him after 9/11, I am shocked and I can say that it could be more easily prevented, which most people will want to know. <br /> <br /> This film is 100% plausible <br /> <br /> In the last scene of the film, when the mastermind of the 1st attack goes to jail by helicopter and flies over the towers, he makes a remark that spooky They laughed at him when he said that. “The next time we bring them * BOTH *". It was actually said by Ramzi Yousef after his arrest. <br /> <br /> This film reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were made right under the nose of the FBI and the New York Police. This shows how the 1st and 4th amendments are partly to blame for the attacks. <br /> <br /> I’m watching this movie now and I know that both attacks could have been prevented.
