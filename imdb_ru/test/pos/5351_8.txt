It was very good, except for two things that I will mention at the end. The animation is gorgeous, accentuated by Nick Park and the trademark of exaggerated teeth and mouth characters that make you laugh almost every time you see someone. The color was also great. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is a clever comedy woven throughout. This is another animated film in which each frame can be seen and heard so much that it takes a lot of views to catch all the gags. This is just a funny exaggerated look at the eccentric “Wallace” and its clever and intelligent dog “Gromit”. Along the way, it amuses people who are fond of their gardens, something similar to how obsessed dog lovers were portrayed in the "Best Of Show". <br /> <br /> My only complaints were two typical features of modern films, animated or not: 1 - let's make the cleric in the film look like a complete idiot; 2 - let's go through the final scene with a predictable result, but too exaggerated. Nevertheless, it is still a very funny film that should deliver a lot of laughter to many people and a film that is worth watching several times.
