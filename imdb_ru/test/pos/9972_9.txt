The inevitable problem of any production of “The Merchant of Venice” has never been in pseudo-contradictory anti-Semitism, but in the fact that there are two plot lines completely different in tone and content; frothy romantic comedy and burning tragedy. Although the mixing of genres was in vogue in the sixteenth century (and mocked Shakespeare in Hamlet), it rarely suffers a defeat for the modern audience. As a result, most directors are forced to focus on one storyline at the expense of another, and it is not surprising that the decision is made in favor of Shylock. <br /> <br /> Like many of Shakespeare's great tragic hero, Shylock continues to fascinate after 400 years, because he is such a complex and complex character. Pathetic, proud, angry, vindictive, weak, arrogant; his behavior is not amenable to analysis and continues to be discussed. He is imperfect, not because he is a Jew, but because he is a man. Rarely modern writers fill their creations with such richly textured contradictions, and it is useful for all of us that Shakespeare use them for inspiration. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare's language is wild and incoherent, full of a multitude of meanings, the word game and metaphor. To be understood, it must be a controversial and tamed actor with the power and knowledge to do it. When an actor fails, words flow into a stream of incomprehensible words, but when he succeeds, English comes alive with immediacy and energy that captures the spirit. Al Pacino is one of these actors, and here he demonstrates an incredible level of clarity and control that, if there was some kind of justice, would encompass every reward in a sentence. It solves the problem of Shylock's presentation in the forehead and provides an unusually subtle and nuanced presentation. It would be a crime if we never had the opportunity to see what he was doing with King Lear. <br /> <br /> The cast deserves attention. Jeremy Irons gives the original look at the familiar Antonio, representing an older, calmer figure, which reflects the unpleasant contradictions between medieval knighthood and the ugly prejudices of that time. Joseph Fiennes is a revelation when he grows out of superficial delicacy to actually populate a character for once. Lynn Collins - the only disappointment. Many of Shakespeare’s women are signed and demand that the actor really work hard to bring them to life, and the imitation of Collins Gwyneth Paltrow seems a bit flat and does not match the dark tone that Redford is aiming for. <br /> <br /> The design team should be recognized for creating a unique and fully believable vision of the Late Renaissance of Venice. The city did not look so sinister from the times of "Do not look now." Taking advantage of the existing space and natural light, the film has a look of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the dark and worn out design of the costume. All of them also deserve recognition. <br /> <br /> The financial sponsors of such films are commendable. With a budget of 30 million dollars, they must go to such an enterprise in full and with certain knowledge that they will never make a profit, and yet they invest. We can all be grateful for this, because the result is a wonderful adaptation that will undoubtedly be a guide for many years to come.
