If you like Gary Cooper, this is one of his best roles. His soft desire to correct a mistake was what made his career. Blayde Hollister arrives in Dallas to take revenge on Will and Brian Malow, who burned his farm in Georgia and killed his family. The unbalanced Marshall stands in the way of Hollister, trying to arrest him when he is interrupted by a street exchange of gunfire between Hollister and Wild Bill Hickok. The shootout is organized to get the law from Hollister, and he takes Marshall's “back East” under his wing to support him in Texas, as they change personality. <br /> <br /> It was a great start, and the picture stands up to the end. The action may be a bit "slow" by today's standards, but this is one of my 10 most favorite films.
