Well, if this film were made much later in the history of cinema, it would not be particularly appropriate. However, in 1898, films were in their infancy, and they were all pretty boring and had no real story to tell - instead, they simply showed ordinary ordinary people involved in daily activities. If you look today, almost all of them are hopelessly boring and very, very short - often less than one minute! And in the light of this, this short clip from the movie is very cool and can just make you laugh. Two guys, a miller and a chimney sweeper stumble at each other - falling and throwing out flour and coal dust at each other when they quarrel. This is all - the film is finished before you know it.
