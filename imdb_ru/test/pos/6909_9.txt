I saw this film as part of Midnite Madness in Sitges. The action takes place in 18th century England. The plot tells about the life of Arthur Blake, starting with his first appearance as a robber of a student’s graves and ending with his confession on the eve of execution. <br /> <br /> The plot is promoted through a series of accidents involving Arthur and his partner, confronted with various unpleasant characters and strange situations. <br /> <br /> The first thing that strikes you in this film is how accurately they managed to capture the horror image of the Hammer period, the atmosphere is set with many cemeteries filled with fog, noisy taverns and great designs of scenery and costumes. <br /> <br /> In a film titled “I Sell the Dead,” I expected that the focus would be mainly on horror ?? don't get me wrong, there are some jumping moments and blood, but the tone is very comedic, caused by the situations in which the characters fall, and their dialogue. The closest comparison to the scenes between the two presenters (Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan) is the interaction of characters that can be seen in the classic English comedies Only Fools and Horses, Two Ronnies, Morecambe, and Wise. <br /> <br /> The acting skills are strong, and very familiar faces in Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimme lift the film over many others that can be seen in Sitges. <br /> <br /> In general, the film offers something completely different from the current mass horror. and leave a smile on your face.
