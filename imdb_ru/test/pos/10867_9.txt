This film gives Daniel his chance to make a great fighter, but I do find the character of Emil Chow really great, brave, but decisive for correcting mistakes. Plus, the main terrorist, he makes me think about his revolution, makes me wonder if he is doing this good or bad. <br /> <br /> A film telling us about Todd, an Amnesian terrorist who was tricked undercover before he finds out who he really is. The consequences he makes with his terrorist family give him a choice. <br /> <br /> Purple Storm was one of the best I've ever seen this year. The film really stands out when itâ€™s filled with terrific battle scenes created by Stephen Tung Wai, who won the best action films in the Hong Kong Prize. (9/10)
