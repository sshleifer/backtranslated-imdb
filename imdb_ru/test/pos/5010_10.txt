After watching the Talk Show premiere with Spike Peresten, I wondered if after 12 years there were really good shows besides SNL, and I was also sad to see that it was just 30 minutes. His excellent writing skills helped this show overcome a series of lack of money and helping hands. Electronic Lincoln was fun, and I really think it would be a good Dark Horse talk show. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased with the way he handled it, and gave Andy Rihtor some good lines to work with. As you suspected, it was a bit shaky, but for such a time interval it was very good. <br /> <br /> In general, if you are not someone on the grass or even if you have, and you donâ€™t have something more important, do it than watch this wonderful piece and have fun.
