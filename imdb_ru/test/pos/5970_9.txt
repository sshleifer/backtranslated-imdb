It is not surprising that Larisa Shepitko was married to Elem Klimov, who later shot the most terrible war film ever made, “Come and See” (1985). "Ascent (1977)" The last finished Shepicto film before a premature death ?? built in a very similar form. Filmed during the Second World War, the film tells about a pair of Soviet partisans who are trying to get food for their starving army, evading occupation German forces. The first forty minutes are painfully tense, as the two men drag themselves through the harsh, snow-covered landscape, the world around them is completely saturated with life, warmth and color (indeed, landscapes are so monotonous that I literally took it that way.) that the film was shot in black and white. <br /> <br /> After the German soldiers captured the partisans, the film becomes cold meditation on loyalty and morality, while Sotnikov (Boris Plotnikov) refuses to betray his army even under strong coercion A less decisive ribek (Vladimir Gostiukhin) tries to save himself. Fisherman, as the Bible is a pity for Judas. Both men betrayed their allies to the enemy and were forced to watch their execution. However, although Judas committed suicide by hanging (at least according to the Gospel of Matthew), Rybek finds even this option are you digging? in a painfully tense climax the belt around his neck is unbuttoned. <br /> <br /> "Climbing" draws its emotional power from Shepitko's amazing desire for realism. I have no doubt that the two main actors all day long climbed the snowy ground on their hands and knees, and, indeed, their misfortune is so convincing that I really caught a cold while watching the movie (seriously, I did). Interestingly, the film intervenes several times in this reality, as Raybek imagines himself claiming freedom, and then executed by his German captors. This device, although unusual, works well with its biblical allegory; Rybek faces a test of his dignity, and at every step he faces a new dilemma, he consistently chooses a selfish alternative, and his own life is the only decisive criterion. At the end of the film, he is still alive, but the nightmare of war and guilt persists.
