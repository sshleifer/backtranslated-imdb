As you can see, I really liked the book; I have been using the name for my pseudonym on the Internet for over 15 years. (Ok, then it had to be phonetically recorded in order to comply with the character name restriction for a BBS at that time, but what could I do?) If anyone finds this film, I would really like to watch it! Janet McTyr is gorgeous in everything I saw from her. I think she would have done great Prue. And it even has an early Clive Owen - before the Chancer (in itself a great series). What not to love? I hope that the forces that will be wise and soon make it available on DVD! With some of the real dredges that they blow, it's time for well-executed productions to do it in the market too.
