I have always loved Brenda Bletin, and Betty's Commitment was not a disappointment. I saw it on the satellite on a dreary Sunday morning. Life was tense, and this film made me laugh and see things that we usually consider terrible, in a fun way. I would like her to shoot more such films and “Salvation Grace”. Brenda Bletin is a great girl for us, about 60, to see in action. She is cute, beautiful and full of life, not looking plastic and fake. Not so many actresses for us to treat them realistically, but funny and / or serious. Brenda - if you see it - keep up the good work. We need more Mrs. Bennetts, Bettis and Grace.
