I generally like SRK as a villain (how can you not?), And I believe that SRK and Juhi are perfect on the screen, as they are actually more pleasant than cute. <br /> <br /> This film is great for watching, although it has some serious flaws: <br /> <br /> 1) a good guy (Sunny) - he is not only much less attractive than Shah Rukh (which In my opinion, it is sooooo important in Bollyfilm), but he lacks his characterâ€™s role - it would be much better if there was a conflict between two strong personalities, instead we would have a conflict between a person and an ordinary soldier. <br /> <br /> 2) The reaction of Kirana and Sunil to the actions of Rahul is incredibly stupid and naive even for a Bollywood production. <br /> <br /> But all this is not so important compared to the beautiful melodramatic atmosphere, great songs (really really great) and (let's say) Shah Rukh as a villain, I just love him when he is so passionate <br /> <br /> Be sure to watch (along with Anjam, Baasigar and Duplicate)
