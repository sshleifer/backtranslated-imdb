This wonderful film never let me down. Color, convincing shade and stunning landscape - all this makes a great contribution. This production, in contrast to the later remake of Carlton, is more impressionistic and is presented more from the children's point of view. It focuses on specific episodes from E. Nesbit's enchanting story, rather than trying to make the somewhat more documentary style of "warts and all" that Carleton accepts. First of all, the late Johnny Douglas's superb musical score reinforces the story everywhere, adding additional emotional depth. The end result is a truly amazing combination of sensory experiences, which together represent the acute history of Railway Children. <br /> <br /> It’s uncomfortable for the viewer to think about how things have changed since then. once - and in many ways, for the worse! Yes, maybe many of us no longer need to use external toilets and ride carts pulled by horses, but what about the quality of life in general? Look at the dirty celebrities who now "decorate" our television screens. Their language is now clearly considered quite acceptable. Also consider the fragile aspects of “here today, leaving tomorrow” of many of today's “partnerships” plus all single mothers - no matter what happens to this institution, called “marriage,” when people recognized each other’s shortcomings, but still remained together to love their children. ? These details add zest to this amazing movie. <br /> <br /> I hope that after several generations, children will still be able to enjoy this film. Not to mention certain adults!
