This is an unusual movie. Like a drama in a courtroom, this is convincing, like a charge against the American justice system, this is scary. For Brenton Butler, the consequences of this system can be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the lawsuit: it is not about revealing guilt or innocence, but about who is better represented in court. In truth, the consequences of this case go beyond the probability that an innocent person will be found guilty or the guilty person will be free. Every citizen has the right to justice, be it a criminal or a victim. But do they get it? The film is well thought out, undervalued and one of the best documentaries in the courtroom that I have seen.
