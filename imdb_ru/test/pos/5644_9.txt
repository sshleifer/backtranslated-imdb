I released this film a week after Ichitawa Kona’s death — I suppose if there is one way to mark the great director’s death, it would raise him a glass of wine while watching one of his greatest films. Ichikawa had one of the best careers in the Japanese film, but since he never had a distinctive style or theme, he was often overlooked compared to his contemporaries, such as Ozu and Kurosawa (he was a little younger than them, but not much ). He is one of those directors who challenge the author's theories — it’s likely that his wife (who wrote the script for this and many of her other films) was equally as responsible for the quality of the films as he was. But at his best, he was as good as any Japanese director at the time. In particular, he had excellent technical skills that allowed him to tell complex stories in an accessible way. But from the point of view of the topic, this film could hardly be simpler - war is hell. No, really, this is really hell. <br /> <br /> Fire on the plain does not comply with the rules of the ordinary genre of war. There is no real beginning - we start as miserable Tamura, who is an ordinary private person (although it is understood that he is more thoughtful and educated than most others) - at one stage it is shown that he understands English, but he pauses when others ask him how he knows that) he was sent to the hospital, because his department is already in terrible condition. The soldiers are defeated and starving to death. They are no longer an army, but simply a group of refugees from a rag bag that the locals hunt for, and largely ignored by the Americans, who have bigger fish for frying. Hunger and despair push the soldiers to the brink and go beyond madness. <br /> <br /> In the typical Ichikawa style, not everything is just gloomy - strangely funny in parts (of course, very black humor). <Br /> <br /> The best moments of this film for me are outstanding performances and a bright photo. Characters in all their humanity, as well as in the total loss of humanity, are too plausible. This is a rare film - one that refuses to wipe itself off your head, even if you want to forget it.
