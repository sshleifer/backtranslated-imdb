Even the artful knick-knacks of Maria Montez / John Hall of the 40s are overshadowed by "Princess of the Nile", Fox's entry into the obsession of Hollywood in the mid-50s with Egyptian things (see "Land of the Pharaohs", "Valley of the Kings", ", etc. ) A clean, immaculate, meaningless hodum, richly created (in fact, with a small budget, but using decorations and costumes left over from the “Mantle”, this technical play looks like it’s worth millions). 71 minutes sweet attitude to the vile jokes in ancient Egypt, not relevant), suggested To the filmmaker and the audience, Debra Page's amazing spectacle, dressed in transparent curtains, most of which hit the ground as she shakes and trembles over the number of female slaves who have no analogues in the history of cinema. Fox player, Jeffrey Hunter, is just as photogenic as Miss Paget, and Michael Rennie is hiding in the background, stirring up evil deeds in the land of pyramids. For those who might think that Page and Hunter cannot act and were hired only because of their physical qualities, take a look at their subtle, overlooked, heartbreaking work together a few years later in “White Pere” (another production of “Fox ", Which, unfortunately, disappeared into the realm of" lost films "). "Princess of the Nile" still remains in its class as fun brainless, breathless, dazzling witness to the glory of the 3-band Technicolor - and the seductive charm of Miss Paget (all 20 at the time). Put this one-of-a-kind classic kitsch on top of your list of “guilty pleasures” and enjoy. Satisfaction guaranteed!
