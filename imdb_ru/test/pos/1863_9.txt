This is definitely a touching film and a great expression of Charles Darwin's personal struggle. The film tells not only about his struggle for the publication of his book "The Origin of Species", but also about his relationship with his eldest daughter. Initially, his daughter was the only person in his family who approved his views, for which she also had to pay. Sometimes it's more than him. <br /> <br /> Now this is not an evolutionary propaganda film, in fact I think that he managed to stay very neutral. The hard thing in my opinion. Of course, this does not condone the way the church handled the characters, in fact, on the contrary. If you need me to use big words to shed light on this film; This will appeal to both deists and atheists, but moves away from theism. The film is about evolution, that's all. <br /> <br /> Paul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course, we can all think of Darwin as an old man with a funny beard, but this film tells about a man in his late 20s, early 30s. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is gorgeous as ever, but the actor who impressed me was Martha West in the role of Annie Darwin, the daughter of Darwins. Definitely one of the best children's actors of the decade. The story of Darwin and his daughter, and she played well. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a few jumps in time that were momentarily confused, the production of this film is pretty impeccable. In some scenes, Darwin observes that nature is simply amazing and almost like it was shot from a high-performing national geographic documentary. <br /> <br /> Although, I have to admit, I'm not quite sure why they chose “Creation” as the title. I doubt that this is irony, the film is too respectful for that. Well, I'm sure that this also makes sense, just don't let it scare you. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 9/10. This is really a great tribute to Charles Darwin, and please give her a chance.
