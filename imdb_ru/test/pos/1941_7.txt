I think it's a pretty good movie, but one thing makes it VERY interesting to me. This is obvious when you look at it: the main characters of this film are the inspirations of hooligans on The Simpsons. Lane - Jimbo, John - Kearney, Tony - Dolph. There is even an episode of The Simpsons, where Jimbo uses the line “I poked her with a stick.” <br /> <br /> Jimbo-Lane's connection is most obvious with a knitted hat, long hair, and a voice. Kearney has a shaved head, unlike John, but a big, dull one. The Tony Delphic connection is fairly obvious with a long, divided hairstyle and even a second-level status.
