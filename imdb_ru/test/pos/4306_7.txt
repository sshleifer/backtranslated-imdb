This Colombo is unique in that we do not know the exact result until the very end. Our beloved dark horse detective suspects a pair of identical twin brothers in the murder of his rich uncle; everyone points his finger at his brother. In a mysterious series in which the crime was shown at the beginning of the drama, this turn could only be used wisely once or twice, and this was Colomboâ€™s time. In addition to this wrinkle, this episode fits well into other series. He has a lighter tone than some, with a very funny game of Janet Nolan in the role of a fastidious and dedicated housekeeper who instantly dislikes Colombo.
