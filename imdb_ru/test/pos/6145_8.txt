I, as it seems, many IMDB patrons, stumbled upon this little film when it appeared in the Canadian Showcase Network. I, like many of you, also sucked and watched the entire movie. At first I was hooked by a competent dialogue and a strange sense of humor, which the film is rich with. I felt comfortable on some wave of "Kevin Smith Meets Killer Films" until the film turned over and explored his topics in more detail ... with a clearly darker and sharper edge. I was not learned from this experience, and they brought me further. This is not the best movie of its kind, and it certainly will not have universal appeal ... so I understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought in ... and I really liked it. The “backward” type of movement in chronology was effective, the characters were well implemented, and the questions raised were human, accessible (for my experience anyway) and interesting. I was very impressed with the ability of the film to remain sweet, funny and interesting, not shying away from controversial topics and coarse emotional language, dynamics and situations. This film is an excellent antidote to many of the slokas that permeate the witty / clever romantic genre. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for competent sect. Take 2 hours from your busy schedule and jump into the world of Wirey ... or you can rent "You Got Mail", because if you like it, you won't like it anyway! Those of us who like it will be fine without you on our side ...
