I liked this film, which is entirely about the average family. Ben Travis (Jeff Daniels) plays the role of a father who is interested only in one son, who swims well and wins many trophies, but he hates him and even his father very much. Ben has very little to say to his other son Tim (Emile Hirsch) and even his daughter Penny (Michelle Williams), who was lucky in college. Mother, Sandy, (Sigourney Weaver) is trying to rally the family, and even her husband completely ignores her. A very tragic event occurs in the family that changes the personality of everyone, young and old people start to use drugs, smoke weed and drink at parties all the time. There is even a homosexual scene, and at the same time there is even a place for comedy, and, of course, there is a very dark secret that Sandy Travis finally tells his son Tim.
