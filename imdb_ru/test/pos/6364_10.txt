Does anyone know why this movie is called travel on the couch? I just watched it and still not sure why this title was chosen. The film was very funny, and probably this is my favorite performance by Dan Aykroyd. It even surpasses his presentation of Ghostbusters. I had never heard of the movie before I saw it in the sears shop. I read my back and thought it sounded good, so I bought it, and when I finally had the opportunity to watch it, I thought it was better than I expected. In my opinion, this film is rated as good as livestock and national lantern vacations. I would like the comedies that came out lately to be written the same way as there was nothing sad about it, and the bad things that happen are also funny parts, if someone else feels that way and would like read the comedy script for the film, in which there is no sad situation, write to me at killer2511@hotmail.com
