How often do you see a movie of any kind in which there is a talent show with snacks? Waldo's final battle is refreshment. Here, Waldo sells lemonade, but does not earn. Lucerne, Spunky, Darla, Mickey and Buckwheat come to visit him, which is ironic because both in “3 men in the bathroom” and in “Coming Brown”, where there was a competition for Darla's love for Waldo. Let's go back to the story: The Gang tried lemonade to see if Waldo did the right thing. One funny moment is when Lucerne gets a glass cup for lemonade, and Waldo fills it and gives it to Darla, and Lucerne has an angry expression on her face. Spunky offers an outdoor show with lemonade, and even Mickey agrees that he is so cute. When the floor show begins, there is no one in the barn, but then the client comes in (Froggy). Spunky asks him if he wants lemonade, but all he does is nod no. Spunky asks him the amount of time in a short one and every time Froggy doesn’t nod, Spanky shows a lot of facial expressions, which is funny. Spanky is trying in various ways to make him drink. One way is when Mickey said very nicely: "These crackers are salty, and they made me drink." There is also a lot of entertainment music bits. Darla's introductory number, which she dances and sings. The second includes alfalfa, singing turnkey (as usual) with Mickey, Leonard, Spunky and Buckwheat on the theme "How dry I am!" (I believe they sing it to make Froggy feel thirsty. It also made me laugh.) The latest issue includes boys and girls dressed in the old fashioned way. It was the last short film of our Waldo gang. Great music shorts, clean 10 out of 10.
