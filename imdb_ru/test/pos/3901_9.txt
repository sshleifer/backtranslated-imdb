It was an exciting movie that really attracted me. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts on a great show. His great sympathy, combined with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I found myself tensely waiting for the entire house of cards to collapse around him (and, accordingly, I, as his confidant and silent witness). It took me a few minutes to relax after the movie ended, I was so immersed in it. <br /> <br /> Good performances everywhere, not just with Macy. Arkin was pretty good, like Cromwell (he was surprisingly cruel). In short, I highly recommend this movie to all Macy fans and / or murder secrets. But you can prepare to feel a little guilty.
