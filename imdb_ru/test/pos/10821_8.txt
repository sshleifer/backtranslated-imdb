I was in the mood for a French film and saw it in a blockbuster. What a little gem it turned out to be! Not sure how I missed Gregory Derenger all these years, but he's fantastic. Such innocence and grace! I love his face and the way he moves. Isabelle Adjani was fun - she reminded me of Nicole Kidmanâ€™s incredible performance at the Moulin Rouge. She looks just like 20 years ago ... really wonderful. Gerard Depardieu also could not resist, but his game continues to amaze. He is perfect in this film. Probably buy this one, I liked it so much. If you want to watch another great French movie, rent a Joyeux Noel. Stunning.
