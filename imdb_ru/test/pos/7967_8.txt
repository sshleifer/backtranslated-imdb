I have a reason to love the great camera users; the smooth direction of action lends itself to a rapidly developing adventure and comedy narrative; but this skill in the hands of King Widor or Anthony Mann can also be applied to work at the idea level. This is Paul Wendkos masterpiece. His story line can be repeated in one pair of sentences. General Hector Cordoba is going to become almost emperor in Northern Mexico and is stealing a huge cannon from General Blackjack Pershing. he sends his unit on a crack mission, divided, wary, but decisive, led by George Peppard, to return the cannon and return Cordova alive to put an end to the uprising. The charismatic Raf Vallone plays Cordoba; Lady in the play - Giovanna Rally and Francine York; with an even larger team consisting of Niko Mindardos, Peter Deuel and Don Gordon. Other persistent students in the class are John Larch and John Russell. In addition, Miss Rally and the stubborn Mexican Teniente (Gabriela Tinti) participate in the already fantastically dangerous operation, whose regiment was betrayed when Cordoba began to act independently. The danger multiplies when Gordon's brother, being an advanced spy, is captured and tortured to death, while he has to watch ... and he decides that he needs to kill Peppard. The attack, which captures a cannon when Peppard's orders do not obey the usual type of army, is one of the most visual and scenic achievements in cinematic history; the penetration into the fortress of Cordoba, the revelations and actions that were revealed there, which give the mission team a chance to win - or almost win - are presented flawlessly. This is a beautiful color adventure film with unusually strong costumes, acting, lighting, art and music by Elmer Bernstein. Scenario Stephen Candela, probably his best movie. This is probably the most underrated chief western at the moment, but I have always valued his heroes as productive workers. But, as Peppard reminds his group on the way home: “The problem with the“ hero ”is the morning after.” To find out why he says that, you will need to look at Cannon For Cordoba.
