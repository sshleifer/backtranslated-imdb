I have to admit that when Madonna first saw “Holiday on Top of Popularity” many years ago, I told my wife: “Another American was surprised that this was all wrong!” Well, she was wearing a terrible wig and was terribly dressed. I never loved her like my daughter, but I must have my words. I like some of her stuff, and sometimes I like her shows filmed. This film “Confessions tour” is great, even if there is no music (and there is none). I was impressed with the play and the concepts. Madonna’s performance was enhanced by incredible dancers whom she decided to support. My daughter was at concerts in London and crazy about it. Lady (Madge) confirmed my initial assessment of her so very wrong!
