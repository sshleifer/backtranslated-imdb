In relative terms, after reviewing a number of disgustingly bad television programs, Tom Fontana and Levinson are geniuses for creating and transmitting In this book the writer is the greatest television show ever created. It was a terrible thing with Oz. In this country, the final went well. 3 In the morning, before that, it was strictly considered an alternative viewing for those who do not notice debris in prime time. <br /> <br /> I caught Oz for the first time by the end of the first series and since then it has been a watch not to be missed. My man, Adebisi, is probably the worst villain in the entire history, Beecher is the perfect antihero, Imon Walker, Said, a class of acting. Of course, these were hardcore things - some kind of simple evil, but, in fact, Oz had a soul. Augustus tells about the unfolding story with the pearls of insight, while the struggle of Beecher, McManus, Said, Rebedal, etc. Is better than any soap opera before or after. Compassion, violence, wisdom, tragedy. Mind, pain, joy, cruelty, love and heroism.

Psychologist attacks Verna In the gym - this is the moment for which I do not need video - a classic small screen that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> Imagine what Oz would do with the same impetus as the soprano. 10 pm and all promotions ??? Well, I am now for it, for those who caught it, consider yourself privileged for those who did not watch TV, this shit ....... and you deserve it.
