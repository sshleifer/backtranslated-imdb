Although I'm not a fan of Michael Jackson, I like some of his early songs, as well as some of Jackson 5. “Thriller” is one of his great songs, and she came out of the best-selling album with the same name. As for the video, it’s awesome, one of the best, but also very eccentric and weird. <br /> <br /> There is a story behind this video, but it is so complex that even I cannot fully understand it. , This is strange. The strangest thing is turning Jackson into a werewolf, his evil red eyes at the end (like a werewolf) and dancing dead people. <br /> <br /> The video is very dark, exciting, cool and original. There are great landscapes and settings. The music itself is full of life and rhythm, characteristic of the good old pop music of the 80s. <br /> <br /> I like the monologue of Vincent Price. He makes a great narrative in his own distinctive and unique voice, and his evil laugh is amazing at the end! My favorite “King of Pop” clips are “Billie Jean” and “Don't Stop Until You Pick Up” (both among his best songs).
