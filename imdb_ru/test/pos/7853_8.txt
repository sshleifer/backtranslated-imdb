I thought Eastwood’s most unusual role was in “Bridges of Madison County,” but that was until I saw “Deceived.” He manages to shoot it, which gives a very good performance, like the rest of the actors. The direction is creative, considering that the film was shot in 1971, and if there were no gaps in the plot - which the director seems to be trying hard to hide - we would talk about an excellent film. However, it remains powerful. <br /> <br /> 8
