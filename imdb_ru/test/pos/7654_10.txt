This film is a tapestry, a series of portraits of Roma communities woven together with music. This is a very musical film, due to the lack of conversational dialogue - and what dialogue exists is not important for the structure of the narrative. Some may expect National Geographic to talk about “custom, clothing, and music,” or the storyline revolving around several central characters — don't look for it here. <br /> <br /> This is because it paints a portrait of a family of nations, rather than telling the story of people. The plot is a story about the cosmos (from India to Andalusia) and / or / time (we cannot say) about people. No need for narration. You get the feeling of joyful people who are closely connected in small communities where social interaction is very important. And a deep feeling of sadness in parts, when they are rejected by society as a whole. <br /> <br /> So this is Roma’s Paine culture, very beautifully filmed, with a wide range of Roma music and a sting in the Tail, which is the oppression these people have come across and still face.
