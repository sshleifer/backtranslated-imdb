An unusual film about a man who is friends with his social opposite because of the fear of blackmail. Peter Boyle makes this film with his disgusting boorish image of the hard-working "Joe" of the working class, in love with the past and fearful future and worried about the present. The first half hour of the show shows the film debut of a young Susan Sarrandon as Melissa Compton, a weak-willed, rich girl who lives in slums with her unlucky guy teeming with a full nude scene. Her boyfriend is a weak spot in the film, a poorly-depicted drug addict and trader who meets his demise after an overdose of Sarrandon. We meet Joe Boyle in a bar when he talks and talks about minorities, crime, hippies and drugs, and it’s easy to see that the later TV character Norman Lear from Archie Bunker is based on a purified version of Joe. Comparison is transferred even to Joe's wife, privacy and entertainment. Joe introduces herself to the life of Bill Compton, Melissa's father, and they form an unlikely couple when they search for Melissa, who has run away from addiction treatment and returned to the addicts she calls friends. Their search brings them to the “fun business,” as Joe calls it, the free love festival, which is fueled by drugs, nudity, and in a wonderful way, joined by anxious Bill Compton and ultra-conservative Joe. and a deadly ending that portends a harsh and frightening ending for Taxi Driver six years later. Joe is a funny movie that, at least at first glance, is anti-violence and racism. Yet the film’s protagonist, Joe, becomes the very tool of upheaval that he fears when he enters and joins the unlawful and unbridled sexual excesses that he faces. Thus, in this respect, the film is not a powerful message and makes you wonder what the final result was.
