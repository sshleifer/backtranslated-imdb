Being a huge fan of Monkey Island, I thought it would be terrible, since Ron Gilbert did not. The boy was surprised! Although he is still not as good as the first two, there is a comedy in it that I wanted. I was a little nervous about the new graphics, the new SCUMM engine and just the fact that it was on a CD. But it all came together, and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters. I especially liked the return of the WOMAN'S FIGHT. And the whole story with the search for a large undeclared ring was just incredible. Try and try this adventure with two CDs. And now we can rejoice, because Monkey Island 4: Escape from Monkey Island is coming out very soon! This autumn!
