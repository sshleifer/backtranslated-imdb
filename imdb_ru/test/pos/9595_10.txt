As the reviewer has already commented, this television comedy is one of the best football parodies. But ... having failed to make a video when it first aired, I now found that it was not in any format. Good, so at the moment only 17 votes have been gained, but the average of 9+ seems to offer something special. In fact, I believe that this is a case of failure if you missed it, because it is no longer available for viewing !! Aaaaaaaargh.
