This film, of course, was not very difficult. No, humor was actually pretty stupid when I think about it. But, although I thought about it, I laughed - to prove that a decent comedy should not be very deep. <br /> <br /> Fatty Arbuckle is a definite star of this short film, despite the appearance of Buster Keaton film too. He is a butcher in a vintage grocery store. There were a lot of nonsense things in the store, and I think Iâ€™ve been laughing the most about the grinder sequence - you just need to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> In any case, Fatty's girlfriend is later forced to go to the girls' school, and because he cannot part, he puts on a drag and gets into the school. Arbuckle is one ugly woman! So for silly and innocent fun, watch this movie. It will not change your life, and this is a very small picture, but it is also fun.
