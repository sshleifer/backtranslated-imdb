Keys to VIP, the original series from the Canadian Comedy Network (comedynetwork.ca), has gained a lot of popularity thanks to this exciting but inspiring game show. This show is led by four funny, cute guys who judge others by their "game" (the ability to select women). In each episode there are two guys who fight each other in various pick-up games. There are three different sections, and the winner spends the night as a VIP in an exclusive Toronto nightclub. <br /> <br /> As a guy, I naturally find this show fun. We all know that itâ€™s hard to resist women, and seeing how these guys do it naturally arouses the curiosity of men. The guys who compete in this show may even give you some tips - if you pay attention.
