“The good news” is that the circus is in town. “Bad News” is what is right above the underground house of Bugs Bunny. He wakes up when his place shakes, as if from an earthquake, when workers are pounding the ground, stomping elephants, etc. <br /> <br /> More precisely, the lion cage is located exactly above the beetles. hole. Leo sniffs the food, and as it is eliminated, he finds out that this is a rabbit. The beetles, curious about what the whole racket is about, meander in the tunnel and pour in the lion's mouth. <br /> <br /> I will say something for B. B.: he is absolutely fearless, at least in this cartoon, and at least for 30 seconds. When he comes to himself, he runs away like a madman, and until the end we are fighting the battle “lion vs. rabbit”. Once again, Bugs encounters a blunt adversary, whom he calls "Nero", but Leo is fierce, and Bugs will need all his mind and a little fake bravado to fight off this beast. <br /> <br /> About half the jokes are stupid, and the other half is ridiculous, but always fast, colorful and good enough to recommend. I mean, not every day you can see a lion on a trapeze or dance hula!
