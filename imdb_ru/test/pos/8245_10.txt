In my opinion, the film is an excellent example of the realities of war and a tribute to the memory of soldiers of all nations who fought and shed their blood in the soil of Gallipoli. The absence of violence in no way detracts from the scale of the tale in the hands. It is honest, true and courageous, just like the people who fought and died on the Hellespont. The absence of brutal images of violence is true and correct. These people have suffered enough for freedom, freedom and the right to self-determination in a free and better world. They never wanted to ever see such a scene again. This is the legacy of the Gallipoli event. It is best not to show how to suffer from the causeless pyrotechnics scene, blood and blood in order to maintain proper respect for the fighters of this crucible of statehood. <br /> <br /> This film is famous for the magnificence of people fighting for their strength. lives with honor, courage, dignity and irrepressible spirit and humor in the face of terrible misfortune. This film is not interested in creating a spectacle for fools. The brutal outcomes that occurred as a result of these personal battles with these people are not at all those that the survivors ever wanted to see on the screen for entertainment. They saw enough of it at that time, and, most likely, at first they would never see it, and never again wanted to revise such scenes on the screen in the name of “entertainment”. The cruel horrors of the facts of the cruel battle that took place in Gallipoli were scenes that pursued their waking and sleeping hours to the end of their natural days. These were painful internal scars, which they, people of all those peoples who fought, carried to their graves. They all fought, and many died in the face of all of this, and somehow they, these powerful people, managed to laugh at the teeth of constant horrible death, because they would not insult their comrades without being ready to die next to them. This is an Australian language for the brave, the game is there, but it applies to all fighters to a greater or lesser extent, but the word from the one who fought was that Johnny Turk was the same game as the brave you ever wanted to be a soldier. <br /> <br /> ANZAC and Turks fought to take their place on the world stage, and from 25/04/15 their respective claims for equality among nationalities became known and indisputable for this world. The director made a masterpiece that truly honors the spirit and memory of these soldiers and serves as a reminder to future generations of all ages, since children can be taken without fear of frightening them for the sake of visual “horror”, and this is a painful and meaningless appeal. And children should attend this film to find out what happened on this sacred shore before they were born. So they can remember. Because it is the nature of people that they will soon forget.
