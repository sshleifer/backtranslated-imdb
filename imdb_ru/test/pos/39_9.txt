Since I first met the Divine Miss Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee's film “She Must Have It,” I was sold in the play of this extremely gifted but terribly undervalued actress. She received an Emmy for her image here, and to say that it is well deserved, is a masterpiece of understatement. <br /> <br /> Here she simply shines as the MOST guiding force and hand in her community. It was especially painful for me, because I grew up in the same period of time. The details of the production were phenomenal and caused amazing memories of the life and times of the 1950s and 1960s and of women like Mrs. Merkerson. She was thoroughly and skillfully accompanied by a hot, hot cast with performances that can be enjoyed again and again. I first saw the name Macy Gray in the credits and began to bully. Her performance was so good that I didn't even recognize her until about a third of the way. I am particularly proud of the obvious thoroughness and attention to detail in order to create a sense of another beautiful era in African-American culture that is tasteful. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial structure of time, but infinitely more attuned to the wealth of the characters and the emotional diversity that they provide to illustrate what ultimately is about the choices we make and to what extent we take responsibility for the choices. <br /> <br /> This is a dignified, elegant representation of African American life, which is undoubtedly destined to become a classic. You must do this as part of your collection. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend.
