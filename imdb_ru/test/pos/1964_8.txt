This film is one of the best of 1986 with terrible, but intriguing performances of Crispin Glover and Dennis Hopper! The Reagan years were pretty bleak for many people, not just for teenagers, but this click really captured despair and despair. Directed by a well-written script (obviously based on real events), I do not see any weak points in this. The launch shot was great. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves was decent for a change, and Miss Sky was right for the money. In the same year, Hopper had three other great performances (Blue Velvet, Texas Chainsaw II, and Husiers). I believe that the cult followed, and I wonder how this picture will look if it is republished. Great things!
