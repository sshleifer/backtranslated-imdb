The problem with so many people watching this film is that they watch it. People come to see the horror film B-Grade or the film "So bad, it's good." Jack Frost 2 - none of them. <br /> <br /> Simply put, a very good movie, cleverly hidden in a very bad one. To consider this as something other than a comedy-talker (easily funnier than all three absolutely useless “Scary Movies” combined) is to misinterpret the film at a basic level. It is like watching “Shoushenk Redemption,” and then complaining that there were no explosions. <br /> <br /> The essence is simple; Characters from the first film, pursued by memories of Jack Frost, go on vacation on a tropical island. They are followed by a new, improved Jack, now essentially possessing Hydroman's powers from Spider-Man; in fact, he can easily and quickly turn from water into snow, divide himself, multiply, and, worst of all, he managed to grow immunity to his only former weakness ... AntiFreeze. <br /> <br /> What is sad about this movie is that the fans of the dead brain of the first Jack Frost (just a horrible movie) cannot appreciate the change in tone to continue. Just as Alien was a horror film, and Aliens was dedicated to action movies, Jack Frost was a weak attempt to catch a horror trick, and Jack Frost 2 was a cleverly written parody of the horror trick genre. <br /> <br /> Most of the entertainment Come live actors who serve excellently. Especially amusing among them are Ray Tuni (playing a caricature of a retired British colonel from the early 1900s), Christopher Alport (offering a crazy, hilarious spin on his wooden performance from the first film), and David Allen Brooks (taking the once-serious new, completely strange heights). <br /> <br /> The lack of “memorable quotes” bothers me. <br /> <br /> Like a horror movie, Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman, evaluates zero. But you must understand that this is not a horror movie.
