Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One) gives us an exciting film where awards are presented to supporting actor John Malkovich. His criminal attempt to kill the president was impartial and trustworthy. <br /> <br /> This does not diminish the efforts of Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo or even Fred Dalton Thompson, who really plays White. House chief of staff. Eastwood was great, and I like any film that features Rousseau. <br /> <br /> The film uses original music by five-time Oscar winner (Malena, Bugsy, The Untouchables, Mission, Days of the Sky) by Ennio Morricone. This alone is worth your time.
