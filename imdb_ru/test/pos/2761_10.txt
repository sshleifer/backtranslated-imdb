Graphics are far from the best part of the game. This is the best TH game in the series. Near the subway. It deserves a strong love. This is a crazy game. There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters ... it's just a massive game. Spend your money on this game. This is the money that wasted. And although the graphics sucks, it does not make the game good. Actually the graphics were good at that time. Today's graphics are crap. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? As they say in Canada, this is a fun game, yes. (You can go to Canada in THPS3) Well, I don't know if they say that, but they could. who knows. Well, Canadian people do. Wait, I'm leaving the topic. This game is swinging. Buy, play, enjoy, love. This is pure brilliance.
