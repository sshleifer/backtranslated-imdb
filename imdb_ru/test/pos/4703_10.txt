I went to see SISTER HELEN at the Sundance Film Festival and didn’t know what to expect. <br /> <br /> People who were chained to this documentary. Helen's sister is an incredible character !!! The filmmakers captured the essence of Helen’s sister’s amazing soul and brought me into the world of the unknown. I was completely satisfied with the trip and was completely taken aback by the end of this film. <br /> <br /> This film tells those who want to get a second chance in life.
