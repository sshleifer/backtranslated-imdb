The legend of Custer, a la "Warner Brothers Epic". There are no spells against the type, with the bright Flynn in the role of the bright Custer in this defiant tribute not only to Custer, but to the people of the 7th Cavalry. The story traces the life of the famous "General Boy" from his stormy days at West Point to his last battle in the Little Big Horn. Great liberties are taken with the facts here, and Caster is presented to us, who is much more sympathetic to the plight of the red man than the story. But this was done on such a grand scale, the battle scenes alone provided work for each additional in Hollywood. Finishing the blow down and that's it, it's very fun!
