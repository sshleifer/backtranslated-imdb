Beautiful, magical, thought-provoking and touching story. Excellent direction, great cast, great script, excellent score, beautifully lit ...... Do you need to say more? <br /> <br /> If you like movies that not only make you think, but also warm your heart this spring, “Contact”, “Field of Dreams” and “Groundhog Day” come to mind), then you will surely love -PAX. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
