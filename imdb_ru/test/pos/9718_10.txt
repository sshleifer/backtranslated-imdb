Jim Henson always seemed to produce great television shows. This was, unfortunately, one of the most short-lived. It was nice to hear every fairy tale with their delightful morality. Each episode was a new story, with new characters. John Hurt played great in The Storyteller, and Brian Hensonâ€™s sarcastic tone as a dog was always pleasant. <br /> <br /> Stage design and costumes were very well executed. The Muppet job, when required, is the classic work of Jim Henson. You know that this is Muppet, but he looks prettier than he forgives. You were fascinated and forced. When each episode comes to an end, you realize that you were very entertained. Fun, which performs, not one that is erased in a few moments. You sit back and think about every episode, realizing that every story is really timeless and a powerful story about morality. <br /> <br /> I have yet to show it to my children, but this is really a series that is more than family entertainment. I beg you to find it on DVD and snatch it. If you can't do it, just find it as.
