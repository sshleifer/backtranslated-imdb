Sparkling movie. BB is a miracle. She is sultry. She is a feminist. She still loves very much. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the Paris of the 50s. Great to look at sites, cars (DS!) And Orly. <br /> <br /> A simple but very pleasant romantic comedy. The music is terrible. It is almost dissonant. On the other hand, it is fun. But this is probably the only thing that is wrong, at least to look at it through the eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The film tells how the French treat treason. It is this feeling that is contemporary. The film, similar to the film "Elephant", made it in the style of the 80s. But the basic premise remains the same. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the creators for providing BB this opportunity.
