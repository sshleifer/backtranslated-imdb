Good movie, great story, great characters, I really liked it, enough to buy a DVD when it comes out. <br /> <br /> The real story she tells is more exciting and exciting than anything that fiction writers could think of. A friend of mine working in the media business said that they should not show such insider deals, this gives the company a bad reputation. <br /> <br /> But there are several problems with DVDs: first, the sound volume is terribly low, so you need to turn up the TV volume to watch it. I noticed that this is also the case when HBO launches it, so in the original working copy. Secondly, the left side of the video is cropped during the first five minutes, that is, the picture is cropped about one inch less than the left side. After five minutes, he fills the screen correctly, from left to right. This kind of careless technical production is very amateur, and I donâ€™t know why the director and producer let this careless look slip away. <br /> <br /> And yet, even with technical flaws, this is a pleasant story, one of the best in HBO. I think.
