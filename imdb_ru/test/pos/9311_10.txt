It was a very fun, fast-paced movie. I watched it more than once and kept renting it to show others. I would just like to take this opportunity to ask anyone who knows how HK producers choose their subtitle translators? I'm very curious. Please direct me. <br /> <br /> Again, to return to the review, this is really a noisy film with a lot of content, subtleties resembling classics, albeit full of farce. Reminds, say, Mexican comedies Cantinflas. <br /> <br /> The film does not disappoint director's fans, who have noticed that he clearly chooses Chinese themes, trying to get to the rarely studied characteristics. The entire collection of the director is a way to discern culture in a disarming way. <br /> <br /> And I do not understand how his ridiculous girl on a Chinese holiday can be surpassed.
