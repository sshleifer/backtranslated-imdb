This is probably my favorite TV show. I love all the characters, especially Alex, who is the perfect woman! Always make me laugh and feel good when I watch this show. There is something amazing in this, it is difficult to describe. <br /> <br /> It seems that some or all of the episodes are also synced with music albums. Here are some examples. (Episodes begin again when they end - but do NOT play the end credits to the very end, but always play the opening credits. In most episodes, the album is played once and the episodes are played twice, but some continue.) RADIOHEAD, PINK FLOYD, BOB Dylan. <br /> <br /> 2.02 'Double Bogey' Kid A / OK Computer (episode plays at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> 2.14 Kid "Saturn" A / Meddle / Shot Of Love <br / > <br /> 2.19 Baby “The World Without Alex” A / Wish You are Here / Pablo Honey (episode plays at least 4 times) <br /> <br /> There are prompts in the episodes that tell you which albums are synchronized . Baby A can sync with EVERY episode!
