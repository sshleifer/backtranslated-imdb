The story told by “The Cranes Are Flying” is admittedly not so original. Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both. We have seen this many times before. <br /> <br /> However, we did not see it filmed so well, with bold images that would allow ourselves to emphasize division, destruction, or hopelessness. Even more remarkable is the native of the Soviet Union and the reason for the conclusion that Tarkovsky is not the last word in the Soviet cinema of the modern era. <br /> <br /> The other day I was reading Chekhov's Three Sisters and by chance on what the meaning of the title of this film might be. In the second act, Masha objects to the fact that we should live our life without meaning or understanding: <br /> <br /> “MASHA: Of course, humanity must believe in something, or at least seek truth, otherwise life just Emptiness, Emptiness. To live and not to know why cranes fly, why children are born, why there are stars in the sky. Either you should know why you live, or everything is trivial - just nonsense nonsense. ” br /> <br /> Similarly, Veronica finds it difficult to believe that the war and its suffering, as well as the suffering of other people, was meaningless. It is better to appropriate the meaning, to live as if life is important, and not to succumb to despair. Perhaps it is this thinking that leads her to the final action in the film. <br /> <br /> By the way, as a minor correction to another comment here, sample V may be in the film, although I didn’t have myself noticed them. But the first letter of the name Veronica is not a further example of this; in Cyrillic, her name begins with a letter that looks like the English letter "B".
