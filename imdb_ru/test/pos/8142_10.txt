After spending five years in prison, Dr. Thomas Reed, played by the incomparable Vincent Ventresque, banished himself to the Purgatory House and eventually engaged in bar service. Soon he meets a juicy angel with the face of an angel (Alexandra Holden). "You are evil." he tells her. "You have no ideas." she replies, sipping a weak screw and sluggishly pulling on a cigarette. Reed is entangled in the cruel ills of her family, and the story of a femme fatale is set against the backdrop of the desolation and despair of the oil-ravaged western city. <br /> <br /> Insightful direction. Great performances. Excellent entourage work. And some scenes of lust that sizzle like the sun in Purgatory.
