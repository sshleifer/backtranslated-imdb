Just saw this movie in Australia on the satellite. Since last week I avoided more news coming from the United States from the United States, about action films, well, frankly, this film is a treasure. Great bravo for all participants. I had only a small idea that the film entailed, as is most often the case for a good effect, and this, of course, came up with the cinematographic goods. The stage setting is effective in the direct sense of the word with all the hairy rival subjects of the modern world in relation to their own vacillating family, even if it is a suburban one. The first forty minutes set up such a professional theater, I was not ready for a loud laugh when they came. Although the cathartic moment created with the help of comedy and character, like family and neighbors, connected in an extraordinary way. <br /> <br /> In general, the prediction of who and what we are. The most significant film that you definitely need to watch. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the date of this review.
