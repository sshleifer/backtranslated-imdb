The working title was: "Do not spank, baby." <br /> <br /> Wayne Crawford became a successful producer of films such as The Girl from the Valley, The Comet Night, and others, despite the fact that he was not too good at this little gem. And the little-known Abe Zwick was supposed to get tons of work from this film, but he didn't get it. Filmed at Moberly Studios in Hollywood, Florida, early Tarzan films were shot at the same place. This film is definitely for those who appreciate abstractness. Initially, the film was shot with some nudity and much more graphic slashers. For reasons known only to director Tom Casey, the scenes of the bloody slisher were given an LSD tab, and the nudity was removed. Despite the fact that this version is worthy of attention of those who are so inclined, in my opinion, the original version would have collected everything necessary to make it full on Sulther 70's Cult Classic.
