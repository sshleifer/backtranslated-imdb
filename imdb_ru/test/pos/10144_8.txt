Unfortunately, because of the sluggish start, I can not say that this is one of the best films of Hitch. It is very good nonetheless. The film stars Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day as parents who find themselves involved in a political assassination plot and should try to return their kidnapped son. They both give excellent results, not surprising, of course. But in fact, what impressed me most was Hitchcoxâ€™s amazing use of music. The climax at the Opera House was fantastic, and the use of a live orchestra to create music and tension at the same time was pure genius. Absolutely fantastic waiting came out of this scene. In addition, Doris Day's use of "Que Sera, Sera" was excellent. Especially when it is transposed into scenes at the end of the film. Thus, this film ultimately became for me the best use of the music I have seen to date. Unfortunately, it was a slow start, or I might recommend this film a little more highly. Even then, it is still worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
