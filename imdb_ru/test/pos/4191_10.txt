This almost ignored masterpiece is that the Monkeys are aware that they are fictional characters in the film (“The Head”), and that everything they do or say is already written (invisible) in a script that they seem to follow. The head was written by Jack Nicholson, Rafelson and Peter Tork on a three-day LSD trip in a suite at an expensive Hollywood hotel. The remaining three Monkeys acted only in this. <br /> <br /> They are struggling with this in all possible ways, performing actions that are not part of the script. They deliberately scatter their lines, leave the scenery, tear apart the scenery, beat other actors for no reason; and eventually commit suicide by jumping from a bridge. <br /> <br /> For example, with quick flashes of a psychedelic party, if you watch frame-by-frame, you can see Rafelson sitting next to the camera and cameraman, very deliberately shooting at the mirror. It shows that the party is actually fake, and it is filmed in the studio with actors who suddenly lose their character and leave in the middle of a conversation when the director shouts “cut!” <br /> <br /> Monkeys, however, never fall out of character, because these characters are also who they really are. Ultimately this becomes the core of Revelation. <br /> <br /> At every step, they realize that their more and more bizarre actions were exactly what they were supposed to do in the script of the film, which they could not avoid in. Are you saying that they went crazy and went across the sky (which turns out to be painted on paper and hung from the ceiling as a background of the set)? No problems! Hey, hey, they are Monkeys, and these stupid guys just keep on monkey! <br /> <br /> In the end, even their death did not free them. So the film was supposed to end, and their still, swamped bodies were caught from the river, placed in another box, and put in stock at the studio until the characters are needed again for the production of another studio. <br /> <br /> This is made even more acute by the fact that Monkeys are really fictional characters that force themselves to enter the real world. They did it with the power of their music. <br /> <br /> Ironically, near the end, Peter Tork has what he rightly considers an extremely deep revelation that solves their problem, but, unfortunately, no one listens. <br /> <br /> Peter understands: “It doesn’t matter if we are in a box (film).” He means that it doesn’t matter whether free will or illusion, and that “the only important thing is that you just allow the present moment to happen and happen ... you should just allow“ now ”to BE, how it happens” without analyzing, evaluating or evaluating whether an experience is “justified” by some abstract definition. <br /> <br /> If you can’t even tell the difference whether to be free or not, it doesn’t matter if you bind to Find out if you are “real,” you are just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I saw this film at a very important moment in my life. I was trying to figure out how to avoid being just “this disgusting, creepy nerd girl,” thinking about it intensely, instead of just having fun (that is, having sex) like everyone else. But the revelation in Hede broke my recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson, Nicholson or Tork ever know. <br /> <br /> For decades I watched Head and I would like to thank Pete. . <br /> <br /> Was it a good movie? <br /> <br /> Uh, how about ... <br /> <br /> == <YES> ==
