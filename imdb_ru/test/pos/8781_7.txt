Cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes in search of the real criminal. Hitchcock's familiar theme of a person mistakenly accused of committing a crime is perfectly played out in this entertainment board, which has elements of “Thirty-Nine Steps” and “North to North-West”, although it is not as good as any of these classic things. There are several spectacular scenery, including the final on the Statue of Liberty. The plot is implausible and unpersuasive, and after a stunning start it seems that it is exhausted. Cummings is pleasant, if somewhat cruel in the lead. Lane is blonde, but not the cool kind of later director films. Supporting roles are usually well played.
