Great work by Mary Kay Place, Steve Sandvoss, Jacqueline Bissett and Rebekah Johnson. An excellent story that turns you into a film, emotional, but carefree. I have this film, and everyone I share with them loves it. Great for mixed company, 18+ people. <br /> <br /> Good production, not a cheap budget, well organized and keeping your interest. Uses new ideas of the dome, for memories, and at some point keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat. <br /> <br /> No matter from which sphere of life the viewer, he will buy one or several points of view in this film. <br /> <br /> I would really like to see a sequel!
