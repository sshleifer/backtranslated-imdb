I was so touched by this film in 1981 that I returned to the theater four times to see it again! Something I've never done for another movie. No film evokes feelings of growing up in the 60s, like Four Friends. The fact that it fit so closely with my own experiences of the 60s is probably what many will share. Why she did not become a major star after that, I will never know. The whole cast is impeccable, as is the script by Steve Tisha. I always wanted to know what part of the story was autobiographical. But alas, Steve is no longer here to answer this question. Iâ€™ve almost exhausted my VHS copy of this great movie! Highly recommended!
