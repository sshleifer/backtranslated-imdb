An interesting story and a sympathetic attitude towards racial discrimination. "Son of the Gods" is too long and contains some Hammy games, but overall remains a fascinating film. <br /> <br /> The story of the Chinese passing white (Rchard Bartelmess)) begins when Barthelmess leaves the college after being insulted by a trio of brainless accomplices. He sets off on a world tour to discover for himself, and eventually becomes the secretary of the British playwright (Claude King). In Monte Carlo, he meets the beautiful Alanna Wagner (Constance Bennett) and they fall in love. But when she discovers that he is Chinese, she becomes infuriated in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Tormented by feelings of guilt and love, Alanna enters the mental spiral and makes several attempts to connect with Bartelmess. After his father dies, he takes over the business (banking?) And puts on Chinese clothes as a symbol of his hatred of the White race, which rejected him. After a San Francisco detective tells him the truth about his birth, Bartelmess decides to honor his Chinese father and mother. <br /> <br /> And I agree that one reviewer here has never seen this film. Alanna declares his love for Sam BEFORE he tells her about his recent discovery. And that makes all the difference. <br /> <br /> Bartelmess and Bennett have several scenes in which they chew scenery, but overall this is a solid and interesting drama. Frank Albertson is good at college buddy, Claude King is the playwright of Bathurst, Besse Flowers has one scene as an Indian from Oklahoma, and Elin Warren is the father of China, Dorothy Matthews is nasty Alice. Not so good is Anders Randolph as Bennettâ€™s father and Mildred Van Dorn as Eileen. Also notice the gorgeous blonde to the right of Bartelmes at the roulette table. What an awesome girl!
