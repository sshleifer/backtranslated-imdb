Once I shot about 20 minutes of this movie on Turner's Classic Movies about 6 months ago. I thought that every minute of what I saw was gold, and since it was somewhere in the middle of the film, and I didn’t want to spoil everything, if I watched it from the very beginning, I decided that I would take it to rent. immediately. Well, the video store I visit often didn't have a copy, so it took me six months to finally go somewhere and rent it. Before that, I saw only some of Chaplin's shorts, funny, but not very tricky, but after I saw a fragment of “The Great Dictator”, I watched three of his other films: “City Lights”, “Gold Rush” and “Modern Times” (City). The lights were great, I found the Gold Rush a bit overpriced, but still worthwhile, and I found that Modern Times is one of the funniest films I've ever seen (the second one is the funniest, after Sherlock Jr. Keaton, more precisely). /> <br /> Finally, the whole Great Dictator. To be honest, it had its moments, both comedic and dramatic. But these moments are not always well combined. Chaplin’s comedy worked well when mixed with melodrama (City Lights is the best example of this), but it didn’t always work with social commentary. Plus, the fact that there was a dialogue diminished Chaplin's impressive talent. Don't get me wrong, I liked the film as a whole, but I thought it was not a big deal. I would give him a solid 7/10 on the rating scale .. if not for the final. The final speech delivered by a Jewish hairdresser is extremely strong. Yes, it is addressed to the provisional rules of 1940, but its message is completely applicable to the modern world. This speech brought me to tears, and I consider it one of the best ends I've ever seen. Final score: 8/10.
