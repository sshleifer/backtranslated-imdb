You know, I saw a lot of shitty Hong Kong films in terms of production and was good. But to run out of TIme was great. <br /> <br /> I think it was so good that Andy Lau and Ching Wan have such wonderful chemistry. The film is very fast at first, but it doesn’t slow down enough to even notice that it’s good too, we don’t want a heart attack, it’s laughing. From the point of view of the plot they are enough to interest you. Lau has some pretty good moments, as he uses makeup to impersonate people from the underworld. In addition, the film has the best Oriental cast since the House of Flying Daggers. <br /> <br /> The film is great because it is so unpredictable and makes you think at every corner. Definitely a good rental with tons of comedy, action and thrill in one, 8 out of 10
