If it were not for Kill a Mockingbird, this film would have been much more famous. If it were not for Gregory Peck as Addicus Fitch, acting would be much more commendable. If it were not for William Faulkner, perhaps “To Kill a Mockingbird” would never have been written in his shadow. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very sadly familiar, because it showed me that one of my favorite films, Kill a Mockingbird may not be as original as I always thought. Perhaps it was inspired by this very similar film. Oh, the "whodunnit" is different, but the main story, the lonely righteous "white" lawyer against the white southern city protecting the black man, is too familiar. And, written by a woman, a mockingbird concentrates on rape, the ultimate betrayal of a woman, while this film concentrates on a brother against hatred of his brother, rape, which a man experiences from fraternal treachery. <br /> <br /> No depth Mockingbird here. Not the comfort that Addicus brings with its presence. So you just left with sadness about whether she intended to remove the plot from this film or not, Harper Lee contemplates Mockingbird. Nothing has changed in those 10 years or so since she may have read Faulkner’s book and saw his film when he was in college in Alabama, and unknowingly or did not accept most of it as her own in subsequent years. Nothing has changed in race relations, and some may say that nothing has changed even now, many years later. <br /> <br /> This is too sadly familiar, and I want Addicus to appear in our day to be all right. While the mockingbird leaves you hoping for it, swaying in the arms of Addikus and waiting for the morning of better times, this film leaves you just sad that the pride of black people can match or surpass the pride of white people. But pride from any of them is not the answer at all. <br /> <br /> Rather, it is the answer of Addicus we need, the consolation is that we are all imperfect and that in our weakness we must show mercy, not pride, when we are faced with each Other in our differences.
