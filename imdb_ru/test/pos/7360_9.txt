I turned it on (from cable television) on a whim and was perceived quite unexpectedly ... although this film was very predictable and turned out to be quite pleasant ... no big stars, but well controlled and just fun. With all the excessively promoted nonsense, it is very pleasant from time to time to get an unexpected surprise ... and this little film perfectly meets all the requirements. 9/10
