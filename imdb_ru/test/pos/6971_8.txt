The first “personal” film by Francis Ford Coppola, completed and released in 1969, was the last film he shot as an unknown, beginning director before “The Godfather”, and contrasts sharply with both this film and the rest of its irregularities. career. This is supposedly a road film, in which a severed young woman participates, who is fed up with home life, and pregnant with a child, in which she is not sure what she wants, avoiding the pitfalls of her boring marriage and going on an open path in search of freedom. On the way, she made friends with a good man, a former football player who suffered a brain injury from a head injury, unexpectedly played by a young James Caan, and decides to “help” him, despite his disappointment in his simple ways. Her attempts to get rid of him always fail, either through fault or accident, and ultimately lead her directly into the hands of an emotionally wounded policeman (Robert Duvall) who has his own ideas. The plot is worn out, but Coppola does a great job of detailing the emotional life of these characters and uses editing techniques to convey a story that was not common in American films of the time. The frames are simple, but extremely effective, conveyed as the gloomy desolation of the open highway, and the emptiness of American life in the suburbs, permeated with delicate melancholy, secured by the film's score. Coppola also deserves praise for solving the problem of domestic discontent from the perspective of a woman in the culturally turbulent 60s. In general, a rather modest film, which is not at all what the audience expects from Coppola, but one that is a small triumph in its own quiet, modest form. 7.5 / 10.
