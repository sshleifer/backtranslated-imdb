Nightbreed blew my mind when I first saw it. And it has been doing pretty well for many years. Monster sets and effects work, are some of the best I've ever seen. None of those whom I know seems to have seen this film, which, I think, was shot at the box office due to the lack of interest in the horrors in the early nineties. It sounds like a dark, terrible tale, and much deeper than you might think, with a strong message against fanaticism, represented by the rich mystical past that Clive Barker created. What sucks is that the film ends with a really cool sequel, which we probably will never see. The only thing that worries me is that Craig Schaeffer is only a tolerable actor at best, and the project might have won with the best actor in this role. Just a minor complaint, although Schaeffer is all right. I had a similar problem with Scott Bakula in Barker's "Lord of Illusions", in fact, this is not a terrible performance, but I just did not like him in this role as much as other people.
