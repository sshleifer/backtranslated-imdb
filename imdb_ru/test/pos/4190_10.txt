The cinema of the 60s was the same time of revolution as politics and music. The filmmakers dared to shoot avant-garde films, which discussed the forbidden themes, allowed only in films about exploitation. Starting with both Respiratory and underground American cinema (for example, Kenneth Angers), films have become more and more experimental. All this has accumulated when Hollywood realized that they had a massive commercial appeal with Easy Rider. One of the best (and most amazing) results of this era was also one of the least successful initially. “Head” was made when the Monkeys career seriously declined, which is a damned one of the best psychedelic films ever made. <br /> <br /> Story? Well, in fact, not one, as many have said. This suggests that the Monkeys are moving from one surrealist scenario to the next. However, all these sequences are clearly colored in LSD and mostly scoff at how monkeys are tired of confining themselves to their light prefab reputations. It is a pity that the film did not find the audience. The babies who loved them switched to a new hobby, as always. The mob of psychedelics / Haight-Ashbury, for which the film was assembled, will never be caught off guard by the film "Monkeys". This is their loss. This film may be less plot, but it is certainly not devoid of meaning and very reasonably composed. The crew later made both "Easy Rider" and "Five Easy Pieces". The film was later reinstated at the Reibert retrospective in 1973, and he received a very positive response, which gave him a cult after he deserved a long time. Ironically, "Monkeys" will fall victim to the same commercialization that they protested in this film after the reunification of the 80s. (10/10)
