“The Man with the Golden Hand” was one of the first films, the main theme of which (and in some respects the message) was the tragedy of heroin addiction. This is not a great film, but its importance lies in the dedication of Otto Preminger, which makes him feel real, on the verge of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked was that it was not so much exposure of drug addicts (if you want to expose the read “Naked Lunch” best, if you can still get through it, except for the essence), but also the nature of the urban environment in which Frankie lives A machine. He expects that after he gets out of prison for the cause, he will go straight and narrow, become a drummer in the band and make him legitimate as a musician. But he has his “crippled” wife, Zosh, who cannot work and needs money and often complains, as well as an old neighborhood - he cannot avoid meeting Louis (Darren McGavin), who still plays card games in the ancillary indoors. and, yes, pushing the dope. Like the "Evil Streets", it is difficult to avoid trifles, if you do not leave. <br /> <br /> But again, Frankie Machine is hard not to try to act naturally in this city quarter. Simply, he cannot escape the temptation of rubbish (when he booked the accusation of a fake theft with his friend, he sees that the addict is going crazy, and this returns the fear of returning to his pure self). And Frankie’s personification is Sinatra, and I don’t see anyone who could play him, not even Brando’s original choice. He fits into the neighborhood and looks like a guy who needs to be one step ahead of the game. But there is a vulnerability for Sinatra, which he pulls out wonderfully, and by the time we see him riding a “cold turkey” in Molly’s apartment, it’s plausible, even if it’s not what people from “my” generation think about heroine (i.e. Trainspotting and, of course, Requiem for a Dream). If nothing else, you want to watch a movie to see what happens to Sinatra as this character. <br /> <br /> However, there are some drawbacks in some other performances, although it is a bit difficult. Eleanor Parker seems to replay most of the film, deceiving Frankie that she is really crippled, when in fact she can walk and deceive him for one reason or another. But then everything becomes clearer - it must be crazy and crazy with jealousy, and at this level it begins to recover. Meanwhile, Kim Novak is good, although not worthy of dizziness, as a possible girl aside, but more like the voice of reason in history. Then there is Detective Bendar, who may be one of the most visible characters / performances that ever existed. And also Sparrow, Frankie's boring friend, and Louis and Shifka characters, and they all played as expected (in fact, McGavin is better than OK). As for the imposition of other talents on Sinatra, Preminger is not so good. And, frankly, some scenes seem to be crumbling. <br /> <br /> But in the Man with the Golden Hand there is a lot of charm, and not just some obsolete piece of sociological interest. It works as a compelling drama, and as part of a message conveyed without being preaching or polite. This is a genuine article, just not exclusive.
