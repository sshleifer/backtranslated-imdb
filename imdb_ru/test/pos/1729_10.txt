Well, I grew up on Who, but I haven't loved the Doctor since the time of Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston again made me fall in love with Whom, and I would be angry with him forever for leaving. <br /> <br /> Scripture is great, acting excellence, directing (which was terrible in the old days) is fantastic. I was very skeptical about this program and watched it simply under duress, but now I am a big fan, and I like it (I have a ringtone with Dalek shouting “Disappear”). <br /> <br /> A few things that I like about the new program - 1) people really notice when Rose (Billie Piper) disappears from the planet. On some old shows, the assistant fell off for a while, and then returned home, as if nothing had happened, no one noticed. 2) Chris Eccleston's Doc loves Rose - romantic or not, this will be discussed, but there is no doubt that 9 loves and cares for his companion. He would have destroyed the world if he had to save her, which the old show lacked — often the doctor would not care if he never saw his assistants again. 3) They talk and think like real people - when Rose shows something outlandish or new (for example, aliens), she behaves like a real person - stunned. I never liked it when the assistant from the old show, who had never seen anything alien, just fit in and immediately adapted. I want to see Rose’s surprise on her face when she sees the plastic mannequin come to life. She gives it to me. <br /> <br /> A few things that I don’t like in this series: 1) almost everything happens on earth (in London or Cardiff), and I hoped for a more extraordinary show. 2) That Eccleston left so quickly, he really made the show brilliant. <br /> <br /> But I can let go of these few things — I like the show more than I ever expected, so I don’t mind if they have something on earth. <br /> <br /> Just do not take this show seriously - it's fun, it's smart, it's interesting, but it's not a very serious hard show. It is purely fun and purely British, and I cannot get enough. Watch it openly, just bring your brain to a neutral position and enjoy! <br /> <br /> ps - do not watch serial 2 or newer. episode 1 was brilliant, the first few episodes of episode 2 were good, but don’t watch it as soon as it gets into Love and Monsters. Perfect nonsense, completely ruins the show.
