This is a very amazing movie! The characters seemed so realistic to me that it was hard to believe that they were not real people. Being from the south, I thought that Judith Ivy's character seemed especially real, and, as everyone said, she does an outstanding acting job. The characters are not beautiful and not like ordinary Hollywood stars - their imperfect bodies and personalities seem much more natural and real. <br /> <br /> One reviewer mentioned that the main character, Alice, didn’t have a good reason to run away from home, and this is true - she didn’t have any moral or valid reason to run away, for example, to run away from child insults and etc. I thought she was just bored with stupid jobs in the life of the working class, and she wanted to flee to Florida, where her friend lived the attractive and privileged life of a college student in Miami. The actress shows that Alice’s confusion, insecurity and questioning turn into determination and willingness to take control of her life with impressive naturalness. The film also shows how Alice finds herself trapped in situations where there would seem to be no options that cause her to panic, act, and seek help. <br /> <br /> At first, the grainy style of filming pushed me away and made me think that it was a very budget or homemade film, but in fact it was very well done. The quality of home cinema really makes you feel close to the characters that is part of their journey across the country. This is definitely a movie that is worth seeing, although I don’t quite understand all of his descriptions as a spiritual story of adulthood. Sometimes it is rather vulgar and anxious, even if in the end it is not entirely sad.
