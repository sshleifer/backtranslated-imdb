Seeing Big Fat, I think Jason learned a lot more. When he told the truth about how Marty stole his story, it was like a boy who was crying a wolf. People heard him, but they did not believe him. No one did anything to help him. In addition, not only Martyâ€™s films stink, but also his advice. The truth is not overvalued. I am so glad that he exposed what he really is. Everyone learned that he stole from this boy, including his parents. Not only did he steal from this boy and lied about it, he gave them someone else's work and tried to call it his own, which is plagiarism. Doesn't he know that it is illegal to plagiarize someone's ideas? Another reason why he was fired. He is not credible. He is a liar, a deceiver, a thief, a crook and plagiarism. Did you get this martie? You are plagiarism Plus, you got everything you deserve.
