I looked at external reviews (Ebert, etc.) for this film, and all of them were largely negative. However, after reading many of them, I noticed that they all did the same thing. Critics were upset that the film talks about what seems like the senseless killing of an autistic child. Of course, this is a disturbing image. Critics, such as Ebert, want a traditional detective story that reveals the cause of the murder and directly blames the perpetrators. They want the charge to be dropped and resolved. Well, this status quo topic is a kind of parodying movie. Like society, critics wanted a very quick resolution so that they could move on to the next tragic opera. Perhaps there is no simple question to answer? There is much more to what has happened than what is on the surface. The film does not seek to explain what is happening, but rather to understand why. What also inspires me in these meaningless reviews is that all they look at during the performances is Spacey and Cheadle, who both were great (and generally are). But other great performances work here besides the two current icons of Hollywood. Gosling gives you incredible performance that only someone of his extreme talent can really give. Somehow, Gosling can cause sympathy for an autistic child killer. This is annoying to many, I'm sure. However, if you watch the movie, they will see Leland’s motives, it’s wrong, but it’s not evil. Malone is also on top of his game as another confused young character. In fact, the murder of a child in this film is not the main theme of the film. The main theme is life itself and how people cope with it, ups and downs, and how they sometimes try to help others cope with their lives (which, it seems, is not very good). There is a lot of good and evil in this world, and how we deal with each of them directly affects how much good and evil will be, and sometimes a confused attempt to do good can lead to even more evil. I think this is one of the most memorable films of late, and its ending is as touching as everything in recent cinema history. I firmly believe that people should watch this film with an open heart.
