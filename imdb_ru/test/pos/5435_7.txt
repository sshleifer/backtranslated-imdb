Robin Williams demonstrates his talented musicians and enhances his status as a comedian in this film “What's wrong with American politics and how Hollywood can try to make an impact without boring people.” Of course, Hollywood uses films with hidden or not so hidden agendas. I think this film is for people who like to get up and political discussions. And the trailers of this film were for everyone to be sure that as many people as possible would see. Everyone knows that Hollywood is more liberal / democratic than Bush & Co., so they have to make these films from time to time ... but this film was probably too obvious, at least I thought so for any real changes. <br /> However, the excellent state of affairs and fresh political issues and conversations ... I liked it, and thanks to the IMDb.com ratings I was pleasantly surprised when I left the cinema, and yes, I laughed many times. Sometimes you just need to leave everything as it is and forget all seriousness ... watch this movie if you like a good and clever fight or politics, and you will not be offended by several references to the fact that things are going bad now. Rent it if it doesn’t fit you.
