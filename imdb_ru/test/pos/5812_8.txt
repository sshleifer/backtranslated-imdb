It was my first look at this short-lived British horror series on television, but I saw a couple of Hummer horror films (“The Terror of Dracula”, “Captain Kronos: The Vampire Hunter”) and thought about them enough to look at them <. br /> <br /> This first episode was a shock - not for horror, but for the entire nude. Was this a “regular” TV in England in 1980? If so, it showed a lot more skin than what we see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing nude women and their breasts, one scene in which a guy put his hand on one and the other scene where a man depicted the top of a woman’s sexual intercourse. Hey, I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The story is simple: a witch who disappeared in the 17th century returns to her old home and makes life for a married man difficult. The latter, John Finch in the role of “David Winter,” was not an actor, but his wife was not a bad and really beautiful woman. She was Prunella Gee as "Mary." The husband suspected her, quite rightly, that she had an affair, and this played a part in this story. <br /> <br /> Patricia Quinn was a funny witch called "Lucinda Jessup" who returns with malicious intent to her and has a good time torturing a couple until everything goes wrong at the end. As a man, I would say that it was especially fun to see two women go for it! It starts slowly, but as soon as Lucinda starts to worry, it becomes very interesting.
