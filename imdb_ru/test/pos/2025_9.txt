I was very happy to see Rock Star, because I'm a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. I was surprised that I liked it more than I thought. The script really left much to be desired, but the film’s performances made up for it. There were a few moments when the visions of Spinal Tap returned, and I can't help but think that this film would be even better as a driving force. But I digress. <br /> <br /> Valberg continues to demonstrate his talent by playing with the believability of an ordinary guy whose biggest dream has come true. He does this with surprise and innocence, which make you not only believe him, but also make you really care about his character. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston, who still hasn't impressed me in films, is amazingly good as a friend / manager. She shows more real emotions than I have seen in her last few films combined. <br /> <br /> But above all, it’s the music in this film that really attracts you. Dotted with 80s melodies (let's face it) - Bon Jovi will have 80s music lovers swaying in his place) the film is really amazing with Original Steel Dragon songs and Wahlberg playing them. <br /> <br /> I plan to see this film again, but first I am going to jump out and buy a soundtrack!
