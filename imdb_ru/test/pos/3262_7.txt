This Australian film, shot in 1999, does an excellent job of portraying a group of petty crooks in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young potential criminal, whose life is in danger after unsuccessful work for his future boss. Heath Ledger and Brian Brown played very well. The plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene that revolves around a bank robbery. The creation of various themes that are central to the story has been done quite well. For example. When one criminal searches for bullets for his gun. Personally, I do not like gratuitous violence in the movies, and in this regard, the film did not hurt. It tried and managed to show us the human side of villains such as Brian Brown. The rest of the cast did a good job, without any real differences that I remember. The direction was very good in making a believable film that provided good entertainment. The main feature that makes this good film is Heath Ledgerâ€™s action and leadership and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short-term satisfaction, thinking that he is invulnerable and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to pounce an error. Directed by Gregor Jordan deserves special mention. The rating in my book is 7 (out of 10).
