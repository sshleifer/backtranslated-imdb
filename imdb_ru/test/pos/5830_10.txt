I admit that I almost gave up watching television shows. What for? Because most of them are about doctors, forensic scientists or some girl / boy who can predict a murder while sitting on the toilet. But I have to say that I was wrong when I watched the first episode of "Oz", one of the most exciting shows on TV until today. “Oz” is a show about the safest prison, which shows episodes from the life of every cellmate in prison and their frustration. What I like about this show is the fact that he has the courage to show real life in prison without any annoying characters, stereotypes and unrealistic dialogues. Even if the heroes of the show should not be heroes, you quickly became attached to them and their lives. Of course, this show has a lot of violence and some disturbing images of rape and drug use, but this is the essence of this show; imagine how cruel and disappointing life in prison can be ... damn, you can't show life in prison like a “clean environment” with “cute characters”, right? Oz is perfect in all respects, the actors do an excellent job, and the whole hour of this show goes very fast. The only thing I didn’t like about this show was the last season of the show, I think it became too strange and cruel, and the final was not satisfactory. But overall, Oz still remains my favorite show on television, it surpasses the Soprano and the million CSI and the crap of Dr. House with only the main title. A brilliant show in which there are balls to show that other shows rob us; realism.
