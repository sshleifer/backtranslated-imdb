I just want to say that the role of Chris Diamantopoulos as Williams for the whole show was a decent Emmy. It was strange how well he did. And to be as fast, casual and creative as Robin Williams really is ... WOW. There were scenes in which Diamantopoulos had to pronounce about 20 fast fiery lines and make 15 different characters when delivering these lines, and it all sounds like Robin Williams playing these characters ... well, my friends play impressively. It's one thing to make a parody of Robin Williams for a couple of minutes. This is another way to do this for an entire television movie. <br /> <br /> I don’t know how I felt about the whole show, and I don’t know how much they played with the facts, but I know that Chris Diamantopoulos was watching me. So for that, I give him 10.
