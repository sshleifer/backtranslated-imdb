I first saw this film as a younger child. My sister told me about it, and I thought it would be more of a children's film. However, it remains an incredible film. It is true that the theme of the film is rough, but the truth is, this film will never stop touching your heart. <br /> <br /> I was only 6 years old when I first saw him, and only yesterday, 7 years later, I saw him again, For the first time in a long time. Even after I learned how it ended, I realized that I had seen it a billion, almost a billion times when I cried like a small, small child. When I saw it a few years ago, I finally understood the idea and the seriousness of the film. So I stopped watching this for a while. But yesterday I did not change the channel, I watched it. By the end, I was amazed at how much it made me laugh, cry, think and, above all, believe in the merikals again. I did not believe for a long time, and this film knocked me out of the rut and opened my heart. This film was not just spectacular. I was so impressed with the actors. Especially Bobby. So, if you want to see this movie for the first time, I suggest watching it alone. With fabrics. And be ready to open your young, sweet, innocent side and the side that still has hope. This film touched my soul when I was only 6 years old, and even while I was trying to understand who I was, this film helped me realize that I donâ€™t do it and still want to be in life.
