This is a great movie for the whole family. I do not think that many people have seen this, because I ask people, and they say that they have never heard of it before. Sophie Heiman - my aunt's daughter in law. my favorite scene is the whole movie, I can't even choose my favorite scene. My favorite character is Hubert, because he is a funny, but intelligent dog. if someone hasn't seen it, they miss a big adventure. I only saw this because my aunt was connected to Sophie, and she received a copy from her. if someone reads this, I suggest buying a film, and I guaranteed that it would not be a bad decision. I saw this film about five times, and every time he gives me the same message, dogs are as smart as people just give them a chance.
