"Phantom walks" is a graceful little mystery with a magnificent turn, quick dialogue and, most importantly, pansies played in a dandy-style actor Johnny Arthur, who never humiliates and humiliates his character. Mr. Arthur is great in his role as Homer Erskine, bringing great comic relief as secretary to the Broadway producer Herman Wood, played by other great character actor Richard Karl. <br /> <br /> They play great against each other. <br /> <br /> Although acceptable words of the time are used to describe the character of Homer, in which “Sissy” and “Cream puff” are used, they never mean mean spirit or mean slander, and they are not spoken by courageous men of the film, but from his employer, who dismisses him and excites him in every other scene, and who shows an almost irritated affection for his faithful employee. <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful scene where Homer tells his boss that he devoted the best years of his life to him and was for him everything except his mother. <br /> <br /> The mysterious corner of the film is very interesting, and the turn at the end can just leave you in the seams. <br /> For a low-cost picture of poverty, this film has a magnificent scenery decoration and a magnificent costume. <br /> <br /> Direc Frank Streier copes with his actors skilfully, and this film holds together much better than some of his other low-budget riddles, but he had a great script for the job and some great actors to perform it. <br /> <br /> This film is a must-see for fans of films about poverty, old riddles of a dark house (they really managed to work in the lines “It was a dark and stormy night”), and it has the added bonus of a gay character . in a movie where nothing bad happens to them in the end. <br /> <br /> This film is available for download in the public section of the film in the online archive at archive.org.
