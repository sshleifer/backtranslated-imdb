Not a movie to see if you want to be intellectually stimulated. If you want to have fun in the theater, then this is one of them. Lots of brisk banter (and some really wacky banter, too). Mos Def and Seth Green are very funny, like comic relief. Exciting and creative robberies and chase scenes. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron (sexually) are attractive leaders. And Donald Sutherland!
