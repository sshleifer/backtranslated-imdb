And I do. Peter Falk has created a role that will live forever on television! And I am grateful for that. Although it is not one of his best watches. Colombo is in college and basically teaches how he uncovers a crime, and yet there are bad guys who think they are smarter than him. We all fans know that Colombo needs a worthy opponent. Without a great enemy, how can he be a hero in a wrinkled coat? However, this is better than NO Colombo, and I will wait and see the next one.
