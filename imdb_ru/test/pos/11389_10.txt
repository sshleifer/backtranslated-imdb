Altman and Scorsese have had sex in one of the greatest American films of the past 20 years. The Boogie Nights didn’t produce a big initial surge, and I still don’t think I got the credit it deserves. The immediate hype around the movie (“Some Porn Movies from Marky Mark”) was completely unfounded. What Paul Anderson created is nothing short of a terrific view of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the American dream (if such a thing still exists). <br /> <br /> For those of you who have lived in the Box (or confessional) for the past 8 years, Boogie Nights tells the literal story of the rise and fall of young Eddie Adams (Wahlberg). Eddie is a stupefied guy from Torrance, California, who wants something more out of life. His room is saturated with muscular, naive America. His dreams are much greater than his potential, but not as great as his ... special gift. His bald southern gentleman quickly raises his attention and surprises the boom, the ubiquitous adult film industry. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds, like a pretty dad with shining eyes) finds out about Eddie's hidden talent and decides to play him in a movie. <br /> <br /> Before he took a deep sip, Eddie changed his name to Dirk Diggler, and he opened his eyes wide to the general public. Fame and good fortune to meet Dirk, like a bevy of local porn celebrities. His friends and colleagues become his improvised family, but she soon turns into a Sunday picnic like no other. While pleasant to the touch 70s give way to coke, video-friendly 80th, Dirk & Co. begins a dangerous retreat. <br /> <br /> Anderson put everything he had into this glorious, touching epic. It hisses and never hisses. None of the frames of this monumental picture is lost, and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after the ELO disappears from the soundtrack. Watch it immediately. And then look at it again. <br /> <br /> And again.
