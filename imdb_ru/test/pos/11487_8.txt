It was sad that COMMITTED only lasted two weeks in the theaters of Dallas. I thought this movie has a lot of things. The script was funny, full of subtle emotional shifts, and there was a good message in it. The game was great. Everyone did an excellent job, especially with the subtleties of the script. Heather Graham not only has beautiful eyes, she has * expressive * eyes. In this respect, all the actors were attractive! I don’t know why it didn’t work in his theatrical release - there wasn’t a big push except the studio. But it deserves to be better, and I hope it is good on the video. This is definitely one of my favorites in the first half of 2000.
