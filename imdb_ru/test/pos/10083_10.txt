It is head and shoulders above other films of this genre: sincerely tense, intelligent, brilliantly played and visually stunning. Yes, the plot can be confusing - but in part this makes it so successful. See it twice if you can. You will get almost as much from watching this movie when you learn this turn than from the first viewing. <br /> <br /> There is no need to postpone the fact that this film is from Korea, a country that is not very familiar to the majority of Western audiences. While there are elements of the film that are culturally specific, the main themes are too universal - guilt, anger, loss, madness and retribution. Lim Soo-joon copes with all this as Soo-mi, the main character. Also deserves special mention Yum Jung-ah, who as a stepmother shows a very creepy and disturbing performance. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it has its own scary moments, in fact this is not a terrible film, as many can imagine. It is rather a psychological disturbing story with an element of mystery. He captures you from the very beginning and will make you guess to the end - and, perhaps, further!
