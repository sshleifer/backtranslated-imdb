I just finished a two-day evening "American werewolf" in London and Paris. Let me start by saying that “London” is still in force after all these years, and the transformation sequence is impressive by any standards, the film was funny and frightening, also a bit bloody ... Now let's move on to “Paris” it is nice, somewhat scars, a lot of blood, not as exciting or creepy as the original, but she has a little laugh at what has become fashionable these days in movies, so maybe in that sense it was ahead of its time, transforming everything. ” CGI, although good for its technology Meni, not nearly as impressive as the original. I gave this movie 7 because I have to admit that it was pleasant, I laughed a lot and found that Tom Everett Scott is so stupid that at first I wanted to dislike his performance only to end up like him ... go figure it out .. Julie Delpi was competent in the direction in which the script lacked brilliance and sophistication. I read here that John Landis should have pointed to the bad, he is not sure, I am quite sure that it would be a completely different film. I also noticed some discussion of the sequel “What if”, but no one noticed, obviously, it should be American-style, but my name is “American werewolf returns home” or in Washington, which would be fun if all this political dogs needed a good fright. You just have to see the original in its new DVD transfer with Dolby 5.1 sound and see both of them on HDTV with up-conversion turned on ... nice !!!!
