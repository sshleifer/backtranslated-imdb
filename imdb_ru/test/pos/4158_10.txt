I just had the opportunity to see “Nuovomondo” (hitherto known in the United States as the “Golden Door”), and was very impressed with both the dreamy and sometimes surrealistic story about a family that immigrates from Sicily to the United States in the first days. 20th century. He also worked as a (commonly known) middle finger, wedged in the eyeball of the Ministry of National Security (preferably up to the 3rd joint), portraying ill-treatment of foreigners who simply want a better life than they received from their original homeland. The (mostly) Italian cast, with some exceptions, works well. This is a quiet, understated film that is pleasant to watch (random, but with a taste used surrealism is always a pleasure), and the script is well written. This film is for those who are tired of the senseless escape from Hollywood, and serves a little more than selling popcorn (not that I had any acute problems with popcorn, mind you! I really love it). You would like to find the Nuovomondo / The Golden Door (or something else that is called in your area).
