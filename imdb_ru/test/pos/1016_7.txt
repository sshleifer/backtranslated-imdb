Distributor: GOODTIMES home video Plot <br /> <br /> Plot: Pretty high school student is marked by incessant horror in this tense atmosphere created for a television film. Gail Osborne - new in the city. She makes friends, she has a boyfriend, and it seems that everything goes on as usual. Until she receives an ominous and frightening phone call during the nanny. After all the new phone calls she was raped. for most of the film, she is trying to find evidence that the man had raped her. <br /> <br /> Audio / Video: This 1987 VHS edition of Goodtimes stinks. There are permanent lines at the top and bottom of the screen. <br /> <br /> Additional Information: no additions to the Goodtimes home video. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts. in 1978, so don't expect many deaths (there are none). If you can find this movie with the Worldvision home video logo on the front panel, buy it. But the Goodtimes version is pretty crappy. It may be a bit boring, but if you are patient, the ending is pretty good.
