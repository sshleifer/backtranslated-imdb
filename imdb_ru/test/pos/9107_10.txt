I've been waiting for this movie SO many years! The best part is that it corresponds to my visions! This is a must see for any Tenacious D fan or a real Jack Black. It's great to see JB, KG and Lee on the big screen! This is not a true story, but who cares. D is the best band on earth! I had a movie soundtrack last week and I listened to it without interruption. Watching the movie was pure bliss for me and my husband. We both met with Jack and Kyle after two different concerts of Tenacious D, and also saw them when they toured with Weezer. We left this concert after D finished playing. No one can lead their show! Long live D! : D
