This film in its current form is much shorter than it was released in 1918. In fact, it is now more accessible with Chaplin's two other silent, medium-sized functions (LIFE DOG and CRIME), which Chaplin reissued in the 1950s. In its time, SHOULDER ARMS was a hit, because it is humor in a unified approach. It's still very funny (Chaplin, disguised as a tree, spying on the Germans, is so funny that it is hysterical), but suffers from what is at his age. Charlie is dealing with World War I, an abominable conflict in which 20 million people died, but not the most terrible war (terrible to say) of the 20th century. Chaplin, too, would live to see this war and would forge its chief architects in the GREAT DICTATOR. But the latter is more accessible to the modern audience, because this film is a talking picture. In addition, Hitler as a target seems more important to the audience in 2008 than Kaiser Wilhelm II and his general staff. <br /> <br /> GOOD WEAPONS should have helped us draw up a plan for the vagabond, his training, his addiction to the trench war and his actual fight against the Huns on the Western Front. Much of this has already disappeared - one segment (when Albert Austin is the doctor examining Chaplin in his office in the draft center) still exists and was fully shown in the documentary film “UNKNOWN CHEPLIN”. This is unfortunate because the film now lasts about forty-five minutes, and there seems to be gaps in these scenes. What remains is first-class, but I want more ... and feel deceived. <br /> <br /> Sydney Chaplin and Henry Bergman succeed in supporting, especially Sydney as Wilhelm. He did this earlier, in a short conversation with Charlie about the sale of bonds, uttering a militaristic speech, before he was hit by a tramp with a huge hammer with the inscription “Military communications”). Here we see how the vagabond managed to capture Wilhelm and the general staff in prison. It was only at the head of Stan and Ollie, who captured the German army with a tank and barbed wire in PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that Chaplin did have a serious crisis as a result of his military actions. He was not a naturalized American — neither in 1917, nor in 1952, when Attorney General McGranery publicly announced that Chaplin could not return to the US because he was an enemy alien (Chaplin and his family were on a trip to Europe), Charlie settled in Switzerland for the rest of his life in anger, except when he made COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG and when he went to Hollywood for his special Oscar career in the 1970s. Since he was not American, he could not be called to the United States, so he sold (along with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford) American military bonds. But in Britain, tens of thousands died on the battlefields of the First World War, and the public there was upset because of Chaplin, whom they considered to be a “idler” and a coward. Chaplin eventually overcame this, but the remnants of resentment followed him until he died. This does not detract from the success of the Shoulder Weapon as a film, but suggests why Chaplin did not make another modern film about the war before 1940, and this is a more worthy goal.
