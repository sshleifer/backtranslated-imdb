La Antena, the daring film of Argentine director Esteban Sapir, succeeds in rethinking the silent film genre as well as in an exciting instructive story. The situation is a city captured by meaningless television, whose people are deprived of the power of speech, with the exception of the lonely and mysterious presence on the screen, known simply as the Voice. In an effort to strengthen his power, the surprisingly villainous duet of the television magnate Mr. T.V. and the mad scientist Dr. Y intended to kidnap Golos and direct his unique talent to his own meanest goals. It is the business of the young family and the nameless son of the Voice to stop this evil scheme. As a result, a story appears on a roller coaster, which is sometimes confusing, but no less exciting. <br /> <br /> This is a silent movie that carries many of its influences on the sleeve; Frank references to great silent films, such as George Melis and Fritz Lang, will be readily apparent to anyone familiar with their work. But behind such tributes lie more subtle references and symbolism. I especially like the fact that Mr. T.V. and his minions drive ordinary gangster cars of the 30s of the last century, when the era of silent films died out and a completely different industry began to appear. <br /> <br /> La Antena produces shaded plot techniques and theatrical performances common to many silent films, albeit very informative and with humor. This is an amazing visual style of La Antena, which really sets him apart from the films to which he pays homage. From the hypnotic TV logo to the menacing transfer station on the top of the hill, this film is replete with dazzling visual ingenuity that rivals the animation studio Ghibli ?? and all this with the use of real actors and handmade decorations. <br /> <br /> Moreover, although the style is often deliberately banal and theatrical, it is still a disturbing, provocative and emotional picture. The use of religious symbolism throughout La Antena gives additional resonance in the struggle between the television empire and the weakening power of the word. At the same time, many of the most powerful images are original, including the hypnotic whirl of televisions and the nightmarish factory for the production of television products. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t want to end this review on a sour note, but I feel that the English version of La Antena is subtitled. The original Spanish subtitles are used with great effect, with a great play with words on the screen. However, the English subtitles that accompany the initial dialogue are disappointingly incomplete, with gaps and errors, sometimes leaving the viewer to collect things for themselves. La Antena, however, is an astounding film sample; a visually exciting experience that shows great energy and humor, telling a powerful cautionary story.
