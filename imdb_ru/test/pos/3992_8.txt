Like this. Okhvon (artist and main character) is an exceptional person. What impressed me most was the message that this film can address to all of you people. And the message is sad. This suggests that it is very difficult to do something amazing or perhaps even brilliant, not submitting to governments, establishments and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you cannot bear it. It is about the battle of one person with the system. With many systems. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie of this wonderful Korean director. Please see if you have the opportunity.
