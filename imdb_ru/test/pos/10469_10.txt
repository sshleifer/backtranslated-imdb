As "Chocolate" showed, food is always a good topic in a movie. "Babette's Feast" is the same. Babette Harsan (Stefan Odran) is a French cook who leaves her homeland after the repressions of 1871. She moves to a very religious Danish village. People in this village are simply useless for joy. That is, until Babette does not cook them one of his exquisite dishes. <br /> <br /> The point is not only to entertain in the place where it has never been. As in other Scandinavian films (and not at all Hollywood films), it shows that the film may interest you without the use of explosions, car chases, etc. This is one film that you cannot afford to miss. <Br /> <br /> One more thing. Do you think the Danish word “feast” sounds a bit like “taste-bud”?
