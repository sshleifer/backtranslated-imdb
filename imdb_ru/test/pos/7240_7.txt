What is often overlooked in the stories of Agatha Christie is her progressive anti-conservative stance on a number of issues - from the role of women to the influence of traditions and people's belief in the supernatural. In Nemesis, you can find many such subtexts, but you can also find a good old-fashioned intriguing puzzle that keeps you in the dark for most of its length. Raising "Nemesis" over the recordings of other series ("They do it with mirrors", "4:50 From Paddington", etc.) is the fact that at crucial moments before and after exposing the murderer you can really feel the unknown. Finally, Jane Booker can guard my body at any time. (***)
