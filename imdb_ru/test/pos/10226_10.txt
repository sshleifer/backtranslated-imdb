I really love this movie. I just managed to get a copy and save it to look at my birthday. This film raises a few questions. One. Who are the monsters of this world? Being different is just like that. Various. Real monsters are hiding behind the masks of everyday life. These are the ones everyone considers to be a "nice, quiet guy" who "did not bother anyone." Or they are worse, they are such characters as Kroneberg played. Men who receive pleasure and power from dividing people and creating their Blood Books. I like werewolves, people with gifts and those whom people may not look at. This film touches and explores what is normal. Who are "others" and what does fear do with some? Even though I made this film 10, I was still tired of the women who either scream or are so tuned that they cannot see what is happening and be the means for what destroyed the Median. My other complaint was why they never made the second film. For example, I would like to see a continuation of this most intriguing story that keeps me captive from beginning to end
