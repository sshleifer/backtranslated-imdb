I am not Ebert. What I am is compassionate, and I have never felt more compassion for a fictional character than for Leland P. Fitzgerald. Sorry if I do not offer criticism, but I see nothing but perfection in this film. I’m sure that many who watch this movie will never see the same thing as me, but if you look carefully enough, you may see something you’d not expect. I read that the character of Leland was erroneous. It seems to me that the one who wrote this could not see past the Question that this film represents. I feel sorry for those who do not see the answers that this film gives. Open your heart more than your mind, and you can let this Leland P. Fitzgerald show you the world that really matters. Exceptional story with an extraordinary game. Ryan Gosling deserves to be talked about.
