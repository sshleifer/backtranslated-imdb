Before that, I wrote only one IMDb review, as I believe that most games are unworthy of time and effort ... The curse of the island of monkeys is different. <br /> <br /> Playing and being impressed by Monkey 1 and 2, I had high hopes for a third release ... and I was not disappointed. The first thing that struck me was the significantly improved graphics. Don't get me wrong, for games made in 1990 and 1991, respectively, Monkey 1 and 2 were innovative and well supplied, but CMI takes a step forward and provides excellent gameplay in a cartoon style that is both fun and satisfying. All the scenes and settings have been carefully thought out and well thought out, and are perfect for this type of game. Animation / CGI is a mixture of realism and exaggeration; fantastic combination in this case. <br /> <br /> For me, the script played a crucial role in the success of the two previous games. The CMI script is smart, appropriate and, above all, absolutely funny. In addition to this, the script is now audio, unlike the previous two, where speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen. The voice of Dominic Armato is perfect for Guybrash: witty, clear and slightly naive. All other voice talents are perfect for their characters, especially Earl Boen, who stands behind LeChuck. I loved each character throughout the game: not only his personality and wit, but also how each character is animated beautifully and clearly. Although sound effects are worth mentioning the soundtrack. The soundtracks for Monkey 1 and 2 were monotonous, and, despite this, were very effective for creating atmosphere and mood changes. The CMI soundtrack is another step forward. Each scene is complemented by a catchy, subtle, playful and pirated (if that word) melody. With a change in setting or mood, the music also adapts, adding to the entertainment and entertainment that the game offers. <br /> <br /> The main idea of ​​Monkey Island is to solve puzzles and tasks in order to progress. It may seem simple, but in fact it’s pretty damn difficult in many places. Some may be repelled by the level of logic and the number of thoughts that go to Monkey Island, but in fact it makes the game even more fun and fun, and also increases the value of the play. The option “Curse of the island of monkeys” or “Curse of the island of monkeys: mega-monkey” (which includes more cunning and abundant puzzles) is suitable for players of all abilities, and also gives good reasons for playing at least twice. Whatever level of difficulty you choose, you are guaranteed a new game every time you replay, with numerous speech options and other puzzles that need to be solved that do not affect the outcome of the game, but just for fun. The most interesting section of the game is Ship Battle, and the sword “fights”, which follows. They were especially well thought out and make the game completely worthwhile. Add to this a grandiose story that is non-violent and suitable for all ages, which will keep you waiting and wanting more to the very end. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a unique special mention should be made to the designers. This game The way all the complex puzzles and problems are thought out is simply amazing. Collecting objects and objects during the game, you cannot see how each of them will help you to progress, but solutions are presented with a little thoughtfulness and perseverance, and for this, CMI designers should be highly appreciated. <br /> 10/10 for the best game I've ever played (no exaggeration)
