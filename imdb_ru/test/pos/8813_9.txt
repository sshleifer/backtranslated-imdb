I have a completely biased point of view, mainly because I live and enjoy the cultural life of the club. Being a DJ and a frequent visitor to the club, I see honesty in this film, and I like it. If you do not know the culture of the club / rave, then this will be a great foray into this culture for those who do not know it firsthand. Honest image of human emotions and problems in that part of the Jeep, which I loved. The characters were well designed, and I really liked this movie. I really do not like the fact that you have to write ten lines on this website. I will write at least 6 or 7, but I feel that I can portray my point of view with less than ten. Here are some additional lines that will make the gods IMDb happy.
