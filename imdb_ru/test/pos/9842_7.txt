This is one of those social dramas that the WB was able to collect, and in the thirties he was guaranteed to succeed. These early “dead-end children” go to a reform school where they are mistreated. Cagney, a gangster as part of the deal, is appointed school commissioner. At first he does not take it seriously, but he changes and makes the necessary changes to improve the lives of the boys. The idea is to let the boys rule and control their community. Is this a serious social reform, I can not believe, but this is a film. This is very similar to Boys Town with a slightly darker tone. A useless happy ending negatively affects the scene, but is still good. WB later made the same films with Bogart in the role of Cagney / Father.
