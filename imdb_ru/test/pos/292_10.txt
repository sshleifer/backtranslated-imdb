This is the apocalyptic vision of the hell of our modern world. Social criticism of our shallow, commercially oriented values ​​is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the cliché “war is hell”, emphasized by Captain Spetsnaz’s mythical journey to Cambodia, whose mission is to destroy (with prejudice) a fraud colonel, who left the concept of justice in the army to create your own world. When I saw the Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece. In particular, I found the last leg of the journey with Brando, which enclosed the Heart of Darkness of Conrad, to be rather boring. I finally got to see the Apocalypse Now Redux and the drawbacks were taken care of. Redux makes the film a true masterpiece, certainly among the top 100 films ever made. Brando's performance now seems complete and complete, perhaps not so mysterious, but much deeper. Martin Sheen is great at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled. It's great to see young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, and so on. On the early screens, which show what wonderful actors they will eventually be recognized for. The work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Laurence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by additional frames. If you've never seen this movie, skip the original and head straight to Redux. I would like to receive from the Scorcese Gangs of New York Redux to fill all the gaps in this deeply erroneous potential masterpiece.
