Eric Bogosyanâ€™s ability to move from character to character in this one-person show demonstrates his true range as a character actor. Each person has his own message in which she talks about truth, society, class, drugs, etc. This is absolutely necessary for everyone who seriously loves acting skills! His performance contains some of the most fun and present moments I have ever experienced as a viewing audience.
