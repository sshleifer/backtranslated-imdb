I mean, let's face it, all you need to do in modeling is to pose for photos. Judged so critical. The show, however, is interesting, especially with Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, Jay Alexander and the supermodel Twiggy. I watched season 5, 6, 7 and in the middle of season 8. It seems that American Idol has become sexy, but I'm a guy, and I only watch him because of hot girls posing in their bikinis! The show can be pretty boring when it comes to judging, Tyra tends to go on and on and it really pushes away. Anyway, would I recommend it? Yes, I would recommend it to women who want to do modeling business? Not.
