I saw it at Sundance one of the first years when I was at the festival - it blew me away ... <br /> <br /> It went too fast, and I could not find it again. I thought it would be somewhere on the compilation, but still there is no joy. My memory is clouded with details - I just remember how I was surprised again and again and sat on the edge of my chair. <br /> <br /> Does anyone read this, are there any reasons? On the Internet, on DVD, in an excellent copy of VHS - I would try to make it worth your ... <br /> <br /> Over the years I have probably watched over 200 short films (I used to live near Aspen). where they are doing an incredible short festival in April). This is one of my favorite places and I hope to see it again! <br /> <br /> Thank you so much to everyone who has a hint how to see it :)
