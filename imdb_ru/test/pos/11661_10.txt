I must have seen this movie about four or five times, and it gets better with every viewing. Suffice it to say: this is the best movie I've ever seen. And I think I saw a lot. <br /> <br /> But I always wondered why this film was so avoided in some reviews or ratings. For example, take IMDb Top 250. Why does it take only 216 places (for today)? Of course, the answer is not in the film itself (because it is nothing short of flawless), but in its reception. The film caused controversy in his portrayal of compassion for the convicted murderer and his position against the death penalty. And so, obviously, the more conservative user probably didn’t like the film (as you can see from some of the other comments). Thus, DEAD MAN WALKING gets a rating that is ridiculous in terms of its quality. These people did not understand what the film wants to say, and perhaps they do not want to understand, being for the death penalty. So now I understand: this is all political. You are for the death penalty - you do not like (and therefore you do not want to hear) what the film says. <br /> <br /> I am very sorry that there are still so many people who are simply tuned in when a new perspective challenges their beliefs. <br /> <br /> Mr. Robbins, the problem of your film divided people's opinions. Some revised their point of view, some just did not listen, but you made a very important point. Your film will probably never appear in the list of “100 Best Films of All Time”, but it will be remembered long after such films as Braveheart, Babe or Apollo 13 (all of which were unfairly preferred compared to yours film on the Oscars 1996) are forgotten. Congratulations, Mr. Robbins, and thank you for this important film.
