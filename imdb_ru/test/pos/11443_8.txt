"Night of the Demons" is definitely one of the most dramatic horror films about demons of the 80s in the same spirit as the brilliant films "Evil Dead and Demons." This film combines sexually active sexually teens and demons into one hell of a funny movie. A certain long-awaited addition after the 80s were captured by slasher clicks, it was nice to see something a little different. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenagers who all meet for a Halloween party in a building that used to be a funeral home organized by Angela. About 40 minutes of drunkenness and sex make the demon or demons come out of the furnace and take possession of every teenager. Add a few make-up effects, lots of blood and cool demons, and you’ll get the sweet cheese festival of the 80s, which will be recognized as one of the best movie about demons in the lists of many horror fans. br /> <br /> First, I liked the setting for this film, “House of Hull” is really creepy and scary, and the ideal setting for a horror movie and, moreover, when demons appear, it is then that the action really begins, and it’s becomes a night of horror and fear. This film spawned 2 sequels, the first in 1994, which was good, but nothing compares to this, and the third one called “House of Demons” was absolutely terrible. This is one of those horrors that has definitely stood the test of time and will remain my pearl for many years. <br /> <br /> In general, a funny funny movie with demons that is definitely worth checking out.
