I saw it last night and laughed out loud the entire second half of the movie. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell shot a damn funny movie! I don't want to give anything back, but when the film turns around and becomes stupid, it becomes really stupid. Just one funny scene after another. My hats to Mr. Campbell and the team for spending it on such a tiny budget. Bruce was there to present the film and make Q and A, which was a pleasure. Many of the questions people asked were pretty lame, but Bruce turned them upside down and would be sarcastic. He was great! In any case, I liked the movie. I will look forward to it on DVD later this year. Be sure to check out this on the Sci-Fi channel this fall. I highly recommend this one.
