“The Honkers” is perhaps the best Slim Pickens performance ever. When we were shooting, everyone who was involved in the production believed that Slim was an Oscar award. Unfortunately, United Artists released a picture of James Bond at the same time and did not pay much attention to "The Honkers". I personally feel that this film was underestimated by most critics. Sam Pekingpou's "Younger Bonner" came out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. In addition, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film released a few months before our release, and it would also hurt us. The picture is worth seeing, if only the footage from the rodeo - one of the best pictures ever taken - taken by James Crabbe. The director and my co-author, Steve Yanat, died a few weeks after the film was released, interrupting a promising career and leaving behind his beloved wife Sally, the daughter of Gaby and the newborn son Stephen. Please give this movie a shot. I bet you say it was worth it. I thank everyone who took the time to read this. Stephen Lodge
