This is an entertaining surrealistic road film. It was written by Joseph Mignon, who also wrote After Hours, an excellent surrealist film by Martin Scorsese. The film tells about the adventures of a ten-year-old child named Gus, who drives a red Ford Mustang through fictional states with names like Tristan (perhaps a tribute to the film by Luis Bunuel), Essex and South Lyndon, in search of eight elusive Motorama game cards from various gas stations Chimera company. The film has a surreal feeling because many things are unusual, for example, money that looks like a blank piece of paper with numbers. <br /> <br /> Most characters disgust Gus on his trip. They tattoo him, beat him, but this does not stop the child in his tireless search. Some strange actors, such as acting David Lynch Jack Nance, Meat Loaf & Flea, also perform. Jack Nance plays the owner of the motel, who, when he first meets Gus, tells him: "If you see any squirrels, give them to me." This is a movie where a man and his wife throw their little children, because he owes Gus $ 100; and the mother calls her son to raise his voice louder while he speaks rudely. If you're a fan of twin peaks and surreal movies, you'll love it. Strange little gem of the film.
