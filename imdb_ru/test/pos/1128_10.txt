When I first sat down to watch Greek, I did not expect a show with complex characters, intriguing storylines and impeccable writing ... but this is exactly what I got. <br /> <br /> Greek is followed by several college students who are in the Greek system at the University of Rhodes in Cyprus. Rusty Cartwright enters Rhodes Cyprus as a polymer science specialist who seeks to be in the fraternity. His older sister, Casey (center of the show and soon becoming president of Zeta Beta Zeta, the most prestigious women's community on campus) does not quite support his plans. In fact, none of her friends did not even know that she had a brother until he set foot on college grounds! In addition to having her crazy little brother forced back into her life, boyfriend Casey Evan Chambers (soon becoming the president of the THE brotherhood on campus, Omega Chi) cheats on her with the new promise of ZBZ (Rebecca Logan), the diabolical president of ZBZ Franny makes her stay with him, and she still has feelings for her idle ex-boyfriend Cappie (president of the campus party house, Kappa Tau). These characters are joined by Calvin Owens (Rusty's sporty, smart friend, who turns out to be gay), Dale Ketwell (persistent Christian Rusty and “possibly a racist” roommate and best friend) and Ashley (Casey’s freaky best friend and his confidant)) . <br /> <br /> For two seasons (or four chapters) in Greek, viewers are often reminded that college life is not black and white, but "in shades of gray from now on." Each character makes his own share of mistakes, but each of them has its merits. Casey and Cappie have a complex but beautiful relationship throughout the series. Friendship Rusty, Dale and Calvin are not always perfect, but they manage to survive all the obstacles they have thrown. Even Franny, Rebecca, and Evan (the "villains" of the series) are depicted as people from time to time. <br /> <br /> Greek language shows college students their best, worst and intermediate results. This is a show that shows that college is what it really is: a four-year adventure in which morality, belief, and willpower are tested, at risk, and sometimes even changed. <br /> <br /> Greek has at least one season left, if not more, before it ends. I can't wait to see where the characters will be next. Greek is not your typical ABC family series. If you want to tune in to a show that shows the truth about a person’s motivation, Greek is the show for you.
