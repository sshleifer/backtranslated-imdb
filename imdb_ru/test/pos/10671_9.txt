I am a great space lover, and in my almost 44 years I first discovered this film. I came to him in a roundabout way from Cosmos in 1999, then from UFO. I went hunting for other creations of Anderson and found that it was their first live game. What a home run! I actually heard about this film many years ago, but I never knew what it was called, so I'm happy that I found it by accident. <br /> <br /> These Andersons were nothing short of amazing in their writing, the performance of completely believable and realistic looking models, the quality of acting, etc. <br /> <br /> I do not think it looks obsolete. Let me tell you ... I'll take the good old models on top of the fake CGI shit ANY TIME today! Seriously, most of the scenes with rockets looked very real. They had it before science! If you decide to think about what you are looking at as the present, itâ€™s not hard for you to believe in it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the amount of detail in the scenery, beautiful photography, the whole look. .. dude, I would like to return at this time! They were able to make great films in the 60s. Personally, I lost all interest in Hollywood films today. Anyone with a budget can do CGI. I hate this! Return the model! Think of all the people who use style! Anyway, I scold. :-) If you like good science fiction, which is very well done, you will watch it.
