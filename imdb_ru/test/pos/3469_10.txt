Until I watched this movie, “Life is Beautiful” was my favorite movie of all time. This film is all that a great film should be. A magnificent script, an unsurpassed action and a direction that does not come close to sentimentalism, which the subject seduces, and does not leave him without the emotional impact he requires. This film contains a taste that could not come from Hollywood, and there is no pretense that will come from France. A wonderful film even higher in caliber, which I expected to see when I saw the handmade logo. I do not need to go into details, since the previous posts cover everything, why everyone should see this film on this planet.
