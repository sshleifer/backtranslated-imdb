I entered this film, thinking that I would not like it, but hoping to be surprised, but this, like the film, ultimately turned out to be bleak and hopeless. But don't get me wrong, Minghella presents every epic epic, and for those who enjoy this experience and want to embrace this adventure and embrace what just happened, then they will not be disappointed, and this will be one of the best films of the year for their opinion The acting is of high quality, and most likely it will receive a trinity of oscillations for Lowe, Kidman, and Zellweger, although several Portman scenes can be the strongest in the film. The places are beautiful and Minghella is looking for a good shot. <br /> <br /> However, those who, like me, want the director to take them on an adventure, rather than go voluntarily, may be disappointed, mainly because of Minghella. and its adaptation. The film is so bleak that it makes it an epic for a punching bag, which, I believe, is a film that is trying to strike emotionally, but does it so extreme and so often that during the film I did not have time to invest emotionally, or did not recover from the previous strike, and it became unrealistic and, therefore, too difficult to really care, not to mention predictability. In general, Cold Mountain almost left me too tired to even remember the good aspects of the film, since all I remember is death, which may have been the original motive, but in the end turned out to be the center of attention, not characters.
