Film noir meets anime ... ingenious! This was one of the most amazing shorts from Animatrix. It was one of my favorites, if not my favorite (I also loved the World Record). This is mainly a reference to those classic films of noir-detective stories and films of the 40s, except that they are animated and include The Matrix. But being animated, he is able to bring the extreme camera angles, detective lifestyle, shadows and everything else that shoots noir to a whole new level. Femme fatale? Trinity. The detective story in this story seems to live in the 40s in his mind, but he is stuck in the modern world, and everything becomes too much for him when his case suddenly affects science fiction and agents when a mysterious woman in black enters his office ... <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
