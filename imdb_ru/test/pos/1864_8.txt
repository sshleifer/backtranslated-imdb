Blimey! Fantastic film in my opinion, I did not expect it to be so good! I was fascinated from start to finish - this is a very well-made and educational film that really gives us an exciting insight into the trials that Darwin had to go through in order to convey his ideas to the world, chronicling his life when he wrote “Origin of Species"; to fight both personal demons and the ignorant society of the time to do it.He fights hard with his mind, body and soul when personal matters reach a critical point, and even his family seems to be slipping away ... at that time like the rest of the world you steps against him because he knows that his conclusions literally shake the very foundations of their life, culture and raison d'être.This is a thin film (not too exaggerated in any typical Hollywood way, it is a British film produced by the BBC), but fortunately very powerful in meaning, and this is due to the amazing well-staged scenes, as well as the excellent playing of Bettany, Connelly plays a lighter supporting role, but I liked her, and she’s as good as one would expect her chemistry was next to her husband op edelenno strong and sweet, you can feel the connection and their real husband / wife Bond definitely shine through their performances. But the star of the show is definitely Bettany, and he does a brilliant job, a very touching performance - I understood and sympathized with him when he struggled with his own degrading health and impending “madness” to try to understand what he found and come to reconcile because all of this is in fact and what it means, because he discovered that his thinking contradicted his feelings, and found that he was losing all of this, including his wife, who, of course, was a firm believer in religion and a strict Christian, until found Camping in the field of science, two worlds, who could not see each other, so their relationship, too, were at stake. <br /> <br /> In any case - a really very good, well-played emotional drama, and, I dare say, I shed a tear during the tragic climax that was really heartbreaking as well as beautifully sharp and exciting. The film is symbolic and very intellectually artistic, in fact I can’t wait to see it again, since there was something to take in the first round, but I missed it. Easily one of the best films I've seen this year.
