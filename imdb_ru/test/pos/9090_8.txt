The Flatliners have all the ingredients of a good Joel Schumacher film - smart, young characters, amazing cinematography, an exciting story and great performances. This is a fun adventure, but it is done very well and echoes the positive spiritual message, despite the frustrating predecessors. <br /> <br /> Schumacher knows how to notice talented young actors, and all the top fives here have moved on to more things (see the list of actors). Their believable performances help raise this film far above average. Kiefer Sutherland shines in his selfish role as a medical student. <br /> <br /> Cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain, which I like in Schumacher; its use of light and location create images that adhere. It creates a disturbing, nightmarish atmosphere that upsets you when you watch a movie, and haunts you when you go to bed, ‚Äùreminded me of Lost Boys. <br /> <br /> This is a film that takes a surprising premise - curious students want to find out what happens after death, and successfully follow a terrible, exciting story about redemption. One of the best Schumacher; highly recommended.
