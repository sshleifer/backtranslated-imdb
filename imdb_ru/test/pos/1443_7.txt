*** Spoiler in the fifth paragraph *** It was a surprisingly frank (aha, aha) picture of 1955. Otto Preminger and Carlisle Productions took a risk by doing this, the American Association of Cinematographic Cinemas refused to certify the film, which openly shows how a drug addict shakes a syringe full of heroin in his hand. Frank Sinatra took the chance to play the addict musician and fall on his face in a role that required at least twice as many actions as he ever did. In general, these gambling paid off, the film is a classic, although it is not perfect. <br /> <br /> Nelson Algren’s novel may be wonderful, but there’s too much to fit into a two-hour movie. A man with a golden hand lasts 119 minutes and often feels much longer. However, in my opinion, not only Frankie Mashin (Sinatra) makes the film, but other characters and their minor plots, all involving Frankie. Ultimately, it's not just Frankie, who has an addiction, everything and everyone seems to depend on him, and he feels it sharply. When the pressure gets too strong, the drums begin to knock on the soundtrack, and Frankie crosses the street with his well-dressed “girlfriend” Louis. <br /> <br /> To say that Frank Sinatra's musical career was an exaggeration would be an exaggeration. ever really disheartened, but in the early 50s he was in limbo between his days of touring with large groups and the era of Las Vegas. “From here to eternity” established him as a serious actor, and his singer career also recovered, but “The Man with the Golden Hand” was still a serious problem, and the whole performance was drowning or floating in his performance. He copes with this with such skill that for a few minutes at a time I forgot that I was watching Frank Sinatra, he must have known novice musicians and used this knowledge to the maximum extent. <br /> <br /> Put it next to Billy In Wilder's masterpiece “The Lost Weekend”, more attention is paid to the sociological reasons for dependencies in “The Man with the Golden Hand”. While Don Byrnem (Ray Milland in The Lost Weekend) seems to be fighting mostly against himself, Frankie Machine is overwhelmed by external forces, and he takes refuge in the needle. Neither approach is absolutely right or wrong, mainly because the addiction cannot be fully explained, but it seems that this film could benefit from a deeper understanding of Frankie’s inner struggle. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ** * One of the problems I encounter in this film is that I “threw a cold turkey”. I understand that “The Man with the Golden Hand”, most likely, set the trend and did not follow it, but this does not make it better. At the beginning of the film, Frankie, apparently, threw out his habit with the help of a doctor and some medical institution. Naturally, the drama of the film requires him to back down, but I found that the general American ideal, that a man should solve his problems alone (or, perhaps, with the help of a good woman), is irrelevant here. The cold turkey and ride at sunset with Kim Novak seemed too unreal. The end of "Lost Weekend" was similar, but in my opinion, was a little less rosy.
