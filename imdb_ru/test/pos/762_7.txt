I thought it would be a lousy movie, to be honest, I mean that Rupert Grint, Ron, acting in a film other than Harry Potter, was actually really hard to imagine. But when the film began, he showed that this guy has a talent, I mean, the best actor from the HP trio, for reference, did you see Emma Watson trying to play? Or how about the play of Daniel? Both have no experience, although they have appeared in millions of Harry Potter films. Ben, his character is a very shy boy, unable to show his true feelings for everything, his disdain for his ruling mother and resentful anger towards his father, who cannot approach and confront his unfaithful wife. Julie Walters was absolutely gorgeous! Her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live in the shadow of her past, while she is trying to recall Shakespeare's sonnets, is absolutely wonderful! In addition, it seems that a lot of young people are wasted in religious nonsense.
