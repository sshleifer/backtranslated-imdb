The woodcutter finds a young cougar in need of help. For the young, to be alone, the cat will soon come to grips with impassable camp workers. Nicknamed "Good time, Charlie," his pranks are initially entertaining. Its wild nature eventually begins to cause problems, and its reintegration into its natural habitat becomes a problem. This film is one of those wonderful Disney nature films that were common in the 50s and 60s, action, beautiful scenery and some kind of cute animal to charm you. These films were short-lived, but included spectacular glimpses into the wild and the effects of human contact. Unlike Disneyâ€™s animated talking animals, the animals in these films remained true to their own nature. They also make travel films to see western states.
