The series "Children's Game" is not my favorite, but "Chucky's Bride" is actually a good movie. This time we have two dolls, Chucky, and his ex-girlfriend (when he was a man) Tiffany. Together they go on a journey to find the object. There are several interesting scenes in the film, such as a guy who is hit by a truck and literally blows up, a sex scene between Chuckie and Tiffany and a final that allows another sequel. In fact, it was not a direct horror, he mixed a lot of comedies and was a kind of trick of the horror genre. It made the film better than a comedy with many horror movies. All, even if you are not a fan of children's games, try this one.
