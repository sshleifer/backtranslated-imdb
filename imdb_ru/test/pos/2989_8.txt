I can hardly even remember which decade I saw this film. I think it was when I was a teenager (I am 37 now). I started watching it as a late night movie somewhere from the mid to the early 80s, and since then most of it has stayed with me. Seeing other comments, I had no idea that he was shown in cinemas or that someone else, even a new one, existed. I don't think I even mentioned the movie to anyone else. <br /> <br /> But after half my life I still remember most of the movie that I watched late at night so long ago. I think that the innocence of the characters, their position, their mutual affection for a long period of time left a long-term imprint for reasons that I do not quite understand. Maybe it's because I was a teenager at the time I saw it, and it somehow touched me ... I really don't know! I also REALLY wanted to know what happens when the end of the film happens. Oh, agony !! <br /> <br /> I have not seen this before or since, but I would love to. I am in no hurry to look out for it, but now I doubt that it will be revealed, and it seems to have disappeared into oblivion. But I probably would have missed it in the television guide, even if it appeared. Pssttt !!! <br /> <br /> Reading reviews here renewed my interest. If someone knows about its availability in Australia, by all means send me an email and let me know. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Sean Bury ... glad to see you in the comments. I looked at the history of your movie and noticed your last appearance in a James Bond movie. What are you up to today? Oh, and do you have a copy of the movie? CHEERS !!!
