I was very touched by the young life experience of a man who rose so high in the academic world. A hard life surrounded by the love of a close family and a large family of workers has created a person who can succeed in the world. For the most part, Latin American culture is shown as I have always watched and admired â€” hardworking, optimistic, and truly family oriented. Points of religious superstition were quite reliable for the Catholic Church. Without a doubt, the actress who played the mother deserves an Oscar. Her prayers for the missing son made me cry. I will recommend this amazingly thoughtful film to my friends and family.
