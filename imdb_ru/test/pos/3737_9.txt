I think this show was right on the money for me. I watched it on the plane, but there were parts in the film that made me control myself because I exploded everywhere. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane was very believable (a fantastic game on both sides)! I also liked the way Diane Lane played on this show. She showed maturity and how she transformed throughout the show, it was easy to believe what a teenager could be in real life. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this show from start to finish. Definitely recommended for romantic people there!
