This film is not just good, it's awesome. In addition to providing us with good performances, an original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and much more, this was still a completely invisible world to the public. This is the first sci-fi film that takes us to an unknown space of our galaxy with such magnificent effects and stunning reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and so I got into the world of modern effects and 3D animation in films. But, nevertheless, I was really, and I mean completely, amazed at the quality of these effects even after almost 40 years. Visual effects were only one of the merits of this film, the camera was in the true style of Kubrick, amazing and charming. It seems that you are absorbed by the screen and drawn into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or as you call it). The effects, the camera and the large size of this movie caught me on guard, although I saw the rating before I bought it. But this film has more than that. The meaning of this film can also be interpreted according to your wishes, although I think that there are some clear points concerning humanity (also Kubrickâ€™s true style). The fact that humanity at the top of its evolution is simply a service on board, and therefore is not required by a computer, one of the humanitarian tools. How we look like babies in space, learn to walk again, lose control over our tools in zero gravity, breathe through equipment like fish out of water. At the peak of evolution, we embarked on an endless adventure like simple primates. Many may think that the duration and slow pace of this film is boring? makes fun of? or just a waste of time. But before you can make such conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends a few minutes with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space. It should show the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty in many cases does not enjoy the respect of the audience. Kubrick wants to show us the beauty, and if we do not yield to her and do not relax, we will not be able to enjoy this film as it was intended. This is not an ordinary film, we cannot just sit and watch, as we can with some other films, it takes time, thoughts and, above all, commitment and feelings to watch. All this together makes it one of the greatest achievements in the world of cinema. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.
