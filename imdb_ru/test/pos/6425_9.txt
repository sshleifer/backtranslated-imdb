Very insightful psychological thriller! Footprints is a stylish example of the powerful Italian filmmaking of the 70s. And Luigi Bazzoni, the wrongly misunderstood director and visually amazing “author.” The film develops its unusual plot with an incredibly tense atmosphere and never disappoints, especially in its sad and dramatic finale! Florinda Bolkan demonstrates excellent performance, rich in nuances and touching sensitivity, able to portray a dark lady who is not only charming, but also painfully real and tragically lonely. But all the actors are fun too! Lila Kedrova, Nicoletta Elmi (mysterious child on the beach), Italian screen legend Katerina Boratto and the stunningly beautiful movie queen B Evelyn Stewart in the short but intrusive role of the protagonist's friend! And Klaus Kinski in an amazingly exhilarating cameo! It should be noted how incredibly good were films like Footprints! Capricious and eerie cinematography of Vittorio Storaro, stylized locations and scenery, the ghostly score of Nikolai Piovani and, above all, the story, so tense and exciting, so reasonably folded and structured! Thriller with fantastic elements, but especially with soul and personal vision. I wish films like Footprints would not be forgotten! I wish that today’s films were more insightful and personal, as they were in the 60-70s! And yes ... I wish someone would soon make a digital widescreen remastering DVD out of this little masterpiece!
