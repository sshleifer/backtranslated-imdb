I caught it in a late, late Mexican telegram, and I have to rant about it. The name was translated as “Secrets” (Secrets). Well, there is a secret that plays an important role in the film, but come on ,! We are not fools. We know that there is a novel behind it. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is quite interesting, and it is carried out by solid ramatic performances. Always beautiful and stunning Jordana Brewster and Christopher Eccleston demonstrate great performances and have such wonderful chemistry. Cameron Diaz is also good, although she has minimal screen time. Blythe Danner is perfect, and his latest appearance in the film is touching, sad. Great performances. <br /> <br /> Jordana’s character and her sister’s ex-boyfriend travel to Europe to deal with his demons and understand why her sister died. Through the memories we learn the sad truth and can not regret the whole family. The ending is really touching. <br /> <br /> So there is nudity, but it is minimal. In fact, sex scenes are frilly and are not going to be paired or sexy. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I continued to watch the charming and beautiful Johnda Brewster on the screen. And I finally liked the story and dramatic presentations. <br /> <br /> Try this movie if you like clear dramatic features. A great movie. The last, last scene was very sad ... Two little sisters in memories.
