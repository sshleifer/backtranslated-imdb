Andrew Davis's adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel was excellent. The characters Nan and Kitty were superbly portrayed by Rachel Sterling and Kelly Hawes respectively. The whole series was a joy to watch. This struck the imagination of all people, whether heterosexual or gay. I wish there could be a sequel!
