Mappin & Webb Ltd, but he refuses.

They invite the Italian safes and the elegant wolf Cesar (Perlo Vita) to join their team, and they are preparing the perfect heist. They succeed in their plan, but D. Juan Cesar makes things go wrong when he gives a valuable ring to his mistress. <br /> <br /> "Du Rififi Chez les Hommes" is a great film noir, of course among the best I've seen. The script is trustworthy, supported by the awesome director Jules Dassin, the stunning performances of actors and great cinematography. Jean Servais has a prominent role in the role of a criminal with principles based on the rules of the underworld. The famous long silent sequence of robbery is amazing and extremely tense and certainly one of the best in the history of cinema. I include this wonderful movie in my list of favorite movies. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Rififi"
