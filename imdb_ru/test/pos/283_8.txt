In the 1960s and 1970s, David Jason was known for his many roles in television comedies, such as “Don't tune your set!”, “Hark At Barker” and the Doctor series. In 1974, he received his first lead role on Weekend Television in London, Edgar Briggs’s Top Secret Life, written by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna. <br /> <br /> Edgar Briggs - secret agent “SIS” (“Secret Intelligence Service”). He sincerely tries to do his job well, but it always seems to spoil everything. Surprisingly, he always manages to sort things out, much to the amazement of his colleagues - Buxton (Michael Stainton), Spencer (Marc Eden) and Katie (pretty Elizabeth Cownsell), they all answer "Commander" (Noel Coleman). <br /> <br /> Briggs is married to “Jennifer” (Barbara Engell), a woman who is very similar to “Betty” by Michele Dotrissa from “Some Some's Do” “Ave, Um!”, has holy patience and supports her inveterate (but well-intentioned) husband, no matter what. <br /> <br /> Like “Do a Little Mother,” Ave “Uh”. and "The Baldy Man", "TTSLOEB" was completely riddled with farce. In each episode, Jason performed tricks, such as falling from a high window sill or falling from the top of the stairs when decorating his apartment. In fact, it was a "quiche in the face." <br /> <br /> Edgar Briggs was not a big hit due to poor planning from I.T.V. Shame, because it was a fun and enjoyable show, well served by his star and a great cast of support. However, the lead person did not seem to enjoy the impressions of the show. David Jason vetoed reruns of the show because he felt that his actions in him were not refined. Of course, David Jason, who played "Del Boy", "Inspector Frost" and "Pop Larkin", is very different from the one in which Briggs played, but his actions were by no means unconditional. Most actors would have turned Briggs into a funny caricature, but Jason's performance made Briggs a trustworthy, realistic figure. Strange, but not impossible not to imagine. <br /> <br /> Jason's next car was “Lucky Feller,” in which he played his mother's boy, Shorty Mampstead. He also could not make ratings. His successful break came in the form of a "sharp sigh" by AT, in which he played in the Peter Barns disaster pedestrian zone for four episodes between 1977-1981. So, although not outstanding as such, the Briggs are lightweight and decent watches. Nice James Bond melody too!
