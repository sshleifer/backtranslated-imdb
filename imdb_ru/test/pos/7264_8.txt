If you like the lock, the drain and two steaming barrels, you will probably like it too. Although I assume that some of the British jokes (for example, the challenge of two London characters, Dixon and Winterburn after the Arsenal players) may be lost for some, it is still amazing entertainment that really enlivens. <br /> <br /> Carlisle, Miller and Tyler are all excellent, bring depth to their characters, and the interaction between the two main characters is always well appreciated. In fact, Scott’s leadership is very confident, considering that this is his first full-length film, and proves that he has a father’s talent to help us relax in unfamiliar surroundings. <br /> <br /> Hell, I convinced myself. I will see it again!
