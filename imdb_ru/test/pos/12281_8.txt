The whole city of Blackstone is afraid because they lynched Brother Bret Dixon - and he is coming back for revenge! At least that's what they think. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous Johnny Holliday and a very interesting, early star Mario Adorf in this Italo-western, clearly filmed in the Alps. <br /> <br /> Bret Dixon returns to Blackstone to find out why his brother is lynched. He is a loner and a gunner, everyone is afraid of him - Mexican gangsters (fighting the gringos who seized their land!), And also “decent” citizens who lynched Brother Bret. They lynched him because they thought he stole their money instead of bringing it to Dallas for the security of the bank there. But this is only half the truth, as we learn in the course of this psychologically interesting western. <br /> <br /> But be careful, this is a kind of depressing film, as everyone is guilty, and definitely it’s all bad to the bone ... <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I really liked and gave 8/10. It is strange that as of January 12, 2002, less than 5 people voted for this film ....
