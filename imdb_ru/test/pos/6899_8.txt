I saw this at the San Francisco Independent Film Festival, and I really enjoyed it. It worked for me like a strange comedy, because I do not like horror, but I had to close my eyes for just a couple of minutes. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was good, the costumes and the settings are not far off the BBC-quality, which is surprising for an indie film. I liked how the plot is spinning and even squirming, and it surprised me. I even warmed up to the character Willy Grimes, who I didnâ€™t like at all in the beginning. It would be better if there was some kind of motivation for a woman who would be so interested in going to the island: it was very similar to intrigue. <br /> <br /> I like Dominic Monaghan. He did a good job in traps, horrors, and more thoughtful moments. Good voice in the story too. <br /> <br /> It would be a funny and unusual dating film.
