Whatever you do, do not stop watching when you think the movie is over! Wander through the first batch of credits, or you really miss something! We watched this film at the Shroud Film Festival and thought it was the best of them all. Dreyya Weber is truly a miracle, not only because of her performances, but also because she can handle it above the ground. In Q & A, she said that there were no wires or effects, so everything that you see really drives her. Eddie could not reach the festival because she was dancing with Madonna. She was superb and damn so beautiful. I was amazed that the movie went so well with the crowd of the blue-haired lady, but you have it, Savannah is not a traffic jam
