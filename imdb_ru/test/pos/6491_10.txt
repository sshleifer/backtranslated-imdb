Freely, from one scene to another, from one story to another, as when walking, from a shadow path to an open place, like the wind in the leaves, from tree to another, how many different sounds? Just like when you travel, people meet and tell their stories, and then leave forever, who knows? And just as when you go to these places, full of lost expectations of another time, the human “thickness” of the world is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I saw this film with my friends, but they didn’t like all of them, maybe they’re too used to scripts and ready stories, I don’t know. So this film is for stupid people who love to watch the sun sparkling on the sea, walk without haste over the hills or small villages, listen to the growing grass that tells the stories of those below six feet below in the warm summer wind.
