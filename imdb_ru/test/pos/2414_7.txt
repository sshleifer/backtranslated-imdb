<br /> <br /> I first saw this film shortly after it was released on video in 1995, I dismissed it, saying that Julie was not Daniel, never gave him a chance and said that awful /> <br /> But here he is, 5 years later, at Disney, and I watch him again. And I discovered that this is not as bad as I imagined. Miyagi is still Miyagi, as cool as ever, music is still as enjoyable as ever. And Swank's character is not so bad, her acting is pretty good, considering the script. The third installment beats by a wide margin. So, my initial rating of 4 was upgraded to 7.
