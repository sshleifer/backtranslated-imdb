“Everything is lit up” is the same as seeing a beautiful work of art of museum quality. It absolutely floods emotions through a very wide range. Jonathan Safran Foer plays with sincerity of Elijah Wood. He is in search of his father's heritage in Ukraine. His travels bring him into contact with Alex, in which Eugene Hutz plays very well and with extraordinary humor. His grandfather is most emotionally attached to this film, and it was aptly played by Boris Leskin. If there is little humor in the human character of this movie, then you only need to turn to Mickey, a real dog, which Alex and his grandfather call Sammy Davis Jr. They also call him a guide bitch. Cinematography is impressive. Colors are a very important part of patchwork film. This is a film that is worth the time and emotional investment.
