At first, I remember a clash with this rudeness on the part of the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams, even in the first days in Comedy Central. In those days (90s), their programming consisted of restarting Benny Hill and the original MST3k, complete with a bearded host. <br /> <br /> Capt. Frank Drebin (played by Leslie Nilsson with a stony face and a dead man) is a process created first by combining various stereotypical protagonists of a police TV show (I think that Dragnet meets Starsky and Hatch Shaw), brewed in flasks with famous police shows, stories and scripts . It is distilled, 3 times to produce the cleanest cop of all. Forget Simon Pegge at Hot Fuzz (for now. Save it for later). Frank Drebin is mostly ignorant, terrible driver, terrible shot, macho, but sensitive and vulnerable. He is master of the police investigation methodology (a.k.a - ask Johnny, the Leather Old Shoeshine Boy). That doesn't make him a bad cop. The cops were lucky too. Captain Drebin (notice that he is the Captain here) perfected him. Together with his partner Nordberg and the rest of the forces perfectly parodied the police drama during 6 gold episodes. <br /> <br /> The show is a treasure trove of cheerful dialogue and quoted quotes. Most of the shows are a little outdated and stupid. However, the magic never came from the jokes. It was based on meaningless and direct conversation and action in the foreground, with crazy things happening in the background. Movies can best be described as 90-minute collections of the best jokes from this series. Think of “Monty Python” and “Now for something completely different” ... <br /> <br /> If you liked “Aircraft 1 and 2”, “Naked gun 1,2,3” or “Top Secret”) , you will definitely like it. <br /> <br /> I always liked the series more than movies, although I first watched movies. What for? 2 words: No, O.J.
