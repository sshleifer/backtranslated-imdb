I saw it last night on Turner's Classic Movies (TCM). I had never heard of this before, and was very surprised to find it so exciting. <br /> <br /> Bogart is turning into a stellar cynical editor who reluctantly agrees with his insatiable radio network chief into this sharp “B” programmer. Approximately 12 years before he played cynics similar in cities with perfection in films such as Deadline USA, Knock On Any Door, The Barefoot Contessa and The Harder they fall, Bogie already experienced stellar qualities. <br /> <br /> To raise the rating and bring their quite popular programming to a more popular level, WUBC, Voice of America, releases a radio serial mini-series about a woman who 20 years ago justified a statement about the self-defense of her husband’s murder. Not wanting to be careful to save the reputation of the woman and her husband, the station uses behind-the-scenes methods to uncover everything for all listeners, and as frankly as possible. <br /> <br /> As a temporary capsule, I also found it very illuminating the morals of men and women in the workplace in the mid-30s. Although, besides Henry O'Neill, I am not familiar with supporting actors, the players were equally good, and the direction was tense. <br /> <br /> If you like this film at all (for example, “Face”) In “Crowd”, “Inspector Calls”, etc.) Don't miss the opportunity to see it. <br /> <br />
