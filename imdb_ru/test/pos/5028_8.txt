That pretty much sums it up ... trite. McDowell’s inability is sometimes painful, and Hart needs money to play such muted roles, but I still enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Why? In a word, Travolta. He is great in this movie. However, I can’t give a film too high a score, but it certainly deserves better than it seems.
