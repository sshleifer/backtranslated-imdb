For years, I seemed to be missing this picture of Ronald Reagan, and because of his recent switch to the big screen in heaven, she was recently shown on television. This is a great low-budget black and white film from the late 1930s, but it’s very interesting to see how the criminals used their talents to steal money from insurance companies with false claims during this particular period of time. I was surprised by the role of Ronald Reagan (Eric Gregg), “The Killer's”, 64 years old, played in this film, along with the great movie star, Sheila Bromley, (Nona Gregg), “Nightmare Circus”, 73 . It was a great movie in which Ronald Reagan was a young man who at that time was aiming for stars in his career in Hollywood. God bless him!
