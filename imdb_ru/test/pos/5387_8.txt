What is your problem? You have nothing better than sitting on fat asses and blogging about how you find something with a bad taste? Here's an idea: go out. That's right: get out of your mom's basement, where you lived for 13 years, and LEAVE OUT. “But I can't leave! Star Trek is turned on after 30 minutes, and I still have not married this avatar in World of Warcraft! ”My God, in that case, stay inside! Well, I could go overboard there. I mean, Star Trek is fine, but I don’t watch it anymore. In any case, you really need to write crap about Mind of Mencia. This is a good show. Maybe you just express your anger, because this girl threw you into World of Warcraft. Or you have constipation. Try adding fiber to your diet.
