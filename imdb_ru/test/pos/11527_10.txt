I have to admit that this is one of the unheard of films of Cameron Diaz, and I was also surprised that she had an important role, but she was not leading. I was very touched by this, as I can really determine the pain of losing a loved one, as I experienced it from close range. <br /> <br /> Both Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were really good in their portrayal of the main character Phoebe and I also had to pass it on to the actors to find two actresses who are so similar that I really thought they were sisters ( real life). This is one of those films that Cameron made for the sake of acting, and not for stellar accounts. She looked like part of a gorgeous, rebellious hippie who wants to change the world, although sometimes she comes off as a rebel for no reason. > <br /> Coming from a dysfunctional family, where her elder sister Faith, the little girl Phoebe, for obvious reasons, is very upset when her faith moves to Europe. When she grows up, she goes in search of her sister and gradually becomes disillusioned with the truth about her sister and falls in love with her sister's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> A great story and a no less remarkable location throughout Europe. I will watch it again.
