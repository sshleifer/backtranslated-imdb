This is one of those games where you love to smash it or hate it to shreds. Even as a hardcore fan of Mario, you may not like this game. You can hate her because she is short and rather boring and simple. Or you can love it because it's a mixture of amazing graphics (and not Nintendo fans) of music or gameplay. I know many people who say itâ€™s awesome, and others who consider him to be the worst Mario. It really depends on the type you are a Nintendo fan. I personally like this game, and I think this is the best Wii game, but you have to determine it for yourself. So I think you should definitely get it if you are the right Nintendo fan. But if you like Classics too big, you may not like it. So try it yourself.
