Barbora Bobulova, depicting Valeria in this story, was completely captivating and heartbreaking at the same time. It has been a long time since I saw so much hidden passion and mysticism represented by any actor, simply using her facial features and eyes and mouth, as Barbora does with this character. She was quite believable, like Valeria, and I was amazed at her characteristic of this role. Suddenly, the film became real life and fantasy, the clever use of limited dialogue left me spellbound. I was forced to read between the lines, and each of the key players used the art of body language and emotional intent to convey a strong storyline. Barbora, in particular, was visually stimulated almost non-sexually and at the same time sexually. This comment can easily relate to each of the many emotions caused by her performance. Understandable in terms of dialogue, but powerful in terms of presence. I was captured by this actress delivery and Iâ€™m looking forward to looking for much more of her work.
