Like most people, I'm tired of the number of clich√©s that make Hollywood. There seems to be no creativity in Hollywood. Companies that want to spend money only on remakes are sequels with a built-in audience. <br /> <br /> This film is a welcome change. It can be classified as a romantic comedy for its genre, but do not let it turn off this film. This is a very original film that does not look like most things that Hollywood produces. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this, you already know the main plot, so I will not discuss it. The only films that come to mind are to compare this with Interstate 60 and The Art of Travel, which are little-known gems that go a different way than most Hollywood trash. worth seeing if you are tired of looking more of the same. <br /> <br /> Dean
