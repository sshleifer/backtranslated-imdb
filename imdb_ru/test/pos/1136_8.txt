When I first heard about “Greek,” I thought I would watch it, because it sounds funny. Another ABC Family family show is so bad, it's almost good. But having tuned in with a friend from college, we both enjoyed the pilot episode a lot more than we expected. <br /> <br /> As a member of Greek society, I can say that many stereotypes here bring up those that appear almost every time someone starts talking about clubs and fraternities on campus. And it's also very fun to play with yourself, not to mention watching on the TV. The opening scene was only a slightly dramatized version of the preparation for the formal rush in some women's clubs, and it continued from there. <br /> <br /> This is not a show for hypersensitive Greeks. If you are offended even by joking about things that are not so good in Greek life, then you will spend the entire first episode, and perhaps many others, cowering and screaming. But everyone else should have a lot of fun watching it. This is nothing new, but when it comes to college, nothing happens.
