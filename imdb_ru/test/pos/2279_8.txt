This film attracted less attention than “Their own league”, perhaps because there is only one “named” star in it. But while women's professional baseball existed in the Midwest for just eight years, Japanese baseball is a much larger organization, both in financial underwriting and in popular support. That alone would make this movie better. <br /> <br /> “Mr. Baseball” shows facts from the life of Japan-ball: regulated admiration, respect for judges, pressure of corporate owners on managers, extreme conservatism of the game - and hotdogs are not welcome. <br /> <br /> This also applies to the isolation that any gai-jin - but especially an American athlete, and not people most knowledgeable about foreign cultures - feels like living in Dai Nippon. But the Japanese, for their part, are uncomfortable with foreigners, and they can show it differently (“a gai-jin strike zone,” complains one American player, “more than a buick”). <br /> <br /> The script may not have received a single award, once again playing on the theme “Redemption for an improved game,” but it seemed to me that watching it was much more pleasant than the League. Definitely recommended for those who want to look at this great sport from a different angle.
