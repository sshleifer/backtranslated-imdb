I just adore this movie! I like all the characters, and I can watch them again <br /> <br /> and again ... and I listen to the soundtrack again and again. <br /> <br /> Although I saw him about two years after it was done, and I was never as young as Jeep and company, I can understand them, and I like their stories. And if someone thinks that this film is shit, I disagree and say that it is full of positive energy, friendship and love ... and youth! <br /> <br /> The weekend has landed ... enjoy!
