Last night I was able to see the premiere of this film on MTV, and I had to tell everyone that this film brought thunder. Obviously, this movie will appeal most to D fans, since there are a lot of jokes in it for those who have seen the HBO series, and more than enough D for new fans and a lot of new converts. The music really shines with new songs "Kickapoo" (which is much better than it sounds), "Master Exploder" (maybe the 3rd best song in the world) and "Dude (I miss you all)". There are lots of great scenes (car chase, rock-off, meeting) and cameos (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I really could go for hours, but I do not want to give the film. Go look. You will not be disappointed.
