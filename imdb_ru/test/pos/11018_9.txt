I tuned in to this movie, because there was nothing else to watch. The characters immediately dragged me. <br /> <br /> Robin Tunney is nothing but a spectacle in this film. Her image of a mentally ill woman is both touching and 100% believable. In fact, this kind of thing is not easy to do. She makes it fantastic. <br /> <br /> We know that this film will end tragically early, but you cannot take your eyes off of it. Characters do stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood films, where people do stupid things, because the plot requires it, these people do stupid things, because they are wrong - and what they do is fully consistent with their characters. /> <br /> This is just an excellent example of filmmaking IMHO. Excellent composition, great acting, excellent direction. The film is for people who think that the film may not be just meaningless entertainment.
