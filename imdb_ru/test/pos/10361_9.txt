This film definitely shows something and sheds light on what is happening today in most institutions, and shows how one girl with her newspaper copes with affairs, her editor fully believes in it and does not publish something important, it will hurt her friend ... and when it is the right time, she will take the necessary action. <br /> <br /> The film received 9 points from me, because it has everything, I mean, it keeps you entertained, and besides, they played very well, for a television movie, its really high the quality of the game, which deserves great praise.
