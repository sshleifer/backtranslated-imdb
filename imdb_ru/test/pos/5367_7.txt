When I first saw the Brotherhood of Satan, I was 12 years old, I saw him in a small town in central Washington, where he played before the Tales from the crypt, which we left early because my sisters were already scared from the Brotherhood of Satan ". In general, I thought it was a pretty good movie. The start was good, we just sat down, and this tank made a number on this station wagon. <br /> <br /> What struck me in the film was the landscape around the city in which he was shooting, he looked almost like the area around Chelan, Washington, where I saw the movie, especially when they were driving in the direction of the city of Hillsboro, where the movie is located, a small town in the state of New Mexico. I always liked LQ Jones and Strother Martin, and also Charles Bateman, who participated in Get Smart in another show that I like. I gave the film 7, and later, when I saw The Tales from the Crypt, I thought the Brotherhood of Satan was better.
