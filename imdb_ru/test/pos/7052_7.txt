As a young teenager, when it came out, I was completely in touch with it. As an adult in contemporary American culture obsessed with sex, he does not have enough nudity to be called tame. <br /> <br /> If you need American pastries, obscenity, vulgarity or farting and feces, meatballs will disappoint with impunity and guarantee. <br /> <br /> If you like Bill Murray and you like good net fun, you will probably love this movie. Likewise with the Stripes, Ghostbusters, Caddy Shaqs, etc. <br /> <br /> Enough said, just go take a look and stop intellectualizing. These are meatballs because they cry out loud! Why read the review? Just enjoy it and have fun. And do not pay attention to the empty talk of others. Films, like many other things in life, are subjective. To each his own. <br /> <br /> Always beware of the “expert” who detracts from the taste of others.
