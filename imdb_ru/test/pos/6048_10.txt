By today's standards, DI may seem a bit strange. The Lee Emery version is more accurate. I finished training camp on Parris Island, South Carolina in 1964. Jim Moore is as close to real as you could imagine on screen in 1957. I can not comment on the plot, but I thought the ending was unreal for MCRD. PVT Owens is similar to many who find themselves in a much more difficult situation than he expected. Like many, he joined the Marine Corps for the wrong reasons. My Training Intuctors were more like GySgt Hartman than TSgt Jim Moore. A lot more. DI is more of the Korean era, and Full Metal Jacket is the era of Vietnam. Today's films allow you to do these things on the screen. I have a DI in my collection. I just recently found it on DVD.
