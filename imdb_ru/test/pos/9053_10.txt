Now it is a classic. My friend told me about this film, saying that he is incredibly lame, stupid, backward and moronic. He also said that I would like it. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I found it at Netflix and immediately rented it. I'm just in shock that I have never heard of it before. If I could give him eleven, I would. <br /> <br />
