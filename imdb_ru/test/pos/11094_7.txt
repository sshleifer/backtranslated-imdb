In the film Falcon and Snowman, when they showed Christopher Beuys around the complex, the satellite in the background was a real companion of Richolith, who is now in space. TRW internal images are allowed. TRW also allowed the filming of both the interior and exterior for one of the original Star Trek series. (This is the episode in which Spock is blinded when a series of satellite lights are activated to kill the aliens). Christopher escaped from prison (Lompoc) and was featured in Wanted in America. He drank at the bar when they showed the show. He said, "Hey, it's me." Needless to say, he was captured and transferred to a high-security prison.
