I collect films on Super-8, and last week I managed to capture the full circulation of this film on E-bay. Looks like, at least for the time being, this is the only way to see this film in a country with NTSC videos. I have seen it many times on a DVD of the 2nd region, but I have never seen the 1st one. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching it a few minutes ago, and I'm amazed by this. This is a powerful evidence of freedom and the search for their place in the world. Photography and music were great, and I really felt sympathy for some of the characters. <br /> <br /> I like the idea that I was probably the only one in the United States who watched “When the north wind blows” tonight! <br /> <br /> Long live Avakum !!
