I have never heard of this movie, but I like Heath Ledger and Brian Brown, and the story seemed interesting, so I decided I would try. I found it very pleasant. Heath Ledger plays a 19-year-old boy who does some crappy work and wants to start doing serious tests, so he goes and asks for a job from gangster Brian Brown. I won't go into details, but for Ledger, things are going very badly and he has big problems with Brian Brown. On their side, the film is getting better and better, with one scene where Ledger connects with a pair of bank robbers. And let's not forget the beautiful Rose Byrne, which plays Ledger's love interest. I definitely recommend this movie.
