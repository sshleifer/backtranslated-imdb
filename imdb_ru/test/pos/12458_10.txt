Before I consider this film, I have to make a confession, which is a rather bold statement as a reviewer of the film. Anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that I have always been controversial in a restrained sense, putting high marks for failures such as Captain America and The Creature of 1985, and panning such classic films, like Alistair Sim. "A Christmas Carol" and "Shakespeare in Love". With this in mind, this recognition may not come as a surprise: <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that Christopher Lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. Wow, don't get mad at me. Let me explain: by no means do I think that he is the greatest actor in the world. I clearly admit that it is not. He is, of course, not Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins, but I would say that his acting skills are probably somewhere out there, at least with Bruce Willis. Nevertheless, I admire him - these are the human qualities that he brings to his fighting heroes. He is just an ordinary guy who laughs, cries and bleeds, he is a hero, because he has to be, and not necessarily because he wants to be. In my opinion, it takes a lot to reveal these qualities in character (especially in the films in which he worked), and the heroes of Lambert are far from the heroes of Schwarzennegger or Stallone. Frankly, with Lambert's characters I find it easier to communicate. Therefore, he is not the best actor in the world ... He is just a personal favorite. <br /> <br /> However, I cannot say the same about his films. No matter how much I value his game, it would be foolish not to admit that his choice of films leaves much to be desired. Most of them, frankly, are terrible, and any ridicule he has received from me over the years is not connected with his game, but with his poor choice of scenarios. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, I can say that his debut film “Tarzan” is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance. As I already mentioned, he is effective because of the humanity he brings to the role, and for how seriously the director, the writers and the actors handle the material. This is far from the action adventure with Johnny Weismeller of the 1940s. In fact, I would not call it a fighter. On the contrary, this is a serious drama in which all the materials of E. R. Burrough are taken seriously, demonstrating Tarzan’s desire to open his real family in Scotland after realizing that he is not suitable as a “white monkey”. He is torn between his old family and the new, in which in his last role there is the wonderful Sir Ralph Richardson. In an attempt to adapt to humans, his monkey instincts are also included, and he cannot decide that he loves more: his real family or the one he always knows. Overall, this is a great commentary on society and a wonderful character study. <br /> <br /> If you say nothing else, this led Lambert to international fame, which lasted until the 1980s with films like "Highlander" and "He is Sicilian." Unfortunately, it did not last long. But just wait a bit ... His recent career moves, such as Gideon and Resurrection, proved that, although he still had a long way to go, he was a competent enough actor to possibly have the opportunity ... hmm .. .. come back if he just chooses his roles better. <br /> <br /> For now, here is the verdict of his first movie: <br /> <br /> *** of ****
