I have to admit that I had low expectations from this film. But I was surprised to find it interesting, interesting and fun. This is an entertaining thriller, not a horror movie. There were moments that made my hair stand up! Even better, however, there were very funny, sometimes hysterical, comedic moments in the film (you'll know what I'm talking about). There are also some great special effects (and humor and special effects are not necessarily separated). <br /> <br /> Overall, the game is very good - better than a typical low-budget horror movie. In particular, the lead role (Jackie) and many minor roles (for example, a lawyer, a couple living next door, a pizzeria) are well played. If they were not, the film would not have supported my interest, and I would have lost faith in the story. This is a good, interesting low-budget thriller, which you should definitely rent!
