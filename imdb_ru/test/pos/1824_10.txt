It was 1983, and I was 13 years old. One evening I was watching Valley Girl on HBO when my parents were working. After this ended, I wanted to immediately talk to someone about it. It turns out that my best friend also watched him, and he became our favorite movie. Every weekend after that, we watched it until we could read it. We woke her parents late at night, laughing hysterically. We started to worship the main character, Julie, played by the beautiful Deborah Foreman. I'm not saying that this is a great classic. Although it is for me personally. And I understand that the whole conversation with the girl from the Valley becomes annoying, but it was the 80s. But the film is deeply based on a love story, and a friend, but a good one. The girl meets the boy and sparks appear on both sides, instant communication. Julie's friends do not like him - he does not fit, does not go to school, he has no money. They love her more with their ex-boyfriend football player, although he is an idiot. She makes the most sacrifice - her own happiness for the happiness of her friends. And she has these really cool supporting hippie parents. This is one of the first films of Nicolas Cage and his first major role. In one minute, he is absolutely cheerful, and the next - incredibly touching and romantic. His friend Fred is also pretty funny. If you were a teenager in the 80s, you would love this movie, or at least it will give you back memories. It's not my favorite movie anymore, but it's still one of my favorites, probably in the top 10. I look forward to his DVD release if they ever release it. You can go to Deborah Foreman's website to sign the petition so that it will be released on DVD, and there are 2 soundtracks from the film, which you definitely have to be if you like 80s music.
