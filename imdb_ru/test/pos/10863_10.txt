Velvet Tips were issued in the UK just three weeks ago, and I’m already watching countless letters fill national newspapers and TV guides, claiming that they have a delicate plot, weak characteristics, and an even weaker script. <br /> <You found me outraged. This is heresy. <br /> <br /> I really would like to dispel all doubts by congratulating Andrew Davis for letting Jeffrey Sax create this wonderful dramatization of Sarah Waters’s novel, backing it up with such a fantastic script. Kudos. But I am afraid that now I need to change tactics. <br /> <br /> I have seen one of the leading television guides here in the UK (who will remain nameless), relentlessly describing Velvet Tips as a “lesbian love story”. If they are, and I assume that they are trying to increase interest in the film, then this is absolutely the wrong way (with the exception of a phrase that causes a frustratingly inaccurate description). Speaking of such things, they either a) turn away those who are instinctively repelled by "this" subject, or b) attract a class of people who will only look to see some kind of "serious action of a girl on a girl." Buy a video! Thanks to this serious inattention, this and other journals make it cheaper which is a brilliant adaptation of one of the greatest works of recent literature. Tips velvet is a story of love, passion, movement, loss and a broken heart. This is not a lesbian love story. No syria. <br /> <br /> The end result is a stylish affair with great performances around the world (especially from Stirling, Hows, Chancellor and May). From the point of view of direction, it is intoxicating and immersing - sometimes it develops quickly, sometimes it does not - but it never ceases to be something less than irresistible. In general, it is polished and well delivered, sex is performed with tenderness and delicacy - and although many will not accept it as a real “movie”, it will remain one of my favorites for some time.
