Seeing how John is preparing this one-of-a-kind performance, I had to share ... There was really something to watch as an adult man portraying himself as a child. I like the fact that with every character he became, you can imagine , what does he look like. It is more interesting when you can understand a person. "Freak" - this is what should be a real "stand up." John REAL talent.
