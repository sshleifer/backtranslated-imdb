You will either love or hate films such as this thriller, set in a lonely refuge in a distant lonely country. This is not so much a horror show, as a mixture of frightening images and psychosis. “Scream” is the best term to use in what has obviously been a popular driving classic known as strange and evil behavior. Pay attention to the "judge" who is going to put an ax behind the doctor! Brr-rr-rr !!! Here you can describe nothing but some kind of damn delicious perfection, but when you have a chance, remember the familiar old saying of a quirky lady: “Get out! Get out! And never come back! ”. Don't you want you not to look into the basement?
