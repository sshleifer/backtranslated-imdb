With the end of World War II, film studios quickly hurried to focus on returning home to veterinarians. "The best years of our life" was probably the best example. It depicts various people returning home, and how they have to adapt not only to their pre-war life, but to the whole changing world. Probably the most interesting cast is the non-actor Harold Russell. Having lost his hands in the war, he plays a man with hooks where his hands used to be, and reminds people that he wants to be treated the same as everyone else; he won Best Supporting Actor and a special Oscar for this role, which made him the only person who won two Oscars for the same role. There will probably always be debates about whether this deserved better picture deserves more than “It's a wonderful life,” but I certainly think that they did a good job with it. Very well done.
