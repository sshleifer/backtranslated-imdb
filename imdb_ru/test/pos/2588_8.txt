We just saw this film, previewed before the release at the Film Forum in Norfolk (Va.), And there was general agreement on two issues: there were excellent performances in the first-class drama by the two leading and the other: and catastrophe. We saw a grim poster with chains and a thought-provoking comment implying some kind of bizarre sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci, while the film has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas. What is sad is that people looking around for porn will be painted over to watch the movie and be disappointed because it will be too “heavy” for them, while people who really like it will not be caught dead going to the theater showing it. Very bad. Good movie wasted.
