When I watched this movie again, I think it belongs to Hitchcock's greatest films. The first time I saw this, I was just amazed at the uncertainty, the action and the images. It has an exciting finish, an insane killer, an innocent person created or pursued by circumstances, some big shots in place, for example. Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. It also has big supporting actors with Hitch Patricia’s daughter as younger sister Ruth Roman and steadfast Leo J. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock films. The episode with the carousels near the end is one of the most nervous in Hitchcock's work. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony (his last full-length film) gives an excellent impression as crazy. A stranger on the train who bursts into the life of the unsuspecting tennis star Guy Haynes (Farley Granger). Granger plays a good guy who is stuck in a dirty divorce. The film begins with a camera showing the shoes of two separate men who leave the taxi to catch the train. In the end, they meet, and the story takes over. The stranger takes an unusual interest in a tennis star, and as the film continues, the stranger becomes a pursuer. The action moves from place to place, including Washington, the fictional little town of Metcalfe, the Forest Hills Tennis Championships and the passenger train that takes two leading men back and forth to different missions. Towards the end, the pace of the game of tennis is woven into the story as they rush over time. The camera cuts off the faces of athletes when they gulp and serves a wonderful series of shots. When the close match is over, the climate chase begins. Hitchcock loves trains, and it's nice to see that Penn Station is long gone. Trains are featured in “39 Steps,” “Lady Fading,” “Shadow of Doubt,” “Spell,” “North to Northwest,” and in this film. <br /> <br /> This classic Hitchcock thriller occurred at the beginning of a great creative period for the master of the unknown — the 1950s, and I am convinced that one day he will be sent to the Hitchcock Hall of Fame. ,
