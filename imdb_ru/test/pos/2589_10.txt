Having just received the Loony Tunes Gold Collection (by the way, I STRONGLY recommend), I will try to comment on most, if not all, cartoons individually. Thus, the initial statement may seem superfluous for those who read several reviews about them, for which I apologize. <br /> <br /> Rabbit seasoning is the middle shorts in the short-minded trilogy (the other two are "Rabbit Fire" and "Duck! Rabbit, Duck). Baggs and Duffy are arguing about who Elmer Fadd should cut. makes me laugh EVERY ONCE !!! There is a comment on the DVD, a function and the ability to play only music. <br /> <br /> My rating: A + <br /> <br /> Additional info on DVD: Disc 1: introduction of Chuck Jones; Part 1 "The boy of the termite territory"; clips from the films "Two guys from Texas." and "My dream is yours", both with Bugs cameos; Sequences of bridges for the episode "Bugs Bunny Show"; Astro Nuts audio; 2 vintage trailers; "Blooper Bunny: Bugs Bunny 51 and a half anniversaries" with additional commentary from writer Greg Ford and picture gallery
