Franklins Forgiveness is the best film I've seen in recent years. The game was fantastic ... especially Marie Blackwell, who was really great in the role of Peggy Leicester. She brought Peggy to life with incredible skill and made her as real as my closest neighbor. I also liked Robertson Dean in the role of father ... he is a true professional, and he managed to shoot even the most intimate scenes with rare grace. The performances of the entire cast were very good, excellent, but the role of Peggy performed by Blackwell made the film. Cinematography was beautifully made everywhere and was most impressive. The only criticism I can offer is the slight weakness of the final scenes, which were overly long, repetitive and too focused on the wrong character. I would like it to end on a note of forgiveness ... but, despite this small flaw, it is very worthwhile for him to be watched and applauded to all who received him.
