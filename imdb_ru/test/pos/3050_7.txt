An evil earthly baron delivers water to a group of ranchers to try to pick up their property for a penny for a dollar. Singin 'Sandy Saunders (John Wayne), who saves the day for Gabby Hayes and his daughter, comes under the guise of the newest fighter of the villain. <br /> <br /> The first of sixteen films that Wayne made for the Lone Star / Monogram Pictures, it tries to present him as a singing cowboy, only with a clearly synchronized voice. The title page depicts his character "Singin 'Sandy", which leads one to believe that he should have been the first in the proposed series! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's funny, but it's also very interesting to see Wayne singing songs and firing rifles, especially when he gets a little drunk before shooting at him with a fighter Earl Dwyer. <br /> <br /> In Riders Of Destiny there is a rare villainous role for Al "Fuzzy" St. John, with the bad guys fooling as much as he, playing a heroic girlfriend, riding with Buster Crabbe and Lash LaRue.
