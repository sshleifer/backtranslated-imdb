I really liked this movie, and I think most fans of Lauren Ambrose too. Her character is much softer than her role in Six Feet Under, and all performances are strong. I especially liked how the role of Emily, a mentally retarded scientist, was handled. Despite some other misinformed user reviews, the role was played accurately and without clich√© by actress Taylor Roberts. Also outstanding was Fran Krantz, whose natural lightness well complemented the more experienced actors of the season. Although the direction here or there was difficult, it seemed that the only problems were with an underdeveloped scenario. What may have worked well as a theatrical production was not well kept on the screen. However, Paul Ryan's excellent cinematography definitely compensates for this, as well as the pace of the film, which is surprisingly not slow. I recommend this movie to fans below six feet, as well as lovers of good acting and cinematography.
