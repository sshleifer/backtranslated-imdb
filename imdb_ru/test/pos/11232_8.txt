When Northfork debuted at the Cannes Film Festival, many did not like it, because they felt that it was boring and too slow. Although I agree that it was slow (one of the slowest films of the year), it was by no means boring. As Roger Ebert said, “there has never been a movie like Northfork.” I usually disagree with Ebert, but this time he is telling the truth. Although John Sales’s “Sunshine State” may have some of the same immediate themes, nothing I have ever seen or known can compare with the striking originality of the northern fork of the Polish brothers. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a perfect example of how many times it is better to spend the extra few minutes to go to a feature film instead of the last Jack Black film. The plot is not some hackneyed plot for cookies; it is so strikingly original. In a small town in the state of Montana, called North Fork, there is a dam nearby, which will soon be destroyed. Therefore, the whole city must be evacuated. However, some people just do not want to leave. On the side plot, a young orphan (Duel Farns) is very sick and bedridden; his father takes care of him Harlan (Nick Nolte). The boy imagines himself to be a fallen angel, so to speak, who helps him cope with the disease. <br /> <br /> Although most of the film is simple, some of them may give David Lynch an escape for his money. There are strange weather conditions, strange, wooden, a huge dog thing and symbolism that would make Fellini proud. It's not as confusing as the Lynch movie, but still rather strange. That's what makes Northfork so wonderful: it is so unusual, but at the same time so simple and believable. <br /> <br /> Northfork has a magical feeling: it’s almost as if you’re watching something that you’re not quite sure what it is, but you feel fascinated by it. As I said earlier, I agreed with Ebert that this film is different from any other. However, I disagree when he says that this is “not interesting.” He goes on to say that this is just "fascinating." Maybe he just thought he should give him good reviews, because everyone else is like that, but instead of how slow it was, I still thought it was very interesting, which many dramas can't do now. <br /> <br /> Northfork may not be the fastest movie or the most popular movie, but if you can get to it and go through it, you will be very surprised, like me. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> PG-13 for short sexuality.
