People who do not like this film seem to have an academic vendetta against it - those of us who do not own the original can fully enjoy it. <br /> <br /> My husband, who has never seen the original, said: "I don’t want to watch a girl movie." I assured him that "women" was just a great movie, not a movie about girls. He had a great time. He was very glad that he had left and enjoyed it more than the “boyish” film that we saw the day before “burn after reading”. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: I even think that the new final is better. Maybe not so fun, but it was beautiful. At first I could not understand why they made certain changes in the plot <br /> <br />, but when I finished, and Debra Messing gave birth to the first man and brought the film into the film, I started crying. Is this one thing to love men? they are our sons.
