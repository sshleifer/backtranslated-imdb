This is my favorite movie, because so much is happening that you don’t see at the beginning, and there are so many things that make you think: “Did Kislowski mean this or it in my head?” For example, the judge should be God or then a higher being? <br /> <br /> Irina Jacob, as in “The Double Life of Veronica”, is outstanding, maybe there are some seemingly more attractive actresses, but no one can convey the beauty of the spirit and physical beauty like hers. <br /> <br /> Tritinnant is also great, although he says little, and what he says is excellent, for example, his answer to Valentina. , , "Be".
