I really enjoyed this show. I never understood why this is called Bug Juice. I should have been about 13 years old when he came out. I remember that they ran it during the summer holidays on Channel 4, between the reruns of Pugwalls Summer and Saved by the bell or something like that. I remember sitting there and wanted me to be in summer camp too - haha. All the children in it seemed to have so much fun that it was all about “finding out who you are” and “growing up”. First kisses and all that. I remember that this really sweet guy was in him, I think he was the main reason I woke up in the mornings that summer. They should have more teenage soap for papers like this, I thought it was great!
