I once commented on this great Chucky, but I had to do it again to say something about the film when I first saw it on a large balcony in a large theater. The film was very funny in the theater and my first film about Chucky in the theater, and it was a special moment for me because I value Chucky. Other horror villains are cited with GREAT COOLING !!! And the blood was amazingly great! The scene where the cheerful child was nailed by a truck was amazingly fun! It was a great bloody scene !!!!! And the final was so strange and shocking that I * s @% @ pants. The idea of ​​having Chucky Seed was very, very strange and shocking! When I left the theater, I just liked it, and I could not believe that it was real. The whimsical and different qualities of this book “Children's Game” for some reason made me note it as the series “Jason Goes to Hell of Children's Game”. It was just incredibly shocking, weird and great quality that reminded me of Jason. Confident ***** of *****. Here's how I rate the series: 1,4,2,3. I liked it, but not as much as the original children's classic Tom Holland. I can't wait for Seeds Chucky! Come on!
