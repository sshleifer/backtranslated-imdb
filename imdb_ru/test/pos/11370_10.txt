I saw this mini-series when I was in high school. I remember it as absolutely brilliant and compelling. At the time, I did not know any of the British actors in the series, but since then I learned that some of today's stars played in it, including Sean Connery (the original James Bond among many other roles), Judy Dench (Queen Elizabeth in "Shakespeare" in love "among many other roles) and Eileen Atkins (probably best known for creating" Above / Down ", but also excellent in many acting roles). Like the other commentator, I would like to see it again. I'm sure that production remains timeless, and I hope that it was about or will be released on VHS or DVD. If you have a chance to see it, do not miss.
