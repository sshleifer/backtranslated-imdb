The Merchant of Venice is one of the most famous plays of Shakespeare, and it still sounds regularly in the theater. It is incredible, however, that this film would seem to be the first ever English-language version created for the cinema, and not for television. In the early years of the cinema, there were several versions made in Britain or America, but they were all silent. <br /> <br /> The reason for this neglect of the play may be related to sensitivity to the intended play. anti-Semitism, a topic that has become even more sensitive since the Nazis came to power in 1933. (This may explain why all previous versions were made in an era of silence; in 1908 or 1922, it would have been easier to portray Shylock as a direct villain than it would be today). However, in my opinion, the film is not anti-Semitic at all. It should be remembered that during Shakespeare’s life in England there was no solid Jewish community; The Jews were expelled by Edward I at the end of the 13th century, and they were not allowed to return until the time of Cromwell, some forty years after the death of Shakespeare. As far as we know, Shakespeare never went abroad, so it is quite possible that he himself never knew a single Jew and did not experience the influence of anti-Semitism. The play is not just about the Jewish question, but, among other things, an analysis of the devastating effects of religious prejudice. In fact, it could be a coded study of mutual antipathy between Catholics and Protestants in Tudor England (something Shakespeare would have had direct experience about) and a call for greater tolerance between them. <br /> <br /> Then, as now, traditional anti-Semitic stereotypes have always portrayed Jews as miserly, but Shylock’s main sin is not greed; if that were the case, he would certainly accept Bassanio’s offer to pay him six thousand ducats, twice as much as Antonio had lent. Rather, Shylock's besieged sin is anger, and the root of his anger lies in the way Christians in Venice treat him and his fellow Jews. Not only are Jews generally considered second-class citizens, but Jewish moneylenders, such as Shylock, are special objects of abuse, although the services they provide are necessary for the Venetian economy. The play shows the corrupting effects of prejudice. Such attitudes not only corrupt the Christians who hold them, they can also corrupt the Jews who are subjected to violence. Shylock's vengefulness is incommensurable with the offenses he suffered. Spitting on him and calling him a dog, Antonio behaves like a boorish fanatic, but rudeness and fanaticism are usually not considered crimes that deserve the death penalty. Moreover, Shylock seeks to take revenge on Antonio not only for the undoubted mistakes that Antonio made with him, but also for all the flaws, real and imaginary, which he suffered from the Christian community, such as the marriage of his daughter. Lorenzo. <br /> <br /> To the credit of director film Michael Redford and his star Al Pacino, they understand all these problems. Initially, Shaylock Pacino has a kind of wrathful dignity, which is gradually replaced by vengeful anger, and finally, after his humiliation on the stage, tested by Portia’s reasoning, to pathos. We clearly see that he was a tool of his own destruction, but we can still sympathize with him. In my opinion, none of the representations of Pacino, which I saw, never was one that he gave in the first two films “The Godfather” (not “The Scent of a Woman”, for which he received an Oscar and, of course, not Godfather III "). But “The Venetian merchant is the one who comes closest to these criteria. Another outstanding acting performance was the bright Portia Lynn Collins, who expressed her lines with great clarity and simplicity and revealed the intellect and resourcefulness that make her character not just a romantic heroine. I was less impressed by Antonio Jeremy Irons, who seemed too passive. Antonio is a complex character; partly loyal friend, partly contemplative longing, partly religious fanatic, and partly enterprising capitalist. Although Irons embraced the first two of these aspects, it was hard to imagine that his Antonio would either give a damn about someone else’s faith, or risk everything in risky merchants. <br /> <br /> The Daily Telegraph film critic attacked Redford, who, although he admired the game of Pacino, disliked the period and argued that Shakespeare should be placed in a modern setting if it should be “relevant” for a modern audience, referring to a recent stage play that marked the beginning of action in Weimar Germany. I disagree with this approach. Theater and cinema are completely different media, and although cinema has several striking modernist approaches to Shakespeare (recalling Trevor Nunn's Twelfth Night), the traditionalist approach is often the best. (I preferred, for example, “Romeo and Juliet” by Zeffirelli Baz Luhrmann). The idea that we can only appreciate Shakespeare in a modern way is pure intellectual laziness; we are not ready to make efforts to see our greatest writer in the context of the Elizabethan society that created him, but we prefer that he be dressed as a twelfth-century ersatz man. <br /> <br /> The traditional approach of Redford not only allows us to realize that fanaticism and vindictiveness are long-standing, universal problems, but also makes the film visually striking. In the play, the scenes in Venice itself are characterized by turbulent action; those in the Portia country house in Belmont are happier and calmer. In the film, the Venetian exterior scenes were shot on the spot against the backdrop of a foggy winter gray sky, similar to what was achieved in Do Not Look Now. The candlelit interiors with brightly lit faces against a dark background resembled the chiaroscuro effect on the Caravaggio painting; I suspect that this was quite intentional, since Caravaggio was a contemporary of Shakespeare. Unlike dark or foggy Venice, Belmont scenes (shot in a charming Palladian villa on an island in a lake) were characterized by sunshine or peaceful moonlight. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best adaptations of Shakespeare in recent years; A smart and visually appealing look at a challenging game. 8/10. <br /> <br /> A couple of mistakes. We see a black swan on the water in front of Portia's house. These birds are native to Australia and were not brought to Europe until 1596, when the film will be set. Also the portrait of Portia in a lead box is written in the style of the Florentine Botticelli, which was active about a century before this date. Lynn Collins may resemble Botticelli's beauty, but it is unlikely that a Venetian lady of the late 16th century would paint herself the same way as Florence of the late 15th century.
