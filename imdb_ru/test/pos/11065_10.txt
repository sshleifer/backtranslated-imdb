I gave this film 10 simply because of my ill obsession with Ingrid Bergman :) lol. I really think that she was the best actress ever to decorate this land with her talent, and all her films are absolutely wonderful (even when they are terrible) because IT is in them. If it were not for her and Vivien Leigh (as I heard), I would give her 9.0. Just because I love Viv, but probably not as much as Ingrid. And any other actress would do it, maybe 6. This is a good story, two wild people fall in love with a society where it is bad to be bad. Reminds me a little of GWTW except for the permeated higher-level attitude. Gary Cooper, as usual, is very beautiful, and, of course, his voice never changes the whole movie, but hey, Ingrid, makes him sound so amazing and fast and 20 times hotter than he probably should be.
