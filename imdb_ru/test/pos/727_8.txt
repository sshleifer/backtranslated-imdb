Crude sharp thriller, aimed at great philosophical heights, which he could not reach. I still really liked the movie. He had wonderful elements of expectation, leaving me with that wonderful coldness in the spine, which I expect from thrillers, and he achieved this psychologically without resorting to escalating blood and blood. The soundtrack and settings added to the waiting is excellent. From time to time it was a bit incomplete, especially acting and character development. It could be a better movie if we knew more about the nightmares that the characters see when they close their eyes, and why they feel a desperate need to look for the “answer” that is so integral to the storyline. In the end, they seemed to continue to search for him, even though they knew, or at least assumed, what might happen when they find him. I would recommend watching this film if you are ready to look further to see the potential of a diamond in rough diamonds.
