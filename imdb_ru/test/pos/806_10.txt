This film deserves 20/10 if I could give one. "THE HOLLOW" is a great novel by Hercules Poirot, and the turn at the end is fooling most people. I am very glad that this film has remained absolutely faithful to the novel. There was no big difference that I could notice. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced into history earlier than in the novel. The game was excellent, and the music, as usual, was of amazing quality! David Suchet is flawless in his role, and the rest of the actors are also flawless in their roles. In no other film that I have seen so far, Poirot was portrayed so brilliantly! I take off my hat to the producers - they shot the film, which I, along with many will keep for a long time!
