If I had to decide which film Ernest was the best, and not behave as if it did not happen, it will be like this all the time. <br /> <br /> All Ernest films are interesting. But the best of them are those with whom Jim Varney plays different characters. In addition, as is well known, I enjoy the comedy style of Bill Bayra and Gailard Sartain as Chuck and Bobby Tulip brothers. "Ernest goes to jail" contains all these elements, as well as a funny script and supporting cast, in which several favorite characters participate. <br /> <br /> That's why I chose “Ernest goes to jail” the king of all Ernest films. Do not agree with me if you want, but deep down you know that I am right.
