Since Babylon 5, J. Michael Strazhinsky has not captured the remarkable art of applying a storyline to a television show. This is easily the best thing on television right now! Characters are pleasant, and it is easy to attach to them and take care of their well-being. The Willians are the type you love to hate, and you wonder what they are aiming for. And Brian Jensen's doll work is the most innovative of all. Kudos to Rocky S. O'Bannon for a job well done!
