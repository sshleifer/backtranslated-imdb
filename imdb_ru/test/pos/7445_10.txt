Did not play the game? Do not worry This is for fans of Final Fantasy VII, who won the game, and no one else will appreciate this rare gem of the film. Want to see and love? Buy a game, beat it, and then watch. When was the last time you saw a great movie on a video game? Well that's all. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds two years after the game, and brief results are not given to refresh your memory (although I doubt that many will forget about it) and leave in one hour and Forty-One Minute Adventures . <br /> <br /> All your favorite characters are here, even Kate Sith. The voice acting is gorgeous in the Japanese version, each character is played perfectly. The clouds sound hard and thoughtful, Tifa sounds good, but strongly ... Aeris is also beautiful, it sounds exactly as I imagined. Cait Sith doesn't sound as cute as I imagined, but it worked very well. <br /> <br /> Character models are impressive, with excellent textures and lighting. The environment is breathtaking, and the battles are put in such a way as to make the Matrix blush. Amazing camera work manifests itself, for example, in bicycle chases, when your eyes just scream with pleasure, and your lungs breathe heavily without consent. <br /> <br /> Music of typical Uematsu quality, which means its highest level. , Familiar tunes are redesigned to accompany Advent Children's' graphic jump, which blends very well with the visual aspects. There is even a joke for fans that is related to music, it will surely make you smile. <br /> <br /> I didn’t watch it with subtitles, because I’m half Japanese, so I can't say it. subtitles are good. However, the Japanese language dialogue is very good, and every word sounds like it comes from real living beings, and not just actors. Impressive. One day I will look at it again with subtitles to see the differences, since I played in the Japanese and American editions of Final Fantasy VII. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Final Fantasy VII, buy this film the day it comes out or make a reservation. If you have not played the game yet, but you want to watch this movie very badly, do not waste your time: buy the game, beat it, and then return to this DVD. I will not tell you not to watch it, but to play a game. It will make this experience much better and will not leave you in the dust, scratching your head. <br /> <br /> Come back, old friends - it's time to go on an adventure again with your brave comrades!
