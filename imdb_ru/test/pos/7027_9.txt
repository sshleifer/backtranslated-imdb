Dirty dances follow the story of Francis "The Kid" Housemaids (Jennifer Gray) and her family when they spend the summer at the Kellerman Family Summer Camp. We see how she discovers herself when she falls in love with dance teacher Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). <br /> <br /> The film is full of wonderful dances (hence the name!), Great music, and a stunning landscape. He solves some difficult problems with dignity and grace and, of course, has (a shocking spoiler here!) A happy, wonderful, pleasant ending! You know how it will end from the very beginning, but this is not the point. The bottom line is that it is a journey, a journey that affects every family member. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films that I need to watch when he goes on TV ... not to mention the fact that I already have it. remember!
