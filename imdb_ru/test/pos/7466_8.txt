This evening I had the honor of watching the film “These Girls” at the Philadelphia Film Festival. Going into the film, I knew very little about it and just took a chance, because the plot of the film sounded interesting. So when I entered the theater just a few hours ago, I wondered what the final verdict would be: thumbs up or down. <br /> <br /> “These girls” is a story about three best friends from a small town. Keira (Caroline Dhavernas) is a leader who basically doesn’t know what to do with her life after school, but her father continues to push her into college, which she doesn’t want to do. Lisa (Holly Lewis) will go to a Christian school after the summer. And finally, Glory (Amanda Walsh), who plans to hold a summer nanny. But this summer will be special because they are all blackmailing Keith Clarke (David Boreanaz), the sexy older guy for whom they sit with their children. There are funny times and lots of laughter ?? <br /> <br /> I usually don’t like movies like “These Girls,” but there’s something in this movie that I really liked. I think the quality I liked the most was that it seemed pretty realistic. Three girls who want to explore their sexuality choose a healthy guy who allows all of them to have sex with him so that they can be blackmailed. It's a pretty funny story about growing up, friendship and sex, but, despite the fact that it sounds pretty funny, I see that most of the films are happening in real life. <br /> <br /> The plot here is probably the main reason the film did not receive mass release in the United States. It is assumed that all the girls in this film are younger than 18 years old, and if I remember correctly, two of them are 17 years old, and one is 16 years old. Now in the US, although minors have sex every day, many production or financial companies do not finance such a film because of their sexual content. This information was actually confirmed by director John Hazlett in the Q & A after the film. What attracts me is that the sex scenes in this film are not graphic, but the nude is insignificant. Not to mention that all the actresses in this film in real life are over 18 years old. Go figure it out. <br /> <br /> What the film does best is a lot of laughter, as well as very strong characters. I liked all the characters in this film, and each character had a “now and then” feature. The jokes were funny because they were cleverly written, and not because they were dirty or excessive. It seemed that everything was perfectly combined in comedy and drama. The script was very strong. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the game was very good. I thought all three girls were great. Caroline Dhavernas, who also starred in one of the most underrated TV shows of all time, “Miracles”, was simply amazing; as well as Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh, who both did a great job. David Boreanaz did a good job and he looked like he was having fun shooting most of the scenes. The guy played with his head, so it was fun to see how he plays this role. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of meeting tonight with John Hazlett, who looked like a very nice guy and was very grateful for the comments made about the film. I'm shocked that this film has not gone away. I think, with a little marketing behind, it might take off. Unfortunately, it will be one of these direct movies on DVD, which so few people will ever have the pleasure to see. I think what a small budget Mr. Hazlett had to work with, the film turned out to be successful, and I think that he did an excellent job with directing this little pearl. <br /> <br /> For someone who usually hates teen comedies, which I can honestly say, I really liked this movie. Character development and a witty script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and be surprised. This is a good comedy because it has a heart and love for it. I know that I will definitely buy this film when it will be released on DVD on May 16, 2006. If you are a fan of adult stories, comedies about sex or romantic comedies, be sure to watch this movie because it is one. of the funniest movies of this kind that will be released over the years. <br /> <br /> The final rating of MovieManMenzel for These Girls is 8/10.
