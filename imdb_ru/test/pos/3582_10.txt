The entire series, and not just Blue Planet, is simply amazing. The best natural TV show we have ever seen. The episode at depth looks like a trip to space! We watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys, and all four of us could not put it down. We read a negative comment about this and could not believe it. There is so much new information that we never learned in school. It is also the best view that we have seen from any television or film on the delicate balance of our landâ€™s ecosystem. The time and effort spent on taking these pictures is very obvious when you sit down and watch this series. <br /> <br /> Be sure to take a look.
