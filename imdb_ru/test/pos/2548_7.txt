I can not say that it was not done well. At a recent film festival, the director admitted that some scenes shot 30 takes. And there is not the slightest sign that he did not get exactly what he wanted. But this strange non-Hispanic film is the same as West Side Story was many years ago. Both leaders, the brother-sister team, are excellent and memorable in their roles. The environment, a kind of underground car repair area in Queens, is completely alien to most people and is worth the price of an entrance ticket in and of itself. But there is something unsatisfactory about the key issue of the film, namely, what, in her sister’s opinion, she must do to get along. I can understand my brother’s reaction, but it seems too easy for me. It seems the film suggests that such people do not need our help, that they will find a way to survive without the usual support systems. I do not urge anyone to believe in it. There will be much more resistance to the choices made here than is depicted. Besides this, as entertainment, it works well. As an accurate idea of ​​culture, I think, not very well.
