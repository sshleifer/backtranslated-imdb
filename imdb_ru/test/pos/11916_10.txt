This film is a great example of a great escape! I really liked this movie, and it was retracted from the start. Of course, this is just an action movie, but isn't it interesting what is watching movies? <br /> <br /> The cast of this film is very strong with nice characters. The friendship between the boys is so realistic and attractive, it is gratifying and fun to see how a group of teenagers interact - especially this group of boys !! Sean Astin makes a great rebel, successfully avoiding being a premature teenager. <br /> <br /> If you want to have some fun, watch this movie! I thoroughly enjoyed it, although I watched it on a very dirty and old VHS, which was of terrible quality (Go DVD!)
