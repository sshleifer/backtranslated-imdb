My roommate and I received free pre-selection tickets. I think you would have called the Atlantic Station in Atlanta, Georgia. Walking, I was expecting something controversial, provocative, overly overzealous, and so on. But the film is much more than that. This is a story about two people helping each other. This is not exaggerated, and the film is made in careful balance so as not to make you cringe or say that it is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> He is very well assembled and does not take himself too seriously. This is the beauty of it. If he tried to take himself seriously, he would fail miserably, but instead he carries himself through humor (some unintended) and Ricci's surprisingly good behavior. Although Timberlake fails miserably in his role, the film is good enough to put him on the side. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this film if it were not for some other reason than that it is something else to experience.
