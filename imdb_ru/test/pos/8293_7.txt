This is definitely a good film, beautifully photographed and memorable. And yet, of course, you should criticize him and Mizoguchi, because he is not without flaws and flaws. Mizoguchi really cared for women and wanted to make statements about the lack of sympathy and complete cruelty of a man, but sometimes he is ahead of himself, trying to make this statement by adopting the wrong means. This undoubtedly refers to “Crucified Lovers”, “Princess Yang Kwei Fei” and “Zankiku Monogatari”. He sets up the script in feudal Japan, which leaves the viewer at the end with a partially right exclamation: “Boy, feudalism sucks, I'm glad it's over ...”. Indeed, some of the scenarios of such weaker Mizoguchi films would be impossible today. In addition, his female characters sometimes become the archetypes of unrealistic self-sacrifice, which also makes the script less attractive. Having said that “Crucified Lovers” is a good film, with so few relative flaws, although the screenwriter sometimes helps Wyinde cool, cynical prose helps this film. I still very much prefer and recommend Mizoguchi’s “realistic” and “modern” films of 1936: Elega Osaka and Sisters Gion, as well as his late masterpieces, in which he showed more restraint and subtlety: Goetsu Sansho Dai "And" Life Oaru.
