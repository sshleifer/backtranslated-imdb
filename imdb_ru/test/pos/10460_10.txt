I do not need to repeat the brief review made by Glenn. The black and white program is even more powerful in depicting the gloominess of the village life of the village at that time. The deep measure of friendship, manifested by Babette in relation to two older sisters, touches the strings of the heart. The auxiliary cast is excellent, and their characteristics are excellent, it would be unfair to single out any one character, since the whole story depends on the cast as a whole. I cannot say exactly why I appreciate this film so highly, because I am not a professional critic; Some viewers may agree or disagree with my rating, because watching films of this type is always in the eyes of viewers.
