Betty is a backup in the production of “Macbeth” by Verdi, who is asked to continue when the diva suffers in a car accident. However, in the great tradition of the Scottish play, the production seems damned because of the problems, not least because some madman is splitting the team. Unfortunately for Betty, the killer seems to have special plans for her ... <br /> <br /> This is one of several must-see insane murderers of Argento, in this case primarily for an extraordinary photograph of the great Britons. cameraman ronnie taylor I didn’t measure it, but I think that about two thirds of the frames in this film are pots, carts, tracking or taps — the sheer number of camera movements is simply amazing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than the standard thriller. Images wild and dizzy - close-up of the heroine's eyes, opened with nails, a sliding flight around the opera house from the point of view of a raven, killer's brain shots wriggling in the brain, a bullet fired at the peephole, the victim’s dug-in trachea. Conceptually, this is just awesome and can only be realized by this director. The film is not without some flaws; The composition of the actors is variable at best - both Marsillah and Barberini are a bit shaky (and his dubbing in the English version is terrible, even by Italian standards), although the permanent Argento Nicolodi is fun, and Charleson thoughtfully plays a role that more than a little autobiographical ( the horror director, who was very offended by his remoteness and reliance on technology). The material is a pleasant three-sided blend of Phantom of the Opera, Shakespeare and Slasher, written by the script of Argento and his regular collaborator Franco Ferrini, with perverted suspicious abundance and usual contempt for boring plot scenes to explain what actually happens, Full of all kinds of different music - Brian Eno, Claudio Simonetti, Bill Wyman, Puccini and, of course, Verdi. The scenes in the beautiful opera house were filmed at the Reggio Theater in Parma. For some strange reason, the British print of this film has the alternate name “Terror at the Opera.”
