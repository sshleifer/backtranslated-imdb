The sequence of tricks (as well as the special effects) in this movie are great. Michael Scherer has to be one of the BEST stunt coordinators of all time. The explosion in the cafe is a wonderful combination of tricks, special effects and visual effects. The director had an idea that the crew managed to create on the film. <br /> <br /> Also; Donald Sutherland makes one of his best performances in this film .......
