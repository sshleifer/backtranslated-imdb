I caught this show a few times when I was young, and it was tilting, My parents liked it, and now in syndication, I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and the twilight zone (new and old) could not do. This show used old ideas and some really original ideas. <br /> <br /> I still can't believe that Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright did this. These guys were producers of StarGate SG-1. The show kept the audience in the plot and created a truly terrible atmosphere. This is something that was not in the new twilight zone. The serling added to the down and the dog added roughness to it, and the forest, which had risen, raised the spirits. <br /> <br /> Ending, good or bad, made a terrible time. You could never predict what was going to happen. I'm still trying to find the seasons on DVD.
