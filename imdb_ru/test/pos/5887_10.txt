Like the "mound to baby boomer" ... born in 1944 in Los Angeles; thus having the dubious distinction that he was alive while Hitler was still actively involved in his “Last Great Offensive”, as well as with our President Roosevelt, who was still actively fighting the offensive ... it was one of the most important " first films of my youth life. Having the opportunity to see it in the “reprint”, several years after the opening of 1946 (the usual studio tradition of those years), I answered (even to my very young look), oh, so many questions I had ... being surrounded our returning heroes Vet. In all these uncompromising thin "multi-plots" William Wyler ... deliberately NOT "surrounding", "mini" or "sub" plots ... in all their "colors and shades of intensity" ... did more than that or else that I can remember, to give me some semblance of a "mind" and a "rational explanation" of what was happening around me ... in REAL life. (My personal experience can be a “new” and “different” point of view when watching this classic film.)
