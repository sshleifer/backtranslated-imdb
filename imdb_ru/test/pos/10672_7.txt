I first saw it in the 70s on syndicated television and admired its production values, which at that time were high-tech. The updated video is rich and colorful, much brighter than the pale 35-mm television prints. This film deserves more attention: it paved the way for UFOs, Cosmos: 1999, and even Star Wars, with its detailed miniatures and slyly thought-out gadgets. Undoubtedly, the story of an alternative planet Earth against matter has been repeated a hundred times since Star Trek, but the beauty of this film is its self-conscious European talent for design: from Rolls Royce space engines to Euro Sec. letterhead, JFSS or Dopplegangers, as it was called in Europe, is pleasant for an imaginary vision of Europe in space in the shadow of superpowers. Jerry and Sylvia Anderson's ambitious epic becomes a bit tedious when the American astronaut finally realizes that he is on Doppler Earth, and everything literally goes down after the poetic graceful landing sequence of the shuttle. The great and lyrical classical score of the late great Barry Gray, John Williams of Britain, helps the mediocre story.
