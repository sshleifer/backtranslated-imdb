For me, Pink Flamingos justified its reputation as a shocking, disgusting, repulsive, dirty film that I was expecting to see, which really contains everything but the kitchen sink. We are treated for almost two hours of nastiness, which never gives up: rape, sex, sex with chickens, transsexuals, castration, murder, cannibalism and the terrible manifestation of the anus. We are talking about a strange couple, which begins a competition with a family of trash trailers, trying to steal their title of "the dirtiest people in the world." Divine (fat guy in drag) - an incredibly nasty man who really gets hurt to watch. Believe me, when I say that this film is not the one that needs to be quickly forgotten, especially the final scene in which the Divine eats dog shit from the sidewalk. I always thought that John Waters was overrated, and I cannot say that I like this film, but itâ€™s an experience if you ever have the opportunity to watch it.
