Head is a film that has worked well since its original release date in 1968. The film is a complete contradiction of the image of "Monkeys". This presents the monkeys in such a way that their fans never perceived them; men with real thoughts. Fully controlled by their manufacturers, Monkeys were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story. The film makes fun of their image, the entertainment industry and corporate America. The soundtrack contains some of their best music pieces. This is a movie that is worth watching again and again.
