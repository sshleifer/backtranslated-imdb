As for fake documentaries (anyone?), This film is with the best! It looks very real, and that is what it seeks. In the light of recent events (Guantanamo) this film is even worse, so we can say that it was ahead of its time when it was released in the 70s! <br /> <br /> One can only hope that such a government does not exist! Looking for terrorists and just interviewing people? Of course, all the people surveyed seemed to adhere to the same thing (the mentality of the 70s): to lie to politicians and to politics in general. Maybe it was not so clever, you might think ... but do not forget: this is just a movie! ; ABOUT)
