This film is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are really funny. Dialogues are witty and conversational. The tension in the film stems not so much from the plot of "The Murder Mystery", but from the relationship between the characters. The film tells two stories in parallel. <br /> <br /> The first story tells about the characters playing Trintynana and Cassowitz. Trintignant is an aging tramp with a somewhat ridiculous macho, followed by a naive young man played by Kassovitz with many good-natured smiles. Many good moments in the film stem from the contrast between the two characters, for example, when Trintignat tries to teach Cassowitz how to intimidate. <br /> <br /> The second story tells how the salesman, played by Gene Yann, gives up to his work and his wife to find the killer of a young friend. Janne plays a role with some aggressive irony. I wish I could describe it better. <br /> <br /> After a while, the viewer understands how the two stories are connected, and they do occur at the end, in an amazing, but also logical, ending. <br /> <br /> The film is a successful mixture of witty, but superficial gangster films, which were written by the director (famous Michel Audiard), and a “typical French film” with great psychological depth and attentiveness to the expression of emotions.
