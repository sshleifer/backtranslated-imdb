Andreas arrives in a strange city. He does not remember where he came from and how he got there. He is ordered to come to work, and he gets his own apartment in the city. All his employees are nice and polite to him, they say hello and smile when they pass by him. But then Andreas discovers that the city is not as pleasant as it seems. Going home from work, he sees people in gray suits who remove the bloody mess of the dead body, apparently the victims of suicide, thrown out of the window. The procedure is performed with a soothing mind, as if they are emptying the trashcan. The next day, Andreas meets a suicide victim who is fully alive at work. More and more, Andreas is discovering the carefree atmosphere of the city. <br /> <br /> “Den Breeze Mannen” may be the best Norwegian film I've ever seen. The original, artistic guide is usually absent in Norwegian films, with rare exceptions. The plot is also very original, and it can even be called postmodern horror, because the film represents the terrifying idea of ​​the need to cope with a world that is completely insensitive. and the more you try to fill your life in this city with meaning, the more meaningless it becomes. I admire how the director manages to create a sense of a dissolute universe, a nightmare from which you simply cannot escape, even with death. <br /> <br /> Come and see, it's really worth it! I gave it 9 out of 10.
