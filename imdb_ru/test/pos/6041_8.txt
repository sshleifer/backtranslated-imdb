Jack Webb finally gives something besides his usual wooden Indian performance. He played the incarnation of the "skull", brainwashed, stormed the beaches, semper fi, a stupid military idiot. Corps above all, even humanity. This magnificent film demonstrated the idiocy of the training camp to the full. 4 stars.
