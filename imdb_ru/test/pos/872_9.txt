(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> People who advertise the Lonely Heart in a newspaper are often idealists. They try to describe in a few words everything that they are and expect. The exchange of letters is full of hope ... Louis Mae (Jean Paul Belmondo), the owner of a cigarette company in лаle de la Reunion (east of Madagascar), is so affected by the letters of Julia Roussell that he offers her. But not expected pretty brunette hails from Mississippi, and - Catherine Deneuve. And we know from the very beginning that she is a marriage cheater and that a crime has occurred. She shows no interest in Julia’s wardrobe (she doesn’t even open her chest) and neglects her canary until she dies. But the most basic methods of seduction (open lightning) are enough to turn Louis into a flexible dog. First: a joint bank account. And then, when sister Julie attracts attention, flight. With 27,850 million Louis out of 28 million, she would need his signature on the full amount. <br /> <br /> Louis and sister Julie hired a private detective (Michel Bouquet). Louis manages to track down Marion (real name Deneuve) in Antibes, where she works as a taxi-girl - her gang lover left her penniless, or rather, without a centime. Louis is not able to kill her. She tells her story: an orphan. Early. Lesbian experiences. A lot of sweets. Prison - and soon she again leads him by the nose. The detective turns out to be tricky as a fox and clingy like a hound; Louis and Marion are burying his body in the basement. They run to Paris, where Louis discovers that Marion has an expensive taste. She worships money as a deity. He sells his firm for a fraction of its value. But when they discover the corpse of a detective (flood), they have to run again - without money. Life in a mountain house with a whining loser - Marion can think of a more fun life without this appendage ... <br /> <br /> The highest point in the career of all participants. Belmondo's self-delusion makes him almost charming. Deneuve looks great in her wardrobe by Yves Saint Laurent, and her performance is amazing: first, she fakes a fragile wife — too shy to ask her husband for money, so a joint bank account is needed — but after revealing she sounds like Katherine Hepburn in the prison scene. Child education". The scenery is impressive - tropics, riviera, Paris. Truffaut directs with obvious aplomb: the sixties were the only decade when European films were head and shoulders above American productions. After this film Truffaut was able to watch his idol, Alfred Hitchcock, in the face.
