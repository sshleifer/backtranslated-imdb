I agree with the guy above, it's so funny, I understand all this, but my friends just do not understand. Go to Japan and you will see another movie after there. When I met my girlfriend's father, at his house in Kanagawa. I swear I felt the same thing as Jack. scary, but by the end of the day everything was fine, so I give this movie 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I watched it at least 30 times, taking it with me to watch the flight to Japan next month on an airplane . One thing that is really good is the ball game scenes. Makes me feel like I'm there again. Be sure to see if you have an interest in Japan and baseball. It is a pity that they do not continue. Does anyone know where the scenes of the temple were filmed and the dispute with Khirko on the walkway with a roof on it ???? I need to know so that I can win the argument with my ex-wife Japanese. thank
