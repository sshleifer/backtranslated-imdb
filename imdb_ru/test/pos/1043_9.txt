Although it is not "perfect", it is close. I love Barbara Stanvik, S. Z. Sakall, Sydney Greenstreet, Dennis Morgan, Robert Shane (Superman Police Chief), housekeeper, waiter in the Felix restaurant and the judge ... This film has been part of the festive tradition of my family since childhood, and my children also grew up with it! "The child swallowed the clock" has always been my son's favorite line. <br /> <br /> Sexy Barbara Stenvik in pants and dresses stole the show along with cute, funny S. Z. Sakall. Dennis Morgan also has some great songs. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie and suggest you skip the remake (blah).
