Yes, it sounds, and for the most part plays like a “after school special,” for a slightly more adult audience, well, maybe a teenage audience. But add to it Bill Murray (who already demonstrates some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talents), a good cast and unexpected sweetness of growing up and memories of those wonderful or not so good days in summer camp, and you will get heart-rending, funny, sleeping hit. <br /> <br /> He gets a little too smart for his own good, but this is also one of his charms. When you hear the name “Meatballs” and see a poster, you expect teenage sex rush, but as a result you get a sentimental, but sometimes sexy look at those formative years in summer camp. Sentimentality and memories of simpler times remind me of the “Christmas Story”, which I also love. Memories of the summer camp have never been so well laid out. The only film I've ever seen is Indian Summer, which I like almost as much as Meatballs, as well as the stars Matt Craven. Hopefully, he will complete the trilogy. Maybe he could come back for “The Return of Meatballs” and return some dignity to the franchise (Meatballs from 2 to 4 do not look like the original classics). <br /> <br /> “Meatballs” are easy on my Top 10 Guilty Pleasures of all time (also not entirely to blame). This is a wonderful little movie that always makes me smile.
