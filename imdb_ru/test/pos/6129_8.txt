Like those who listened to broadcasts about the attack on Pearl Harbor, anyone who has ever seen PINK FLAMINGOS can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw him - and thirty years later the film is still one of the most incredible vile, disgusting, disgusting and ridiculous funny films ever placed in celluloid, guaranteed to check the strongest stomachs and the toughest funny bones. <br /> <br /> Shot with a near-zero budget and some of the most precarious cinematography around, PINK FLAMINGOS tells the story of two families who are fighting for the tabloid title “The Dirtiest People in the Living.” How dirty can they be? Much: the film includes everything from sex with chickens to what I can only describe as a wonderful manifestation of rectal control and a lot of help for dogs, and I guarantee that you don’t want to eat an egg for at least a few weeks after seeing it. <br /> <br /> The cast is either wonderful, brutal, or monstrously wonderful, depending on how you look at it. The star is, of course, the Divine ... and describing the Divine as the BIG transvestite on the planet would be an understatement of the year. She is a gigantic creature who is given BIG eye makeup, BIG orange hair and BIG expression - she is Charlton Heston from the burden, and she almost runs down the run, stops to use the bathroom on some front lawn, or Striking real shoppers strolling along the sidewalk in Baltimore, she is incredibly funny and incredibly funny. Other cast members include Mary Vivian Pierce, Danny Mills and the ever-terrifying Edith Massey as members of the Divine family; and Mink Stole and David Lochary, a pair of slave-owning children who challenge the status of the Divine. <br /> <br /> It should be absolutely obvious that the FLAMINGOS PINK is not exactly a film that only everyone will like, and viewers who know the director John Waters only from such later films as HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY expect a serious push. But if you want to see something completely different, so that even Monty Python cannot imagine this, this film is for you. Just make sure you eat before you see it, because you probably don’t want to eat later - and you may need to keep a barf bag on hand just in case. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
