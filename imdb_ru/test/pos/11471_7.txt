I was given a DVD of public enemies, and I expected it to be the 2009 version, but it was not - it was so! Of course, it wasn’t the best movie I’ve ever seen - by any means - but, damn it, it cost more than 2.8 out of 10! When I saw this terrible rating on IMDb, I wondered what I was going to get, but since the disc was in the player, I decided to watch it. As other commentators have noted, Public Enemies is NOT a historical film per se, and I noted that, unlike the 2009 version (which I have not seen yet), IMDb does not classify it as such. <br /> <Come, people! This is a story based on real people - that's all! If I wanted a history lesson, I would sit at this computer and read Wikipedia or something else. Ma Barker (real name Arizona - or Arri - Barker) was NEVER accused of any crime, and, as other commentators have already noted, she probably never even took part in the actions of her sons. They sent her to the cinema when they "worked"! (I hope she was not as critical as some of those who watched this movie!) <br /> <br /> Theresa Russell had a difficult task of portraying a woman from the age of 17 to her. death at the age of 52 - from a young girl running from the house to the hardened mother of four sons of a bully. I think she did it quite well. The cheeky little smile she used in several scenes was classic! Well, I agree with some of the critics that the direction of this film was below par, and I sympathize with the actors about this. Teresa had to tell the director to forget the topless images — they did not contribute to the story. Perhaps some famous stars would have been able to bring some of their own knowledge into overcoming bad direction, while second graders were not so bold. Who knows? <br /> <br /> But, although it was certainly not a blockbuster, it cost more than 2.8! I have all my DVDs in my personal database, where I rate them BEFORE I look at the IMDb account (although this sometimes affects small changes later). I take what I get in my own interests, and do not hold one film against others of the same genre, and this one that I felt was interesting enough to get 6.8. (Yes, I agree that this practice usually depends on my mood at that time, but isn't it also applicable to those who vote for IMDb?) However, you can imagine my surprise when I looked at IMDb and saw the pitiful bill he got here. <br /> <br /> Considering the surprise, I decided to read a few other comments in the hope of understanding the low rating, and I noticed that they are rather polarized. I agreed with those who said that the film is worth seeing, and came to the conclusion that it’s just hard for some people to please. Well, since some of them were just awful, why don't they go out and make some better films? I look forward to the gems that they should be able to get! On the other hand, if they can't do it, then why don't they just shut up?
