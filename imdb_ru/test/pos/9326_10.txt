Michael Jackson is the greatest singer and greatest dancer who ever lived, and this film proves it. It's great to watch, and the dance is fantastic. when Michael turns into a werewolf, then when you watch him for the first time, it becomes something like the edge of your seat. and rap Vincent Price adds fear when all the zombies rise from their graves. if you like it, then I advise you to buy Michael Jackson's Thriller, in which there is a film, and then shoot it. This show features an incredible performance of Michael's Billie Jean when he first made a moon walk on television. watch this
