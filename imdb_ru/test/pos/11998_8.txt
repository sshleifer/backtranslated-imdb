This is without a doubt one of my favorite episodes of Colombo. The acting is very well done, the music is very catchy, the script is brilliant, and the direction is great. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk, who brilliantly acts in every episode of Colombo, is especially good in this episode. <br /> <br /> Also, great performances by Stephen Caffrey, Gary Hershberber, Alan Fudge and Robert Culp <br /> <br /> The final is absolutely brilliant, and I like the way Colombo describes it. <br /> <br /> This is a Colombo film that WILL NOT.
