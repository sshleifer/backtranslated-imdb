“Tempo Di Uccidere” (“Time to kill”) Guiliano Montaldo is a bit of a strange film, but in its own way it is good. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about the plot. Much of what I read makes the wrong impression and makes me believe that most of the people who wrote these don't really understand the film. And you need to understand it to a certain level, even if you cannot describe what it really is about. This film looks strange, if you watch “Once in America” - only shorter. <br /> <br /> Many “Hollywood” stars (whatever that means ...) played in lesser-known Italian productions. It is known that many actors who have passed their heyday or slowly rise to it, do it. Cage was not yet a real star when it was done. I'm not a fan of it. He is very good at some roles (“Raising Arizona”, “Bringing Out the Dead”) and weak when playing a hero. I really do not know what to think about him in this, but he does not exactly portray the typical hero of the protagonist. This film could do without him, but the fact that he starred may be the only reason why this film was on DVD. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is good. None of them look fake, and they behave as if they are really there. Solid support. <br /> <br /> I saw Montaldo’s 3 films (Marco Polo, Sacco and Vanzetti and this one), and I think he is one of the greatest directors of this time. Unfortunately, no one knows him. This film was his last in a long time (a break of 19 years). I think that this film could have failed in the office, but because of how it was made, I think that for Montaldo it was a personal project that he really liked. <br /> <br /> Production is excellent. This is always enough. Dusty army camps, claustophobic cities and gorgeous landscapes all play an important role. It all seems very real. In some scenes you can almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special, but Ennio Morricone's music is very good. This is not the thing that you will whistle when you are in the shower, but it certainly works great. <br /> <br /> So this movie looks, feels and sounds just right. It does not serve the lessons learned from it on the golden platter, but this may be the biggest difference between Hollywood and Euro cinema all over the world. It may seem strange to give 8 and not recommend to people, but this is what I do. If you are looking for action; avoid it! If you are looking for a well-made Apocalypse now in another time and place, but with a similar journey to “state of mind” (sorry if this sounds trite, but I don’t know how else to call it), you could just enjoy it a lot .
