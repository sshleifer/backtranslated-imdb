This is a brilliant movie. The story begins in Romania, where Billy Crystal plays the role of an agent who can convince anyone to do anything. There is a really funny scene where Crystal is a child and speaks to his father, who is a rabbi who eats pork (you filmmakers may know that this is a parody of the Crystal religion) Basically, he is a talented scout, and he is trying to find a suitable villain for his latest film. Upon learning that the entire film has a terrible team, he accidentally falls into the river. Believing that he is dead, huge hands come to him. He later thinks he is in heaven. He learns that it is not, but he is in the monastery. Believing that God saved him, he becomes a monk, seeking who saved him. Later he finds 7 feet 7 in a man whom he calls the perfect villain (he also reads Shakespeare!). Watch the movie and find out the rest!
