In the great mid-70s, a scruffy bunch of cheeky young Venice, Californian teenagers from ruined houses and a weary part of the city, known as Z-Boys, turned the old world of professional skateboarding into their ear with their tough punk stance, radical unconventional style riding and unrestrained clean spirit aggression, revolutionizing sport in the process and paving the way for many extreme variations in sport that have emerged on their influential path. Directed by Stacy Peralta, one of the most legendary Z-Boys, talks about the incredible exploits of this amazing team of disparate, fiercely-assertive and intuitive manner that is both informative and wildly interesting: instant fast-paced editing, uninterrupted fast tempo and rough An elegant photo delivers a hell of infectious film buzzing, creating a feeling of absolute joy and fussy energy, which is nice to contemplate. Moreover, this documentary film does not disinfect and does not romanticize its subjects: these rude lousy guys were so fierce and competitive that they all diverged when the lure of fame and wealth appeared in their lives. The final fate of some guys is agonizing and heartbreaking, and the gifted and spontaneous rat-skateboard JJ Adams considers himself the saddest and most tragic: he missed his chance just in time and ended up in prison. Other guys are very colorful and personable; Tony Alvaâ€™s charismatic ball of defiant and defiant fire, in particular, looks like one arrogant but impressive piece of fiercely energetic work. Sean Penn amazingly talks about the delightfully light and light nasal carelessness. The stunning rock soundtrack also seriously smokes. But what really makes this documentary such a winner is its refreshing total lack of pretense: it is just as dynamic, rich and unusual, as the incredibly outrageous Z-Boys themselves.
