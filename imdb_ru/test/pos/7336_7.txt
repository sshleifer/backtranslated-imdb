...this. What immediately occurred to me was Loving Annabelle, as she has the same mature mood and distant connection with the subject. We just observe how the story unfolds, not taking sides or not facing any “moral” problems (or, of course, we are, but they are not fed with a spoon). Of course, there were a few difficult facts that we had to face, and the choice that needed to be made, but it just happened. In fact, it was the same as in any other love story, in any other life, with any other gender. <br /> <br /> I personally discovered that girls have good chemistry, and I had fun with them on their night weekend. The only thing I could exactly define as a problem is that she felt a little ... abandoned. Deters It is not about sex scenes (or those that are missing), but given that I felt that the film became the most animated in those moments when they had a good time together, it seemed to be contrasted with the others. Louki is good, but he never smells like a Loving Annabelle and doesn't touch me so much. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I wholeheartedly recommend it, but this is not a waste of precious time, on the contrary ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
