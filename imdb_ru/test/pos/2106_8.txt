I just remembered this tender memory of cinematic insanity from the first days of my existence, and I must convince you to ask you to steal or borrow it. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a duel between the righteous priest from Shaolin and our villain. Needless to say that Abbot White, Abbot White kicks Buddhist ass and freely campaigns against Shaolin with the help of his new allies ninja (who in a gold robe fights with a gold ring, the one in a black cloak fighting with a spear, and my favorite: the one who fights with a pair of knives that can disappear and reappear like a flying carpet). The rest of the story concerns the teaching of the disciples of Shaolin monks killed by Abbe White, one of whom is Alexander Lo Rey. While we are addressing the punishing training sequences that two young avengers have to go through in order to learn the Shaolin finger strike technique necessary to defeat Abbeat Whiteâ€™s invincible armor technique, we see some ways of keeping our villain in shape ... Taoist magic to get blood from naked ladies. We all know how this will end, but we are here for a psychedelic journey. In conclusion, this is a good example of what Taiwan was doing when Hong Kong got sick with martial arts films, and this makes more and more outrageous martial arts films. This film is very well put, it has a bit of nude, a little blood and enough balls to entertain the wall to entertain even the most tormented spectator. Visit your local Beewise today! <br /> <br />
