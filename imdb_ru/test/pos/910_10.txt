The fact that some Hollywood films are trying and almost never achieve, creating some kind of metaphysical connections between people (without becoming unrealistic), copes with this wonderful film (thus, a bit like the wonderful “Double Look of Veronica” by the same director). and with the same beautiful actress). This is a REAL film that slightly changes the outlook on life - a clever and beautiful story, masterfully filmed, excellent main actors, a cinema workshop. I just watched the movie for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still think it is one of the best I've ever seen. And if you are unhappy with the ending of "White" - "Red" puts a happy end to the whole trilogy.
