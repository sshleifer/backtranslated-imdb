Hello to all Denver fans! <br /> <br /> I can't agree with you guys anymore! This show was so cool and sweet, I watched it as a child in the late 80s. There are other favorites among Denver, such as Care Bears and Rainbow Brite. I'm 24 now, but it's still one of my favorite shows and my favorite cartoon of the 80s. It brings back all the memories. The thematic melody was also great, I get goosebumps when I hear it. It is sad that it lasted so short a time, but he remained a firm favorite. It's great that I'm not alone and there are people who like it too. This is one of the animated shows that I will leave for future generations. <br /> <br /> Viva Denver! :)
