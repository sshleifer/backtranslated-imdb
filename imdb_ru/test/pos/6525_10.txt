For a film shot in 18 days and with a budget of less than 2 million, this small film that may deserve the award “the best we could.” An interesting premise (apart from the usual meteoric material) with a solid outflow from familiar faces. 2 thumbs up. Advice to another reviewer: do not be afraid to say that you liked something.
