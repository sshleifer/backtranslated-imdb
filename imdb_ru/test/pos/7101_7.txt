This film marked the end of the “serious” era of Universal Monsters (Abbott and Costello meet with monsters later in Abbott and Costello Introducing Frankentstein). It was a somewhat desperate, but fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the Wolfman, the Frankenstein and Dracula monsters for the “last” time. <br /> <br /> I say desperately, because in the previous Frankenstein's House movie, “both Dracula and the Wolfman are killed according to the legends of vampires and werewolves (Dracula from sunshine, and the wolfman from silver bullet "). And yet they are returning to the House of Dracula without explanation. This film could play a kind of prequel to the House of Frankenstein if the plot of the monster of Frankenstein did not continue in chronological order in the House of Dracula from the House of Frankenstein, and if the wolfman was not cured. Then there would be no holes in the plot. But since this is not the case, the plots of Dracula and the Wolfman are meaningless. <br /> <br /> However, ignoring these holes in the plot, “House of Dracula” is a classic atmospheric horror film, which is interesting to watch. He has a lot of bright moments. Especially seeing how the wolfman is cured. I know, I just said that it should not have been included, but it was nice to see how he was cured after all this time. And the scene with the lady playing "Moonlight Senada" on the piano, suddenly playing an obsessive melody under the spell of Dracula, was very creepy. Dr. Adleman’s transformation into Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde was also very well done. <br /> <br /> And it's great that Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman are together, one "last" time. <br /> <br /> *** outside ****
