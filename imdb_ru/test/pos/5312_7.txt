The name comes from a change made by a teenage prisoner in a correctional institution on the cover of his school book on a government called the United States; he adds "from (his name)". <br /> <br /> Many of the characteristics in this film work well - the scenes between Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Becky (Jena Malone), Pearl (Don Cheadle) and Father Fitzgerald (Spacey), as well as with Leland, Becky and sister Julie (Michelle Williams), among many others. <br /> <br /> But the main theme of this film is the fulcrum on which everything hangs - these are Leland’s character and motives. He is a somewhat shy, passive, pleasant high school student who boldly imagines himself to be Becky, who (as we see) goes to alternative school because of a past history of drug problems. In the family, Becky has a sister, Julie, who has just graduated from high school and is preparing to go to college; Julie's girlfriend, her age (and whose parents have recently died) also lives with them. <br /> <br /> Leland lives with his mother; his father (Kevin Spacey) and mother divorced long ago, and his father is a famous writer. Leland is very perceptive. A boy in the “Sixth Sense” saw dead people; Leland sees adolescents in love and admits that after years they are divorced, that pain will follow the current experience of the happiness of many people. BUT, for reasons that are never explicitly stated, his predictive gift seems to work several times, for some people, for some relationships, and not for others. ??? <br /> <br /> In some parts of the film, there is something like a quilt derivative - borrowing from American Beauty, Sixth Sense, Graduate, and possibly some others that I did not recognize . It would not be bad if only Leland's character worked. <br /> <br /> I think Gosling played great in Leland, but the script and the story imposed restrictions. Will such an observant, meditative young man ever kill? Even for altruistic reasons? Nothing in the film gives grounds for this. I am a retired therapist with extensive experience working with families and adolescents; while many of the reactions shown in the film work — this part, of course, is not the most essential element. <br /> <br /> And there is at least one more element that, in my experience, does not correspond to real life, although this is not so critical. They never hint at the reason for the differences between the sisters, Becky and Julie, but this is normal. As soon as two sibs begin to occupy different roles (one is a good girl, the other is a problem one), the roles themselves can begin to push each other to more extreme positions. For the restless, Becky, it's kind of: “What do I need to do to be loved here - give up on me and become Julia?” And the pressure to justify myself to be All-Kind, pleasing the parents with a child is no less intense for Julie. So why did she break up with her old friend, whom her parents so obviously approve of? <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle was a good teacher of Leland; all others were good in their parts. 98% of the scenes were good. What was missing was a critical understanding of human nature. vicious history and psychology; worth seeing; not a complete loss.
