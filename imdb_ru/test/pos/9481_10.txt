After years of waiting for the final collection of Led Zeppelin performances on video, the fans were finally rewarded with what is undoubtedly the best live video! Much better than the dark "The song remains unchanged", this video includes performances from at least 5 different places covering a decade. This also includes rare interviews and television appearances. The sound quality is amazing considering the source material used. And the video quality is even more impressive. This is ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY for any Led Zeppelin fan.
