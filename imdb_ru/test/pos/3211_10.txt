People should give this show a chance. People who write bad reviews (very few of them) are obviously people who have not seen many episodes. You need to really sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All characters are realistic because they have so many flaws. They make mistakes, but these are REALISTIC mistakes, which is rarely seen on television today. In addition, for the most part, acting is gorgeous. Lauren Graham was shocked by the Emmy for six years. Someone should give this woman the credit she deserves. The same goes for Kelly Bishop, who plays Emily Gilmore so well. In addition, it is nice to see the show, in the center of which there can be a young girl, and not a teenager longing. Rory is a smart girl who isn't seen much on television today either. If only other shows could embrace the integrity of this show ...
