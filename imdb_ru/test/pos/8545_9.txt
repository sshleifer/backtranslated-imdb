There are many, many old films that deserve translation into DVD format. This is definitely one of them. Anthony Quinn is a triumph! Many films depict victims of Nazi atrocities before and during the war, but I don’t think that any of them went into the prey and predator’s psyche as much as this one. Anthony Quinn was a real man of all time. He had the ability to portray the most modest of creatures deprived of human appearance, a creature of extreme animalism, and make it so believable to viewers who did not think about what they had just seen! Indeed one of our greatest artists. He misses.
