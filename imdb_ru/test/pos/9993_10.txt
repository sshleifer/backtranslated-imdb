if you watch it at home on a DVD or Bluray! make sure you have a great sound system. musical accompaniment through this is what moves you through the film. I watched this movie several times and thought it was great, but after updating the sound system of a home theater, it makes no difference. I will watch this movie many, many times. <br /> <br /> If you donâ€™t have a great sound system. find a friend who does it and watch him there. <br /> <br /> Also look at the additional plots and additional frames that come with him (BR or DVD), an interview from Quimet in the 1960s about his scholarship. the foundation ... but in those days only the boys got it. Today I hope that some of this goes for girls .......
