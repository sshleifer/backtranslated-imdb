In the DVD era, you might think that you can find almost any piece of celluloid shit, and for the most part it's true. So WHY, WHY so hard to find this big little film, clearly made by people who love noir as a loving tribute (buit, never descending into the fraudulent land) of this most cinematic of genres. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are the superhero in this, and the superstar in the process of creating Karl Gugino (KAREN SISCO, SIN CITY) makes her now the trademark beauty / great acting routine. <br /> <br /> This movie really has everything for movie lovers. B-Noir on steroids, smart and energetic JUDAS KISS succeeds on every score. <br /> <br /> Please Columbia TriStar PLEASE, release it on DVD soon !!!!!!
