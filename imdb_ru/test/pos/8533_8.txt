On Monday, at the beginning of this week, somewhere in July, I was under the influence of the sweet leaf, and I, being a horror fan, wanted to see something terrible. I was thinking about Amitville's Horror 2, but something turned out better. I was at my friend's house, and he had a VHS Evil Ed. Without a cover or something else, he himself didn’t even see it all, but he told me that it was about a guy who goes crazy and kills a lot of people. Well, this film was very shocking, I never saw the real cruel nature of sadistic violence, until this film buried Ted Bundy and Ed Heine! It's also quite funny, with links to the Evil Dead trilogy (and plus the Evil Dead 2 poster everywhere in the film!) Edward's movie, obsessively obsessive, good guy who, as it turned out, is the editor of the film. Then he was loaned to another department in the building, and he was sent to Sam Campbell’s chic, but cruel world, the Department of Splashes and Gore. Sam Campbell, Eddie's new boss, tells Eddie about the big break in his films, the terrible Free Limbs series, and he needs Eddie to make the film somewhat less violent so that they can be shown throughout Europe. Soon, Eddie regrets that the images and scenes that are shown to him from the lonely suburban home in which he is sent to work, and what comes from there, are really nightmarish. Imagine yourself in his place! The game is gorgeous, the overlay is a little funny (Sam Campbell's voice is often funny, like other actors). Nevertheless, the work with the overlay was done quite well, I put this film on 10/10, and this is a good introduction to the subgenre of Horus in the horror film. Very good, nightmarish, bloody ....... you just have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> Quote from the movie: "Where the f ** k is my scene of rape in Bobr?!"
