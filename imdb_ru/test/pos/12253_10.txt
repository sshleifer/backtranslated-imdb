Television news producer Jane Craig (Hunter) meets at the workshop of Tom Grünick (Herth), who begins as a news presenter, and their mutual attraction brings them back to her room. Romance, however, ends when it turns out that Tom, in his own words, “is not very good at what I do well”, and Jane realizes that he personifies everything she hates about where the television news is going. The problem comes when Tom finds out that he is going to join her news bureau in Washington. <br /> <br /> The initial attraction of Jane and Tom thus gets a second chance, but can Jane be able to postpone her professional opinion about the person she attracts - and should she? Aaron Altman (Brooks) is a very clever fellow reporter Jane and her confidant. Despite his obvious talent, Aaron’s career has stalled, as he lacks the confidence and skills of people — and his classical appearance — to achieve the success that his new, less qualified, and less intelligent colleague, Tom, becomes. He is also concerned that his good friend Jane may fall in love with Tom, despite her discretion, as it is becoming increasingly clear that Aaron has his romantic feelings for her. <br /> <br /> This central romantic plot unfolds in the trials and tribulations of the television news network office, where moral dilemmas and ethics are quickly resolved and where appearance and dramatic effect are becoming more common and important. <br /> <br /> It is here that most of the bite occurs with clearly visible comments and scenes. One of the many moments is the scene where Tom first meets the main host of the Network, Bill Roric (cameo for Jack Nicholson), and the camera focuses on their handshake. In the film, filled with wonderful lines and dialogues, long and short, you will learn a lot about these two male characters from one quick snapshot of two hands. <br /> <br /> The dialogue between the characters is one of the most intelligent and Witty that you can ever find anywhere on film and in such abundance. Brooks gets the best part of them, according to his character, but even the briefest conversations that are random and perhaps too audible to one or several characters when they pass through a crowded room should be heard. <Br /> <br /> “Hunter” is the tourist power in this role, for which she was rightly (and not one) nominated for “Oscar”, and for which she would probably get the role if she were in the film, Do not mock part of what has become a closely related industry - and against the strong performances of another actress in a more traditional good mood, rom-com. <br /> <br /> Brooks is also excellent, as he is constantly disappointed and sometimes too smug for his own good, Aaron Altman. <br /> <br /> It hurts, despite the fact that he has the appearance and personality necessary for his character, does not always convince him that he is just as vague. the savvy character says he or should be. He demonstrates a hidden intelligence that allows him to make the most of his obvious limitations, which can be plausible, but I do not think that Hurt copes with it. Besides the fact that when he tells us that he "stinks" or "does not understand this," Hart seems a little smarter than that. Otherwise, this is an effective performance in a role in which his character is compromised by intellectual limitations, but Brooks and Hunter slightly overshadow Hert's performance. This is the only negative thing I can say about the whole film, and who should say that someone else would have done it better or would have come off better when he was next to Hunter and Brooks and their performances in this film. <Br /> <br /> Support is provided, among others, by Robert Prosci, Lois Chilis and Joan Cusack, as well as the role of Christian Clemenson, who plays a well-known legal fame in Boston, and a short role for Joan. Brother John Cusack, whose face you don't even see. <br /> <br /> James L. Brooks has given us a lot of great TV shows and movies, and this film should take place there among the best of them. He may not have won a single Oscar, despite seven nominations, but he did win many other awards and turned Holly Hunter into a star.
