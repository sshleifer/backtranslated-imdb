It was unusual: a modern film that was very good. In fact, it was so nice that it was too hard to believe in the details. When I watched this story based on real life, I thought: “Nobody is so good, so tolerant.” Mostly, I meant the role of Ed Harris as “Coach Jones”. I think they overestimated his character a little, but this is better than the opposite: to show him worse than he was in real life. It's strange to see that Harris plays this role, since he has a long resume in the role of disgusting, profane characters. <br /> <br /> In any case, I never complain about a good, pleasant to the touch film, and it is nice to see a group of good, kind people. These people direct their friendship, love and compassion to "James Kennedy", better known as "Radio", a mentally retarded schoolchild played by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story takes place in the mid-1970s in South Carolina. Gooding also copes with the role. Nevertheless, as in the role of Sean Penn with a mentally retarded person in “I am Sam”, an hour and a half of such a character is enough. After that, the loudness of these guys becomes tedious to hear. <br /> <br /> Note: in one of the documentaries on this DVD, it was interesting to know that in real life it took years for Radio to transform it, not months, as shown in the film.
