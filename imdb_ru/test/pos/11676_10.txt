<br /> <br /> First, I watched this documentary because I was interested in the plot, which he portrayed, punks from Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> I listened to this music, and I liked this music, and I read a lot of little zines that were made in the early 80s and which were not so easily performed in Finland. <br /> <br /> So, if you don’t like this kind of music, why are you writing about it here? I like this music, it speaks about my soul, so I know punks from all over Europe and America, so why do you, to whom this music is “disgusting,” do you want to comment? <br /> <br />
