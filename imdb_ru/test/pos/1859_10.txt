I read reviews of this film that found him "disappointing" and "embarrassed." I find it difficult to understand why this should be so. From the very beginning I found this a wonderful experience and a complete joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The opening headlines overlap with a beautiful visual picture of the evolutionary process, and it presents a story with a serene and impetuous style. The film is not about the process itself, but about the struggle of Charles Darwin with his conscience, his love for his wife, his late daughter and his search for truth. <br /> <br /> The appearance of his daughter’s manifestation of a tortured mind, who knows that he “killed God.” The daughter is an adult, comments on her work to adults and torments Darwin with personal doubts. Was he somehow responsible for her death? Husband and wife in real life, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly give really wonderful performances in the role of Charles and Emma Darwin, as well as Martha West in the role of Annie. Bettany's size and clumsy gait give the character of Darwin a genuine sense of reality, while Connelly seems very pleased with her English accent and sometimes a rather serious personality. <br /> <br /> It is easy to misunderstand the times in which this film lives. The power that religion had in society, and the inner struggle that a man like Darwin must experience, sought the truth in what he saw. Science and religion have always been awkward associates, and although it did not cost him his life, as was the case with many earlier men and women, science put a barrier between husband and wife, fact and faith. This film shows this barrier very well. <br /> <br /> I give Creation ten stars, because I think this is a beautiful, deep, beautifully played and authentic, no-prying glance at one of the world's true geniuses. <br /> <br /> What seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone ... see Bill Maher’s wonderful "Religious") has been hidden for thousands of years. True, as soon as it was open, it was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation explores this pain and the realization that we are all that we possess. <br /> <br /> A wonderful cinematic experience.
