Enchanting. The best time to watch this movie is when he is unhappy or sad. This is all so cute, even the way the polar bear secretly loves the Queen and gets Her at the end, also an achievement that was given by two young actor Gerd and Kai. This music is also very good. The two of us will always be united in combination with the sad tones of the piano, in some places it is a very touching result, and if you look at both parties at the same time, he will see that the Snow Queen is not so bad. She is only trying to surround Herself with love wrong. In the evening this film was here (the first part). I only watched him because I was bored, but after that I really liked him, and I was very angry when they didnâ€™t show the next part because of the funeral of the Pope ... Yes, it was terribly sad for me. But when they said it would be next week, I was so happy that I wrote it down, and now I'm glad I did it.
