First of all, until recently I didn’t go to doctor Who. To be honest, I have never had the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations (pun), since here in the USA he was never “big” as everywhere else. <br /> <br /> However, I have to say (obviously) that after the end of season 2, this is one of the best science fiction shows I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now I watch a lot of science fiction shows from all over the world, and this show stands out. <br /> <br /> The first season was the best for me, with Christopher Eccleston in the lead role, and I thought he was awesome. Of course, just like the beautiful Billie Piper, who simply adds such humanity and warmth to the character of Rose, that no one could do it better. Let's not forget that Kamil Caudouri as Jackie and Noel Clark as Mickey / Ricky, who are just amazing. Then there is David Tenant. At first I thought he was too clumsy to play a character (his ears !!), but after watching the 2nd season he fits perfectly. His sharp acting and physical comedy is almost flawless. He is great with a lively dialogue and can become serious without looking up. <br /> <br /> In addition to the great acting role in the cast, there are most of the invited actors who have appeared. Many of them are veteran actors, but some are new and damn good for me. <br /> <br /> Production and directing the show is top notch. Sometimes there can be some stupid effects here and there, but this has always been a factor in the original series, and, as in these episodes, is negligible. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing from the series: stories. Writing people is always the key to great fun. Russell T. Davis wrote many episodes with several other authors, and they did an excellent job. They managed to bring excitement, ingenuity, intelligence and fun with the help of clever concepts and great dialogue. I also appreciate the fact that they can well pierce past plots and enemies of old doctors (my friend explains a lot to me while we watch the show), and with respect. <br /> <br /> I won’t mention anything about season 2 and how it ends after the science fiction channel just started broadcasting season 2. <br /> <br /> I would not want to spoil it. It is so fun and exciting. You never want to look away and not miss a word. <br /> <br /> This is really good. <br /> <br /> PS: Thanks to the producers for Nicholas Briggs! ** exterminate! **
