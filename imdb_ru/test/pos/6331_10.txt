Although this is not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word, it is more useful than any film full of laughter but devoid of substance. I do not think that the films of Bergman can be easily attributed to narrow genres, even the lightest are quite complex. This film, despite its light touch, poses a number of problems associated with marriage and its shortcomings, as well as what happens when the flame begins to die, etc. I do not personally deal with all these problems, as I am sure others. But the atmosphere of the film is extraordinary, you almost want it not to end. I must admit that I was swept away by the fifties by Bergman, recognizing most of his later, revolutionary efforts. Before Nikvist, von Sydov, Ulman, etc. The master made some of the richest, warmest, and most touching films I've ever seen. Although it is a long way, I saw such a love for the human race in all its complexity only in Fellini films of the same period. Bergman lovers should watch the lesson of love with the "Smiles of the Summer Night" to get a full picture of the abilities of the person, and those who love the movie with the heart. May he rest in peace!
