Shame is quite unique as a war film (or rather, a completely anti-war film) in the sense that it not only does not focus on the soldiers involved or politics (there is politics, but also not how you think it will be shown) it has dealing with their two main subjects as the only two beings who can generally be cared for in this cruel, decaying society in which they live. Ingmar Bergman, at the height of his peak, and after two other highly psychological films, The Person and The Hour of the Wolf, is much more interested in how the war affects normally civilized creatures, in that it reveals the worst in them. and also, in a cathartic sense, is a reminder of what is really important in life. His two key actors are frequent collaborators and friends Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann (oddly enough, Rosenberg), musicians living on a farm on an island (not too different from Wolf, when you think about it). /> <br /> They see tanks passing by, and a couple of old friends are already wearing out, but they are trying not to get angry; there is a pleasant scene in which the couple simply speaks, quite frankly, but with a heart (everything that is shot, as it is repeated in the film, perhaps in order to provoke a feeling of provocation) ... Then problems arise, including a fake propaganda film made at gunpoint with Rosenbergs, a psychological mess of being prisoners of war, and terror associated with a “friend” in the armed forces (one of the most delicate works of Gunnar Bjornstrand with Bergman). It goes without saying that this is not one of the simplest films from the point of view of Bergman’s filmography, but for some it may be one of his more accessible works. His religious themes this time remain very restrained, even though the idea of ​​preserving a kind of faith permeates the atmosphere of the film. When fighting is underway, it is shot in non-traditional, fast ways (through the great amigo Sven Nikvist). <br /> <br /> And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eve is successfully coordinated against the background of a chaotic war — an area where the lines will never be drawn too accurately. In a sense, this film, shot in the midst of the worst times in Vietnam, is even more relevant today; I could not fail to see the frightening, uncompromising coincidences between Iraq and other places with some scenes of Jan and Eve with the militants or those who “commanded”. By the way, the latest scene is one of the best in Bergman (acting, directing, lighting). This is not a military picture (or, again, anti-war, I do not find John Wayne's spirit in this Sven play), which I would immediately recommend to all my friends in Saving Private Ryan - there is a little more in relation to the Path of Glory looking at the effects of the hypocrisy of war. But in fact, like any “genre” film by Bergman, it stands alone, but the one that fills the crowd with art-house viewers.
