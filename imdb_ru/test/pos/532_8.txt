I'm sorry, but Star Wars: Episode 1 didn’t do justice with Natalie Portman’s talent (and undisputed wit). She was completely underestimated as Queen Amidala, and when she was used, her makeup was frighteningly awful. For “Anywhere but here,” she discards her terrible makeup and behaves normally. And she not only can behave well, but also looks good. I'm a little older than her (she is only 18), and I have almost no chance of meeting her, but hey, the guy is allowed to dream, right? <br /> <br /> Even if Susan Sarandon does it in this film, which is entirely owned by Portman. I’ve been an observer for Portman since the “Beautiful Girls” (where she was younger, but also pretty). In the future she will have big things - I see it.
