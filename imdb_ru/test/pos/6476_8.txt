"Knute Rockne All American", a biopic about the famous beloved trainer Notre Dame Knut Rockne, is a great sports movie to watch. Without seeing this, we were surprised by the technique used in the film by director Lloyd Bacon, which shows that he was ahead of his time in photographing football games. The result is a vivid picture of a person responsible for the legacy of university sports, Knut Rokn. <br /> <br /> In the film, Rockne talks about his humble origins in Chicago and his studies at the famous Notre Dame University in South Bend Indiana. He was an ambitious man who had a vision of how to play the game. Fortunately, he went to give his beloved Notre Dame the glory he was after. <br /> <br /> Pat O'Brien looks a little older when he starts out as a freshman. In fact, he doesn’t change much throughout the entire film, but he’s fine, like Mr. Rockn. Pat O'Brien shows that he can inspire players under his leadership simply by being a father. Gail Page plays Bonnie Rockney, a wise woman who understood the call of her husband in life. Ronald Reagan is played by George "Hipper" Gipp, who was a legend who died too early but left a legacy. Donald Crisp made a great contribution to the role of the father of John Callahan, who was Rockn's tutor at the university. <br /> <br /> This film will delight not only sports thanks to the leadership of Lloyd Bacon and the fast pace that he attaches to the film.
