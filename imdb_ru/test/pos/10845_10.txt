Over the weekend, I watched the movie “Tipping velvet”, and if I had to score 100 points of this film, I would give 100 points without asking questions. I truly believe in true love, and this film touched me differently, and the actors coped with the role without any problems. But I have to say that the ending was not so great, because I did not see that spark in Nancy’s eyes when she looked into Flo’s eyes, because her eyes sparkled every time she looked at Kitty, Kitty should only be in in the room or in Nancy's thoughts, and Nancy simply beamed from this spark. Kitty told Nancy that she could not find her and that she was looking for her, but she could not find her. Kitty was ready to give it all up to get Nancy back. In Kitty's eyes, you could see Kitty's pain. I believe that Nancy should have allowed Kitty to see that their love is true and strong, and that she will not allow her to leave so easily. You need to make up the second part and have these two do it together, but you shouldn’t allow anyone to play the roles that Kitty and Nancy must be real, otherwise it will never work. My mother once told me that true love is simply not true. I am not a fool, I know that we all have true love somewhere, just waiting for each of us, and I believe with my life that Nancy’s true love is really only Kitty, and Kitty’s true love is only Nancy. Come on, let's play the game correctly, the only way. Let Nancy's eyes shine again ... Kitty lost everything, losing Nancy. And Kitty is not the only one to blame. I myself am gay and being gay is not easy !! WAKE UP !!! in 1889, I would not want to be gay, Kitty was deeply immersed in herself, and in 1889 it was probably more correct to marry a man. Even if you love a woman. Kitty needed Nancy to confront her, Nancy needed to fight for her. I myself remember how much I loved this girl, and I let her go, because I thought I was doing something wrong, and I went back to my ex-boyfriend. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I know that I was wrong to let her go, and I would cry until the end of my days, because, like Kitty, I could not find her anywhere. I heard that she is married to a man in the USA. I even heard that he beats her. I think in the end we both lose. Give two girls another chance that life can be very lonely if you are not true to yourself and your lover. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Kristen Ann
