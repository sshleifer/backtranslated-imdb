Hmmm I was a little confused. I mean, I know that I liked the Death Bed, I know that I will spread the Death Bed Gospel to all my friends and acquaintances, and if you read this, I encourage you to see the Death Bed, but I can't really tell you why. Perhaps this is the secret of his charm. <br /> <br /> Story? Well, sort of. There is this bed that eats people (and fried chicken, apples, flowers, suitcases, and any other things that are next to it), sucking them into a mattress filled with digestive fluids. Among his almost limitless abilities, Bed has the ability to hold Aubrey Beardsley's spirit trapped in the picture to watch and tell about the events of the film. Then different people find themselves in an abandoned mansion Trouble (the habit of Trouble eating everything that moves, gives this place an unpleasant reputation), and lays down to have sex, or take a nap, or because they feel bad, and they are eaten sometimes unpleasant dreams first appear . And in the end we have an explosive final confrontation between Burdsley, Mama Bede (you should have been there) and Bede. <br /> <br /> It seems pretty simple when I say that, isn't it? well, except for the part of Aubrey Beardsley. But something feels constantly out of sorts, and the story seems to slumber sleepily from one scene to another, even when indulging in cheap laughter or strange effects of blood. Imagine that Bunel crossed with Bergman, and then went to a large bath with Herschel Gordon Lewis. The tone of the story shifts from horror to a fairy tale, comedy, existential meditation, without interrupting the step - an incredible achievement for a student film without a budget shot in Detroit. <br /> <br /> All in all, an astounding little movie that, quite likely, no review can fully pay tribute. See for yourself.
