“Best in Show” is often a fun layout that takes us to the world of dog shows and some dog owners who are preparing for this event. The only thing that distinguishes this film from real dog shows is that dogs in “Best in Show” behave more sensibly than their owners! Fun things from a first-class cast that includes Eugene Levy (who co-authored the film), Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch and Christopher Guest (who wrote with Levi and directed). They are all funny, but Fred Willard steals the film with his incredibly funny performance as a dog show announcer who says the most outrageous things. Plus dogs are cute too. “Best in Show” is not exactly the riot that I expected, but there is laughter, and it’s worth seeing. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
