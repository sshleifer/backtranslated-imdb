Ramin Bahrani creates a scene in Chop Shope, where I immediately found out where the character Ale (Alejandro Polanco) and his friend came from. They both get on the subway, and as soon as the doors close, they ask if they can get everyone's attention for a moment, and that they sell candy, M & M or something else, and then they continue to sell some bars. If you (like me) have ever been on the subway in New York, at any time, this situation happens so often that you barely notice it. Often, people in the subway see how children or these minorities sell or announce something and talk about something on the subway, and do not pay attention to them. The focus of Bakhrani is not only children who sell items for subway rides, but also the survival and condition they are in when they are in the lowest class in America. Subsequently, he finds himself in his hands thoughtful and heartbreaking, usually immediately. <br /> <br /> Comparing it with Pixote or Bief Thief is not so far away (in fact, the latter is at least the father). and the son have each other), although Bakhrani is defined in his intentions in his documentary style. We care about this character, Ali, no older than eleven, working at a car repair shop who cleans some cars and helps to make out others, as well as his sister, who comes from another city to stay with him. But this is not just because we are forcefully fed with any clichés, except, as you know, brother and sister (especially brother) who are trying to take care of each other. Bahrani makes the story accessible thanks to Ali’s simple desire for a goal that is possible in his situation: having accumulated enough money to buy a used food truck that Ali and Isamar can manage themselves. <br /> <br /> This is all Ali’s work on, but what Bakhrani shows us in gloomy detail is the work Ali has to do to make this happen, even if his unpleasant things, such as tearing off caps tires from cars at Shi Stadium or at one point the wallet is stolen in a desperate moment. This makes the problem even more serious when El sees that his sister makes money on the side at night, providing sexual services to men in an abandoned truck on the side of the road. He does not mention this and pushes him aside, but it is always something that adds tension, something that Ale wants to protect her sister from. This adds to the tragedy when Ale learns the real value of what it takes to turn a food van into a profitable person, and this further increases the pain that he only absorbs. <br /> <br /> You can immediately take a look at the fact that Ale is an orphan in an area like the one in the Queens area, the film was shot in its natural form, such as the work of neo-neo-realism (let's just call it realism), with almost all non-professional actors in parts of mechanics and workers and people on the streets - but Bakhrani is more focused - here and now, and this is what makes the Chop Shop so immediate and cordial. There is no trace of melodrama in the film, not even musical accompaniment, except for live Latin American music coming from cars and radio receivers. Sometimes Bakhrani focuses on a very subtle point that says it in further scenes, for example, how Ale stays awake, but behaves as if he sleeps the first night after he witnesses Isamar’s night meeting, and we see crawls into bed, she probably knows that he is not sleeping, but no one can say a word. Or, in many other scenes, poetic touches that seem seamless, for example, when a man shows Elya how the feeding of pigeons works. <br /> <br /> This is rough and sandy, as you can expect, and this is not so. Give great hope to your main characters, despite the fact that several minutes of happiness flew around. This is also a superbly filmed hand-held film, in which the technique, as in many films shot in urban colors and approaches, informs and complements the scenes on the screen and what they do, but it is also never reckless. shot or too flashy. The filmmaker has an excellent “real” cast (Elya was pulled out of public school in New York without any experience) and knows how not to waste a shot while at the same time achieving brutal mastery, just showing what he shows. It is not the City of God or Pixot; this is his own little masterpiece about a character or characters that we usually wouldn’t simply take a second look (or just the first) on our way in a city like New York. If Ale and his daily struggle will not touch you, I do not know what to do.
