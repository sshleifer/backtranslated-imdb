I caught this movie late at night and never knew what struck me. It was one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen, and yet I sat on the edge of my seat, waiting for what would happen next. Alan Rickman is a great “bad guy,” but this character wins all the rest. I have never been so affected by the film! 6 years have passed, and I still can not forget the "Closet Land".
