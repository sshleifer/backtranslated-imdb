These excellent postwar classics of the 40s are usually overlooked in these <br /> <br /> days. When it was released in 1945, it was cleared in the Oscars of 1946, mainly due to "This is a wonderful life." Both films were the best, the best directors and the best actors, the winners of which were The Best Years. Frederick Marsh, <br /> <br /> and Dana Andrews, along with amateur actor Harold Russell (<br /> <br /> a real soldier who lost both hands in an explosion), play <br /> <br /> Return of the soldiers, the search for life is very different from what they remember. <br /> <br /> Mirna Loy is gorgeous as a March wife who should keep her family together <br /> <br /> while she is not at home. The tear jerk scene <br /> <br /> where March and Loi reunite is gorgeous. All three <br /> <br /> men discover that they have problems adapting to post-war life, and not <br /> <br /> at least Russell has come to terms with artificial hands and his finances <br /> <br /> (Katie O'Donnell) is trying to be too helpful. Sam Goldwyn is quoted as saying that he doesn’t care if the film doesn’t earn money at all <br /> <br /> while everyone in America is watching a film, so they’ll appreciate what these people <br /> <br /> have gone. If a movie is worth 10 out of 10, that's the one.
