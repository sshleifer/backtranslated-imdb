I rate it 8 because of the background of the film. The game was beautiful, there was no one who stood out as amazing or awful. It is disturbing that smart people have fewer and fewer children, or they prefer not to have children at all ... while supporters of the stupid ass "W in '04" breed like rabbits. And, although I do not believe that the earth will really exist in 500 years, I see that the parodied prophet Mike Judge will become like a life imitating art. The world is ruled by idiots, and it will deteriorate when smart and freedom-loving people become a minority, and the fans of "valiant deeds" outnumber them. The proof is our farce election. <br /> <br /> But I digress. If you are lucky that you play in your city, look at it. I paid my popcorn for $ 7.50 to see the rubbish "EVEN SLOWLY" than this (Date of the movie or someone from "Napoleon Dynamite"?). There is laughter, there is a buzz, but in general it is interesting. If you have half the brain, you will think to yourself how this film, although funny, is accurate and precise, but a bit strange. I’m not all surprised that this film is almost completely unknown, because Fox was the one who distributed it, and they wouldn’t want one of their sheep to see it and think: “Maybe I’RE READ the book and not see "Next," or "Fraudsters," or, "Oh, My Eggs."
