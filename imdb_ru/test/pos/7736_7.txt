William Shakespeare probably did not expect Stefanos to become a gay doctor, Antonio an unfaithful wife, or Caliban a scapegoat with Trinitron, but with time Bard coped worse with his good work and could even enjoy the luxurious presentation of life. this is his “Storm”, reconfigured by Paul Mazursky and co-author Leon Kapetanos. <br /> <br /> This time Prospero is Philip Dimitry (John Cassevetes), an architect from Manhattan, who is tired of designing Atlantic City. casino for the gracious Mafiosi Alonso (Vittorio Gassman), especially after he discovered that Alonso was having an affair with his wife Philip Antonia (Gena Rowlands). Together with his daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald), Philip runs off to a remote Greek island with Miranda and his new mistress Aretha (Susan Sarandon), a sweet Catholic who struggles with Philip's unmarried lifestyle. After all, a sudden storm will bring everything in order? <br /> <br /> Here is the thought of Cassevetes's career: how many other actors can turn a film into such confusion? Dear film critic for his early work, often with his real wife Rowlands, he represents the main character who really suffers because of his art here, but seems to enjoy himself and make us enjoy it too. This is not Prospero, but something rich and strange that makes a stunning sea completely change it. <br /> <br /> “Everything is here,” he tells one of his faithful comrades, Areta Nino's dog. "Beauty, magic, inspiration and serenity." What is it. “The Storm” takes London to Manhattan in 1611 and finds some pleasant resonances in Philip's displaced life. “Show me the magic,” he calls out to a skyscraper in a storm city, and the Mazursky version, supplemented by Donald McAlpine’s stunning cinematic depiction of purple seascapes and, of course, sun-burnt Greek landscapes, does just that. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie, by any means. In fact, the big finale, which is the only part of the film that to some extent corresponds to Shakespeare's storyline, is a mess. In this movie about Rowland’s character it’s very difficult to take care of, and after meeting Sarandon in all her reckless glory, it’s hard to understand Philip’s constant concern for his wife, not to mention his left-sided desire to bring an unfortunate “victim” to restore the natural order of things. <br /> <br /> But in “Storms” there is something to love. In addition to Cassavetis, there is a debut in the film of Ringwald as his devoted, but restless daughter, here as in the play the object of striving for the primitive village “Kalibanos” (Raul Julia). Ringwald here is the same teen muse of privileged adolescence, which would have inspired John Hughes, but with emotional depth those later Hughes films did not penetrate. Ringwald and Julia never attracted the attention of Oscar, but they both would have won the Golden Globe for their playful work here. He is trying to get hold of her in her island isolation with the help of his repeated screening of the movie “Gunsmoke” in Greek, seduced by her 15-year-old body. <br /> <br /> “I want to pester you with my Bonnie Johnny,” Kalibanos says that he is being pushed aside, but still gaining our sympathy, especially after the performance of “New York, New York” with a goat chorus. (When “The Tempest” hit the screens, Julia was Broadway's toast starring in Nine.) <br /> <br /> This is a Mazury show, even if it sometimes seems that Cassavetis is running an improvisational reading line and emotional breakdowns are in abundance . (Philip meets Areta, telling her: “I am in the midst of a nervous breakdown.”) He plays his character as a gracious obsessed, seeking to crystallize his happiness, building a theater on his uninhabited island. <Br /> <br /> Gassman’s rich performance gives pleasure, as does another person who is as friendly as Julia, and tells the young man who possesses Philip: “Boys do not have as many means as ours. They are "nervous ... and they make love in the back of an old sports car." Despite the fact that it is too long and pretentious in some places, like many other feature films, The Tempest entertains with its excesses and a journey very similar to what Shakespeare planned, even if in his dreams there was no smoking backstage at the Go-Gos concert.
