This film is a great comedy drama. Christopher Walken is great in his role as a manager, and his comments will make you laugh. Robin Williams plays a big role as a savvy “John Stewart” and will entertain you if you are fans of Comedy Central. The show is good, because if the viewer has a half-brain, he will view it as a much-needed subcultural attack on the policies of the current Republican government and criticism of the American democratic process ... and not mention the methods of electing most politicians. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at the auxiliary plots and found that the film is very fast and interesting, without any ordinary “o-brother”. agree, the film is less comedic than sold, however, no doubt, better than 90% of the garbage in movie theaters at present. Just my thoughts ... Don
