Surprisingly well done for TV Thriller I did not expect too much from this, but I am glad to say that this is one of the best of its kind. This is a fast paced and excellent acting game and interesting events. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, the story hooked you, and with many hits you cannot but find the film very interesting. <br /> <br /> Thyssen's background story is complex. but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than the stepfather of her childhood friend. <br /> <br /> The concept of a “stranger” and its actions cause concern if you consider that this is a common disease in society. The serial rapist does not respect society or even his family, and this film perfectly shows illness and crime. <br /> <br /> My concern about the film was a meaningless situation when the character Thyssen returns home with his abnormal husband after being released on bail. By that time, she already knew what he had done with his young relative (who is played by the pretty Allison Hannigan). But this is only a typical Hollywood scene, which causes more problems. <br /> <br /> The climax scene shows that Thyssen follows her husband when he is about to commit another rape, then she calls the police who arrive in time to catch him. The end tells us that in real life the husband was sentenced to 99 years in prison. <br /> <br /> The game is also pretty good, and Tiffany, as always, is gorgeous and gorgeous. The direction is also very good.
