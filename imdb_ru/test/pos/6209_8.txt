Preston Sturgis "POWER AND GLORY" was not visible to the public for almost twenty or thirty years until the end of the 1990s, when it surfaced and even appeared on television. At the same time, he gained notoriety because Pauline Kehl's “CIVIL BOOK” suggested that the script of Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Wells for KANE is based on the Sturgis script here. As mentioned at the beginning of this topic for the movie on the IMDb website, Kehl exaggerated his work. <br /> <br /> There are about six narrators who take turns telling about the life of Charles Foster Kane: newsreels (representing Ralston - a clone of Henry Luce), the memoirs of Thatcher, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane and Raymond the Butler. Everyone has their own view of Kane, reflecting their faith, disappointment or hatred towards the person. And, of course, each also reveals his shortcomings when telling his version of the story of Kane. This method also leads to frequent repetitive repetitions of the same incident. <br /> <br /> This is not a situation in FORCE AND GLORY. Yes, like KANE, we are talking about a legendary business leader - here is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose to the very bottom and became the head of the most successful railway system in the country. But there are only two narrators - this is the right hand of Garner Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This limits the almost three-dimensional representation that we get in the time of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he talks, talks about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of a skeptical public — she only sees flaws in Henry. <br /> <br /> A typical example: although he achieved success, Tom becomes more and more an opponent of labor in the years to come. The unions are troublemakers, and he doesn’t want their machinations to slow down. Henry describes Tom’s confrontation with the Union in a major dismissal and how it bothered him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him of how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (obviously, having blown up the headquarters of the Union — killing a lot of people). Thus, we have two views on this person, but one is pure white and the other is pure black. <br /> <br /> In fact, I don’t bring down POWER and GLORY for not duplicating KANE’s success (few films are made - including all from Orson Welles ’other films), but I know that the story is well represented to interest until the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore in the role of his wife, Sally, the tragedy of the couple’s worldly success fully returns home. <br /> <br /> When they get married, Tom wants to succeed (in part) to give his wife and their family benefits that he never had. But in America, big business success is expensive. Tom is deeply involved in the management of the empire of the railway (he expands it and is constantly improving). But it takes him too much out of the house, and he loses touch with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), a young woman who becomes his lover. When Sally finds out about his misbehavior, it destroys her. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Tom also receives a complete shock (which makes him a martyr in Henry's eyes). Eve marries Tom and gives him a son - but it turns out that this is the son of Eva from the son of Tom Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). Finding this incestuous cattle causes Tom to shoot himself. <br /> <br /> The film is not successful - the action skips from time to time unconvincingly. However, this makes the business real (note the situation when Tom tells the board of directors about his plans to acquire a small competing railway line and discusses the use of debt obligations to finance plans). Sturgis came from a rich background, so he could bring this type of detail. So overall this is a first-class film. Perhaps not a CITIZEN KEYN, but an interest for movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression of America.
