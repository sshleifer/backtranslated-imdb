I have to say that this film was perfectly shot and surpassed the ratings as a typical science fiction film! I liked it ... it's a science fiction movie, if you want a thriller to watch another channel ... This is what the fans of fiction want. Perfectly produced by one of the top Sci-Vandiver Sci-Fi producers! OK, the special effects weren't great, but what a great cast! A little more money could be used for effects, but again, that in science has a great budgetary effect. Stop complaining and change the channel if you donâ€™t like this type of movie. Films like Mission Impossible and Braveheart are great, but they are not science fiction films. done .. keep them in oil!
