This film was not only better than the entire final season of H: LOTS. But it was better than any movie made for television that I have ever seen! <br /> <br /> Looking at the “Top 250”, I see that only one movie on the small screen did this: How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I think the time has come to increase this group to 2. <br /> <br /> I recognize that there were several shows in the original series that were better than this, but I did not mind. I just LOVE that I can re-enter the world of the assassination squad in Baltimore!
