This film is more a tool of corruption in the entire American system. The ratio of those who vote, who does not matter, is so proven in cars that the comedianâ€™s voting in the oval office ends. Politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us, how we have been laughed for years all over the world. Bushism has become a lifestyle for Americans and will be the only thing left after he leaves his post soon. Strangely enough, the only honest person is someone who is not even elected to this position, and in the end speaks the truth. The story is very thin, and if you laugh at it, it will not happen. Leaves a lot to think about. Overall I liked it.
