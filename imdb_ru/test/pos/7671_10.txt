I found this film one of the best for this time and era. The cast was very exceptional and most interesting for all who saw it. I would like my younger generation to watch this movie, but I could not find or watch a movie in the past. My first viewing was again in the early sixties, and I have been looking for it since. The film showed me the potential of how far we have come to be gifted in a craft where we could only have meaningless roles to act as jesters and servants. <br /> <br /> Porky and Bess told about the urban life of my neighborhood, as I saw it at a time when I needed good, solid role models for men. Singing and acting made me skip days playing different characters in this excellent film.
