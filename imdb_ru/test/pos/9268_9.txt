I saw this documentary at the 2005 Independent Film Festival Slamdance. This documentary was shot, directed and edited by the son (Craig) of his mother’s battle with cancer from year to year. The one-year-long shot, “The Closer She Gets,” is a documentary in true form and gives you an inner look at the family’s fight against cancer, the viewer gets an internal view on the effects that cancer has on the family human throughout the process. I have never seen such an honest film, it is a powerful and raw film, and since it was not filmed by an outsider, you get the true emotions of all the participants. Many documentaries were shot by outsiders, but the story of this story by the son adds another emotional level to the film, unlike what I had seen earlier on this or any other issue. This is a touching story that everyone should see and to which you can relate. I highly recommend it.
