Although I have not yet seen this, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only one of his talents could take up this bold theme - the comedy about Hitler. All great satire is based on reaching the brink. Also, all the great comedies deal with the other side - pathos. Looks like this film will bypass both sides. Like Dr. Stenklave Kubrick, the Great Dictator deals with history through a distorted satire lens. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is to laugh at it. And, I hope, thanks to laughter, we can learn to look at the world in a new light. Another film that does this, which comes to my mind, is “Underground” of Emir Kusturica and “Fando and Lys”. So let me see the movie first.
