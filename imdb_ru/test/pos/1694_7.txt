In The Landscape After the Battle, Andrzej Wajda in the second era of his cinematic career portrays emotional and psychological confusion in the former Nazi prison in Poland, freed immediately after World War II. <br /> <br /> A hand-held camera explores a variety of extreme close-ups and vivid colors. The end of the loan in the form of graffiti on the sides of freight cars symbolically completes the film. The soundtrack is great, with the exception of Vivaldi, which sounds tasteless in pop art style.
