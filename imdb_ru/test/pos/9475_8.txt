This is the first James Cagney film I've really seen. I had never been interested in his films before, because I decided that I didnâ€™t like anything in this style of cinema, and because I heard that most Cagney films are the same. I have to say I really liked it. By today's standards for the cinema it was not special, but I found it surprisingly interesting. Cagney didn't look like a tough guy, but he played the role very well.
