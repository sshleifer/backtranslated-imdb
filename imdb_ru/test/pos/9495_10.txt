I like this movie. He manages to arouse sympathy in characters (well, most of them) in relation to the problems they face. <br /> <br /> Gloria Swanson, like Leila, is in a dusty marriage with her husband, who barely notices her presence. (although he notices her absence). The film very well shows why she is tired of family life and why she is susceptible to a sweet-talking con artist, without making her selfish or demanding. Leila’s reaction to the dinner table on her anniversary, when her workaholic husband (again late for dinner) eats salted shallots with pleasure and pulls the bride and groom dolls off his plate, perfect. > <br /> Elliot Dexter stole - and stole - easily, like Jim, Leila's careless husband. Having lost Leila to another man, Jim literally clears his act, shaving off his mustache, trying to lose the middle-aged spread and dressing neatly. There are several pictures of Jim in the house, alone and thinking about Leila, including a powerful scene when he finds one of her old dresses in the closet. The film gives viewers the opportunity to observe the transformation of Jim with Leila. Not only looks are more attractive; we learn much more about what kind of person Jim really is, and see how completely different he is from Leila's second husband, Schuyler (Lew Cody). Dexter shines both before and after Jim, who, having discovered Schuyler’s true character, is determined to return Leila if he can. The most touching moment of the movie comes when Jim and Leila discover that they are standing under the mistletoe, and Jim talks about what he has lost. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
