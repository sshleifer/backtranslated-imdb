If you have not seen this movie, do it. This is genremix, as I have never seen another. Some very surreal scenes, some funny funny things, noir film cutting, musical numbers on a grand scale, sexy scenes (2nd best orgasm played in the film, superior only to Sally), Orson Welles step, mixed together into a work of art should not be logical at the end, at least not logical for everyone ;-). I had a television copy on VHS, but I lent it to an ex-girlfriend, and now I can't get her back. But the film should be released on DVD in Austria on June 10, 2003, and I will definitely buy it.
