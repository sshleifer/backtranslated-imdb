So, Keira Knightley in it ... So, we automatically compare this movie with the setting. Apart from the fact that this film is also of wartime and its appearance cannot be surprising, these films are completely different. <br /> <br /> Actors work well, I think that one good thing is that there is no memorable person, they are a team. <br /> <br /> If you want a film in which everything happens, then advise another one, since the story of this film is about human interaction and how their physical life is damaged by their experience and how their life is intertwined. <br /> <br /> This film has a genuine interaction, ideal pause moments that make you hold your breath. No, it's not interesting, but it's exciting if you can empathize with these characters. At some moments I wondered if this film was better than a theater play than a film. We expect a lot from the cinema, because everything is possible, but in the theater we communicate and rely on faith. <br /> <br /> There is something bad about it if you are looking for a blockbuster, if you are not looking for anything and let the film take you, move you, allow yourself to forget these stars, and not judge them as actors, but allow they become people, you really feel displaced. <br /> <br /> FORWARD! ! Try it!
