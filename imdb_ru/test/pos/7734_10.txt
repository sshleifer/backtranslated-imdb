I just can not believe the low ratings of this film. The probable cause is associated with a low number of votes, which means that few have seen it. This is just a fantastic movie! Inside there are so many stories intertwined, but this is not difficult. Each character grows with the film, and we experience how it undergoes changes in life. The scenery is simply awesome, and the final credits are the best in any movie I've seen (as in Shakespeareâ€™s play). Yes, it is a bit outdated (filmed in 1982), but the problems faced by the characters are very relevant. This could have been filmed in 2002 without a change in the storyline. Raul Julia is amazing, the best movie role is his authoring work. Young Molly Ringwald is superb as she matures from girl to young woman. Susan Sarandon is beautiful as a young carefree woman, and John Cassavetes is the force that unites all of this. Do yourself a favor, find this film, watch it and enjoy it. Go back to IMDb and rate this film in the top 250 of all time where it really belongs.
