This was the first completed project of Eisenstein in the last ten years. The film takes place in the 13th century during the Russian invasion of the Germans (I think the Teutonic Knights). Released in 1938, this is a very weak parallel to Russia's approaching participation in World War II and the advancement of Germany to Eastern Europe. There are some incredible scenes, the most noticeable battle at the end of the film, and there is a shocker when children are thrown into a fire pit, but this is not an easy clock. The film lasts and is not as brilliant as Potemkin or Ivan the Terrible. Sometimes Eisenstein is better at clips. His brilliance is present, however, and it is “a must see” for Eisenstein fans and film historians. Russian propaganda in all its glory.
