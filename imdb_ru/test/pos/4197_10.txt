“Head” is one of those films in which it will be difficult for you to convince your friends to watch, but as soon as they do, they will fall in love with it. I do not know how many times this has happened to me. This film is just ridiculous and bizarre, really destroys everything that monkeys had up to this point in their career. Much credit goes to Bob Rafelson, who largely ended his Monkee career with this film. I guess he wanted to get away from the direction of the television show and get into features that he did heavily after that. Mickey Dolenc is absolutely funny. I can't believe that he didn’t have a second life as a comic actor after this film. There are a lot of great cameos and a lot of psychedelic nonsense in this movie. I feel that the reputation of this film continues to grow, and it will not surprise me if it eventually becomes a complete cult classic.
