I would say that in general the Barbie movies impressed me. I have a five-year-old Barbie's fanatic niece, and she watches them all the time, so there is no need to say that I saw quite a few Barbies during these holidays, but I was not tired of them. visually, there is something to offer, especially the backgrounds, and the character animation improves with each new movie. In particular, I noticed a significant improvement in the Barbie hair animation in this film. It has a wonderful range of excerpts from classical music, and I think this is great, as it exposes a new generation to the classics. This film is worth it, especially if you have young fans. They will be entertained for hours!
