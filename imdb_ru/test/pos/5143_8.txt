In Creek, Logan Lerman plays Roy Eberhardt, a new student who has just moved from Montana. But Florida is very different from Montana. Despite the problems with the merger, Roy discovers a big problem. A new franchise restaurant arrives in the city, and families of burrowing owls are in trouble. Can a new child, a tomboy (Brie Larson) and runaway (Cody Linley) prevent a big business from destroying the house of these owls? <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty good. The kids (Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley) are the real stars of this film. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) is fine, but in fact it does not really matter. Neither Robert Wagner (Mayor), nor Jimmy Buffet (Mr. Ryan). <br /> <br /> However, it was a fun movie that the whole family would love. For the first time, the producer thought that Jimmy Buffett had collected quality work. Plus the owls were really cute.
