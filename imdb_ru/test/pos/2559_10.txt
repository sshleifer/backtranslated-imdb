Where should I start? Let me say that - after watching the entire film and special features on DVD - my wife and I again watched the entire movie with the director's comments. I do not remember ever having endured more than 7 minutes of such a comment for a film. Worth hearing. <br /> <br /> Iâ€™m not a southern guy, but I spent some time in Memphis a long time ago, and I feel this area. This film almost smells South, it's so real. Samuel Jackson, one of my favorite actors of all time, is gorgeous as emotionally bent Lazarus, and Christina Ricci performs all her life in the role of Rey, a woman who was badly wounded in her short life. I always liked the work of Ms. Ricci, but in this performance she gives 137% of herself every second when she is on the screen. Awards and small statues are not enough to reward her for what she put in front of the audience in this film. <br /> <br /> There are other places where you can read the story, so I just comment on the work. I heard the name of Justin Timberlake before I saw BSM, but I had no idea how he looked or even why he was famous. Having hit my head about 60 years old, I, at least, am outside my target audience. After watching this movie, I recognize it. He can act! He gives substantial, believable work as a loving soul mate whores county. <br /> <br /> A director from Memphis respects his region. He is also a wonderful storyteller. <br /> <br /> ..... and I MUST mention music. I love blues, and the Black Snake Moan soundtrack is a real treat for a blues fan. <br /> <br /> I write less cohesively than usual, because my enthusiasm for this film overcomes the structure of the sentences. Watch this movie and I mean it now.
