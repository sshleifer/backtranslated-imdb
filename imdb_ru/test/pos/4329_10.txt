Using the boat, Jack and Said came up with a plan of confrontation with "Others". However, when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley follow Michael in “The Others”, Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret while they are in the wilderness. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time is now time to find out that it is time to find out what will happen if the “button” is not pressed. However, Mr. Eco’s determination to keep pressing the “button” is surprisingly strong. Therefore, when Locke comes up with a plan to block Eco from the hatch with the help of an ally, Eco does everything he can to prevent Locke from doing what he considers a big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is a classic episode of “The Lost”, full of secrets, uncertainty and very few answers to the many questions that it poses to its viewers.

One thing is guaranteed, it will make you guess until the very end, and you will still be disappointed with more stunning questions while you are in agony waiting for the start of the third season.
