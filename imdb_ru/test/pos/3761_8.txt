"Pearl Harbor, mate." This movie is great! Of course, this is not quite the same as in the multi-million comedy, but the constant jokes are just incredible. Iâ€™m a foolish person, very much like Dumb and Dumber, Airplane and Wet American Hot Summer, and I must say that it easily takes place there. Movies are simply not written with such a sporadic comedy. Too many jokes in this are so surprising to the viewer that it is truly amazing that they no longer know and praise this masterpiece of the farce! Watching this, you will easily find more than 20 quotes from it, which you will find, that you are quoting the afterglow ... and after viewing you will find again more!
