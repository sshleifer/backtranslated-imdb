This film reminded me of the lively dramas of the 1950s — not like the recent “Reliable,” which seemed more of a gimmick than anything else, but a TRUE moral drama that simultaneously attracts and makes you wonder. Anne Heche is more than trustworthy because the army officer has an affair with her boss, played by Sam Shepard, and Eric Stolz is great because her lawyer protects her from the military department. I expected their business to start, if only because they look so good together. This film is obviously based on a true story, and it is a relief when I am asked to think about real issues for change. <br /> <br /> Directed by Christopher Menol, who also starred in the TV series Passion Ayn Rand (along with Stolz) and Prime Suspect, is a film in a big way and style worth seeing.
