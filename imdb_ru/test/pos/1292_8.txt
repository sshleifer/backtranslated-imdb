Humphrey Bogart in his first leading role looks very young, behaves well, but has a pronounced surge, which is only hinted at later in his career. Nevertheless, he is very good and very attractive as an idealistic young inventor of the new engine. <br /> <br /> Dorothy McKale is a real star playing a once-rich woman who is torn between her true love for Bogart (he also broke) and the convenience and security of marriage with an older man (Hale Hamilton). <br /> <br /> Astrid Alwyn is involved in the trip as Bogartâ€™s tragic sister, Bradley Page as her potential producer Barbara Leonard as a beautician, Jack Kennedy as Gilligan and Holliwell Hobbs as a faithful (and wise) butler. <br /> <br /> Both McKale (who was a star in silent films) and Bogart tried to keep a foothold in conversations in 1932. Bogart was a slowly rising actor from a stage on Broadway; Mackaill slipped and will soon appear in the production of the sled, as PICTURE BRIDES. Yet they are both very good here. Mackaill wasn't even 30 when she appeared in this movie!
