This British documentary was recently shown on Comedy Central during their "Best of ??" week and can also be seen on DVD of the second season of South Park. I remember seeing a lot of commercials on a DVD with clips of this documentary, most of which occur with Matt Stone, Trey Parker and some other guy in the hot tub. It was funny when I saw him in commercials, but I was used to seeing him by the time I saw a real documentary. <br /> <br /> Overall, “Goin 'Down to South Park” is quite funny and interesting to see how episodes are created in South Park, and how the story of the series goes back to the moment when Matt and Trey put the idea into college . However, there was something in the tone of this documentary that actually was a bit dismal. This is not so fast, fast, and not as lively as in the real episodes of South Park. Instead, he has a slow, reckless style that can sometimes be funny, but most of the time you just wait for something to happen. If you have the opportunity to watch it, by all means, do it, but I do not think that you really miss you so much if you never see it. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 7/10
