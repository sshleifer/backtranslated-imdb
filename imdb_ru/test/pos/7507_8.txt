Dr. Bock teaches at the hospital, and he is good at it. The thing is, he's depressed. Dr. Bok and his wife separated, his children are deviant, he cannot speak in the bedroom, and it seems to him that he is not very good at helping people heal. He commits suicide, but meets Barbara, who changes his ideas for the better. Everywhere around this story is the murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outside. <br /> <br /> The film is well-made, and Dr. Boc's character is well-played. It's a little sad, a little funny, and a little dramatic. It was nice to see a couple of stories wrapped around the hospital, even if they were somewhat unrelated to what Dr. Bock was doing. A great movie.
