I just want to comment on the woman above that the film is Beethovenâ€™s merit in begging. At the beginning of the credits they show it. Thank. I think this is a terrific movie. They picked up exactly the music that is suitable for the mood of the film, the animation is wonderful, and they very well picked up voices for the characters. He teaches children to never give up and always have hope. Princess Annika does not give up, and this shows the children that they can do the same. The film also has humor for all ages, parents and children to laugh. The colors in this film are great, and children can feel good while watching it. I watched this movie for the first time, now I'm a big fan, and I am sure that your child will also be. Walmart sells tons of Barbie and Pegasus Magic, so your child can continue to enjoy the film, even if he does not watch it. Thank you!
