This is my favorite cartoon Looney Tunes. This is a common plot: Daffy Duck is trying to convince Elmer Fudd that this is really the season of rabbits, and shoot Zhukov. But you can never outwit this rabbit! In addition to the usual cartoon comedy, this cartoon is supported by a great play on words that will make you roll on the floor.
