Caesopatra (delightful Monica Bellucci) is challenged by Cesar (Alain Chabat): to prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans, she promises to build a fancy castle for Cesar within three months without any delay. She calls the one-armed architect Numerobis (Jamel Debbuzi) and gives him two options: to be covered with gold if he fulfills his mission, or to become food for a crocodile if he fails. Numerobis will seek help from Panoramix (Claude Rich), Asterix (Christian Clavier) and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideiafix). This film is very funny, especially the parts in which Obelix and the Pirates led by Red Beard are involved. However, the screenwriter and director should have noticed that French is not a universal language, like English. Consequently, jokes with words (as, for example, in Austin Powers films) are not well suited for people who are foreign to the French language. French people and people who are fluent in French will surely love these jokes, but they have no meaning for me, who do not speak French. My voice is seven.
