I know a girl who figure skated for the main girl. Once she met my brother, and she was always very sweet! I also live in Cranbrook, about 15 minutes from Fort Steele. Haha, I went there on excursions when I was in elementary school. It was strange to see this in the film. I also had a chance when the film was shot to be optional, because for them there was casting in the mall. But I didnâ€™t want to go at this time, because I was not interested in acting. Now I would completely like me to do. It was such a terrific movie that I bought it on Ebay. It never came out here, (which is rather strange to see that it was partially shot here), so I was excited when it arrived. I really loved the storyline, and the bear was pretty sweet. But if someone has a Fort Style question, just ask him :)
