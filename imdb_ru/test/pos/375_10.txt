When Alfred Hitchcock starred in the film “STRANGERS ON A TRAIN,” a harbinger that most of the film was made public, he returned to the top of his form. From 1946 to 1950, his films were not box office successes, and his contractual agreement with David O. Selznik ended because of this. In fact, he made some really good films of that period, such as “HUGE”, “SPELLBOUND”, “UNDER CARICORN”, “ROPE” and (in my opinion) “STAGESTRUCK”. But despite the fact that “HUGE” and “SPELLBOUND” were liked, the audience was rejected by Hitch's attempts to experiment: his use of the sequence of dreams of Salvator Dali in “SPELLBOUND” was acceptable, as was the situation among psychiatrists. But the experiment with long takes in ROPE embarrassed the public (forcing it to ignore the merits of this film), and Hitch’s reluctance to deceive the audience with a lie told by the lead character in the memoirs is much more disliked than it deserves to be - in STAGESTRUCK. The question of a bad time for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released at the moment when scandals broke out with its star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosalini) made it seem like a failure (which was not the case). The case of PARADIN was another failure - and one that really had little use. <br /> <br /> With STRANGERS ON TRAIN, Hitchcock evaded special tricks that interested him in recent films. Instead, he focused on his favorite topics of common guilt and mistaken identity. Based on the novel by Patricia Highsmith, the story of how Guy Haynes, a professional tennis player, meets his fan - Bruno Anthony, a playboy - who travels on an all-terrain train at the same time as an athlete. Bruno is talkative and frowning, and Guy regards him as one of the typical fans he met ... albeit a bit eccentric, with his talk about wanting to be on the first rocket into space. But Bruno knows all about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam and in love with Anna Morton, the daughter of the senator. Bruno knows that Miriam will not divorce his successful famous husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather, who constantly criticizes him. Then Bruno mentions (in some way) that he has an idea about two men - technically unfamiliar people who exchange murders with each other and then commit two committed, intractable crimes instead of deceiving them. The guy listens to the idea - and agrees that this is an interesting idea. The train reaches Guy's destination, and his last comment is similar to the confirmation of the idea. He simply does not understand that Bruno’s “eccentric” is a sociopath, and believes that Guy has just agreed that they are killing each other’s enemies! <br /> <br /> This is actually a surprisingly simple plot. Bruno, of course, kills Miriam, but he fully expects Guy to fulfill the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. The guy is terrified - and even worse, he discovers that he is the number one suspect from the police department. When Bruno, to encourage Guy, mentions that he has the lighter of the latter (he put him on the train) and can land him at the scene of the murder, Guy has deeper problems - how to avoid the police and how to control (if possible) Mad Mad ? <br /> <br /> Hitch always carefully planned the frames of his film so that from the very beginning we would see both of our “heroes” with our feet heading for their fateful meeting on the train with each other. The film uses constant cross contacts to show how the two men are drawn into each other’s orbits. It seems to be the fate that unites them. Yet both have their own individuality - and Hitch, with a typical twist, makes the insane Bruno a actually more attractive figure. His scheme may be flawed (if successful, he will kill two people, and he will force Guy to fulfill the agreement, no matter what). he has an interest in life. There is a suspicion that Guy once had one too, but the failure of his marriage, combined with the fact that he now meets with a socially famous woman, made him more circumspect and boring than he was. <br /> <br /> The cast is also good. Robert Walker probably played his best part in this film (just a year before his death). It was far from the homespun boy next door, because you left or the clock. His flexible figure also looked quite elegant in the stories in several scenes. Because Guy Farley Granger acts as a cousin of his co-killer in ROPE, especially since circumstances make him all the more suspicious of the authorities (since his previous role caused him to have suspicious behavior towards Jimmy Stewart). As for the ladies, Kesi Rogers is truly slutty, like Miriam, which allows the audience to be ready for her death (in a known sequence, shot in the reflection of her glasses), so that they actually cheer on Bruno in his act of evil. Patricia Hitchcock appears as Anna's younger sister (Ruth Roman), who is very similar to Miriam and accidentally goes to Bruno for a social event. She plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman duly supports Granger, but limits her role because she is an establishment and a little restrained. Other support performers, Leo G. Carroll as senator, Marion Lorn (usually a comedian) as the spotted mother Bruno and Norma Warden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker — all show the best advantage — everything is in the hands of the master.
