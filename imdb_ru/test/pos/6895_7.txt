"Sell the dead" - a big sloppy comedy of horrors, which refuses to take themselves too seriously. This has its advantages and disadvantages. 85 minutes of the film have passed, and the film is full of bits, sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes bloody, sometimes all three at the same time, but the individual bits are much better than the sum of the parts of the film. <br /> The story, as it is, follows the professional grave robber Arthur Blake (played by Dominic Monagan). The criminal partner of Arthur Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden) just cut off his head for the murder, and Arthur stayed one night before his own head was punished for the same crime. Arthur insists that he is innocent of the murder, but there are many other crimes that he is willing to confess when he is bought by an Irish whiskey by a Catholic priest (played by Ron Perlman). <br /> <br /> Since the release of the film, this is a series of jokes grabbing graves recognized by Arthur, it becomes a kind of an anthology of horror - a series of scattered stories connected by a similar cast (Arthur and Willy) and a similar theme (robbing graves ). As in most anthologies of horror, there is no single mythology, because all mythologies are true and occur simultaneously, even if they contradict each other. <br /> <br /> It probably didn’t help that I watched this movie the same night as Pleasure Trick, an anthology of horror that avoids all the traps I sell The Dead to. In fact, Trick 'r Treat, designed as an anthology, tells a more unified, consistent story than “I Sell The Dead,” which is intended to become a single narrative. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the film (and I admit that this is crazy picky) - so quickly and freely plays a movie with a story. Grimes killed guillotine. We could stretch the point and say that he was killed by a Scottish maiden, the forerunner of the French guillotine, but the Scottish maiden was left in 1709, and this film was shot a hundred years after mentioning Burke and Hare and they were executed for murder in 1829 The robbery of graves as an industry became obsolete with the adoption of the Anatomy Act (1832), so the film must take place before. <br /> <br /> I know that this is an absolute historical bore, and we are clearly dealing with a universe where all kinds of dead, undead and legendary dead are possible, but the easiest way to consolidate imagination, to convince viewers to stop their disbelief is to use something real and genuine to reflect the fantasy from. And this is not like the story of grave robbers, kidnappers and resurrections (call it what you will) - a boring story. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating thing is that the writer. Director Glenn McQuade clearly knows the history of especially good bits. For example, when Grimes first takes Arthur as his student, he correctly explains to Arthur that, as resurrected, they do not steal clothes from the dead, because stealing corpses is a misdemeanor, punishable by a small fine, while clothing theft is a felony punishable deportation or even death. So you expect Ville and Arthur to undress the corpse at this moment (and for the rest of the film), but of course they don’t. You could blame the director for ignoring the script of his author, but not when the author and the director are one and the same person. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to say that there should have been a lot of naked corpses in the body. the film, my point is that if you are going to raise this whim in the law and make it clear that Willy and Arthur will follow the law, no matter how stupid it may be, then you will have to bring this thought to its logical conclusion. even if it means that Willie and Arthur are chasing the zombies through the graveyard, trying to tear off his or her clothes and shove them back into an empty coffin so that they will not be sent for stealing clothes of a walking corpse, otherwise do not raise this issue at all. <br /> <br /> Not to mention historical tediousness, “Sell the Dead” is worth rolling as a small but funny horror film, which could be much more.
