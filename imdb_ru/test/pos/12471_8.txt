If you're looking for a modern version of the Buster Crabbe movie or how Johnny Weismyuller overcomes the machinations of unscrupulous white safari guides or sly blacks to save the animal kingdom, this is NOT a movie for you. This is a retelling of Tarzan's “legend” from the very beginning in intellectual, adult terms. It is beautifully filmed and true to the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Tarzan is not a hero of an action movie, but a man torn between two worlds - natural and civilized. In a stunning performance, Christopher Lambert portrays this fear with absolute realism. If he slips only once, the cat will leave the bag: the public (especially the adult audience that the film is aimed at) will laugh, and the film will completely lose its power. It will sink into the cheese depths. But Lambert will never allow it. (Forget that you can think of him in other films; when I saw this movie in the cinema in its initial release, I thought he deserved an Academy Award.) <br /> <br /> The cast is equally excellent because other commenters noted. I disagree with most of them that I didn’t find anything wrong with Andy McDowell’s speech. I would not have nominated her for the Academy Award — the role is not demanding — but she is fully prepared for this, whatever it may be. I also do not know why her voice was imposed. <br /> <br /> The cinematic plot of the African plot is very beautiful. It reflects both the beauty of African wildlife and the exotic expectations that it carries in the collective imagination of those who have never been there. Landscapes are lush and exotic, and the colors are bright. <br /> <br /> But this is also a “historical” film, and the cinematography also beautifully portrays Victorian England - the countryside, the city and the interiors. Costumes are outstanding. The soundtrack is beautiful, but not overloaded or intrusive. <br /> <br /> There are several disturbing scenes, especially for animal lovers, but no more disturbing than a few scenes in Dances With Wolves. This is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature, embodied in the young Lord Greystoke, convincingly portrayed by Christopher Lambert.
