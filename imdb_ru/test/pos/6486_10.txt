Of all the major stellar actresses of the 30s, Miriam Hopkins was the most strangely forgotten and underestimated. Her range of superb films of the 30s and 40s is impressive, but she is often called spectacular or fragile. And yet she had a great sense of humor, and she remembered in several comedies, including this film “An Old Acquaintance” (with Betty Davis) and “Smiling Lieutenant” (with Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert). Hopkins became famous for her dislike of Hollywood, and the results were bad, undeserved. <br /> <br /> In Wise Girl, she plays an heiress trying to save her dead sister's children from their guardian. son-in-law sister (Ray Milland). The film offers some funny scenes, such as Hopkins taking a bath in the pantry, Hopkins joins Milland and Guinn Williams in the Greenwich Village restaurant for $ 3 apiece to play Bohemia and Hopkins goes to the ring during one of Williams' fights . Milland is also great and very funny. <br /> <br /> Hopkins and Milland are a great pair. The film also has solid support from Williams, Walter Abel, Henry Stevenson, James Finlayson, Margaret Dumont, Grace Hale, Leonid Kinski and Ines Palange. The two girls are fine. <br /> <br /> But Hopkins, drunk on a “piece of wine” and wearing a double-bonded dress, is twice as fun as she blows on random hair while smoking .... Scream.
