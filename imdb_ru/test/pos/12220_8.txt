The problem with television today is that people have been spoiled by "light" watching television. This type of TV show is the equivalent of elevator music or "easy listening" jazz. A typical idea of ​​the audience about the "continuity" - to remember who voted for the island last week, and wonder who will be next. Show them a program like Surface, Firefly, Dr. Who or anything else with a plot of more than three episodes, and ... well, they will just return to Survivor. <br /> <br /> 95% of sheep watching television do not want to break their heads. They want excuses not to think. They want the boob pipe to match their name ... and they don’t want shows that are trying to go any other way. Because of this, Surface and many other high-quality shows, which were supposed to last much longer, got an ax. <br /> <br /> TV viewers do not want stories, or morality, or philosophy, or something more than a third Vocabulary level assessment. They want people to eat earthworms, or overly dramatize the “real-life” series (there’s no such thing! bye and then brag about it in front of their friends. <br /> <br /> Today’s television is nothing but a wasteland, and the few diamonds you can extract from the dust are just thrown away because nobody even knows what a diamond is. The surface was one of those diamonds.
