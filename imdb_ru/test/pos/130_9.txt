What makes “Fire” even more attractive to observe besides his magical mastery is his touch of feminism and rebellion. In my opinion, the character itself, played by Shabana Azmi, is a symbol of Indian female protest against Indian society. The name of the film and the scene in which Radha walks through the flames in her kitchen symbolize the course of Sita, Lord Rama’s wife, from Sita’s mythology passing through the fire to prove her impeccability, according to the same story as in the film. This film could serve as a great inspiration for women, especially in the subcontinent, to search for their freedoms and gain control over their lives.
