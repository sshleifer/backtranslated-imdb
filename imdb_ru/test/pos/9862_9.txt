After reading some of the earlier unpleasant remarks, I had to deliver my two cents. This show was NOT, despite what this jerk in Essex thinks is the worst thing that has ever been televised. I think most of today's television is much worse (when will this stupid “reality” ever end?), And there is not a single show I could watch. Give me the stuff I grew up with. I am a child of 1965, and I am not ashamed to admit it. <br /> <br /> This show has been my favorite for almost 30 years. I was in high school when he was on the air, and I think it helped me to hold on for these unfortunate days. Then I was such a loser, and "Island of Fantasy" attracted my imagination. Since I was a novice writer in those days, it gave me incredible opportunities for practicing the craft. What a wonderful premise! I will not say that he did not have his faults. Sometimes the scenarios were pretty bad, and some problems seemed trivial; but it could be good, and it was a blast to look and still. As for the dampness factor, I consider it unfair to label each product of the 70s as cheesy. Then there were a lot of great things, and it was among the first. (By the way, most of the seasons were broadcast in the 80s !!) My favorite episodes were mostly from seasons 2, 3 and 4. <br /> <br /> For those who disregard Hervé Willeschez for his heavy French accent and short stature : Grow and learn something! So easy to laugh when you're "normal" and "perfect." This man made the best of what he had to face in life, and if you do not like it, it's just hard. Have a little compassion. He died 15 years ago, and how easy it is to kill a man who cannot protect himself. Just no more shame. <br /> <br /> I like this show. So it looks outdated. I hate to talk about it, but we had no special effects or Blu-Ray discs. We are lucky to have video recorders. Live with it. Take it for what it is, and it's just fun. “Escapist TV” perfectly describes this, and this is what was for me - an escape from my rotten real life. And still very fun to watch.
