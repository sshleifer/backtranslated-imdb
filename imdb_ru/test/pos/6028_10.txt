I have to tell you the truth. The only reason I wanted to watch this movie was because of Rose McGowan. I think this part definitely worked ... actually quite well. However, the film was also very good. Some parts of this film are really good. <br /> <br /> The film also has great action. The secret is pretty hard to figure out, and Rose (McGowan) makes an Oscar-worthy acting game at the end of the film, but I don't want to give anything out. Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnov are also great in the film, like some other stars. <br /> <br /> If you like puzzles, action movies or just Rose ... I think you would like this movie.
