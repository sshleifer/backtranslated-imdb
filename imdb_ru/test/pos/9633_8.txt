In fact, this is a very good movie. This is very different from other Seagal films, which, unfortunately, may turn off some of his fans. Unlike some other films, it doesn't look like a “Seagal vehicle”. You can also see many other characters, and all of Mr. Segal’s actions are not the same as we’ve seen before. The notion that he is an “intellectual” in something other than bombs and other weapons is a good change. Although there are some unrealistic parts in the film (some more obvious than others), you can generally let them slide as the film is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> It all comes down to this: sorry for the classic Seagal action movie, but you will be disappointed. Watch it anyway for fun. If you are open to watching Seagal without action, it’s worth a look. I personally think that this is one of the best works he has done in a long time. <br /> <br />
