When I first saw this film, I could not believe my eyes. Before me was a great and well-made parody of Valentino ... to see bullfight Stan Lorel as if to see a great swordsman in action! This is a very good parody, rich in ideas, with a smart and charming Stan ... as old and kind as whiskey. (or binge after this)
