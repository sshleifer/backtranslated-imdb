This is a smart and interesting film about the backstage fight, which then chose the successor to Johnny Carson at the Tonight Show. Nevertheless, the final thesis of the film that David Letterman’s excellent comedic talents were overlooked due to his contradictory nature, and the show, diminished as a result of the enthronement of subordinate Jay Leno in the leading comedy program on television, is simply not true, because anyone who watched both Leno and Letterman perform themselves. The hard and simple truth exactly corresponds to the statement of one of the leaders of NBC in the film "Jay Leno - the funniest man in America." And David Letterman is not. Once you understand this, most of the frauds in the film will become irrelevant. Ultimately, the entire film is more than sour grapes from Letterman fans who simply cannot accept the fact that the best comic was chosen by people whose business is to know such things. The final proof is that, despite the early leadership of Letterman, perhaps because of the rush that arose in the battle for continuity in the Tonight Show, Leno’s show was invariably more popular, thus, in my opinion, at least to refute Letterman’s allegations how he unjustly robbed him of his legitimate inheritance.
