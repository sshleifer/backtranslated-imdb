I just watched the DVD of this award-winning film. One Life Stand is a bright drama that, thanks to its pace, black and white shots and atmospheric music, creates a very convincing and honest picture. This is a story about strength, sex, and control of a life dilemma, underlined by several sad, lonely lives. Mother (very well acting Maureen Carr) is agitated and drawn into herself. The father appears only aside, and yet is a powerful and key part of the drama. Money is hidden in boxes and shoes. <br /> <br /> The inscription was excellent, and I liked the sensual close-up shots, such as nails, red lips, a candle, mirrors, etc. The way the camera was made very intimate. This is a heart-rending story with sexy undertones, while the drizzle of Glasgow on dark streets intensifies the despair of sad characters. <br /> <br /> There are some unforgettable pictures, transmitted simply by walking or leaning. - for example, Triza, which goes under the bridge. And Trezy’s stunned and offended facial expression in a call center who hopes to help people with Tarot cards when she listens to the caller’s conversation about her own violence. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, we see John Paul, wide-eyed and innocent, taking photos of how he wants to try modeling. Tris, his mother, is mistaken and makes the wrong choice, pushing him away while she tries to keep him. John Paul's modeling turns into a maintenance job, and Tris's boss offers her money, and in the end they go on a date. There are also moments of humor and subtle irony. One great scene is when they eat fairly normal and start to open up a bit when a father appears with his dark presence and clouds everything around him. But this and other things give moments of hope. <br /> <br /> I felt that from time to time the course of the film was too intense, but this is a small detail of another wise and memorable film, and something else is a little different. This is very different from most American films, which are either a complete fantasy or a real “world”, visible through spoiled glasses. This film depicts life with all its rough edges and displays unforgettable images. <br /> <br /> This is not “light entertainment”, but a drama that makes you think, and real life. <br /> <br /> One Life Stand is a truly exciting and emotionally honest movie.
