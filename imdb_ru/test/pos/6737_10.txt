I love this film. All the actors were amazing in depicting their various characters. Judith Ivy portrayed her weak, scared, dependent, passively aggressive towards her mournful and selfless nature so well that it was a relief to see the character's metamorphosis. Blythe Danner was equally attractive in her role as a somewhat condemning Jewish mother, devoted wife and loving sister. Jonathon Silmerman, Bob Daishey, Stacy Glick and Lisa Walz coped with their roles equally well. <br /> <br /> If you like movies in which you experience difficulties without losing your sense of humor and hope, you will like it. movie.
