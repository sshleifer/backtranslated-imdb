This is really a dark movie. Noir really. The title character is smallpox, unknowingly delivered to New York by Evelyn Case. <br /> <br /> She performs one mission when arriving, and more rude after talking to her innocent sister. But she herself is not an intentionally murderer. This does not mean that it does not kill. This does not mean that its presence among some eight million other people does not dismay the city. <br /> <br /> Keese - great. The supporting cast is also very good. This involves several obscure people, including the director. Do not postpone. This is a movie to be reckoned with! (And it's nice to see a picture of Colombia. Great comedies and noirs came out in Colombia and the Republic; but we will never see them again.)
