Chop Shop is a hidden treasure in movie theaters! I can't begin to describe how beautiful the performances in this film are. This film is for those who want to see a powerful story and see an example of how modern films should look and look. <br /> <br /> This film is about a young boy, Alejandro "El", who works and lives with his teenage sister Isamar "Izzy" in a tiny attic in the same room in an auto shop. The story unfolds in that part of New York (of which I did not even suspect - Willits glasses), where there are endless dumps and workshops. Here Bakhrani tells the story of two forgotten children who hope to support themselves by buying and repairing a van with food. <br /> <br /> Ale earns money by helping them at an auto shop, and Izzy helps them in a van with food; both, however, earn extra money on the side. El sells bootleg movies and stolen auto parts; Izzy leads to selling herself. Their lives are surrounded by sand and gloom, but although both witnesses live and barely survive in their harsh world, their love for each other is never tainted by the dirt that surrounds them. And sometimes they can laugh and enjoy the moments of their childhood, which is stolen by the reality of the struggle for survival and living together. <br /> <br /> The best comparison I have in regards to the Chop Shop is that Bahrani’s comparison with innocent love between family members versus such a gloomy atmosphere is as strong as Roma Pasolini’s mother combined with the struggle to get too fast to grow up. unfavorable circumstances, as in "Mussette Bresson." <br /> <br /> Having co-authored the director and edited this film and his first “Human Cart” (which won awards all over the world), Bakhrani is the creator of the full package. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that his films will not be hidden treasures for long!
