What can I say about the show called NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm ... Just that it was one of the best TV shows ever !! You have actors of all ages, actors who are somewhat known and forgotten at that time. Everyone plays their part to perfect perfection! There is always some kind of moral story on these shows, which in most cases (if not always) is very true! You may feel that a person whose voice is duplicated above the captions at the beginning and at the end, believes in what he says from the heart! Not only do these shows have great storylines, they also throw you at them, make your brain beat faster, and your blood is pumped. The original outer limits were black and white in the 60s on the right. These shows made a triumphant return, the likes of which I have never seen! It was interesting to watch the new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker, but the new OUTER LIMITS is what you need! If you have not seen: I beg you to check out these episodes, and you will understand exactly what I mean! LONG LIFE WITH NEW OUTSIDE LIMITS !!!!!!!!!!!!
