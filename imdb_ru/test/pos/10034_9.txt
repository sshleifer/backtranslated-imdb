It is true that "They died in their boots" gives a very fictional story about the life and career of George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn), but remarkable, especially with regard to the Battle for the Little Big Horn. Because it is not considered that in the 1941 film they try to portray both the American-American cavalryman and the leader of the Native Americans, the leader of the Mad Horses (Anthony Quinn) in a favorable light. I am almost tempted to say that “Little Big Man”, in its unqualified position against Custer, looks unbalanced compared to him. Further you should not be misled by the name of the picture ?? it is not just a film about the battle for Little Big Horn, it is a film about the unreliable cadet of West Point, the glorified hero of the Civil War, the Indian fighter and, last but not least, her husband. /> <br /> The film begins at the time of Custer at West Point Military Academy, where his disobedience and disobedient behavior lead to frequent shortcomings. During punitive military exercises, he meets his future wife, Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who, like Custer himself, is a native of Monroe, Michigan. Custer intends to care for her, but the outbreak of civil war causes him. The legendary courage of Custer is shown in a sequence of battle scenes, the largest of which is dedicated to his battle with the legendary southern cavalry general Jeb Stewart during the Battle of Gettysburg. While on vacation, he goes to Monroe and cares for Elizabeth, who promises him his hand in marriage. Immediately after the war, Custer and Elizabeth Bacon got married. <br /> <br /> After the end of the civil war, Custer was demoted, he did not get real command and was forced to undergo a painstakingly slow process of promotion. small professional american army. When he starts drinking, his wife intervenes on his behalf with former General-General Winfield Scott. Custer takes command of the 7th US Cavalry, which he trains to become an elite unit. Neither Custer nor Crazy Horse are willing to fight, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railway through the lands of India in clear violation of previous contracts. Custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of the Mad Horse case, but enters the battle to fulfill his duty as a soldier, exposing the conspiracy of monetary interests in a letter he writes on the eve of the battle. <br /> <br /> “They“ died in their boots ”,“ although it lacks historical accuracy, it is as good as war films and westerns in the 1940s: Caster and Mad Horse ” the main actors are playing, neither the Indians nor the Southern Confederation are denigrating, and the courtship scenes with beautiful Livvie de Havilland are simply charming. The only negative, and that is why I can not give this picture a whole 10 points, this is a hidden manifestation of racism in the image of African-American servants; Servant Elizabeth Callie is a stereotypical, heavy, good-natured, superstitious black mommy. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting that the film does not find fault with either Caster or the Mad Horse, but with the greed of the railway. Companies force Washington politicians to violate the guarantees they gave to Native Americans using semi-criminal methods. Just a couple of years later, the insinuation that American businessmen could even think about doing something in doubt would probably be taken as a hint that the filmmakers were sympathetic to the communists. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, “they“ died in their boots ”misses the fact that Custer’s overly aggressive tactics often border on recklessness, greatly exaggerating the importance of his interaction with Stewart and does not mention the lack of intelligence before the battle on Small Big Horn. However, contemporaries saw the war hero in Custer, and he had several impressive feats that could be pointed out in the Battle of the Brandy Station, Gettysburg, Trevillian and others, although his exploits were not so decisive for civil war, as "they" died in their boots, "suggests. <br /> <br /> In any case, “They died in their shoes” is a well-made military film with Western elements, three outstanding performers (Flynn, Quinn and de Havilland). ), and offers a positive outlook on Native Americans, as well as a negative outlook on big money, which will not be seen in major Hollywood productions for decades. It would be worthy of 10, if not for the racist mini-shooting of African Americans.
