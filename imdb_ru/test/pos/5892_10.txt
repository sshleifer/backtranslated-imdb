The best years of our life is a film that has been hiding on my radar for years - I heard about it, but I never had the opportunity to watch it. Thanks to TCM On Demand, I was able to watch it completely and for free. <br /> <br /> What surprised me in this film is how quickly it was shot after the war. The film frankly tells about people who were injured in the war, both physically and morally. He manages to accurately cover almost all variants of military experience in the three characters. <br /> <br /> We have an Air Force officer who was a veteran of the early European bombing campaign. Because of the terrifying depletion rate among the crews of the bombers, the Air Force at that time had a reputation as expelling officers who quickly rose through the ranks. So it was with this guy who went from simple soda in civilian life to his B-17 captain and scorer. He also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, which at the time was called "fighting fatigue." <br /> <br /> We have a non-profit army that served in the Pacific and suffered from the horrors of this campaign. His story is the opposite of the story of a guy from the Air Force in that he moves from the prestigious work of a banker to a modest grumble in the army and rises to the rank of sergeant. The stripes on the sleeve show that he is the highest level of sergeant, but he is still on the front line. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have a naval sailor who is part of a faceless attendant staff commonly referred to as REMFs (MFers in the back echelon) fellows on the line. Ironically, he gets the worst physical wounds, working as a mechanic under the decks on a Navy ship, his ship is hit, supposedly by a kamikaze and sank with the death of 400 people. He was pulled out of the water, but his heavily burned hands were amputated and replaced with prostheses. <br /> <br /> BYOOL talks about how these three meet on a transport plane that they boarded the house, and how they adapt to civil society. <br /> <br /> What struck me most in this film is that, despite the obvious problems faced by the three main characters, he never sinks into a melodrama. A guy from the Navy, played by a real amputee, gets into a situation where we can feel sorry for him, but the script never lets us feel this emotion. An army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and history points to this, but he never stops at this. The captain of the Air Force is struggling with the loss of status, when he is forced to return to the pharmacy, in which he pulled a soda (now bought by a large chain), and get a humiliating job to support his ungrateful and disloyal wife. <br /> <br /> The script provides many opportunities for all these characters to reach a dramatic apogee regarding their disasters, but he carefully avoids this. But due to excessively dramatic results, the director tries to use the obvious. <br /> <br /> In one of the scenes, which reflects the entire film well, the daughter of an army sergeant (Frederick March) leads a discussion with her. father and mother regarding the captain of the Air Force. Despite his marriage, they fell in love, and she is determined to dissolve the marriage, which is clearly problematic. Now we have seen thousands of scenes typical of this, when the father rages angrily, and the daughter, in tears, runs off to her room, slam the door and falls on the bed. Later, a mother appears, comforts her daughter and offers words of motherly wisdom, and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> In BYOOL, this scene is played in a completely different way than the cliche I described above. Of course, the conversation is heated, but all parties are reasonable, and there is a serious and timeless discussion of the nature of relationships, which has some of the best dialogues I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, BYOOL is a very satisfactory film, with honest action from the entire cast. Technically, this is a good frame, a frame of editing and cinematography, but it never overshadows the exciting story. Despite the points that are clich√© and overly dramatic, I give this film the highest rating it clearly deserves
