I would like to see the connection between NightBreed, The Fury and the X-Men series, sort of like the second Outer Limit series will link specific stories and storylines after the fact to create Doug's story, although no one was meant. I would also like to know if there is any additional information - anecdotal or otherwise, anywhere about the relationship and / or collaboration between Clive Barker and David Cronenberg. I just can't figure out that David Cronenberg appeared as an actor in the movie Clive Barker. Is there any additional information on this? Finally, 17 years have passed since the film was released, and I was hoping that by that time there would be a sequel. Does anyone there know whether there were any plans in the development process that were never implemented, or are there plans to continue?
