The director and co-author of the article, Alejandro Amenabar, did not make life easier for the audience for his strained, slightly long, but very disturbing story, precisely based on the Spanish man’s struggle for suicide with help. Mar Adentro (The Sea Within) captures, and its influence far exceeds the time spent in the theater. <br /> <br /> With the award-winning Canadian film “The Invasions of the Barbarians,” people got to see the family with a group of loyal friends in order to decide the desire of a loved, though quick-tempered person, to end their lives. In this film, the spotlight suffered from progressive, incurable cancer, and its descent to the terminal stage was quick. Emotional scenes were there, death was inevitable - the question was how soft it could be made with the help of the requested intervention. <br /> <br /> Ramón Sampedro (brilliantly played by Javier Bardem) is a different story. For more than two decades he has suffered from paralysis due to an immersion accident. (Very astute viewers may find terrible irony about why he ended up in such a state because of his careless immersion.) Once a traveler around the world and a lover of beautiful women, he now lies trapped in a fixed body, his every need is satisfied - to the real faithful family, who willingly give most of their personal life and time to maintain their favorite relationships. <br /> <br /> Rosa (Lola Duenas), a single mom of two little boys, enters Sampedro’s family from what could be a simple curiosity to learn about the plight of a paralyzed man, but it becomes both emotional support for Ramona, and also a funny, but sometimes aggravating presence. Good performance Duenas. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem is that Sampedro is not ill in the usual sense of the word. He may well live for several decades with proper care. Thus, his gently but persistently expressed desire to end his life with “dignity” creates a moral dilemma for friends and relatives, who, unsurprisingly, react from different ethical and religious points of view. <br /> <br /> Ramon is a poster of the Quartet group dedicated to changing Spain’s laws regarding suicide with help. “Death with dignity” is their slogan. Gene (Clara Segura) is a sensitive activist who enlists the help of community lawyer Julia (Belen Rueda). Julia has her own health problems, which have an uncertain but catastrophic prognosis. Happily married to a faithful wife, she is emotionally connected with her client. <br /> <br /> The following is a highly sensitive interaction of values ​​and emotions. Ramon lives with his brother and wife, their technophilic teenage son, not the intellectual Ramon, and his elderly father, who cannot stop grieving due to the catastrophic descent of his son into absolute helplessness. <br /> <br /> Moral and legal issues are played out through superb acting and short vignettes, including a scene in a courtroom in which formalism defeats any judicial interpretation that can take Ramón’s feelings and views into account. This may be Spain, but problems exist in most countries, including the United States. <br /> <br /> It is especially funny to shout, from the first floor to the bedroom, the debate between Ramon and the invited Jesuit priest, also four-footed, but one whose hidden dogma casually disguises the absence of soul. <br /> <br /> Special thanks to Mabel Rivera, daughter-in-law of Ramón, Manuele, for the painfully authentic image of a strong woman who holds the family together. And the same compliment from the heart extends to Belen Rueda, Julia, who is moving from an objective attorney to a close friend to a woman who is going to meet a dark fate. <br /> <br /> The director does not make value judgments that allow each character to express the full range of his or her feelings effectively, and sometimes touchingly. Like The Walking Dead, this film can support any idea of ​​its deadly subject. <br /> <br /> No one can prevent a person from committing suicide if he / she is set up, but the world tragedy of the Ramons of the world is that without help life in a body in which only the heart beats and only the head can move, a sentence that no court can pass against the most depraved criminals. <br /> <br /> Cinematography goes well with the plot and the beautiful Galician scenes represent a deliberate contrast with the limited views that once roamed the planet Ramon from his special bed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
