Sir played Lyra more than 200 times, but tonight he cannot remember his first lines. Sitting in the mirror, his eyes reflect the king’s madness. His dresser gently prompts him, pronouncing the words. In both of these people, there is an atmosphere of despair. The great actor, knowing that his powers are going away, his valet and his conscience, the surrogate wife - realizes that his boss has gone insane and knowing that he is powerless to do more than ease his passing. A “chest of drawers” ​​is truly a love story between them. Over the years, they become interdependent on each other to the extent that no one can imagine a future without the other. Set during the Second World War, this concerns the fate of a frankly second-rate Shakespeare company, consisting of an equal number of former and imitators, headed by "Sir", the theatrical knight of what can kindly be called the "Old School". Whatever role he plays, he captures the central stage and fusses over the spotlights, intimidating the audience with applause. But somewhere inside him, sinking most of the time deep under the ham that he regularly serves, he still remains the random brilliance of his early greatness. It is a glimpse to see what his viewers fervently hope for. Mr. A. Finney very cleverly concentrates on the ham, often before the caricature, and as soon as you are ready to reject his performance as a mere hyperbole and riot, he will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that will make you realize that a great actor plays a great actor. The same applies to Mr. T. Courtney. It is easy to write off his image of Norman as an exercise in stereotyping. We have a middle-aged woman, not a camp theater chest, wading through life. Enjoying the company "Girls" and the love of evil insiders, spreading in the "Theater". There have been, and I strongly suspect that many men are exactly the same as Norman in Profession. Infinitely kind and patient, knowing more about the play than many of the actors, they run backstage with wisdom and love. I believe that the vast majority of them will scream with approving laughter at Mr. Courtney’s portrait. I saw “The Locker” in the London scene, where, despite the wisdom comprehended, Mr. Courtney’s “Norman” was much more depressed than in the film. “Sir” was played by the great Mr. Freddie Jones, which caused a huge response from the audience. It was a memorable performance that eclipsed Mr. Courtney, turning him into a “running” rather than an actor in billing. The idea that “Sir” and “Norman” may be almost incomplete without each other, got out of control. window. “Norman” turned into his puppet, and I'm not sure that exactly what Ronald Harwood planned, but was created for a breathtaking theater. Lord Finney and Courtney correct the balance in the film, restoring equality in the relationship. Both men have come a long way since their appearance in the British paintings of the New Wave, when they became the favorites of the dimly left, “middle class and shame on him” movement. When British cinema actually performed Harikiri in the 1970s, they quietly focused on the theater, with the exception of a few roles, to keep the wolf from the door. With the resurgence of more meaningful films, they reappeared, blinking in an unusual bright light. <br /> <br /> “The chest of drawers” ​​marked their return, still boiling with energy and talent, shouting to the whole world: “We are still here.” This is not a big film, but undoubtedly an excellent one.
