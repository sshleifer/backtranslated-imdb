This film is basically a very well-made film and gives a good idea of ​​the military situation and its impact on those who participate in it. It is always interesting to see the story from the other side for a change. This film tells about a group of German soldiers who are sent to Stalingrad, Russia after the war in North Africa, where one of the most notorious and bloody battles of World War II is fought. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see the other side of this battle, since we basically just always see the Germans simply as "villains." In this film, these "villains" are given a humane face and voice, and this somehow makes you realize that the only true enemy in a war is war itself, and not necessarily those with whom you fight. At first it's hard to focus on the film, because deep down you always think that the Germans are evil villains. But, of course, you quickly get used to it, and soon you adapt the Germans as the main characters of the film, and you even start to take care of them and be interested in them. <br /> <br /> The way this story is told, however the best. Sometimes it is difficult to track the history, as it moves from one sequence and location to another. The film is not always logical in telling stories and contains too many episodes that remain too vague. In addition, most of the time it is quite difficult to separate the characters and see who is who. This does not always make this film easy to watch, but, on the other hand, there are many episodes and moments in this film to make it useful and interesting, but not the most consistent. In this respect, Hollywood films are always better than European ones. <br /> <br /> Production figures are high and include some good looking scenery and places, although the film was not even made in Russia itself. It helps to create a good wartime setting. <br /> <br /> The character is mostly interesting, although perhaps a bit formal. But I don’t know, for some reason, formal characters always work well in war films and heighten drama and realism. It also helps that they are played by well-played actors. All the actors are not the most famous actors around (Thomas Kretschmann was still a rather unknown actor at the time), but each of them is well suited for his role and gives his characters a unique face and personality. <br /> <br /> Overall, not the best or most consistent drama of the Second World War around, but definitely worth seeing because of its original approach of the German side of the Battle of Stalingrad and its good performance. <br /> <br /> 7/10
