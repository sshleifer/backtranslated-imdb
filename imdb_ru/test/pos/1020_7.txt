High school student Kathleen Beller is found beaten and raped in the first scenes of this film for television. Then the film <br /> <br /> is remembered a few days before the rape, because Beller is <br /> <br /> harassed by a stranger. <br /> <br /> Bellaire and Scott Colombi and her best friend Robin Matson and <br /> <br /> Dennis Quaid meet doubly. Beller's excited parents, <br /> <br /> abandoned Tony Bill and shrill Blythe Dunner, waited at home, wringing their hands <br /> <br /> and so on. Immediately, the 1970s make it a dated entry <br /> <br /> when young couples discuss romance and love in <br /> <br /> Three Days of the Condor. <br /> <br /> Beller, an amateur photographer, begins to receive threatening notes <br /> <br /> hidden in her locker at school. The filmmakers wisely give us a lot of suspects: Beller's new boyfriend, Beller's boyfriend, Beller's father, Beller's former boyfriend and that <br /> <br /> is an overly friendly teacher who wants Beller to was a bit more sexy in her self portraits? I knew who the abuser was <br /> <br /> because the video box of Worldvision Video had an <br /> <br /> attack on the back cover, destroying any obscurity in this <br /> Respect . <br /> <br /> Without revealing who the attacker is, Bellaire begins to receive exhausting phone calls and is eventually raped. Then the film <br /> <br /> heads south, acting like Nancy Drew, and secretly sets <br /> <br /> a slow-motion camera to catch the guy chasing the other student. <br /> <br /> Finally, the filmmakers resort to an unexpected narrative from Beller about misunderstanding for the victims of rape that day <br/> <br /> day and age. <br /> <br /> Surprise is very real here, without going into details <br /> <br /> of scary movies. Bellaire is very good, and watch her and Matson's scene in an abandoned theater - and they both do an excellent job. <br /> <br /> There are many familiar faces in the film, including Ellen Travolta in a small role, <br /> <br /> and all the professionals. <br /> <br /> This was done in 1978. and it shows. I’m sure that no one had any <br /> <br /> idea that this issue would be considered in 2001 by a horror movie lover - <br /> <br /> who needs to go to bed early and Get up early <br /> morning, but some relationships here are confusing. <br /> <br /> The teacher who tells Beller to be sexy never forces her to explain exactly what he meant. Now, if any high school teacher would say this <br /> <br />, then this would be done for a television film on its own. <br /> <br /> After Beller’s rape, the rapist still remains part of her life, as orders are issued <br /> <br />, blah, blah, blah. Perhaps this is not the case, because <br /> <br /> Beller is not a virgin and cannot prove that she was raped, <br /> <br /> she said. Many of these problems were solved with the help of modern technologies <br /> <br />, but this film obviously knew that he would have a chance to contribute to the reform debate. Rape is <br /> <br /> an act of violence that has not disappeared, but today attempts are being made to catch <br /> <br /> attackers many miles ahead twenty-four years ago. The problem <br /> <br /> is that the angle of rape is felt as a background <br /> <br />. Before that, we have a little hard brace that has a truly honest characterization for God. After rape, everything changes <br /> <br />, in a cinematic way, and not for the better. <br /> <br /> I remember Bellera from the 70s and 80s (and who could forget <br /> <br /> her revealing role in Betsy), but she didn’t do anything in the last ten years old. It's a shame, because then she was very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would recommend "Are you alone in the house ?!" based on <br /> <br /> acting alone, with a reluctant nod of at least the first two thirds of the movie <br /> <br />. If you want to live through the 1970s, created for school television life, <br /> <br /> this is your Taba cup. <br /> <br /> This is unrated but contains physical abuse, some sexual abuse <br /> <br /> and some adult situations.
