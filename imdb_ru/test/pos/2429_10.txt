Probably, it was the viewing of this television film that aroused my interest in the discussion about whether “Anna” was really the daughter of Tsar Nicholas Anastasia. Since I saw him, I've watched various documentaries, and also bought a book. Despite the evidence that has been discovered since the release of the film, I sometimes still think it was. Such is the strength of Amy Irving's action in this two-way film, which is somewhat liberal with historical facts, but crammed to the brim with the devilish drama and Irving's absolutely convincing performance. <br /> <br /> I was not consciously aware of Irving before, although I must have seen her without realizing it in Carrie (another favorite movie). In “Anazasia” I did not for a second feel that “this is just a film”. For me, this woman was Anastasia, and when the first part ended with her in a railway carriage, where members of the royal family met, I knew that the devil or high water, I had to see the second part. I just wanted to see how she would prove that she was who she called herself, and as the story progressed, I felt a strong hatred for Rex Harrison's character, although I admire him very much as an actor. <br /> <br /> When I saw the film again in the television directory, I convinced my mother that we should watch it, and after that she thanked me for it, showing almost the same desire as watching the second part . Then I bought the video and can fully recommend it. “Anastasia” is one of those rare television films that you just have to watch in order to enjoy watching the best acting game I've ever seen on TV, and it doesn’t matter whether you believe in the legend or not.
