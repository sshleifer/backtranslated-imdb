"Until Dawn" in 1981 - one of the best horror stories of wildlife. This is one of the best quality slashers of the 80s, and it easily blows up films like “The Last Terror”, “Don't Go Into The Forest” or “Sacrifice Out Of The Water”. <br /> <br /> A group of young people come to check out the mountain property that one of the group has just bought. However, they are not alone in the wild. The hulking inbred killer, who seems to be in two places at the same time, is hiding and obviously hates violators. <br /> <br /> Director Lieberman, who gave us such wonderful films “C” as “Squirm” (1976) and “Blue Sun” (1977), perfectly copes with this clever thriller. The film is very atmospheric, with a creeping feeling of tension and strong emotion. This film makes even open wilderness seem frighteningly claustrophobic. Oregon locations are beautiful and well captured by tricky cinema. The musical accompaniment is a real original and contrasts amazingly with the stage visual effects. <br /> <br /> Deborah Benson does an excellent job with her task, her presence was charming. Gregg Henry copes with the role of Benson's lover, and Chris Lemon gives a little charisma. The cast, especially veteran actor Kennedy, also does a good job. <br /> <br /> A real gem of the slasher genre that does not need blood for thrill. Definitely worth looking for fans of slasher and horror lovers. Take a look! <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
