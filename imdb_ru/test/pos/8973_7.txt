Well, we definitely saw, and I and many other people expected the worst. There were good sides to him, so I did not expect him to fail in other areas. <br /> <br /> First, the game was above average. I love Philip Seymour Hoffman in this film, and I liked Tom Hanks. Hoffman was the glue to this film. If not for him, this film would have collapsed and would have reached the bottom. His performance was by no means overwhelming, but absolutely necessary. He gave a good witty, cynical presentation in which most other actors could easily turn his character into a cliché. Tom Hanks did quite well and did not disappoint, but of course he was not impressed. What I could not endure was that Julia Roberts was involved in this film. She was as big a mistake as I ever saw. On the one hand, she is a bad actress, at least for me, she was young for her character and was deceptive even for the character she played. <br /> <br /> The direction was average for me. I'm not a very big fan of Mike Nichols' latest films, and this film didn’t impress me either. It was done with such a Hollywood, cartoonish sensory hat, which I hated. Worst of all, in the end, he tried to make it a really significant film. I love informative films, but not when the film tries to throw itself into one or two scenes at the end and show something that tries to justify the rest of the garbage scattered throughout the film. This is what Mike Nichols seems to have done a lot on his recent track record. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive parts of this film was writing. The dialogue was very well composed and allowed to develop the story. The letter was what really could raise this film to a level above average. In many scenes, I kind of laughed at the writing. <br /> <br /> Well, that's what we saw at least. Many landscapes were good in the film, if you understand what I mean, but not much more than that. I liked that this film does not glorify everything that America has done. Obviously, during the entire war in Afghanistan, the United States gave weapons to people who are now against us. In this film, we are too guilty. This shows that what may seem good in the short term may turn into something terribly wrong in the future. This film had a good original message, but it did not give it correctly. Overall, although it was interesting.
