Kramer vs. Kramer is the story of the breakup of marriage and its consequences. They can be destructive for partners and, especially, for a minor child, which in this case is played by Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about Kramer vs. Kramer is his strong point as a film. This is the way Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep's parents present themselves to viewers as whole people with many sides of their nature. Although the film is tilted in the direction of Hoffman and more about his relationship with his son, he is not represented as any kind of saint, nor is the Strip an absolutely black villain. Hoffman is a career-oriented person in an advertising game. He largely ignored the dreams and aspirations of his wife, but for him it was a big shock when Streep said that there is no more love and she wants to leave. She also wants to be a mother, at least for a while. <br /> <br /> Hoffman and Henry are doing everything they can. The pressure of being both parents forces Hoffman to lose his job, and he has to take less-paid jobs in another agency. At this point, more than a year later, Streep decides that he wants custody. <br /> <br /> Both parents give weighty witnesses and beautifully present their arguments, but in such situations the connection is always broken in favor of the mother. <br /> Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won their first of two Oscars, respectively, for this film, she is in the category “Secondary Actress”. I'm not sure how these things are solved; Streep gets less screen time than Hoffman, if that’s the deciding factor. The film focuses on Hoffman’s relationship with his son and his evolving understanding that he carries his share of the blame for the failure of the marriage. As for Meryl, this is Hob's choice for her, as for many women, to balance career and motherhood. The conflict in her psyche is recorded for all to see. <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman may have won this Oscar partly for the same reason that Spencer Tracy picked it up first by fulfilling an impossible task not to give the scene of theft of a child stealing a movie. Children with their lack of restraints are natural actors, and Henry is great because he came as a real child, not a Hollywood child. I wonder if Hoffman saw “Captains courageous” and saw how Spencer Tracy communicated with Freddy Bartholomew? Dustin could have done a lot worse than the Spencer Tracy channel in his talk. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs. Kramer also won an Oscar for best picture, best director Robert Benton and best adapted script. This is an intelligent and convincing drama that adults burst out of love and try to cope with it as best as possible for themselves and their child. Do not miss if ever broadcast.
