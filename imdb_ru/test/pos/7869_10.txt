Seduced is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films, a departure from his typical early roles. Director Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood collaborated in several films, was made a year before Eastwood’s directorial debut with Play Misty For Me. An alternative title for the film was “To cheat on the old plantation pussy”, which, fortunately, was not used, otherwise I’m sure that joking jokes about the fact that this happens in a school for girls will be difficult to avoid. I first saw this film in one of my cinematography classes at a college in the mid-1970s, and I was immediately taken along. I only had an old battered VHS cassette until I recently bought a widescreen DVD, which also includes a funny, terrible trailer that makes the movie look like a Peyton Place soap opera and doesn't convey any eerie film. . <br /> <br /> Interesting Notes: Eastwood and Siegel had to fight Universal Pictures to keep the original final, and they won; and, the film was declared as standard Westwood Eastwood, which is certainly not the case. This is a gothic story about deception and horror that developed during the civil war, with a characteristic tone of eroticism and sexual tension. <br /> <br /> I don’t put any spoilers on this review, and if you want to watch the movie as it should be, then be careful with searching it on the Internet, as there are plenty of spoiler reviews. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood portrays John McBurney, a Union soldier who was shot dead in Confederation land and discovered by a young girl from a nearby school for girls. She saves him and takes him back to school, but instead of notifying the local patrol of his presence, that he should go to jail, the director, Miss Martha (Geraldine Page), her assistant Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), their black Servant Holly ( May Mercer), and mostly teenage girls take him, heal him and fall under his spell. The film sets the tone for eerie and gothic horror right from the titles, as it shows real scenes of the battle from the war, while Eastwood's voice quietly sings the funeral song of that time. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of his meeting with a little girl who saves him sets the tone of his character and the tone of the entire film. To say more than that would spoil the surprises in this first scene. Saying much more about the movie itself can ruin it for anyone who has not seen it ... if you are passionate about gothic tales, find it and rent it. Eastwood is great in the film, and it's interesting to see him in an early role or in any role where he portrays a character who for the most part is not very cute. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page had a role in the film as a director, and I cannot imagine another actress of that time, as good in the role; A long shot might be Piper Laurie, but I do not think that Laurie could embody the role in the same way as Geraldine Page. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Hartman (whose wonderful performance in the movie Patch Blue is like a blind girl who falls in love with the character Sidney Puiter is another stellar achievement in her short career), in her prime here, delicate and a workshop at the same time. Unfortunately, her delicacy in cinema was also part of her real life, she committed suicide at the age of 45. <br /> <br /> I finish this review with this observation: one manipulative, deceitful Yankee man is not can be compared with a group of deceptive and libidinal southern asavits.
