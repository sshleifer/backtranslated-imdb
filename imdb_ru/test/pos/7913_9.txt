I honestly can not believe that this film does not have a higher score. Claude Chabrol can be described as something like the French Alfred Hitchcock, and although this film is only his second film that I saw (the first one is “Le Bush”), I already see that this guy is something special only on the Power of these two movies. The film is a French and Canadian co-production, and takes place in Canada. The cast is made up of British and Canadian stars, and the high quality of performance foreshadows the rest of the film; most of which are also high quality. The film is a murder mystery and begins when a young girl covered in blood enters the police station. After questioning Inspector Carella, it turned out that a young girl Patricia and her sister Muriel had been attacked by a man who had killed her sister and had just allowed Patricia to escape. However, as the investigation continues, Patricia returns to the station to provide new evidence that reveals the killer’s much more shocking identity. <br /> <br /> This movie has great performances. Donald Sutherland is subdued as usual, but he is very well suited for the role he has given here, and I would not hesitate to call his performance in “Relatives” one of his best. The film also features auxiliary twists from British stars Donald Plesans and David Hemmings, which both make good turns; The pleasure, in particular, who shows what a great actor he can be, and emphasizes the shame that he was wasting himself in Halloween movies. The unknown Oud Landry also plays the part of Patricia well. The film is very mysterious in the first hour and really keeps the audience confused. When Inspector Carella discovers the diary of Muriel, the film turns into a drama, which shows the latest actions of the girl; and although this section of the film is not as good as the one that came before it, it is still interesting and gives a big twist at the end! In general, Blood Relatives is a great movie that truly deserves to be seen better. Le Boucher is a more famous attempt at Chabrol, but for my money it is at least as good! Watching is highly recommended.
