My favorite show of all time! Yes, I thought it was so great, and Larisa Oleinik was my first love (AAAAWWWWWW). It was well written, funny - except when it wanted to be serious, and just a great show in general. But since we couldn’t afford to leave Nick, I couldn’t see any episodes after February 1996, and maybe it makes me think about the show more than I should. For me, this is more of an epidemic (now it looks wrong!) Having to say goodbye to someone you love and KNOW that you will never see them again. And I still think, because, as far as I know, in the near future there are no plans to release it on DVD ... yes, life means! I figured it out for sure (although you may find a strange episode each here or there ... but I also never liked bootleg copies of things). <br /> <br /> Enough of my sad life: (.... Most of the children in the 7th grade do not need such abilities as Alex to get them through life (it’s unreal - for sure), but again, How many cities have super-evil chemical plants who are willing to do something for “Progress at ANY price?” Gee, this show was fun to watch! Although I would agree that putting up a little overgrown (and even a bit politically correct). My favorite roles were when the children had some reason to hack the factory (video tape or something like that) like a child Tom Clancy's version of the Rainbow Six (which I got hooked on this series of games over the years, probably for the same reason) is almost! Then you have a factory "safety" team that is desperately trying to find a "child from an accident" ... very mean guys (at least when I first watched the show ... they seem to be more sympathetic to me now.) I am very sad for Larisa Oleinik, I'm not sure that she is not against this role that she puts on, but I will always remember her. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, an actor who plays Aaron Pierce from “24,” and here as a school coach or something like that ... too cool! Perhaps he can get the producers of this show to get Larisa next season "24". I just bring it up because Jack Bower is my other television hero, and I just wanted to see cross things, laughs :). Both are in California, so I just keep dreaming ... and now I see it: "Leave me alone with this suspect for a few minutes ... no, I do not need a car battery!"
