Somewhat typical moment of filmmaking of this era. Obviously, it was first conceived in the world for the stage, but, nevertheless, a very good film from start to finish. Peter O'Toole and Suzanne York perform a stage performance for a silver screen, and both do it efficiently. There are very few ways to tell a story, and anyone who is not familiar with this type of learning about non-standard characters can be a little out of the way. In general, a good movie in which Peter O'Toole and Suzanne York replay.
