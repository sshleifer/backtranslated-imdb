Vittorio Mezzogiorno and the masterful Jean-Hugh Anglada's excellent performance embellish this strange story of lust, desires and alienation in France. The work of the two main performers is striking - subtle, intense and passionate. Alas, the script is intentionally stupid and dirty, and the overall effect leaves a dull spirit. Nevertheless, those who can appreciate the high quality of acting skills will be able to enjoy the bold work of the main characters in this often complex film about Gallic life with a low standard of living. <br /> <br />
