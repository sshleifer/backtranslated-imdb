“Don't torture the duckling” is an absolutely amazing entertainment for Lucio Fulci. Unlike other sub-genre heavyweights, such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento, Fulci adheres to a decidedly rigid, reasonable and socially receptive approach to the narration in this film. There is nothing charming about child murder and border pedophilia (the intrepid plot of 1972), and Fulci wisely shoots with a balanced and somber eye, avoiding flares, melodrama and the director's histrionic. Processes accentuated by bloody and instantly burning scenes, which are further enhanced by a sharp sense of realism of Fulci ?? in particular, the deeply disturbing scene of the "killing of the witches" with its bald cruelty is reminiscent of a snuff film. Composer Reese Ortolani plays these scenes, filled with bloodshed, with fierce reverberant string explosions. <br /> <br /> The film is limited at the same time by a lyrical and cruel conclusion, in which theology, morality, fanaticism and superstition collide. This is a very effective final, able to leave the viewer in a bewildered and disarmed stupor. <br /> <br /> Fulci could not choose the best place for this film. Do not attempt to duck, which was photographed in the ancient city of Matera, Italy. As Matera continues to modernize to this day (as evidenced by the transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial one), she struggles with her reputation, sponsored by UNESCO, as the seat of mysterious Paleolithic ghosts. Materani’s anxiety in real life is reflected by the film’s heroes who, putting their Christianity on their sleeves, frantically face any exotic tradition (especially witchcraft) that goes beyond the norm. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Matera was also used as a substitute for Jerusalem in Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ. In any case, this adds even more potency to the message of Fulci. Catholic guilt and horrific murders are such a resonant combination.
