This is one particular Stooge short, which actually uses satyr in combination with a farce, a rarity. As already mentioned, the name and concept of this short film “borrowed” from a feature film of the same year with Clark Gable titled “People in White”. This is mainly about the trials and tribulations of the interns and their sacred cause of "duty and humanity." I saw it recently and almost treated it like the Stooge version, because she takes herself too seriously. In any case, "Men in Black" are so well written, directed, not to mention the original, that they did not borrow anything from Chaplin or anyone else, that the Academy of Cinematographic Films nominated him for the best comedy of 1934. Some smelly short film "La Cucaracha" surpassed it and stole the award. It must have been that some producer’s son-in-law was on the Academy's election board. "Men in Black" derided the entire concept of the medical profession just as the Marx brothers did at that time. It may be an unfair comparison, but I see the Marx brothers in this short statement. In fact, in their film “A Day At The Races” there is a scene where “medical affairs” take place, and they cause anarchy as usual. My suggestion is that this particular short was rated the same and, therefore, why it was nominated first. Try it for real: first look at this short, and then look at “Duck Soup” or “Race Day” with Marx, and then see if there is the same great quality of comedy.
