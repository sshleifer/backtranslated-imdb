A very trustworthy and disturbing film about the effects of war on the general public, Shame gives us a chilling insight into Ingmar Bergman's beliefs. The lack of color and sound (as in the soundtrack) helps to give the film a more realistic feeling. There is no soft or hard lighting or multiple angles to give the plot a charming or dramatic effect. Everything is very simply depicted as it really would be. At times the storyline was confusing, but perhaps in order to give an idea of ​​the characters' mood ?? how they now know what is happening and why. The simplicity of the film made it somewhat boring, but I could understand how the director tries not to embellish the story and the plots. He depicted the harsh and disturbing events and consequences of the war. Initially, the characters were presented and shown as content with easier settings and very long, extended frames. When the war suddenly struck them, they were much darker and quieter with less intimate shots. Bergman did a good job of allowing us to be absorbed by the war ourselves and to present its image that is so appropriate for the war. Although the storyline itself was not very impressive, the content of the film was.
