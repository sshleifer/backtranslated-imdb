Robin Hood; Men in Tights is worth seeing, I recently watched it because I just became a fan of Cary Elwes, and this is one of his main roles. Some moments really made me fall so hard! I did not expect them, you know, it was so funny, Even the second time you would still fall from the chair. The cast is great, of course, especially Robin from Locksley, Carey, but Blinkin, Sheriff and Little John (Don't let the name fool you, it is very big! Lol) and everyone else! <br /> <br /> Of course, there were moments when the film tried to create a comedic scene, but you don’t do that, I’ll laugh at this, but everything is fine. <br /> <br /> Carey Elvis and Patrick Stewart are filming for the second time in the film, they both worked on “Lady Jane” in 1986, and it was fun to see them, 7 years later, older, auuuuu. <br /> <br /> This is definitely worth seeing, really, really fun!
