After a couple of years of searching for Humphrey Bogart’s film “The Two Against the World,” he unexpectedly appeared as a TCM proposal called One Fateful Hour, the first national film of 1936. The character "Boggi" is Sherry Scott, the Man who runs the WUBC, a radio station whose program loses to listeners. The owner is Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass), a pathetic leader who calls the shots at the station, but hides behind his decisions, throwing them up to Scott. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to increase the audience, Reynolds also has an idea to revive a twenty-year murder case and offer it as a radio show of fifteen chapters. Scott enlists the help of Dr. Martin Leavenworth (Harry Hayden) to write the play and present it live. <br /> <br /> In the Pembroke murder case, a woman was involved who was acquitted of the murder of her husband, the circumstances are not explained. However, Gloria Pembroke married and now lives as Martha Carstairs (Helen McKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill), and their daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is going to marry (no less on the same day). since the radio game must reveal the identity of Gloria Pembroke). Going to face the devastating effects of this revelation, Martha and Jim Carstairs are taking a crusade to stop the program. At the same time, the future relatives of Edith respond, demanding that the marriage not take place. <br /> <br /> Without revealing the final result, the film takes a destructive twist to shock the viewer. Edith Carstairs confronts radio station executives, vigorously warning Scott and Reynolds whine. Accepting his share of the blame for the result, Scott partially redeems himself, leaving his job, dismissing the secretary and pulling her out of the office, recognizing her for the conscience he once had. With a completely unexpected ending, the film leaves as disoriented and indecisive as any movie that does not have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Humphrey Bogart, who has about a dozen films behind him, gets a chance to take center stage with astounding results. Without the name of the supporting players, Bogey walks up to the occasion, taking responsibility within the boundaries of the radio offices, and controls the show as if it were his own. In an interesting description, he expresses his irritation by folding his arms on his bowed head, after another half-dozen years we will see a similar effect in “Casablanca”. For the fans of Bogart, it’s a real joy to catch such an unexpected nuance as this one.
