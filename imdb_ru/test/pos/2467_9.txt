Not being a fan of cinema, I am not familiar with the names of leading directors, scriptwriters, producers and the like, but I can tell you about an outstanding film when I see it. <br /> <br /> The creators of this beautiful film may very well be on top of their fields now, or they may well get there pretty soon. I know that the actors are already here. <br /> <br /> To bring talent to genius closer, you need to show with such realism how such a national tragedy, like Vietnam, influenced the daily life of a typically average American family and made us see at close range why so many homeless Vietnamese veterans . <br /> <br /> Without going into unreasonable scenes of bloodshed and bloodshed, we understand why so many young people remembered what they went through. /> <br /> Dialogue is especially exciting and gives us an idea of ​​what happened in many families after Vietnam. <br /> <br /> I wish there were more good films like this, not only about Vietnam, but also about other social conditions.
