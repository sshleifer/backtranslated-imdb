I saw this film when it was broadcast on television in February 1983. I was in the hospital, having just given birth to the first and only child. I will not tell you the extent to which I was touched. Suffice it to say that the memory of the film has remained with me to this day, almost 23 years later. I hope I can find a copy of this film if such a thing has ever been made. This film should be remembered with love by anyone who has ever seen it. However, I must admit that the fact that it remains somewhat obscure suits me perfectly. Thus, it will always be a little secret for me and those whom he also touched. I have never seen Miss Margaret play the best part. I have never seen her in a more convincing role. I will always respect her only for the fact that she took such a wonderful role.
