Finally, having caught up with this “masterpiece”, it seems to me that at one time he seemed terribly clever. This is French art, underrated to agony, and ultimately depressing. But if you look at the prospect of 37 years in the future, it’s also a bit pointless, pretentious and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Others summarized the story, but I don’t think that someone pointed out the dramatic flaw in the basis of this film: the main characters, Corey and Vogel, really don’t deserve what they get. They play right in their code, never harm those who have not asked for it, and show great courage and initiative. In addition, Corey, in particular, becomes a victim of his former "friend" from gangster countries who stole his girlfriend and who repeatedly tries to kill him, apparently only because he (Corey) dared to "borrow" several thousand francs. These are guys who really have to rest! Instead, for them everything goes much worse than they really need, within the framework of the logic of history. <br /> <br /> It can be argued that this is the whole point: real villains will never be caught; that they collude with the police as necessary, sell off their friends and always come out on top. But this is also not shown. An old friend of the gangster Corey is not shown in collusion with the police. Nor does he show gloating over his victory. In fact, after he materialized several times when he needed him, he was nowhere in sight in prison, leaving the dramatic tension (his enmity with Corey) completely unsolved! <br /> <br /> However, I would say that this film is worth paying attention to its beautiful photograph, slow, thoughtful stimulation, magnificent frank performances, complex sequence of robberies and the embodiment of the style of an art film of the late 1960s.
