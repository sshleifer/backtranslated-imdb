Oh, I remember watching this show at 4:00 in the evening. during my younger days. It was not a very pleasant experience, because I remember watching it when I was doing my homework. <br /> <br /> However, the show caught my attention when Alex demonstrated her special abilities and considered typical problems of the lower grades. <Br /> <br /> But the show was not only about adventures and special powers; it was rather an educational job for a young audience to be more interested in school and biology in general. <br /> <br /> The lead actress (I don’t remember her name, and I’m too lazy to copy and paste the main details) delivered a fantastic performance. She made the show watchable. <br /> <br /> They just don’t make such shows anymore ...
