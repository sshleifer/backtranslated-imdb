Since many other users have already explained and commented on the storyline, I will not do that. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to repeat that Bardem’s interpretation is amazing, as are the other actors, and the Actresses in this film. <br /> <br /> As I read the previous comments, I noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film doesn’t show opposing points of view of euthanasia, and that these little people present are ridiculed. In my honest opinion, this is far from the case. <br /> <br /> There are many characters that move in the gray zone between Ramón Sampedro’s love and his desire to stay, and his desire to die. The most obvious ones are family. For example, Ramona’s sister-in-law never speaks for or against euthanasia. Another such character is Jena (social rights activist), who at the last moment tells Ramon to rethink it all. The scene clearly shows that she does not want him to die. <br /> <br /> Then there are characters who are clearly against euthanasia. Brother Ramon is clearly against this, as is his father. (“There is only one thing worse than the death of a son, and he has a son who wants to die.”) Other users noted that the discussion between Ramon and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that Ramon is WELL, and the priest is BAD. Well, without a doubt, the scene is comic, but this does not mean that the priest is caricatured or ridiculed. From my point of view, the comedy in this scene stems from the fact that the priest is trying to convince Ramon to continue living, using arguments that Ramon has completely alien thoughts. The priest’s speech goes like this: “God gives, and God takes,” “We are not the masters of our own lives, they belong to God” ... and so on. Comedy stems from the fact that Ramon is an atheist, and therefore everything that the priest says to him is nonsense. <br /> <br /> This film is the antithesis of Manichaeism, it leaves the viewer the opportunity to think about this topic and form their own opinion. And above all - the chanting of FREEDOM.
