If you want to really scare people, choose the Devil as the subject. After all, a considerable part of the population believes that it is real.

And this will certainly cause a lot of nightmares to your young audience. <br /> <br /> In this episode, everything looked like a Hollywood blockbuster. In fact, having finished watching it, I switched to another channel that played the recent Bond film, and, frankly speaking, could not share the differences between SFX. With a minimum composition, limited by its position on the space station; Combined with a stunning panoramic view of the exploding universe, it was as claustrophobic and intense as the “Alien” or “Event Horizon”.

I'm not sure that I even want to see what will happen next!
