A single lie changed my life. In fact, questions and answers were. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS BELOW. Only for reading, if you are watching trailers or have already seen it: <br /> <br /> The character Emily Watson is deceiving the character Tom Wilconson. My first reaction to Emily with a puppy's eyes was "It's over. Drop her. Bad deliverance." For some reason he was stuck. Not in a pitiful way. He just listened. And tried to accept her needs. Sometimes he had to leave. But he stuck to her and allowed her to live his life. But I still wanted to see her. <br /> <br /> After that, Julian, the screenwriter and director, spoke about the film. I'm glad he did, because, frankly, I was too you and was too immature to understand before he broke it for me. <br /> <br /> Tom’s character loved her, and no matter how much her desire for her needs didn’t coincide with what he wanted, he would always love her. The relationships and love they shared were not a lie, all of a sudden, simply because she wanted to be with someone else. The fact that she wanted to be with someone else did not make her what she is. When you are over fifty, there is a high probability that the love of your life will not come again, so you can not be as dismissive as you were in your youth. You should try to make things work, because the alternative can be much worse. <br /> <br /> She needed what she needed, and she could not do anything about it. He had to learn to let her go if he wanted to be who he could be. He helped her pursue her lover, even when it hurt him. <br /> <br /> Another thing: Julian said that the most powerful tool of the controller is guilt. <br /> <br /> Again: the most powerful controller tool is to blame. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Tom relieved her of the burden. He felt the need to let her know that he loved her, but not to bring her back; he wanted her to know that she didn’t need to feel guilty or think badly about relationships, simply because they ended so badly. <br /> <br /> This is not my way to review a film based on a message, not a performance, especially when I better understand this message, when it is explained to me by the director, but I make an exception here, because I feel more mature, what would be useful for me to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> The filming took place at a pleasant British pace. Rupert was slimy and disgusting. Tom and Emily were their usually solid, real characters.
