I hate football !! I hate football fans! I hate cars! but this film was the funniest thing I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> I was given a great opportunity to watch this movie on the weekend, and all I have to say is that I laughed until I cried, and when it appears in the UK and Denmark. Girls, this is one football movie that you will need to see, it's funny! <br /> <br /> The fact that this film started off as a crazy commercial for a telephone company is simply amazing, the guys may not be very well known actors, but this is a very muted real humor with real people, and I I applaud them for taking it off the screen. <br /> <br /> WELL MADE!
