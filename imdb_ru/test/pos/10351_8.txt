In the last ten minutes of this exceptional television film, I cried like an idiot. I have to say that the idea to sit down to see the 90 minutes of what was supposed to be a rather depressing material on Sunday was not desired. The thought of another, more worthy, opportunity to win BAFTA did not excite me ... However, the end result knocked me out of a rut. This is one of the best TVs I've seen in recent years. For years, I had the impression that all originality had left the BBC drama department. “Our friends in the north” was the last performance that really hit me, and that was 10 years ago. However, faith restored and honor satisfied. David Tenant was incredible! So many actors that I can think of would really go to a city with such a role, but not once did I see Mr. Tenant as an actor or Doctor, all I saw was Alan Hamilton. My heart didn’t hurt so much since Daniel Craigs played the role of Jordi Peacock all those years ago. Sarah Parish was also incredible, and I really hope that this role will bring her the best roles in the future. All the actors were great, but a special mention should go to the director who really put us in Alan's head. In particular, the toaster scene made me feel nauseous.
