This is one of the best and most underrated teen films ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw how he was growing up, and he was one of my favorites, perhaps not as popular as “Fast Times”, but just how wonderful. <br /> <br /> This film has a serious side, as other reviewers have mentioned, it starts as a comedy and turns into a drama about halfway through. This is the beauty of it and what distinguishes it. You get it all. Humor (not much different from “Fast Times”), Drama and a BIG BIG soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I personally think that every child who is going to go to high school should see this, it will give an idea of ​​the journey. they are going to start. Well, what kind of child watching this won't be able to see someone in the film? The fact that it gets so serious is halfway through, although it is also cool and just superbly done. You do not even expect it. Definitely a lot of surprises. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW. <br /> <br /> An excellent humorous slap (which can forget the scene) between Gary and Camilla?). I still hear it: “Oh, my big strong burrito !!” Priceless !! <br /> <br /> Some scenes between Gary and Karin are difficult to watch (especially the final scene is rough). There are so many women, like Karen, who would make the same choice as she. Think about it - how many women reject men with golden hearts (like Gary) for assholes? I know I did it, and so many women I know. This film will provoke debate and, despite the countless number of times I have seen it, is still admired by directors and performers. Everyone will find someone in this film to associate with, or, more likely, than one person. <br /> <br /> Finally, the music used is simply gorgeous (a lot of Cars, u2, a lot of incomprehensible (now) songs from the 80s. - a purist dream of the 80s.) <br /> <br /> But make no mistake It’s not the music that makes this film unique, but the story itself, simple and clear. One of the best of its kind and classic film for teens.
