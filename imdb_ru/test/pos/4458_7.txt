If you like someone, you will like it, this film, which is considered the best Italian detective (Djallo), made Fulci. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not Mickey Spillane. There are scenes designed to disturb someone. <br /> <br /> Many were offended by the beautiful woman who tried to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but nonetheless she was naked, and he would have taken the chance to jump into her dice. She is also trying to seduce a local priest. <br /> <br /> Young guys disappear, and there are some interesting suspects. You must watch out for the killer. You can? Do not jump on the first guy, it's too early, and he is too obvious. <br /> <br /> Anyone familiar with Fulci can guess the killer who died a violent death at the end. What a crazy reasoning he had.
