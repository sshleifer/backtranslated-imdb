It was a film that first showed me what a great actor Martin Sheen is. He modestly asserts that Charlie is the best actor, Charlie cannot offer him a candle. <br /> <br /> I found this tense, and I really liked the interweaving of a love story with the main storyline (and I usually hate love stories). In the end there is a great plot twist, which seemed to me completely believable, especially in the early 80s, and probably now also. <br /> <br /> In the last scene I was on the edge of my place. This film clearly demonstrates that betrayal is often heard by those we trust, while the declared enemies have more in common than they suspect, and, finally, human compassion can be found where we least expect it.
