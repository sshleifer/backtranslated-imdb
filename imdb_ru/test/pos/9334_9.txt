For those who remember the original impact of this video, it will never be forgotten, and watching Thriller is all it takes to feel like a 12-year-old again. But, although this is a great video, it is not perfect, although at the time it seemed like it was. When this video first came out, no one had ever seen anything like it before. Now the medium of the music video has grown by leaps and bounds, and a fresh look at Thriller will reveal its flaws. Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song? When Michael Jackson goes next to the girl after they leave the cinema, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping choruses. After he becomes a zombie, when itâ€™s time for him to sing again, his zombie makeup inexplicably disappears, and he sings the chorus again and again and again, as if to catch up. Perhaps it was the first time that a song was made out to fit the visual elements of a music video, but of course it was not the last time. This continued to be a problem in the MTV era. The best videos, such as Billie Jean and Beat It Jackson, used visual effects to play music, and not vice versa. However, the thriller is very funny and absolutely necessary on Halloween.
