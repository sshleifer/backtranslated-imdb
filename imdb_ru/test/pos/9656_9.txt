This is a cute and charming epic fantasy with a big heart. I got lost in this cute movie, watching it in the Chinese theater Mann in Hollywood. It is really romantic with a touching message. The decoration and effects are visually striking, and the fact that the director is an amazing artist is so obvious. Frames, how to watch moving art. It also has a strong and talented cast. What a wonderful surprise to see Joss Ackland, he is just a fabulous perfect king. Sarah Douglas is awesome because the villain and Christina Taylor and Tom Schulz make up the perfect romantic couple. The fact that the film was made on a ridiculously tiny budget of indie films just amazes me. This may not be the kind of Hollywood thing we flooded, but this is a really good movie that can be rented and enjoyed rolled up on a sofa on a rainy Saturday. Don't forget the microwave popcorn. This is my advice. Just enjoy it.
