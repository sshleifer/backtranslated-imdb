Chick Flick? Sure .... been done before? Many times .... Predictable? Yes ..... worth seeing? You bet! I was delighted with Sarandon and Portmanâ€™s portraying other characters in a familiar storyline. I am a big fan of mother / daughter stories. What is the difference between good and weak is in terms of performance and character development. Although it is not the BEST in its genre, I will buy it and look again. I felt that the characters were believable and the game was excellent.
