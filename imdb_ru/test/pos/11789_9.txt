OTHER great performance by Kiefer Sutherland. I love his films because he always plays his part very well. For a low budget movie, it was done very well and kept me on the edge all the time. I like movies of this type, and I was glad I understood that. I will definitely buy a DVD or tape. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
