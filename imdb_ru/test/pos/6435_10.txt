OK. Who ever invented this film hates humanity and wants to see them cut their throats. This "film" was absolute and utter abomination. What the hell is wrong with strange eyes in old bags? Seriously, did she take any horrible medicine, and then it just seemed to her that she could control people? She ran with her damn evil eye, and it was like what? My nose is hanging booger? What are you looking at? Are you like a sea witch or something? Everything and everyone, although I thought the graphics were top notch old guy. For this alone, I would give ten. But just close your ears when you watch it. The pure and total evil that emanates from this film will make your ears bleed and your eyelids fall. Who knows? You can even get a knot in the small intestine. You better watch out for fools.
