The magnificent story of a dedicated young teacher who is going to teach minority children in an area outside of South Carolina. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight is simply amazing, like a stubborn, dedicated, idealistic teacher who faces this problem, despite the fact that the school principal believes in strict discipline and cares little about modern educational methods, as well as crisp an old school superintendent who was happily played by the late Hume Cronin. Madge Sinclair is the principal who loves her children. <br /> <br /> Since I am a retired teacher, I can relate in some way to this beautiful film. The ignorance shown here, as well as the lack of cooperation with officials, is also quite obvious in urban areas. <br /> <br /> Voight understands that these children need much more than traditional classroom instruction. He forces them to go out and explore life on their own, while studying outdoors. <br /> <br /> The end is definitely depressing, but so true to life. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, such backward students had an interest in learning and were well disciplined. I think this answers my question. Behavior took place, and they were motivated to succeed, despite their surroundings. <br /> <br /> The end will just shake your heart. It was unforgettable and very good.
