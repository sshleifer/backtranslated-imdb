I can't believe people give bad reviews about this movie! I wonder why ...... maybe because of the book ..... I have to admit that it really does not follow the book ... for sure ... the book of Dean Kunz is much better .. but the film is also good !!! he has an expectation ... the game is good ... especially Michael Ironside, who gave an excellent game in this film !!! <br /> <br /> one guy ... give this movie a chance. ... the film is still much worse than this ... as the sum of all the fears ... ghosts ... da Vinci code ... this is one of the worst films I've seen ... really boring if compared to viewers who really have great elements in the film ... this film contains a great wait and non-stop action !!! I'm looking for this movie ... but on DVD it's really hard to find ... <br /> <br /> yes ... I really recommend this movie to everyone ... watch it! !!! You will never regret !!! <br /> <br /> 10/10 *
