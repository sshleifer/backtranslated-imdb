Penelope Spheris (known as “The World of Wayne”) impressed the documentary “The Decline of Western Civilization” about the Los Angeles punk scene in the late 70s and early 80s. Most of the documentary contains punks interviews and live gigs (which often become fierce). In general, we see how the punk movement was a reaction to hippies: while hippies were natural, punks wanted to change themselves as much as possible, with studded hair and all that. But we also see how they are really unhappy and sometimes become skinheads. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is really a great time capsule. We are not quite sure whether we want to strive for this epoch or feel it repulsive. But this is definitely not a documentary film that will leave you neutral. Really worth seeing.
