Dolemit stunning. Pimping Rhyy Ray Moore with kung fu rigging with horrendous choreographic sequences of actions is almost so close to becoming a cheat of the genre, but not to deceive him. Citizen Kane, this may not be Les Infant Au Revoir, but this is undoubtedly a genius in and of itself. Production values ​​in this film are so bad that they can be qualified as existential special effects. The plot stretches a little in the middle, but the power of such a cheap prerequisite, like the prostitute Kung Fu, is enough to get everyone except the most attractive movie lovers. The infamous forever boom Mike evokes shades of the gloriously incompetent Ed Wood and never becomes unfunny. I sometimes wonder if the boom microphone was deliberately left as a commentary on the ridiculous aspects of films in general, but I am usually distracted by erotic scenes in which there is no eroticism to the level of high artistic routine. Everything in this film is alive and breathing, dripping from a desperate desire to be both beloved and insulted. It works. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
