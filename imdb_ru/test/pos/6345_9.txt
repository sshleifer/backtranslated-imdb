Let me start by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original “Lonely Pigeon” than me. And the book that won the Pulitzer Prize, and the high mini-series adapted from it, in my experience, are lonely as touching, dramatic, believable and fascinating works. There is no comparison between the Lonely Pigeon and any Western film - at least after the legendary collaboration of John Ford and John Wayne. It was with real reservations that I sat down to watch this new mini-series, in which McMurtry and the missing original actors did not participate. After watching the first episode, it became clear that this is not the “Lonely Pigeon”. In almost all measurable ways, this continuation does not match the original. So what? I did not expect it to fit. Taken as an effort, this film is attractive, interesting and of very good quality. If this was done as a new story, and not as a continuation of the “Lonely Pigeon”, I have no doubt that she would not receive so many negative evaluations. John Voight did a decent job in the role of Calla, Barbara Hershey was amazing Clara, and new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well drawn and believable. Louis Gossett Jr. deserves special mention as the equestrian debater Izom Pickett. The film made me take care of the characters, and I don’t ask more than that from the actor. Unfortunately, this worthy effort is in the shadow of its predecessor - it is worth seeing by itself.
