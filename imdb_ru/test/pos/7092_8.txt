Kate Gulden, played by one of the most nominated actresses of the last decade of this century, and also one of the most talented actresses Meryl Streep (Out of Africa). She is beautiful in every role she plays. A graduate of Yale University - the pride and joy of American cinema. <br /> <br /> Kate's health is deteriorating, and her husband George’s role is well developed by a brilliant actor and Oscar-winning winner William Hurt looking for help from her daughter. The poor daughter of Ellen Gulden, Renee Zellweger (Jerry Maguire), was expecting too much from her. No breaks! The story takes a very realistic look at the parent's illness. In this film, the only daughter must postpone her life to take care of the needs of others. In every family there is always one who is faced with such responsibility. Ellen is angry at the beginning of the film, but over time she realizes that her mother has devoted her entire life to life. She even asks her mom: how do you do it every day, and no one notices it? This is what women do, much of what I call invisible work. In addition, we remove, we repair, we repair, we stretch, we celebrate, we are best friends, we are confidants, lover, outreachers, disciplined, sensitive. Some of us, like both women in this film, have an excellent education, are psychological support for the whole family, and also perform all this invisible work! This is Kate Ellen and many women in our society. Many of us have already passed that stage of life when our parents grow old and die. I was there. They are just too young. I thanked my parents, but I never understood them as well as when I had to play their roles, and I had to walk in their place. This film reflects the reality of life. It may be sad, but such is life, at times. George, a professor at Harvard, is a complex man who seems to think that his work is more important than everyone else, and in his life there is a very “master / servant” mentality towards women. He is not strong enough to cope. If you want to see a good acting game and the reality of life, do not miss this movie. Favorite scenes: restaurant Kate, violins and all that. Making a table from broken porcelain. This is me so symbolic! We are all broken vessels! Favorite quotes: George: “Only ascending the mountain do you realize that you are really going down.” George "Do you have education at Harvard, but where is your heart?" <br /> <br />
