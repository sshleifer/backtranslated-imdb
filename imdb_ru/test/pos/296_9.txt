I saw this film 4 times in 5 months, and I never get tired of it just because it is perfect. And this is also the best music for films and the best roles ever written for a film. I mean, you just have to love Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and Lawrence Fishburne in this film, but especially Duval. I can't believe that Kramer vs. Kramer really won an Oscar instead of this amazing war movie. So this is my conclusion, if you take the director of the world's greatest film (The Godfather) and the best Hollywood actors, you can succeed. Now I just need to write something down to get this preview, so donâ€™t read it except for the last line. The rules of this film !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
