Every episode I saw when I was an innocent kid was stupid. There were some funny looking puppets called “Mitts” who always discussed children's things. They would play this song before a part of The Mitts show, which sounds like this: “Let's join the Mitts ...” There was a Gaucho Marx puppet telling jokes. Before the session, this man sang "Hot Fudge! Right On!" There was a green puppet with teeth called Seymour. We would always see more of Seymour. He will joke and sing every episode. Every episode has always been moral. In one episode, a man sang "Liars are losers!" Another episode that he sang about sharing and caring. Seymour said, tell me about these two little girls "Sharon and Karen". In the role of Hot Fudge Holey Moley, this man does strange things, and they play strange music.
