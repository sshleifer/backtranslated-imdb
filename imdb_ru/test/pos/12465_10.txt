.. especially Lambert. This is the main Tarzan Burrough, which I read when I was a child. I read a few negative reviews about this film and could not help but wonder what their problem was. Obviously, they did not see the film that I made, or expected something more similar to the Saturday afternoon series. <br /> <br /> This was Tarzan, who was from the novel, and filmmakers should be welcome to take the original material and take it seriously. Lambert was superb. I still think he is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. It was a movie in which he starred. <br /> <br /> Photography and monkeys made by Rick Baker were awesome. You have definitely felt since the jungle. The second half, Tarzanâ€™s attempt to be civilized really drags you into the emotional conflict that he was forced to resolve. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
