Anyway, I missed many early episodes of Farscape, so I see them in all kinds of orders, as they are repeated on different channels. I caught it for the first time - quite by accident - while lounging in a hotel room. The first 10 seconds I was completely hooked - this is what SF is doing. <br /> <br /> Strong characters; and Moya / Pilot is what Lex should have been. Plots vary in quality, but in my opinion, none of them falls below the excellent. And I must mention Rygel - what a magnificently disrespectful character! None of your tricky sugar-coated aliens is here, this is a real deal - cynical, self-serving and full of disgusting personal habits, Rigel is a genius. <br /> <br /> Last week, the SciFi Channel showed "Crazy" (body exchange episode). A real classic, I could not stop laughing from beginning to end ... <br /> <br /> Long let Farscape decorate our screens!
