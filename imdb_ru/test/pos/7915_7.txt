Eisenstein’s first sound film tells about the ice battle of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the Livonian knights, trying to subjugate Russia to Catholicism. Created in 1938, Nevsky can be seen as part of propaganda: German knights with their sinister (and somewhat stupid) helmets are an obvious substitute for the Nazis. The massacre of knights when they enter the Russian city seems to be a prophetic warning about the massacres of the Second World War. The film ends with a warning: those who come to Russia with a sword will die by the sword. Made in soft black and white colors (somewhat reminiscent of the daguerreotype), it also marked the return of Eisenstein to official support. By the end of the 1920s, Stalin wanted the Soviet cinematographers to stop experimenting and make films that would be more popular and acceptable to the Russian public. This stopped Eisenstein’s career in Russia for a decade, and in Nevsky he returned with his more accessible film. The strength of Nevsky is his second half, which tells about the battle itself, and it is justly considered a milestone in the history of cinema: never (and probably never after) the battle would not be so bright on the screen. Another strong point is Prokofiev’s beautiful, haunting soundtrack (using the composer to create a film was completely unusual at the time). One of its weaker points: the comic relief (in the form of two simple Russian soldiers trying to persuade a beautiful Russian peasant) is really unpleasant.
