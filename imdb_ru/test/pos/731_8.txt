As the late patron of driving enthusiasts (1970â€“1980s), I have seen and forgot many films. This is one that I could never forget. Despite its low budget, exploitative style of film production, STORY was very well done. An isolated therapeutic shelter, where patients play out their fantasies to help cure their psychosis, the accidental killing of the head doctor, as soon as a new nurse appears, a (supposed) medical assistant, various crazy patients revelation that the doctor's assistant is actually the patient and, finally, the rescue of the young nurse by the ingenuous Sam, who killed everyone else in the house so that she could escape safe and sound, made for the great HISTORY that kept the film together. I emphasized the word STORY, because this is what makes a good or great movie. No matter how much blood, blood, nudity, sexual behavior or outrageous behavior you put into a movie, if HISTORY is not good, then the film is not good. The films show clips of all the actors, including the old story with the final line, in which you are advised to leave and never return, which is a great ending to this film. If it is on video / DVD, watch it and enjoy.
