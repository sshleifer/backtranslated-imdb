I originally saw it a few years ago when I was sitting on the couch and stuck watching it on HBO. When the console was out of reach, I decided to go with it and waited for the unfortunate film, which I avoided for a year. So it all started, and I'm not very optimistic about this, but after about ten minutes I laughed. The exact opposite, as I expected. The comedy was smart, the acting was pretty good, considering that the cast worked very well together, and the story (albeit a bit clumsy and fake) was actually quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Three convicted brothers were able to escape their sentence and eventually go in search of their condition. The film takes place in the 1930s. Along the way, they encounter many funny and interesting characters. Everyone has their own story or achievement, to which they aspire. In fact, most films may seem random. Some may say that it was pointless and boring, but if you are looking for a clever comedy (and sometimes stupid) that is integrated into the film, I am sure you will like it. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the performances of George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. They all coped well with their roles, and they did a great job together. But to end it, "O Brother, Where are You?" This is a smart, funny and adventure movie, which I would not refuse.
