What a great cast for this movie. It was a great time and there were so many smart lines â€” I kept laughing a few times a few minutes after they were delivered. I found that Manna From Heaven had some amazing moments, and although I thought something would happen, the way they came together was not at all predictable. This film is about hope and error correction. I left the theater, feeling inspired to do the right thing. Bravo five sisters.
