I found this little gem as an extra feature on my Vampyr-Der Traum Des Allen Gray DVD and didn’t expect it all. It looked like it might be an interesting shorty, so I turned it on. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did. It was really incredible! Despite the fact that it was made over 70 years ago, the animation was, in my opinion, better than the one that was made today, using all the computer effects and experience available now. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: The assembled dog hears the complaints of its owner that she cannot afford an orange, and goes in search of her. In the process, he encounters the underworld of toys with all kinds of vile creatures and toys, which are watched by none other than the devil himself, who also wants a canine orange for himself. <br /> <br /> This film precedes, but does the Mad Monster Party remind me a lot? (1969, Jules Bass) - a film that I always liked a lot - and, to a lesser extent, some of Tim Burton’s animated work “The Nightmare Before Christmas” (1993, Henry Selick) and “The Bride's Corpse” (2005, Tim Burton) I am sure that any of these films will also like the Talisman. <br /> <br /> In general, an incredible short animation that is worth seeing.
