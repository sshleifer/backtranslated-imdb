When you've waited for years to see a movie you heard on a vine, obviously your expectations are high, right? f ** k, yes! But when this child fell a little out of my door, I knew what amazing images would decorate my TV and distort my fragile mind. First of all, Karim Hussein is a fan of films, like all of us who grew up on the Argento / Fulci / Lynch diet, etc. ... and it shows in this film, but in a good way. Although I didnâ€™t know what the hell was happening on my first watch with this gem, I was just amazed by the visual effects, lighting and, of course, the performances of all who took part, Karim must have really believed that going to push the boundaries of filmmaking (which, I think, he does) and that he will have hard work to convince the actors to do the same ........ <br /> <br /> So what can I tell you about "subliminal cruelty"? Well, without spoiling it .... it is a deep understanding of the human psyche with images of cruel and sexual madness, which turns into madness ..... really unforgettable experience ..... .. <br /> <br /> Watch for Karim Hussein, he can do only the best things ..... <br /> <br /> I watched the full printout of subliminal cruelty on a two-DVD. from Infliction movies that are loaded with additional services ..... please note that there is a Gonzon release with censorship, avoid this version.
