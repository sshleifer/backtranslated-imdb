I have never seen such a powerful, believable film. Thanks to this cinema masterpiece, I discovered a city, a country, a lost revolution and even a Nobel Prize winner. <br /> <br /> If you havenâ€™t seen this movie yet, you cannot say you have seen anything. <br /> <br /> An excellent lesson in courage, humility and life. <br /> <br /> Since then, I have not seen anything good. <br /> <br /> TE Saturday, January 9, 1999
