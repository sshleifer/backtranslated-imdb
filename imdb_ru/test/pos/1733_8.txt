As a child, I have never been in a situation where I could have been introduced to Doctor Who, and although I happened to hear about the series, I still did not understand what it was. Then, with some doubt, I sat down to see how the ninth Doctor and his antics were told that he was something like Arthur Dent (from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), but cooler. I can not believe that I am missing, seriously, why no one told me about this before? All my childhood was devoid of the adventures of Doctor Who; I am a huge fan of most fantastic and fantastic adventures. Honestly, I really enjoyed it and I look forward to any future episodes. <br /> <br /> At first, I had to admit that at first I wasn’t sure that Billie Piper would be the best actress, but I’m glad to say that she did very well, I thought, and added a very realistic shade to the series. I think, in fact, it was one of my favorite aspects of the series; the contrast between the great alien conflict scenes contrasted with the rabid normality of life at the South London Council Estate. I am always interested in cases when people’s ideas about the world are seriously challenged, and how people can take any situation and edit it in their minds to match their worldly life. I also loved Christopher Eccleston. I have not seen many of his films and have never seen another actor in the role of Doctor Who, but I thought his image of the Doctor was brilliant, incredibly cute and at the same time gloomy enough for you to be surprised. I believe that many other characters with their character history tend to be a bit two-dimensional; they have all the right emotions and actions, but they always seem slightly superficial. This Doctor, on the other hand, deserved my loyalty to his stratified personality. I agree with some other remarks that a higher budget for special effects, aliens and much more could be a bit more efficient. but then again, this is not about special effects (although they help) from what I read and heard from long-time fans of Dr Who; it is the spirit of all that really matters. And I don't think they did a bad job with what they had. I really liked all aliens, but my favorite was Dalex; if I ever knew something about Dr. Who, before watching the show, it was that there were things in it that looked like overturned garbage cans on wheels. Before watching, I was skeptical about these pots of pepper that threaten the existence of humanity, but some of them were pretty scary! That I really liked, of course. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good show. I look forward to future episodes with delight. The doctor has a new fan.
