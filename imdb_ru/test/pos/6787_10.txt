Blimey! What a wonderful, warm, rural film! The story is about Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), a young male traveler whose journey takes him to a quiet, rural coastal city. There he lives with the Brown family. Velvet (Liz Taylor), their youngest daughter, with whom Mi is fine friends, passionately loves horses and wins the auction. This horse is a beautiful, burgundy stallion; it is mentioned by its previous owner as a "murderous pirate", but Velvet renames it to pie. Soon Velvet proposes to introduce him into the Great National Race, Mi and her family are against this idea, but soon they agree, and Velvet and Mi began to prepare him for the most famous British leap ?? This film is a great example of what British films look like. I remember the first time I saw this when I was eight years old and on my summer vacation. My parents took it off the TV and I instantly warmed it ?? I watch it most of the day, not the large collection of Disney films I own. <br /> <br /> I think it was one of Liz Taylorâ€™s first films and a good one! Is her character naive but cute ?? her game is extremely convincing, especially when she portrays her love for horses. This is also a good chance to see Angela Lansbury in one of her early roles; who starred as the older sister Velvet, who spends most of her time in the film fighting a boy in town! I have to say that she was a gorgeous lady when she was younger. Beautiful blonde hair and ruddy face. Although she does not have the lead role in the film, she has several scenes - so do not disappoint your fans! Parents are reading this, should I emphasize? if you can get a copy of this please! If you kids love animals ?? I highly recommend that you show it to them! They may find some boring scenes, but you see how Velvet rides a horse many times throughout the film and most entertainingly entertains children! Beautiful and nostalgic film. I could just leave now and put it on!
