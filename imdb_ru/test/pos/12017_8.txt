This film is a welcome member of my movie library. Although not a mainstream film, this is, in my opinion, a high-performance film noir, in which Eric Roberts is completely undervalued as an actor. (I would qualify him as a much better actor than his sister Julia, who is overvalued, but this is another review ...) Roberts plays a former reporter out of luck, with the perfect combination of narrative accuracy and tormented idealism: integral part of any effective film noir. Roberts' first person narrative enhances the quality of the film and makes us guess about the real motives for the crime. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens in the film in Palm Springs is moving slowly around a metaphor for the theme of oppression: Ash (Roberts) is oppressed by its past; the police are oppressed by the rich residents of Palm Springs, who treat them like servants; in the meantime, the rich are oppressed by boredom (look at the classic performance of Johnny Depp as an insightful rich child who just wants to be loved ...); The isolation of each character is omnipresent and further aggravated by the heat and isolation of the desert. <br /> <br /> There is an audience for this film if they are looking for a more modern version of the film noir. Although there are some elements in the film that could be tougher, I recommend getting a copy of this film and placing it directly between the Big Sleep and Chinatown in your movie library. (The film is based on Arthur Lyon’s LITTLE CASTLES, and if you like the way Roberts plays in this film, you can get a copy of Ambulance in which he demonstrates his funnier and easier side.) "Caution? Careful what? I had to ask. Only fools ignore the strange warnings of ladies from a trailer park. ”
