But a great cast! Jonathan Price, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynn Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And this is just the beginning. <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure that any description of the film and plot will seduce you to watch this film. Suffice it to say that there is something for almost everyone: death, singing, a shiny suit, mobile phones, a small person (actually, a beautiful woman), a drawbridge (modern, not medieval), a boombox and a crossbow. Oh, and psychotic. And Barry Manilow. <br /> <br /> You will have to trust me when I say that 50% of you will hate this film because of the absence of the Absurd Gene in your DNA. This is not your fault; it is hereditary. The other 50% of you will probably want to change the channel in 20 minutes, but you MUST CONTINUE. <br /> <br /> Even so, you might wonder why you were watching ... but keep in mind that this is an absurd thing. It should grow on you. This is a test.
