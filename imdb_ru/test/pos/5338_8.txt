If you have not watched the movie, but you like comedy, go and buy it, or at least remove it! The fact that he won an Oscar animation is no accident! I haven't watched many other Wallace and Gromit films (in fact, I think I only watched one other), but the humor is very characteristic ... and some would also say that it is very British. In a good way, of course! <br /> <br /> The story will be only an excuse for all the jokes, but although it is not the most difficult, it still works (by the way, my niece expected to see one of the big surprises) I donâ€™t Glory to her; about)). I really think that after you watch this, you will come out and look for other W & G films that are there. Have fun!
