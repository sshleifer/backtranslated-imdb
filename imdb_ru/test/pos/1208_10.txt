The largest crowd that has ever seen a wrestling competition in the USA, took place at Wrestlemania 6. More than 93,000 people gathered to beat the Rolling Stones record indoors, and this event did not disappoint at all. Perhaps the biggest match of all time was when the Immortal Hulk defended his world title against the Final Warrior. More than 12 matches in total, so you get a ton of action.
