The film is visually elegant, but interesting, mostly plot. The film tells about the zigzag progress in studying the innermost feelings of the main actor. Max, who lived in New York for two years and intends to marry the girl he met there, returns to Paris and unexpectedly meets his ex-girlfriend, whom he still loves very much, but eventually finds out who he loves the most. in fact, her best friend is a non-linear story, so many memories and each part are clearly articulated. The three women whom Max has met symbolize what we should pursue, although we may not have a clear picture of the basic motives. His bride is what he needs, not what he loves, and therefore we see no loyalty. She also does not give him love, but only stability. True love also cannot be found in his relationship with an ex-girlfriend. Just a fantasy for him - to run away - a lot of romantic things that he did for her, but almost nothing seems changeable. The one who really animates Maxâ€™s life is in fact her best friend. The balance achieved at the end is not identical to the original balance, because Max understood much more about his deep feeling. Nonlinear structure makes the search process more complicated. Not as brilliant as Pulp Fiction, but the things in the Apartment seem much more natural. Max is not the only character who is undergoing a transformation, and in fact the description for Romani Bringer is also interesting. Good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci very beautiful. A good comment about today's love and, undoubtedly, a film that is worth seeing. <br /> <br />
