Coolie Hai is one of my favorite movies EVER !!! I think I saw this movie a few years ago on TV late at night with my mom, when I was little, and I thought it was so funny. This film was also referred to as “Black American Graffiti”. Glynn Thurman is great in the role of Prop, and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs is great in the role of Pich Cochise's friend. There are other great characters too, and there’s a lot of humor in this movie. From the very beginning of the film, in which Kochiz goes to Propich's house to get ready for school, and until the sad end of Kochiz’s funeral, this film will make you laugh all the way. There are many scenes in this movie that I really like. The scene in which Pouter (another one of Pass and Kochiz's friends) goes with them to the zoo and throws the gorilla feces on his shirt (very rudely, but also funny), the first scene in the dining room at the corner of the street, a quarter party in this girl's house , which became a disaster because of the fight, and some others look great. This film even has a great accompanying soundtrack album, in which many great hits and performers of Motown from the early 60s (only 6 songs on the soundtrack were written in the 75th, and the rest were in the 60s). Basically, the film tells about two friends who dream of escaping from their impoverished and rude area after graduation, but their future seems almost unattainable because of their innocent, joyful ride in a stolen car for which the other two hoods were responsible, Prop's Relationship with His Girlfriend The brand name (played by Cynthia Davis) is almost endangered. Go out and rent or buy this film, and be ready for a lot of fun entertainment !!! Get the soundtrack too. It's very funny!
