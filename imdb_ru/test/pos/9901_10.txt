Extraction is an unusual film that surpasses most films. His refreshing, witty humor never justifies remaining superficial. On the contrary, the film explores various aspects of the human spirit and human relations. His warm approach promotes tolerance and acceptance of diversity and recognition that unites all people. The characters are charming and funny, reflecting those idiosyncrasies that we can all laugh at in ourselves. Quick dialogue and witty banter will not leave you indifferent, and you can try to keep your own laughter, because you do not want to miss a single phrase! You may want to see it in the movie, and then (several more times) on the video, and each time you will discover something new. After each viewing you will feel warm and cheerful.
