Has anyone else found a way to get copies of this series? I see that many people asked, but I canâ€™t tell if any of them were successful. It is hard to believe that this series cannot be seen today by people, especially the series based on the real problems that real people faced in those tense and exciting times in our country. How can this be true and what can we do to change it? In addition, I agree with all the comments of other authors about this series on this website. This is a great story about events about which everyone should know and know something about today. Many of us saw this show when we were in college or at the time. Now we want to share this with our children ... but we can not? If this is true, then what will be good written materials conveying the same information?
