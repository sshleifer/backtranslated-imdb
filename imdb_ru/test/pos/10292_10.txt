This sad novel cannot be told, because the director decides to break his narration and offer the perspectives of each character. So, there are many memories of re-filming the same scene. But it would be an extraordinary moment for the cinema - to arrange all the fragments in order to see the result! <br /> <br /> And it's worth it, because for me it's just one of the best French films! <br /> <br /> Everything is there: <br /> <br /> Cast: the first steps of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such a presence and such voices, even for the hearing impaired! It is symbolic that they fell in love with this film! <br /> <br /> Director: his camera is bright, live, plays with sets, or may be mysterious with a long close-up "a la David Lynch." <br /> <br /> Cinematography: the light is beautiful, between gold and rust, like their love! <br /> <br /> Never seen before Paris: Paris is timeless, more precisely Composite from many districts! Huge search here! It looks like Gotham City, modern and old at the same time! <br /> <br /> Music: not a big orchestra, but fits perfectly into the frames. And the song of Charles Aznavour made me discover this great singer! <br /> <br /> Oh, ?? story! As I said, this is a love story, but rather tragic: to say that love can be in vain, that it does not make all people happy or does not guarantee a sweet ending, great, because this message is not often said! Love is a passion that comes from the Latin "pain". You can suffer a lot when in love! Because of why ..?, Endless waiting, lack of courage, indecision. <br /> <br /> And when you can relieve yourself, fate, fate, God (?), the devil (?) can stab you in the back just because you arrive too early or too late, and, above all because love means 2 in the world of billions! Much can happen and as many stories can be written! So what is love? <br /> <br /> Personally, I lived in such moments: in the car with my beloved. Her mobile phone is ringing and you know that it is her “special friend” whom she kisses goodbye (and not you, even if we are always together). So, you want to get out of this car, to leave them together, so as not to hear the sweet, but cruel words, but you can't, because an amazing heavy rain has just started! <br /> <br /> I discovered that this film portrays these moments of tragedy like no other!
