This movie is great! Being a fan of “Comic book presents ...”, I just knew that I would like this film. And I love it. I finally decided to buy a copy of this film at the beginning of this year. However, I was annoyed to find that it was cut! Therefore, I will continue to look at sales of automotive shoes for the original version. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is about Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmondson), who is trying to impress his girlfriend (Dawn French), claiming he is a drug dealer. However, Dennis overheard a pub party and cut himself! So Denis turns into a supergrass, but the trouble is that he knows nothing and begins to lie and dig himself in an even deeper hole! The irony of all this is that drug smuggling continues in Devon. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as funny as I expected, but it’s still a really good movie with a good laugh and a great soundtrack. He also has the best scene in the British film (Robbie Coltrane's walk on the pier set by Frankie in Hollywood, “Two Tribes”). <br /> <br /> So if you are a fan of “Comix presents ...”, any of the actors or fan of the British comedy, look as soon as possible !!!
