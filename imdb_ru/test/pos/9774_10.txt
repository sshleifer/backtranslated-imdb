This is probably the best episode I have ever seen. I watched vividly every Sunday night and bought a box set as soon as it became available. This is a timeless play, written by a fantastic Australian, which may include people of all ages, regardless of whether they are Australians or not, but for those of us who are Australian, this is indeed a typical Australian icon. Must see 10/10
