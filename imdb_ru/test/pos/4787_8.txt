I accidentally saw it on public television a few years ago and was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it was. <br /> <br /> Although in some ways it's a bit trite, its main function — the mysterious thriller — works. great, thanks to the script that comes up with a brilliant plot; it made me guess all over, and the resolution was inspiring. <br /> <br /> The cast is stellar, with a mix of those who ended their careers (indeed, Richard Long died the same year that it was done) or those who were on the verge of fame in a popular TV series (Kate Jackson, Tom Bosley). They all do well with their task, with the exception of Cesare Danova, who walks in her role. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
