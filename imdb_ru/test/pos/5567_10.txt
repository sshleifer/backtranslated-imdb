Farscape is one science fiction show that renewed my interest in science fiction. <br /> <br /> But Farscape is much more than fantastic. Comedy, drama and much more :) Acting is very good. Fortunately, Farscape survived and canceled it and showed through Peacekeeper Wars that he was not dead yet :) I hope Farscape has a future :) In my opinion, this is also not a problem that some of the characters on the show are dolls. Behind this is worth a look, and you will see what Farscape is. <br /> <br /> Farscape has set a new standard in television, and I think it will be really difficult for new TV shows to prove that they can be equal or better than Farscape. I love this show :) <br /> <br /> SaphirJD
