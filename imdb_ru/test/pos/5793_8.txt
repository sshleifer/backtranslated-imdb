In Little Vera there was a lot of strange to me. In general, I really enjoyed this film, but in many ways the behavior of the characters was not what I'm used to. For example, the environment in which the Vera family lived was very tense. Almost every time the family was together, they either drank, fought or shouted, and often it was a combination of the three. After I watched the movie, I felt the tension because of all the confrontation that occurred during it. However, it was very interesting for me to observe the plot of this middle-class Russian family. Throughout the film, we are reminded of the industrialized state of Russia because of the repeated shots of the train passing by the screen. This gave the viewer a sense of a mechanically lived life. The characters seemed to be focused on living their lives at work and drinking after work. During the whole film there was no feeling of happiness. The only time the character didn’t shout is when Vera first fell in love with her fiance Sergey. It was very short, because the viewer later discovers (after Sergey locks Vera’s father in the bathroom, and Vera releases him, after which the father continues to hurt Sergei) that he is insulting. Another time, Vera was told that the only reason she was born was because the family could get a big apartment. It is very interesting to observe how Vera and the family managed to cope with the behavior of each other. The film was definitely worth seeing because of its description of how life can be in the regions of Russia.
