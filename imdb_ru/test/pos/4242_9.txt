Chucky (murderous doll from the "Children's Game" and 2 shitty sequels) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using Voodoo for Dummies) revives him. Then, due to circumstances too entangled to get into her, she is killed and her soul is invested in another doll! Together they fall in love and kidnap a cute couple (Nick Stebile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet so that Chucky and Tiffany become real people again ... <br /> <br /> Much better than it sounds . After the last two sequels of the "Children's Game" (both of which were terrible), I expected the worst, but in fact it was a lot of fun. The film does not take itself seriously for a second (seriously - how could this be?), And the stories and situations are actually quite funny. There are also a few VERY bloody murders to satisfy us, horror fans, and the movie never stops. The film also has a few things that are not usually found in a horror film - gay's best friend (Gordon Michael Woolvett), who is smart and not played for laughter, and an episode in which Stabile removes his shirt, just to show his muscular body. John Ritter also has a beautiful cameo as a sheriff. <br /> <br /> Good game - Stabile is young, VERY beautiful and cute; Heiglu has nothing to do, but he copes, and Brad Dourif (voice of Chucky) and Tilly are funny, like murderous dolls. My favorite part is when the dolls have sex (don't ask), and she asks for a rubber band, and he answers: “But I AM MADE of rubber!” The special effects are good (there are no lousy CGIs here), and this is one of the few horror films in which funny funny and humorous. Worth seeing. I give him 9.
