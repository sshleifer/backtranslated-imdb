Every show is great. Finally, a show about something other than why it's terrible to be married or how good-looking people talk about why they look like normal people. It is a pity that it was canceled. <br /> <br /> Mike Scully and Julie Tucker, who previously worked for The Simpsons, wrote or produced several funny episodes of this series, and many of them look like humor in style. Take officer Steve Cox and think of Troy McClure. However, he has his own unique humor, and let's face it, a teenage girl will love him only on their faces. <br /> <br /> With television, most good shows are canceled, and we fed with a spoonful of such abominations as “With whom did my mother almost sleep” or what is the name of this show? Please learn the lesson. Not everything should be about attractiveness or romantic afflictions or especially reality shows on how to demystify every aspect of life. Some people actually love to laugh and shouldn't think later. Well, my grip is over for the day. Now back to the Simpsons. When is it on? Oh yeah! All the time.
