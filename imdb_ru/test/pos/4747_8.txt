This is a pretty good movie, and you probably won't be disappointed, but there is again Roy Shader in it, right after he played “French Connection”, playing a policeman named “Buddy”. They also use the same memorable steering wheel from the Bullitt. At first you will think that you saw a car chase before, if you still have memories of his face. The car chase is great, but, like in many car films, it has some technical and editing errors. Check out “Puppet on a Chain” and “French Connection II” for other good, long and intense chases.
