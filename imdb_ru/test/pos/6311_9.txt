Well, I'm Italian, but not so many Italian films. I think the plot is very good for 3/4 of the film, but the ending is too simple, too predictable. But this is the only little mistake. In “The Consequences of Love”, in my opinion, there are excellent episodes, especially at the beginning, and a great soundtrack. I would really like lighting fixtures to work on it. The best thing about it is a great, great actor. You know, if your name was Al Pacino, now everyone would talk about this performance. But this is only the great Italian theater actor named Tony Servillo. Yes, someone told me this film and this kind of performance is too slow, so boring, so much silence, but I think these components are his fantasy, this is the right way to describe the love story of a very talented young girl granddaughter of Italian actress Anna Magnani, Olivia and the mysterious old man Tony. One of my favorite Italian films.
