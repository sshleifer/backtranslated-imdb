Oddly enough, these shorts get 10. Why? They are funny. It's fun. Note a lot of strange humor. Outdated and childish skeptics, but they do not know what they are talking about. They learned that cartoons are not just for kids. The art in this is probably the best non-road art of the 1950s short Looney Tunes. It is hard to find something better than art in the Great Piggy Bank Robbery, although it will not work. This likely closes 3rd or 2nd. Shorts like this could generate reckless LT robberies, such as Tiny Toons Adventures, to try to squeeze out all the old comedy over and over, for example, about how great movies like Scream make shit like I Know ... which It was released only squeeze out all the old horror from Scream, but, like Scream, it is one great. Chuck Jones sometimes faced his flawed shorts, but he made up for them. Take, for example, Hopper. Few people love Hopper, but this has never destroyed LT’s reputation, but I’m sure it was his makeup. Bottom line: it's not as good as “Duck! Rabbit! Duck! ”But close. Catch it on the Cartoon Network often.
