As a fan of Dan Aykroyd, I watched this movie when it was recently shown in the middle of the night on TV. I did not expect much, so it was a big surprise that I loved him so much. <br /> <br /> This is a film that Dan Aykroyd seems to enjoy doing. For him, this is a chance to “get down to business” and not take it too seriously. If you love him in Blues Brothers or Ghostbusters, you’ll understand what I mean and it’s helpful to check out The Couch Trip. <br /> <br /> Fans of Aykroyd fans will also be interested to know all the tiny links to his other films in the script! <br /> <br /> I cannot describe this film without spoiling it for you, so all I can do is ask you to check it out. I can't praise this film highly enough, and it’s probably time for the DVD to be released!
