Finally a real horror movie. This is the first time in many years when I have had to close my eyes. I'm a horror lover, and I recommend this movie, but it's pretty awful. I am not a big fan of wrestling, but Kane really coped with all this monster. I have to admit that I did not want to watch this film, my 17-year-old was pulling me towards him, but I am very glad that I did. During and after the film, I looked over my shoulder. I have to agree with others about the entire remake of horror films enough, enough. I think this is why this film gets good reviews. This is a refreshing change that brings you back to the Texas chainsaw (first), Michael Myers and Jason. And no shit CGI.
