I believe that this story has two perspectives, firstly, it’s a satirical view of the world, presented in an explicit Kafkaian style, emphasizing the dirty sight behind some of the most common, but pleasant or pleasing moments and elements, which are usually enough. for a person to function in society. I like it: good work, good home, good wife, good car and even a good housewife. Besides this so-called general bliss, there are some that cannot but ask themselves some more uncomfortable questions, such as where they come from, or if they may have some other form of bliss, the weather may be the reason for their existence or to be something that they missed, or, even more sinister, the weather can be something that the system itself hides from them. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the most interesting aspect of this film, I believe, is the fact that he attacks this natural coercion to dissect the world around us, casting doubt on this by our personal judgment, and usually condemning it, because it does not serve us better, because it is not made specifically for us as a person. <br /> <br /> The symbolism behind the railway accident, I believe, suggests that our own will can be defeated by fate or some other universal great power, even in the face of our so-called power, to decide when we we want to go out. Instead, man is fired by this greater force (let's call it SYSTEM, because the authors clearly avoid calling it GOD, perhaps emphasizing once again that the SYSTEM is made by man and therefore can be mastered by man, unlike FATE, which is a concept that closer to religion) on with They are their own conditions, not killing him, but showing him that there is a place for a person who asks / wants too much, suggesting that true satisfaction does not come from the outside world, but from the inside, and if the outside world “decides” to provide you have some comfort, you must learn to accept it, without questioning the structure of each of its small aspects. <br /> <br /> Inconvenient, but it forces you to overestimate some existential issues that have become mainstream in the last century, for example, what a person can do in a world that is increasingly depleted from essence in a consumer-oriented world in which can be interchanged without changing the overall picture, but only as long as it is useful for the system.
