I have been away from Istanbul for the past 10 years. During this time, I constantly lived in London. When I watched the movie, I realized how I was Istanbul. I'm not just from Turkey, I'm part of Turkey. One of my parts is Istanbul, the sound of Istanbul, residents of Istanbul. <br /> <br /> Faith Akin probably thought he made a great musical documentary, but I have to say that itâ€™s something more. The point is to put an excellent mix of completely different music, cultures, approaches, politics, ethnic groups in a delightful pot ... <br /> <br /> As we all know, Turkey, to be precise, Istanbul always comes and goes between the east or the western city. As one of the band members said, Istanbul is a bicultural city. But much more eastern city, because we have always tried to be a western city. This shows that we have never been like that. <br /> <br /> This film will be viewed from the first second. The music is great, people are great. Especially Ainur and Sezen Aksu. Singers, band members! Nice to see you all in a small cinema in Wood Green.
