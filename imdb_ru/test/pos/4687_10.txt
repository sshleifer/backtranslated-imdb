I watched this show on PBS back in the eighties and still watch the old tapes every couple of years or so. Very atmospheric and creepy sometimes. This is a very good show, as all the characters are clearly defined and act. You are drawn into the plot and have come to take care of these people. The villains are almost ridiculously evil, especially the sheriff of Nottingham. Dude, I'd love to knock out that snotty little bastard. Nicholas Grace does an excellent job with his job and must have had a great time being a sheriff. His whipping boy, Sir Guy, is no less hissing, but pitiful. In this series, many murders and riots, as well as tons of black magic, devil worship and the like. I noticed that I received an award for children's television, which is amazing. If I had children, I would not let them watch it. Outstanding use of seats in this show also. It's on DVD now, so go buy it.
