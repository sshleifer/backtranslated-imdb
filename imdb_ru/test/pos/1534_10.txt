Even the trailer for this movie makes me cry like the first time I saw this movie. Not for people who are easily frustrated by intense stuff! The best performances of Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe, without a doubt. This horrible story about a society that has the power to kidnap and torture its citizens for ANY reason, whether an anarchist or author of children's books, will terrify you I saw it when it first came out in 1991, and I remember every frame. It still scares me today. It is happening now. <br /> <br /> Apparently, IMDb requires ten lines to meet their criteria for a film review. IMDb may want to get a GRIP! Some of us are more laconic in writing opinions.
