David Suchet is a mustache detective Agatha Christie Hercule Poirot in the film After the Funeral, released in 2005. Anyone who has heard David Suchet speak with his own British accent knows what a shock it is, because his accent like Poirot is so perfect and organic for character. Suchet - Poirot from Agatha Christie's books, and although I confess my love for Pyotr Ustinov in this role, his image has nothing to do with what Christie wrote. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Poirot's lawyerâ€™s friend asks to investigate the possible killing of one of his clients. On the train, a lawyer talks about the events after death - a strange testament deprives the heir of the expected heir and announces the murder of this man's sister. When Poirot meets a family, he discovers adultery, a lot of secrets, another will and murder. <br /> <br /> The story is excellent, with rich production value and an excellent, detailed description of the time period. All acting skills are great, especially from Monica Dolan, who plays Miss Gilchrist. Poirot is here without Hastings, his beautiful office or Miss Lemon, but, nevertheless, he is effective. <br /> <br /> I had the honor of seeing David Suchet on Broadway at Amadeus. Breathtaking. What actor - when he plays Poirot, I only see Poirot.
