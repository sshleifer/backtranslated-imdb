What do you get when you have a tenacious, experienced French police inspector named Maurice Martino who is called to investigate a murder case? Well, just a very interesting, funny movie. The re-created black-and-white film “Quai des Orfevres” delivers the goods, despite the romance, jealousy and marriage, which seem to interfere with the truth of “who did this?” <br /> <br /> Inch by inch, technique by technique, seasoned with experience and intuition, the patience of this master inspector cuts into the truth - but, of course, with a bag full of dirty police interrogation tricks. <br /> <br /> Martino is the centerpiece of this film. The use of hoarse background music by director Henri-Georges Clouzot to enhance drama in the style of a grand film noir is an excellent wrapper for visual experience. <br /> <br /> Martino finally unravels the mystery and arrests the criminal. Hey, he is good !! But, alas, Martino can also keep a dark secret in his past. Who is this boy who may not be his son? <br /> <br /> Some things can never be solved - even beyond the closing credits.
