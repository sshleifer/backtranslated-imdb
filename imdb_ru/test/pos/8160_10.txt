Back in 1982, a small film called “MAKE LOVE” shook the audience with its frank and open image of the romantic love story that just happened, about two men. <br /> <br /> For years I have been waiting for a good, old - fashionable romance between two men; LAST DAYS - all this and more. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is soapy, melodramatic, cliché and rather banal. That's what makes it so wonderful. Nothing beats a good romantic film, and this film is romantic in the best sense of the word. <br /> <br /> Regarding religion, sorry guys, but such things happen and happen to gays. people even now. Not only the Mormon church rejects its gays. Gays in every religion faced severe condemnation and rejection. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie. It ideally combines a fantasy novel based on the reality of the daily life of the characters. If I could give him more than ten stars, I would. Good love stories never go out of style; Great love stories such as LAST DAYS are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It's about time!
