This film may seem boring to some people, but I find this film very interesting in terms of trying to unveil the tradition. <br /> <br /> Director Lim made two films about traditional music in Korea before this film. Before this film, music was shown throughout the entire film, and this film tries to achieve similar results by creating a background in the film, as in the film. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that the story is written by both the director and the philosopher Kim, a famous scientist in Korea (he has many degrees, including a doctor in Havard), I do not say that educated people do films, but this philosopher is an expert on traditional culture in Korea, so it gives more credit for this film.
