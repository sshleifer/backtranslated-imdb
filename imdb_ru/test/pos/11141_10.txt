I loved this movie because Bobby Phillips can really fight! I always hate it when the actors are not believable in the roles. It was nice to see, no offense, but a WOMAN who knows how to skillfully perform martial arts and fight. If you compare this with most militants with women, you will definitely understand what I mean. They do not need to cut frames with someone who can fight, and it flows better. I was very impressed. I hope this is not all!
