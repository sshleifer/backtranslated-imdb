It should be the best movie of all time (in my opinion). It really taught me, when I observed, when I was 10 years old (in 2000), that the freedom of a childâ€™s existence eludes us earlier than we expect. Joseph Mazzello is also supposed to be my favorite actor, and I think that he and Elijah Wood did an excellent job with the role of the brothers. This film is rather sad, and some people do not understand the ending. But the story itself is absolutely unbelievable, the thought that a poor 7-year-old boy (Bobby) can insult a drunk stepfather is terrible, and what these two boys do about it is sad and important. My favorite part of the film is when Tom Hanks (the elder Mike) lists 7 things that were children that were lost to the adult world. However, there are some roles that could be done better in this film, such as casting a mother (Lorraine Braco), which, I think, is a terrible actor. "King" played a good role, because it is a difficult role. Joseph and Elijah were definitely the stars of the film. I could not believe how well they were the victims of a cruel stepfather, being at the age at which they were (7 and 9 years old). But overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves wonderful children's actors and a great movie. :)
