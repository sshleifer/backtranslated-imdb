In general, an excellent film of the time and source (from Warner Brothers, since it was at the peak of skill and style shortly before World War II), provided that you do not take it seriously at all. The film really does not claim to historical accuracy and, of course, is no more or less accurate or believable than, say, JFK. (In fact, this may be more honest in this regard, since, in fact, he recognizes that this should not be taken as fact-based, but rather as a stylish semi-heroic image.) It is worth noting that the audience was no more naive in stories than we are today; The NY Times review acknowledged that viewers “would reject the factual inaccuracies scattered throughout the film,” described the biographical report on Custer’s life as “bizarre” and indicated that the presentation of Custer’s motivations regarding recent events contradicted various historical reports. could have gone overboard in the creation of Custer, but they perfectly managed to portray him not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around, but appropriately resolute, principled and inspiring. <br /> <br /> Flynn and DeHavilland, shooting their eighth film together for 7 years (and the last), feel so comfortable and play up to each other so easily that it is not so difficult not to notice how subtly their courtship is written. At the first connection, it would be difficult to imagine what Elizabeth really could bring to Custer, but these two make her work. The film also lacks their director from their previous seven films (greatly misunderstood Michael Curtis), but given that he worked with them on the similar theme of the Santa Fe Trail the previous year, it is understandable if he decides to abandon it alone. (They all started together with “Captain Blood” and “Light Brigade Brigade” - both are awesome - so we can't blame them if it became hard for them to keep it all fresh.) <br /> <br /> Raul Walsh the director here, certainly more comfortable with action sequences - which are outstanding - and everything else outdoors. The interior scenes are a bit more uneven, but the studio's masters manage to compensate for this very well, as well as the outstanding cast of Warner Bros “ordinary suspects” and new faces (Green Street, Jean Lockhart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc.), I would like more if Kennedy's character was a bit less standard (I usually like his work), but here he seems to beat about the same notes in each scene; this part could have been better written - and I believe that they could not have been sure about what he could handle, since he had been filming films for only one year (Walsh probably took it for that after the joint “High Sierras "). <br /> <br /> The various highlights include the description (probably imaginary) of the origin of “Garryowen” as a cavalry subject. The last half hour is especially outstanding, especially with the parting of the presenters repeating the end of their on-screen partnership, followed by the latest battle scenes. A thoroughly inspiring adventure. <br /> <br /> 8 of 10
