Imagine a world in which everyone treats someone well, not a single bad word has been spoken, there are no office disputes, and your boss regularly invites the office crowd for homemade dinners where you can talk about the latest styles of interior design. All neat, nice - well, just nice. In other words: you are in hell. In the mid-thirties, Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag), left off the beaten path, begins a new job as an accountant in a small, clean city. From the very beginning he feels like a stranger in this own impersonal world of superficial kindness, surrounded by pleasant but lifeless inner architecture and similar colleagues. Food tastes nothing, drinks do not get drunk, there are no children anywhere; after the initial steps of inscribing, Andreas is looking for ways to escape the soft new world. He no longer knows where he came from, but he still remembers rich tastes, real feelings â€” everything that is not an obligatory flat life that he leads now. SOUL PERSON resonates with the ideas of Huxley and Kafka, but here cruelty is omnipresent incompetent accuracy. Unlike PLEASANTVILLE, this is not about narrow-minded fanaticism, but rather about the fable of our urban civilization of the free world. This is most reminiscent of the ingenious scene of FIGHT CLUB, in which Edward Norton walks through the catalog of mocking IKEA. Spiced with eerie humor, this Scandinavian laconic tale convinces at all levels: history, characters and relevance. A real gem of the screen. 8/10
