Well, I'm not fooling myself that this is a typical gay love, but since when are direct romances in real life as they are on the screen? This film is well balanced with comedy and drama, and I really enjoyed it. It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving playing a sex-obsessed gay property trader who uses his clients' homes to meet his flaming Darren (Tom Hollander). And, having seen him in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, only the day before, he is probably one of the most reliable actors of masculinity. :) In any case, the plot flowed smoothly, and the scenes with the participation of men were noise. Thumbs up! 8/10
