I never saw any of John Leguizamo’s speeches until I watched Freak, and after seeing him again recently in the HBO comedy, it was better, more animated and with things that at 14 I couldn’t understand earlier. Spike Lee did an excellent job of directing, maintaining the visual angle at the level of Leguizamo’s theatrical presentation and personal storytelling style; This is the essence and style, merging together, but unobtrusively. We get Leguizamo's excitement about race and sex (the bits about sex are classic), but a lot of this is connected with the family, and what is still fresh in my memory is about his father. Even when it gets dark in some stories, there is something fresh, crazy or random that the Leguizamo pulls out to laugh and it works more often than not. If something does not work (for me, anyway), it can be his personal tics here and there. But in general, this is the fun stuff that is not rash, but so true in itself that it burns. Find it if you can!
