Anyone who spent time working in a hospital or medical facility should rate this film. The plot is absolutely wild, but interesting from beginning to end. The game is great. George S. Scott is a wonderful doctor, but a class A loser like husband, father. Diane Riggs, sex symbol of the 1960s and 1970s (The Avengers), saves him from himself. The surrounding cast is excellent and the dialogue is quite interesting. I think I liked the movie more when watching 4, 5. or 6th. time, because I caught a lot more wealth of dialogue and interaction of characters. Worth seeing again and again. You just do not want to register at the hospital in the near future.
