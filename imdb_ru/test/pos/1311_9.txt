I originally saw it on channel 4 (UK), and it was a fantastic film that made a huge impression on me. However, I recently saw it on Irish television, and Roy Shader added a story (“we will need a bigger boat!”). It ruined the movie for me. His buzzing monologue adds absolutely nothing to the film, and if it takes anything from the brilliance of the films. Interestingly, the new version of the DVD, in which there is no Roy (for legal reasons?), Would prevent people from buying it. Well, believe me, the movie is much better for him! <br /> <br /> Greetings <br /> <br /> Damien
