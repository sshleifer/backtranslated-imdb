A pivot line is some kind of male dream about an ideal woman ...; o) Seriously, let us return to the film on which classic cinema is written (pun intended and literally shown in the picture, as you see)! <br /> <br /> How could someone make a silent movie this year and age? It's not quite quiet this time (take music, for example). With great cinematography this is the answer. And it is not surprising that he won prizes (as stated by another user) in this area! But sometimes it is a fall. Despite the fact that the pictures are great, sometimes they have too much time instead of moving forward (plot and time). If you cope with it, you will enjoy it even more than me. I have not told you anything about this story, but I will never do it, because I do not want to spoil anything for you ...
