Spoiler alert <br /> <br /> I have never seen movie comments that I disagree with more than comments from people about this. You can learn from the critical views of this film. As an educational film, I appreciate it because it teaches how to succeed! We do not watch films to learn; we generally look for fun. As entertainment, I rate it low: the ending is sad and cerebral and intellectual. This conflict leads to my eight star rating. The film is about Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The head of the network is Tom Grünick (William Hurt), who is preparing for a role on the air. Tom immediately enchants people with humility. Another potential news presenter had been waiting for him on the air for years, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all the news, both inside and out. <br /> <br /> The Network Manager wants Grünik to be on the air, and Jane claims that Grünik is not ready, he does not know the news. They do not listen to her. Forced to put Grünick on the air, Jane contacts Altman to get information about the news, and transmits Altman’s comments through the speaker to tell Grünick while Grünik speaks. We see a sharp contrast between the words of Altman / Jane Craig and the words of Grunnik, when Grunnik skillfully rewrites everything that Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear to make it understandable, pleasant and interesting to the public. Altman gets a chance on the air, and network managers demand that he turn to a coach for Grünick, a new guy. Is this new (newbie) guy training him? This is what Altman does not see justified, but reluctantly agrees. <br /> <br /> Grunnick coached Altman and worried, noting Altman’s flaws in appearance, audio and vocabulary. Altman never thought about it before when he became an expert in the news itself. The difficulty of understanding what Grünik taught him causes Altman to panic sweat (“Flop Pot”) when he is on the air. Grunnick eventually becomes the main anchor of the network, and Altman resigns before being dismissed. But Grunnick fails in his attempt at romance with Jane Craig because she learns from Altman that Grunnick sometimes forges circumstances to make people like him. It distracts her from him. This sends the message that in a relationship we want people to be sincere and not try to make us like them. <br /> <br /> This film says that attracting people to you is the most important skill at work, but this is especially true in the news. There are a lot of people commenting on how stunning TV news is and how Grunnick represents a cute but stupid guy or an entire style but not a creature. The opposite is true, Grünick had skills and a very complex intellect to make people like him, including the presence of mind, to know exactly how he looks and sounds when he is in front of the camera (he trains Altman to strike a word in each sentence). Grunnik’s disadvantage, which costs him in a relationship with Jane Craig, is that he is too obsessed with the idea and will pretend that the situation will suit him. Many people call Altman very clever or brilliant. Altman, played by Brooks, is not as clever as Grünick, and the Pot Flop scene shows that his mind could not cope with the difficulty Grünick copes with on the air. Altman is outraged by the fact that he knew the news, and Grünnik succeeded more, forcing people to love him. There are also people who comment that these things are exclusive to the television news industry. The concept that winning friends is the most important skill at work is obviously not popular, but my experience shows that this is true for most jobs. Like a movie about how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, albeit unpopular. Educational, yes, but it doesn't have an inspiring ending.
