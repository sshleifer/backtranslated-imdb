The cage fascinated me at first sight. I was a little surprised by this fact, because the story of this film is absolutely boring. If there were no history, the film would be better. Bunuels "Un chien andalou" comes to my mind - a film with no history, but also with exciting and sometimes disturbing images. But THE CELL is, firstly, a Hollywood film, and secondly, a work of art. I am very interested in the next project Tarsema. Indian hamlet can be very interesting, especially if it looks the same as THE CELL. <br /> <br /> For cinema music lovers: Howard Shore's score for THE CELL is absolutely amazing, but due to the complex listening his very modernist style.
