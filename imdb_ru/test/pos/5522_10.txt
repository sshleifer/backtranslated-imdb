Abe Zwick beautifully honed one-time. He never made another film, but in this film he created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self-hatred, which is both acrid and spectacular. He commands the screen, presenting the crumbling debris of a man collapsing under the onslaught of an increasingly meaningless life. <br /> <br /> Paul (Zwick) is an aging queen who somehow convinced Stanley (Wayne Crawford), a cross-eyed idiot who has no sense in the future, to follow her star. He is a petty thief, lately boiling hate. He was forced to miss the city and move to a suburb of Miami. As a disguise, he dresses as a dried up old blue stocking with the same violent sexual torment as the church lady. He tells Stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his "Aunt Martha." Paul himself has no friends, he spends too much time alone in the house, and he has to deal with the depraved lifestyle of Stanley. That would be enough for anyone to cross the line into transgender suicidal mania. <br /> <br /> Again, Zwick portrays Paul as a tragic figure who completely lost her understanding of how to relate to other people. However, there is a certain poetry in his throes that slowly burns throughout the film. He is tragic, but elegant. In the end, this is a very sad movie. He, of course, has a lot of funny moments, but there is such a surge of hopelessness and despair that the humor is bitter-sweet. This film is worth a look at Abe Zwick's performance. He could really build his career on Martha. She is real gas as soon as you meet her. Just make sure you cut your hair and stop fooling around. She really hates it!
