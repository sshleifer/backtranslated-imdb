"Egyptian" occurs during the reign of one of the most amazing figures of the ancient world, the pharaoh Akhnaton, who thirteen centuries before Christ attempted to introduce the monotheistic religion of Atenism in ancient Egypt. The main character, however, is not Akhnaton, but a fictional sinuhe. In childhood, Sinuhe mysteriously floated in a basket along the Nile River and was adopted by the doctor Senmut and his wife. When he reaches maturity, he follows his adoptive father into the medical profession, initially working (like his father) among the poor of the city, but he becomes famous after he and his friend, the ambitious young soldier Horemheb, save Pharaoh’s life during hunting expedition in the desert. Sinuha is appointed court physician, but becomes obsessed with the Babylonian courtesan Nefer. Sinuhe not only destroys himself in a vain attempt to win her love, but also is dishonored when his neglect of his duties means that he cannot save the life of Akhnaton's daughter. <br /> <br /> Sinuha flees into exile, where he succeeds as a healer in neighboring countries, but returns to Egypt when he finds out about the Hittite plot to invade. Although Akhnaton readily forgives him for his previous crimes, Sinuha finds the country in turmoil. Attempts by Pharaoh to introduce a new religion led to feuds between his followers and the priests of the old polytheistic faith, and he is by nature too quiet to take any steps to counter the Hittite threat. Sinuha turns out to be drawn into the conspiracy of Horemheb, now a general of the Egyptian army, and Ahnaton’s sister, Princess Bucketmon, about the overthrow of Pharaoh and replacing him with a more effective monarch. <br /> <br /> The film’s weaknesses are mainly due to its two romantic plots. During the film, Sinuha is revealed as the long-lost son of the previous pharaoh and stepbrother of Akhnaton and Buketamon. Therefore, a modern audience may be surprised that it falls in love with it; the marriage between brothers and sisters was not necessarily considered incestuous by the standards of the Egyptian royal family, but the standards of the cinematic audience of the 1950s were generally less liberal in this respect. In any case, the Horemheb-Buketmon-Sinuhe love triangle is an unnecessary complication and diminishes the role of Bucketmon in the film, that is, the voice of cold eyes, the cynical Realpolitik. <br /> <br /> Nefer's sub-item, which takes up most of the first hour of the film, is rewritten and over-melodramatic. Nefer is useless from a moral point of view, but fascinating, and for this role an actress of great beauty and great drama was needed to make her trustworthy, especially since Nefer copes with the difficult task of winning back Sinuha from such a beautiful woman like Gene Simmons plays Merit, rival sinuhe for her affection). Therefore, it is regrettable that the role went to an equally comically inept actress as Bella Darvi, whose only qualification was that she was the mistress of producer Darryl F. Zanuka. Darvi was not only a wooden actress, but also spoke with a strong foreign accent, made even more incomprehensible because of the noise. She was not even particularly attractive compared to the two legendary Hollywood beauties in the film, Simmons and Gene Tierney, who plays Buckethamon. <br /> <br /> A film is better when it focuses on its main political and religious themes. Other actors are better than Darvi, although Pyotr Ustinov, as a servant of Sinuha, Kapta, makes the same mistake as in Spartacus - trying to bring comic relief to a film that he does not need. In any case, his voice was too patrician for the role of "comic servant." <br /> <br /> Little-known British actor Edmund Purdom was forced to play a major role when Marlon Brando left the game at the last minute. , but more than adequately fills the shoes of a great man, although his style of play was very different. He copes well with the task of showing changes in the character of Sinuha, from a non-mundane idealist, to an insane sick fool, an angry cynic and an enlightened seer of the final scenes. Victor Matrei was never the most expressive actor, but he is well suited to the role of Horemheb, a practical, practical person of action. Here he is better than in his other epic in 1954, "Demetrius and the Gladiators." Simmons is as luminous as Merit. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding (hitherto known to me as the second Mr. Elizabeth Taylor) plays Ahnaton as a potential philosopher-king, who ends up as a kind of holy fool. His inability to make difficult decisions makes him an unsuitable ruler, but he has a prophetic vision of peace and justice, which gives him a look of moral greatness far beyond those who hope to replace him with a throne. Although Aton has more in common with the Supreme Being of the Deists than with the Old Testament of Jehovah or the Trinitarian Christian God, there is a rather deliberate attempt to draw parallels between atanism and Christianity. In the film, the symbol of Athenism is “ankh”, chosen, no doubt, because of its similarity with the cross, but in fact it was an ordinary Egyptian hieroglyph for life, and not unique to Athenism. The Achnaton language often has a biblical sound; his comparison of himself with the “whistle of the wind in the desert” recalls “the voice of John the Baptist weeping in the desert” (hence the name of this review). The finding of Xinuha in the river is parallel to the Old Testament history of Moses. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Xinuhe, who became the heir to the spirit of the dead Ahnaton, reaches his own moral greatness. The essence of the film is that, although we may need practical action people, such as Horemheb, we also need dreamers and thinkers who are ready to ask the question “why?” Despite all its shortcomings, “Egyptian” is an idealistic and humane film in respect of religion and politics. 7/10
