"STEP BY STEP", in my opinion, is a clean blow ABC! I can't remember every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when an accident happened at school. I always laugh at this. In fact, I think almost every one of J.T. (Brandon Coll) and Cody (Sasha Mitchell) were funny. It would be nice if Penny (Patrick Darbo) stayed on the show for the entire run. Everyone always gave a good presentation, the design of the production was impressive, the costumes were well thought out, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope that this will never stop broadcasting in syndication.
