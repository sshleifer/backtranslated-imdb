Lights of New York became the first publicly available feature film. It was, of course, The Jazz Singer, released in October 1927 as the first feature film, incorporating synchronized dialogue. However, this film, released in July 1928, practically does not remember its place in the history of cinema. It began as a short one, but gradually more was added, until - not having come after 58 minutes - it accidentally became the first publicly available feature film. It opened for the mill and, to the surprise of Warner Bros., made over a million dollars. It was good money back in 1928. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple. Two village barbers are naively buying at a hairdresser on Broadway, which looks like the gangster Hawk. When they find out the truth, they cannot afford to get out, because the younger hairdresser, Eddie, tied all the money to his mother in place. Kitty is the girlfriend of a young hairdresser, and the gangster Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) has a desire to turn his older girlfriend (Gladys Brockwell) into a newer model, the chorister Kitty (Helen Costello). A policeman is killed while trying to prevent the Hawk people from unloading a batch of liquor, and Hawk sees this as an opportunity to substitute Eddie, thus getting Kitty for himself. <br /> <br /> This early phrasebook is a load of fun for enthusiasts of these innovative works. Of course, the plot is elementary, and the dialogue is drowned out, but there is something that you don’t see in early conversations - background music score. The Vitafon was originally used for this purpose, and here they still use it for musical accompaniment along with dialogue. And there are singing and dancing numbers! Hawk nightclub scenes are used as an opportunity to show what movies could never do before - musical numbers. There is even a presenter with wild eyes, with some kind of heavy makeup left over from a silent era, which is very interesting. <br /> <br /> At this moment, the Vitafon could not go out because of static booths with cameras, so the scene in the park between two lovers Eddie and Kitty is modeled - and cheap. Greenery looks like something from the Ed Wood movie or, perhaps, from the school play "Our City". <br /> <br /> Gladys Brockwell, Hawk's ex-girlfriend, strikes with her own blow. She is a real soldier, considering which lines she should bring. Hawk - "So you think that you can take any chicken and throw me back into the deck!". BUT? mixed metaphors anyone? And then there are her last lines: “I lived, and I loved, and I lost!” Did someone pay to write this dialogue? Brockwell achieved great success in her career as a radio station after she won a victory in silent films (an evil sister in “The Seventh Heaven”), when a fatal car accident ended her career. <br /> <br /> Then Eugene Palette is the oldest of two hairdressers in our history. His froggy voice, natural line drawing and good looks gave him a long career as an actor character, usually appearing as a dressed family man / businessman with a rough appearance and a heart of gold. In fact, Mr. Palatt is the only member of this lineup who still has a significant career in films just three years after the release of this film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the question arises: “Where is this microphone hidden? ? ”The microphones were still motionless, and it was interesting to find out where they had hidden them. However, there is one famous scene where everyone can figure it out. Hawk, in his office, talks to his two minions, who seem to understand as slowly as they do about how to "take Eddie for a walk." If you watch this scene, you would swear that the phone on the table is a character in this film. This is the front and center throughout the conversation. Most likely, a microphone is installed in the phone. <br /> <br /> Something heroic in these pioneers, blinded in the face of new sound technology. You have silent actors who are used to using pantomime to express, Vaudeville who know how to play with a live audience, but don’t know how to make the same impression on a Vitaphone camera, and you have dialogue authors trying to write a conversation as compactly as they made title cards or filled movies with endless chatter. <br /> <br /> Check it out. It's not boring, moving fast and giving you a lot of fun if you know what to look for. And no, I do not expect it to ever appear on Blu-Ray, but I hope that the guys from Warner Brothers will soon add it to the Warner Archive so that everyone can see it.
