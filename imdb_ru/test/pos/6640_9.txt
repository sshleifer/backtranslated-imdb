This is one of the darkest, most heartbreaking Bergman films I've ever seen. I also think that this is one of the most powerful films about the ugliness of war and what it does with human souls. <br /> <br /> A pair of musicians who left a large city on a remote island and did as farmers live, find themselves capable of inexpressible and shameful acts that they usually couldnâ€™t even imagine as they struggle to survive in the terrible reality of war. They betray their souls, their friends, and even each other in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day. Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow, as usual, are magnificent, like lost, confused and frightened couples who fell in the midst of civil war. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
