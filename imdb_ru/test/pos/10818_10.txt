I saw Bon Voyage 2 days ago, and I found this a great production. The film must entertain, and it does! He imitates the style of American comic comedies of the 30s, but Von Voyage is more refined. Ajani and Depardieu are great in their roles. The plot is simple. The film begins with people involved in many situations that obviously should not have anything in common between them. It is very funny how these situations become related during the movie. Nice to see a French movie with such a sense of humor. I consider it mainly a film in which love is the main theme. Peter Coyote as a German spy in France once again proves himself an excellent actor.
