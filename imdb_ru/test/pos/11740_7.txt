After many, many years, I saw this beautiful love story again, thinking about how I, half a century later, reacted to a film that made so many girls cry and sigh while I was just a male teenager, trying to understand female behavior in a small city in Brazil. <br /> <br /> This time my attention was attracted by something completely different in the film, namely the perseverance with which doctor Dr. Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) explains to journalist Mark Elliott (William Holden) her particular ethical state as a Eurasian. In fact, she constantly emphasizes this moment in their relationship, repeating that she is ready to accept her love for him and continue her “in a random way”, provided that she does not betray her Chinese side. It seems to the viewer that Suyin with she is enthusiastically making efforts to establish a very fine reconciliation between these two unstable and opposing aspects of her culture, as they immediately enter into open conflict in her mind with minimal failure in her attempts to control them. <br /> <br /> Is Suyin's attitude always leaving poor Elliot? Resolute, courageous and extremely practical person ?? excited and puzzled, not knowing how important it is to attach to her words. For him, whose love for her is simple and clear, the situation is absolutely clear: if we love each other, let's make a couple and immediately start living together. “Not so fast,” it seems to her, verbally and non-verbally, “to answer him all the time. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Chinese part of Suyin will never allow such a level of pragmatism. And, while continuing to strengthen this multi-purpose balance between these two worlds within herself, she also often lets him know that a very specific feature of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind, namely, constant “attacks” on the real world by invisible people from the spiritual or non-physical world. For Suyin always warns Elliott about how dangerous life is, not because of any objective and specific threat (as would be perpetuation of English colonialism or the rise of the Japanese invasion), but because of the threats of a large number of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical creatures above poor, scared and vulnerable people. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems that a whole bunch of Chinese deities are constantly under surveillance to make people's lives completely unhappy. Because of this, mothers must dress their precious male children in girls' clothes so that jealous gods do not take them; everyone should always be ready to make loud noises in order to drive away the clouds so that they do not close when looking at the moon; peasants are advised to shout loudly: “Rice is bad! Bad rice! ”Protect your crops from being stolen by deities; and at the funeral it is recommended that the family of the dead be isolated from other people by curtains, so that the gods do not take advantage of their sadness and fragility. <br /> <br /> In other words, Suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural really exists, as if a rather alarming pantheon of evil and sadistic gods is always on the verge of negative interference with the most commonplace acts in one's daily life. <br /> <br /> Since the story unfolds in Hong Kong in 1949, it must be clear that China at that time was indeed an almost semi-feudal society, while in the country from which Elliott originated, cruel capitalism had not yet dominated. Launched by the United States after the first oil shock in 1973, claimed responsibility for the whole world. Therefore, at least in one aspect, both sides of Suyin's Eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today. <br /> <br /> A lot of stories originated from those ancient times. As for China, the main fact is that after several stages of the communist regime, the country in the last two decades has finally reached a state of very aggressive economy, much more accurately described as state capitalism. And what happened to that old spirituality that Suyin so fascinated in Hong Kong in 1949 and with which she impressed so passionately Elliot under that tree on the hill behind the hospital? It is gone, completely gone! In short, if this story happened today, Elliot would not have thought it necessary to go to China to make an offer to Suiyu in the presence of a Third Uncle and her entire family. In fact, both men would now be incomparably closer to each other, in their immense pragmatism, talking as usual!
