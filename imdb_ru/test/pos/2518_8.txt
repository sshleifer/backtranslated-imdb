The drive was a pleasant episode with a dark ending. In fact, a man and his wife are infected in the inner ear with a high sound wave emitted by some military equipment. Some of my favorite parts from this episode are Mulder's dialogue in the car, and the scene where Scully enters with the Hazmat team and finds a little old deaf lady completely unaffected by what they consider to be a virus. The end is certainly tragic in its realism, because it makes the viewer believe that he can really carry out this elaborate plan to save the victim, but when Mulder arrives, the person is already dead. 8/10
