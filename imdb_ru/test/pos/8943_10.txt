I think this film deserves 10 out of 10 because it is funny from beginning to end. The plot is simple and straightforward, but it makes you look, and there is so much laughter that you really love it. When I went to see this film, I almost heard nothing about it and did not know what to expect. I thought it would be a movie for older women, like “The Girls on the Calendar,” or something like that, but it took me by surprise. Despite the fact that I am still a teenager, and the film probably was not directed to my age group, I still found it excellent, and I think that people of all age groups will like it. I think it is a shame that he is not famous at all and deserves more publicity so that more people watch him and understand what a wonderful film this is.
