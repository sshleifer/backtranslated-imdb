The best screen performance ever by George Scott. Chaifsky’s script, an ironic dialogue, is almost perfect (“Where do you teach your nurses, Dachau?”). Rigg is beautiful as a saving angel who saves Scott from death, as does the whole cast. This is a fun and serious movie. This is a film from the 60s period, but it is in no sense dated. What it is, the chaos and irrationality of the system in comparison with human sanity, is timeless. And the monologue "We are not treating anything." We do not cure anything ”(delivered, actually shouted like no one else but Scott) with his references to cloning and other“ wonders ”of modern science could be literally written this morning. > <br />
