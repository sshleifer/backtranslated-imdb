It contains spoilers that I recorded some time ago when he was on PBS, but I never had the opportunity to watch it (probably because of the prejudice about having to sit in the 5-6 hours of the Masterpiece Theater with its BBC, created for TV production (no music, settings - all in the same room, no scenes in the street, the TV does not look ...)) But after watching the movie "Traffic Traffic" (which I then thought was pretty good), I could not dig up the Traffik tape , to see that otherwise they could stop at an extra 2.5 hours. <br /> <br /> Boy, my prejudices in this series were wrong. It is much more attractive than traffic. Characters become clearer to make their actions more believable. And the whole story with the participation of Pakistan completes the common point of view of all the participants in the entire supply chain, from the farmer to the final consumer. In "Traffic", the story of Pakistan was rewritten and reduced to the plot of "good cop versus bad cop." <br /> <br /> There were many more substantive discussions and debates about alcohol and other forms of drugs, whereas in “Traffic” they basically became passing references that do not matter. It is the same with social issues that were actually transmitted in Traffik without a sounding sermon. Whereas, in “Traffic,” the characters simply crossed it out as a statement, similar to the way they do it in Television's “Release of the Week” films. <br /> <br /> There was no bad guy against a good guy in Traffic, even the dealer is portrayed as an addict who sells to keep his habit, and not “nobody spoils me” in “Traffic”. <br /> <br /> The only negative side is that since I was watching “Traffic not long before watching this, it was difficult not to compare scene by scene, and although the scenes were not the same, I knew how will be the result. Thank God for the history of Pakistan, which is so different that it allowed me to fully enjoy it, without thinking with which scene it is compared. Although I was confused, thinking that the drugs were merged with the ceramics of the statues in which Helen brought back to Germany (as in the story "Road traffic"). Thank God that Traffic was not so far-fetched and contrived.
