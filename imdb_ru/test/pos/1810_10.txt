What can I say?? This film has everything ... Romance, separation, rich children, punks and readiness. This is my favorite movie ever, which I can list in turn. I remember when he first came out, I was 14 years old, and I could not get in ... so, finally, I saw him by cable ... I got hooked! I wanted to move to California and become a girl from the Valley ... (Hey, I even remember the song Moon Zappa, isnâ€™t it?) Tried to get a never-produced soundtrack for years in vain ... now you can find it on rhino records ....
