Victor Shstrem was a real master in this film, starring in it, shot it and even wrote the script! This is pretty amazing. Although few people today know who the Sixers are, he may be familiar to Ingmar Bergman’s fans as the star of one of Bergman’s most famous films, WILD STRAWBERRIES. <br /> <br /> As for this film, it is a very mixed bag. On the one hand, you must respect this, because for 1921 it is a very good film. The idea of ​​the Grim Reaper sitting with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is quite original. Plus, the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is pretty convincing, and technically speaking, this is a well-researched film. On the other hand, this is an amazingly outdated and preaching film - more like what you expect to show in Sunday school, and not in the theater of honest goodness. In addition, some elements of the story simply do not make sense. Instead of being faithful or kind, the dying employee of the Salvation Army looks like juice - a very sad and confusing juice. Why is she "in love" with this man? Did I miss something? <br /> <br /> So, I recommend that if you are madly in love with silence (like me), be sure to look at it. But, if you're not a silent fan, this film can do nothing to convince you that this style of film is great because the story is too melodramatic and outdated.
