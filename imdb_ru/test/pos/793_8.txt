Not all, but most of this story is that Buster is mistaken for Dead Shot Dan, a famous criminal. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is no story, just a series of adventures to show Buster’s amazing physical talents and his comedy time. The 27-minute film is, in fact, one adventure after another, in which someone who is pursuing our hero is involved. <br /> <br /> In the past, a couple of policemen chased the streets after Keaton, and later it was Big Joe Roberts, a useless cop — and the father Buster was interested in — who was stalking him. These last scenes were the best, as I thought, with a lot of tricky jokes related to the elevator of the hotel where Big Joe and his daughter live. It was Keaton at his best. <br /> <br /> This is just a crazy half hour, which makes little sense but cares? This Buster is at or near his best farce, and this serves his purpose: to entertain us. Just think: 85 years after this film was shot, there are people (like me) who are still discovering and enjoying this quiet comedy classic! Great!
