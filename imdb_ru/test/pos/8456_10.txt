When CHINA SYNDROME was released, many right-wing critics and supporters of nuclear weapons exploded this film, especially since all three of its top stars were known for their liberal policies and clear distrust of nuclear energy. But it took only two weeks and an almost catastrophic crash on Three Mile Island to silence these critics. <br /> <br /> Fonda and Douglas is a Los Angeles news team that witnesses a potentially unpleasant accident at the Ventana nuclear power plant; Douglas shoots an event through the soundproof glass factory; but the channel will not broadcast the footage, for fear of a mass trial. Thus, it is up to the Foundations and Douglas to find out the truth, despite the massive attempt by the plant owners to cover the accident. <br /> <br /> But the conscientious shift manager (Jack Lemmon) found some flaws in the pump support structure. He believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that, although the repair would be costly and lengthy, if the repair is not performed, the next accident may be apocalyptic. But he cannot make anyone who works with him believe in his story. The result is a nightmarish climax that unites various political, technological and human stories into a single alarming package. <br /> <br /> Despite being politically liberal in nature, the CHINA SYNDROME, well managed and co-author of James Bridges (“Chasing Paper”), is also a film that tells about the dangers combining technology and nuclear energy. In fact, nuclear power can NEVER be made safe, because people can NEVER be perfect. This is what the film says; and very interesting and stressful, it says it brilliantly.
