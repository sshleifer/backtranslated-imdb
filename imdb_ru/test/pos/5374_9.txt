The 70s were a great time for horror films. The brotherhood of Satan is another forgotten gem. It is full to the brim with big surrealistic, disturbing scenes. Also nice to see Stoter Martin and L.Q. Jones (who also produced) in decent roles. <br /> <br /> Some of them are a bit outdated and stupid, but the Brotherhood of Satan is straining at the Devil Race and many other 70s Satanic films.
