This is one of the funniest films I've seen in recent years. I watched for about 20 minutes, slightly puzzled by what was happening. Then I started laughing and did not stop until the film ended. Such a deadpan satire is really rare. Christopher Gest perfectly understands the humor peculiar to those who have no sense of humor about themselves (for a start, about 90% of white heterosexual men). As in “Waiting for Guffman,” the Guest nails the idiotic self-esteem of Central America to the wall. I can't wait for his next movie.
