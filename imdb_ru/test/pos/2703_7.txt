Yes, this is one of the best television films, and I would not expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a big fan of The Carpenters, I had to sing all of their material in the choir of elementary and middle school, and I did most of the solo material Karen sang. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70s — and as a child / teenager singing these songs and studying music — the only thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman. I never received, she died three weeks before it was supposed to happen. And yes, it impressed me because I did not know anything about anorexia - and I could not fully understand what had happened. <br /> <br /> When this television film appeared, I had a complete understanding. Perhaps not everything in Karen and Richard's life is open to a television audience, but, opening the roles that I was shown, I understood a lot from the music industry of that time. What upsets me is that I write “at that time” and see “now.” Nobody learned the damn thing, although it was a very informative and soulful look at the problems of the family in the music industry. <br /> <br /> These films are not made for fun, but in order to open the door and show us something. Here was a wonderful woman who was fascinated by the idea that her talent was based on weight. She was fine. She did not know this. She received mixed messages about her weight from her brother, whom she loved, the parents she loved, and the music industry, which cared more about her appearance / weight than about the talent inside. With the advent of MTV, it got worse. With “American Idol,” it looks like a decay with an English accent. <br /> <br /> A great TV movie, I’m sure that someone can later give him an HBO treatment, but in any case, a lot of lessons and the absence of another great talent.
