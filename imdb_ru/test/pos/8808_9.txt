I remember the time when there was only one thing that existed when there were clubs, pubs with drugs and parties. This film came out a couple of years after I started playing clubs. If I had never discovered the more attractive side of things, this film might not have made sense to me. That night, when I watched it for the first time with a few friends, I was completely shocked. I have never watched a movie that is so close to the reality I was in in my life. Almost everything I could relate to in some way. There was never one character to whom I could fully relate, but more was a combination of all of them anyway. My comrades, where nothing is different, and I remember how we all said that they, where we or we, where they are. We all went together this weekend, doing what the team at HT does. We went down when we watched, and when the movie “got off,” I remember that I actually went down a little further. in fact it was rather dull in our room during these "low points". That's what's good about human trafficking. he really touches the whole situation. <br /> <br /> This is a unique film, not based on the plot, but not completely controlled by the character, although the characters are important. it seemed to be always based on situations. Situations of both groups and individuals. Each character is lost in life for their own reasons. yet each of them responds to the loss in the same way. work any kind of work to make money, to pay for the weekend and avoid it all. for them it is their holiday. But the reality is that you cannot truly escape. Another situation that they all have to face. <br /> <br /> My friends and I are no different from these guys. We all had our own things. Human trafficking helped us explain that we did not understand about ourselves. He does it so as not to talk to you. It made us feel that we were not the only ones like us, and that the lessons learned went through what many others from around the world had gone through. only when my lifestyle changed from a popper party to a career, did I fully understand this movie. these days I watch HT from time to time (as I just had), and remember the old days. No other movie can do this. I was Peter Popper, I was Jeep Travolta, I went to never land with my chosen family. I would have $ 200 in my background, and I waxed a lot! Do not worry!
