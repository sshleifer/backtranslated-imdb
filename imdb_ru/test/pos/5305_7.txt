As a longtime fan of the Ghibli studio and especially the Hayao Miyazaki films, I went to the film right on the opening day. When I left the theater, I had a strange feeling that something was missing, this “magical” feeling that I had experienced in all Miyazaki films before, but I could not say why it was not possible this time. After thinking about other Ghibli films, I can know the reason: this movie had most of the elements of the great Miyazaki anime: cute characters, great key animation, a great soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi, and a warm story that gives you the feeling of watching quality Japanese animated film. However, two elements were missing: deep history and dramaturgy. Obviously, the purpose of this film was to entertain young children with a simple storyline, as in the case of Totoro, so the complex story told in Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke is not really needed, but On the other hand, this story was simply too superficial. I could not connect with the main characters, because there was no character development, the dramatic scenes were only limited and did not last very long. I really really do not want to give only 7 stars for the Miyazaki film, because I would immediately give 10 stars to all previous films, but this time it was just not this wonderful “ghibli experience”.
