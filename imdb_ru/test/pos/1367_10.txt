The story tells how an ancient demon was released in a small town on Halloween night. I have never seen such a stupid film in my entire life, but it is so interesting that you can forgive its bad play, effects, direction and script. This is the best movie created for the Halloween season since the original Halloween. And when they first introduce the character Linnie Quigley, she is exposed in the shower for about 5 minutes. God, they just don't get better than that. Hurry up and buy this tape right now. 5/10
