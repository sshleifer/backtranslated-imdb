Periscope is not a Great Film. But again, very few clicks. So if you are looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom, then this is a “great film” without capitals. No sharp sexism or graphic violence spoils this light comedy about a bunch of losers assigned to an antique submarine. They do not cope with their tasks, so the general can get his extra star. They must take over the entire US Navy with its nuclear submarines. But they are losers, and this is a comedy, so you can guess the result. But you support these losers, and that makes it a very interesting movie. Watch and enjoy ******** (these are eight stars)
