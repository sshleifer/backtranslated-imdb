I think this is one of Elizabeth Montgomery’s best movie shows and I’ve seen most of her films I first saw it on TV when I was about fourteen years old, and I was so scared. I watch this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it. I know that these days this film probably won't scare people too much. It simply shows that the public in the cinema and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the past thirty years or so. I love movies that don’t show graphical details, you let your imagination do the work for you. The cast in this film was top notch. Jess Walton, who played the sister in this story, was very good, although her role was rather small. At the same time, she played in a terrific television thriller called “You will never see me again” with David Hartman. I received the biggest blow from Eileen Heckcard's performance as a housekeeper. Eileen was as good as a lady with a very bad temper. George Maharis, who played her husband, was very spectacular. In this story there were many so-called mistakes in the plot, but I still love the movie. I highly recommend this film to people who love a good thriller without graphic violence. I gave this film seven votes.
