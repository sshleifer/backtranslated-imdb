Great movie for those who just need to shut down and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Scotland. In fact, the film takes you on a journey of love among breathtaking landscapes. The actors are “dressed” for the roles they play, so this film does not have great costumes or hairstyles where the acting is gorgeous, sandy and mundane. Time Definitely for those who have even a tiny drop of Scottish blood ... because it will pull the strings of the heart and excite the soul. Something that you can share with your family and watch again and again .................. a real classic that I’m sure will go along with some of the great movies that never die
