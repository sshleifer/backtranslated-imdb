It was one of the first color films that I saw in the movie when I was a kid. It is good to remember. The girl Liz Taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, starred with the tiny and superb actor Mickey Rooney. The content of the film is good for all ages, goodwill and behavior. Good ethics of parents Velvet, especially her mother - this is what needs to be considered. Our generations must be well educated, and this film can help with this. Velvet loves horses and horse racing, and Mi Taylor (Rooney) led her to international racing competitions in England, where young Velvet won in the end, but was disqualified because she was a woman.
