I was looking forward to the release of this film since I first heard the concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed. I will not generalize the story, as everyone has, but I will say that it was just interesting everywhere. The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were pretty. <br /> <br /> My only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely missing; the film ended very suddenly - in fact, the script became rather weak in the second half, as if the authors were not sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot was not as important as the music and the action, it did not affect the entertainment value of the film, so this is not as serious a complaint as it might seem. <br /> <br /> (2) This is really captious, but the music that was heard by the characters in the film sometimes dates from 1985, when the film was set. INXS 'Devil Inside has been since 1987, and AC / DC' You You Ready has been since 1990, among other errors. It bothers me a bit, since they obviously went to great lengths to make a good period, they could check the copyright date of these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier. Again, no big deal. <br /> <br /> Oh, I thought about something else strange. The members of Steel Dragon were supposed to be English, but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and guitarist Ozzy Zakk Wylde played the band members, and each of them had a few speaking lines in American accents. It was a bit lazy too, but it was still great to see real musicians playing musicians, so I will forgive you too. <br /> <br /> I could quibble all day, but I donâ€™t want to give the impression that this is not a super entertaining movie. I will probably buy a DVD when it comes out, and I will certainly buy a soundtrack CD just for six Steel Dragon songs (some of which were performed by the singer from the group Steelheart, if you remember them!). The highlight of the film may have been a great event when Mark Wahlberg speaks about a rock song around the scene and suddenly someone plays Good Vibrations by Mark Mark and Funky Bunch. Mark's surprised expression is priceless. Classic rock and roll! Rating: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment
