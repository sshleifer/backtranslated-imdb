A few years ago, I didn’t like or respect Jimmy Cagney’s films almost as much as I do now. I noticed that in many Cagney films shot with Warner Brothers in the 1930s, there was no realism, and his style of play was far from subtle. However, the more I watched these films, the more I found that I was hooked, despite these aspects. In fact, I now seem to be waiting for them! Fans of old Hollywood films probably understand what I'm talking about - teenagers and other young fans don't understand! Well, when it comes to entertainment, the Mayor of Hell never gives up from the beginning to the end. Although the idea of ​​such a shady character as Cagney playing in the reform school is ridiculous, and although all the changes he made seemed far-fetched, it all somehow worked and brought some fun to the game. <br /> <br /> A gang of brutal thugs was the Dead-Dead Kids, and instead of Leo Gorsy, Hantz Hall and Billy Hellop, Frankie Darrow and Farina play similar roles. Yes, I said Farina. This black actor was already known for his roles in the Our Gang comedies and was, believe it or not, one of the highest paid children's actors in Hollywood. All he had to give in return - call it tasteless name and behave like a pretty stereotypical "negro". Here he was actually quite good, and the usual black stereotypes are a bit suppressed than usual. Nevertheless, some will be unhappy with the very funny, but terribly insulting scene of the court, in which Farina and his father Fred 'Snowflake' Towns are involved. With such awful names like Farina and Snowflake, do not say that I did not warn you. <br /> <br /> In addition to this small complaint and plot, which is hard to believe, the film is exceptional and fun. Children do an excellent job with their work, as Kagney and Dudley Diggs do in the truly disgusting, but exciting role of an evil guard. In addition, as an added plus, you will see the eternal actor Warner, director Allen Jenkins, in his first role in the studio.
