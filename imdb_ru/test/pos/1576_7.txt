I just finished this impressively crazy affair, and so far I can’t say how it was as good as I did it to keep in mind that it was still an effective and rather unpleasant piece of the brain, twisted and warmed up. juggling j-trash. His story tells of a poor girl who is looking for her sister, who eventually gets rape and drugs from the Yakuza scum, and a woman doctor who intends to avenge her, making it strange and terrible after a similar attack of rape and drugs. Oh, yes, and there is also a bit of direct sex, unfortunately, all this is a soft core, according to Japanese disapproval below the naked body below the belt, but pixelation is minimal, in fact only noticeable in a merry blow mine scene. Although writer / director Kazuo "Gaira" Komizu is not able to create a particularly compelling story, it is at least a rather dirty thing diving early in a mud well with a rather disturbing rape (aggravated by the fact that the girl looks rather young, although I am pretty sure that she was an adult). In addition, for the most part, these are fairly professional looking things that may not be stylish, but they have a certain talent, and the content is processed quite well, with special praise for avoiding the use of a large number of pixels. This is mainly sex / rape, based on two-thirds of the acute work time, and it’s pretty watchable if you don’t mind such a fare, after a while it gets a little overwhelming, but it’s easy for women to see, and sometimes it’s pretty harsh. The music from Yôichi Takahashi is sometimes effective, although it is unlikely that the key part of the show, which she does in several places, neatly complements the action, in any case, it is enough for me to notice. More important are the effects of Nobuaki Koga, which cause an impressive splash effect when they appear, which contributes to the insane nature of climate fraud. Things are even drawn to a curiously affecting ending, of course, this is not crying or something, but for a film with such a groveling level for most of its playing time, it is relatively sharp. In general, this is quite an interesting entertainment for vile fans of garbage, especially for those who love Japanese adventures with rape. I really could have done it with a longer section of revenge and more blood, as well as, possibly, with more points / minds, but hey, it made me watch, and it was quite nicely equipped with memorable moments. So, if you dig up this degenerated trash, it may be worth it, just maybe don’t expect a second coming.
