I like the rest of the fans who love this comedy, I was waiting for her on DVD. I got it on VHS and so fed up, waiting for release and worrying that my copy of VHS will ruin everything I need to get it on DVD. To my surprise, the picture and sound are excellent. If someone else needs a copy, write me at <br /> <br /> stone_stew@yahoo.co.uk <br /> <br /> and for £ 7 I will put it on a DVD, print a DVD and get it in the mail for you. £ 7 just cover my expenses and registered delivery, etc. Maybe with a small margin, so I'm not going to make money on it, I just would like the world to see this ignored comedy gem. Got over 26 pounds, amazing. How can they not release this classic. Email me for payment details like check or Paypal, etc., etc.
