This is the most energetic and entertaining ten minutes of the film, which I have seen in a long time. As a film student at New York University, where this short film was shown several times, I applaud Jim Cox for his insightful sense of style and pace for our generation. I am sure that> later I will see his name on the big screen. We hope that this short> will find the market on television or somewhere else, so this inspiring work> can be widely adopted
