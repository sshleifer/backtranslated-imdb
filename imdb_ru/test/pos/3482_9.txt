I usually do not comment on films, because I am distributing films, but I must say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. The game is fantastic and the script is even better. There were no silly speeches or exploitation of people with disabilities to try to make this film more “Hollywood”. James McAvoy is such an outstanding actor, I could not look away from him if I tried. I was impressed with Stephen Robertson as well. I can't believe this is his first real movie. Brenda Fricker plays a small role, but, as usual, she is outstanding. This film is for everyone to see how lucky we all are. If you like Awakening and The Mask, you will love this story. You should check out this movie yourself.
