The film Muppet is an instant classic. I remember the opening scene from a bird's eye view to the swamp and Kermit, starting (in my opinion) the most favorite song in the history of songs. At this point, my mother will always sing along with Kermit. <br /> <br /> When I watch this film, while still an adult, I smile. I can still sing according to the desire of my heart. As in many Muppets films, there are jokes for adults, which (in my opinion) are still ridiculous. My favorite line of all time - in fact from this film, is the last line of my green hero Kermit with astonished eyes, “Life is like a movie, write your own ending” This is what I intend to do! Thank you, Jim Henson.
