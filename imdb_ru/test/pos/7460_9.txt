I agree with the posters earlier that the characters were exceptionally strong and believable, and all the actors were in great shape. I especially loved David Boreanaz, who was being pulled apart, so that, unlike everything else, he played, once again proving his amazing gift of comedy. The first part of the film was easy and fun, part of the blackmail was a bit surreal, but interesting - and from there everything was downhill. <br /> <br /> It upsets me that at least two out of three girls (Cyrus and Lisa) get out of blackmail and betrayal for free, without a trace left on their psyche. I know that the film corrected the darker ending of the play - and I do not say that I missed part of the murder. But I definitely needed to somehow see these two, and I was left groaning with frustration about the final. (That is why I gave him only 9) <br /> <br /> But, of course, an interesting film.
