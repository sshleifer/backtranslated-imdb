Being a marine, I can tell you that DI Today, the exact image of the camp of the marines and how the boys turn into men. Jack Webb is superb as Sergeant Jim Moore, a tough but fair drilling instructor on the Isle of Paris, North Carolina. The film is about a recruit who doesn't seem to "agree with the program." A later film, Full Metal Jacket, also shows life in basic workouts and is worth seeing.
