Blade is a fantastic action / thriller that keeps you captive throughout the film, and Wesley Snipes demonstrates what I would call his best performance. <br /> <br /> This film has everything that you would like to get in a fight / Thriller, it has a lot of blood, guts and blood, a perverted, disturbing bad buy, moments of humor, but most importantly, a very good storyline with a lot of turns. <br /> <br /> Their constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects, the combat movement of Wesley Snipes is fantastic. <br /> <br /> This film, in my opinion, definitely need to be seen, cool, Wesley Snipes makes this film, and I can’t wait for the “BLADE 2” to be released next year. <br /> <br /> My IMDB rating is 9 out of 10
