Just as the "Start" showed that we were still going to get the "classic" secret files, Drive showed that the X-Files were going to explore new territory. They start by giving us a unique “Drive” teaser with footage for the news camera. It was an interesting transition from television to real events. I would have liked it even better if they kept this news camera for the whole teaser, and not cut out the car from the inside. When I watched this episode live in 1998, I thought, “Am I on the right channel?” This first Scully showdown flooded me with loud words that I don’t understand. I think she learned a lesson to ALWAYS wear a mask before an autopsy. Silly Scully! What about the lighting in the autopsy lab? It's dark as in a grave! How should they see what they do there? The assistant director Kersh gets his first lines in this episode. I have no love lost for this man. He is the third repetitive character in the series you love to hate. The first two are Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender. I think the producers felt that too much love was going on for Mulder, Scully and Skinner. So they needed to add some characters to mourn our favorite agents and rekindle our anger as fans. I like the quarantine suits that Scully and her team wear with cool lights in a helmet. Boy. In DRY northern Nevada at night is very smoky or foggy. Can we say the word "effect"? The trip is a cool episode, but looking at route 36 in my American atlas, Mulder could not keep up to 70-100 miles per hour on this road. If he was on I-80, freeway, maybe. But there is no way on the state road with so many turns. All shooting inside the car looked very authentic. Rob Bowman's great work. This is not like the old days of an obvious blue screen or clip with a passing landscape outside the window of a car on stage. It was a funny episode, but some inaccuracies prevent it from being a great episode. It keeps you on the edge of the seat, so hold on to the fast ride!
