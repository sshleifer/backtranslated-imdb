I must have been a bit skeptical when I came to the cinema to watch OSS117: French comedies are so complacent today that only the stupidest of them get high points in the national box office. But I was surprised that although humor did not always reach the level of “Monthly Pythons”, many references to the French vision of the world in 1950, which OSS117 represents, are amusing, and the director managed to recreate the style of film production this time with amazing loyalty. In short, a little pleasant surprise, not to mention the excellent performances of various secondary actors. And, at least, this time, Jean Dujardin's style (which can get on many people's nerves) perfectly matches the character he plays.
