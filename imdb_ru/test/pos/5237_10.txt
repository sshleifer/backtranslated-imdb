If you ignore the technical problems of this early (1930s) sound film, such as sound quality and the random toughness of John Wayne, it will turn out to be an epic epic film that is more realistic than almost any film made since then. Starting in Missouri, a large caravan of Conestoga wagons, people and animals, is heading west. The carriages tear down huge rocks and cross the flooded river with a significant risk for the riders in the cars. Indians meet with Wayne and pass the train through their land. Later, the Indians gather to the west of the train to fight them. The cars form a huge circle with horses and cattle in a circle and shoot from their rifles, creating a curtain of smoke by the Indians circling. <br /> <br /> When the battle ends, the dead are buried in place, and people and carriages leave. This scene is remarkable in that the camera stays with the dead when the living go. It is unique in that it connects the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from the living. The cars meet a strong thunderstorm with heavy rain and mud everywhere. Finally they reach their destination near a redwood or redwood forest in Oregon. The film was shot in a 70 mm widescreen format with a 2.0: 1 aspect ratio (in 1930!). <br /> <br /> I did not mention the plot, because it is secondary to pictorial greatness and a huge amount of work. involved in making this film. Filmmakers will never work so hard to make such a film or any other film. Given the technical limitations of sound, music sometimes moves, for example, when Wayne leaves his girlfriend to track down his friend's killers, and at the end. <br /> <br /> While all the critics are delighted with The Searchers and Wayne's Psychology, racism, hot temper and complex characters, Big Footprint tells us how ordinary people face extraordinary difficulties. One of the best westerns I've ever seen.
