especially if you look at the amount of crap that got to the DVD. I found this movie very funny. Rip Thorn - a classic with its teeth; Rob Schneider, if he is annoyingly fun as an over-compensating Ensign; Bruce Dern makes a great "villain." The whole cast seems to explode, and this is not at the expense of the audience. If you like just a funny comedy, and you donâ€™t get too much into the meaning, you can just fall in love with it.
