true love. true love. mad love beautiful love. ugly love dirty love. sad love happy love. stupid love smart love gorgeous love stupid love. love love love. Minnie Moore realizes that she really needs a man who trusts her, trusts her and loves her crazy. of course, when this man comes ... she tries to escape, but Seymour, beautiful Seymour, he trusts her, he believes in her, so he is going to fight for her against her. I want to be like Seymour Moskovich. I want to be that kind of person. a person who wants to love without fear of failing, but wanting to fail. it's a kind of hero. this is my hero ... and Minnie Moore is my woman. Long live Cassavetis and his whole bunch!
