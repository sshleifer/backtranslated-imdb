This film is breathtaking and breathtaking. But I think that maybe this can only be appreciated by hard fun in an RPG. It is like a game. One of the problems is that the plot is too much like a game and has too many turns. Twists are excessive. Jude Law gives a very good game. I really like him in this film, just like Jerome in Gattak and Jiglo Jo in AI
