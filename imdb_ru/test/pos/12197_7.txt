If the vampire tales are your cup of blood, then this goth festival based on the Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles should give you pleasure. The present consortium of the undead in modern times, Queen of the Damned, directed by Michael Rymer, is a story of shadows and darkness and unhappy souls who live there forever. <br /> <br /> The vampire of Lestat (Stuart Townsend), who is sick of the world that he no longer cares about, “slept” for many years; but suddenly the sounds of this world, which he hears from his long sleep, change, and, loving what he hears, he decides to explore. He discovered that the world is filled with new sounds, a new kind of music - moving and penetrating - sounds that attack the senses and make it feel alive and desired. And he knows that in the end his time has come, that for him and those who, like him, the time has come to go outside and meet the world on his own terms. To this end, he becomes the leader of the group - a singer and performer, not like anyone who ever knew the world. He presents himself as a vampire and very quickly accumulates followers who reach far beyond London (where it all starts), and eventually will take him to Death Valley, California, where he plans to give a concert that promises to be out of anything ever seen or experienced. <br /> <br /> Lestat is undoubtedly powerful, but there are people of his kind who do not approve of the fact that he discovered them, one of whom is Marius (Vincent Perez). ), a vampire, powerful in itself — actually a vampire who “created” Lestat many years before — and they get together, get together and make their plans to meet with Lestat at a concert. And they are not going to music. But there is something else: at some point, Lestat involuntarily woke the Mother of them all, the most powerful of all vampires, Akasha (Aalya), who is going to tell everyone about her presence, and especially to the one she chose, to rule next to her as his king: Lestat. And at the concert, rest assured, Akasha will definitely take part. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this is Lestat’s story, and Rymer presents her in a setting with a rich atmosphere and some exquisite moments, although his film has less bite than Interview with the Vampire or Dracula Bram Stoker. It sets a good pace, and there are some scenes that provide some real thrill, but overall the film is not as saturated with the threat as it could be, or as much as one would expect. Ultimately, in fact, the amount of burned flesh overcomes the real bloodletting, although it is more than the taste of blood, and more than a fair share of lips and mouths dripping with red. There are also some good F / X, especially in sequences that emphasize the speed of vampires, as they move and fly through the air faster than with the naked eye. This is Rymer's good work, but he could have made more teeth if he had rigged the alienation that Lestat hinted at; Be that as it may, you feel his detachment, but this is not enough for full involvement. <br /> <br /> In “The Interview with the Vampire” Tom Cruise brought some kind of charismatic star power to the role of Lestat, but Townsend is even more effective, with an appearance and attitude that capture Lestat perfectly. He plays with him with a sense of acceptance, and on closer examination you may even find a hint of remorse and longing. This is a good presentation, and it convincingly sells his character. <br /> <br /> Like Marius, Vincent Perez does a good job too - he is, in fact, one of the strengths of the film - although his character is a bit ambiguous; this, however, is more connected with the way it was written than with Perez's speech, which is quite good. <br /> <br /> Margarita Moreau, as well as Jesse, a young woman too curious for her own good, is among the notable speeches; and the magnificent Lena Olin in the role of Mahareta, Aunt Jesse, who ultimately plays a key role in the outcome of the drama in which Lestat and Akasha participate. <br /> <br /> Aliya, like Akasha, is an absolutely exciting presence. What else can you say about her, besides the fact that she is a gifted performer, with great talent and beauty. And, unfortunately, she left us too soon. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Paul McGann (David), Christian Manon (Mael), Claudia Black (Pandora), Bruce Spens (Hyman), Matthew Newton (Armand), Tiriel Mora (Roger) and Megan Dorman (Mody). With a much stronger story than the usual sentences of this particular genre, fans of Ann Rice, in particular, will be pleased with the film “Queen of the Damned”, which was well prepared and directed by Reimer and her attractive cast. By focusing on the drama of this story - and how it is presented - instead of just focusing on providing cheap thrills, Reimer managed to create a real horror film that is definitely a head taller and that can whet your appetite. And this is the magic of movies. I rate it 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
