I first saw the Korean version of Daisy. It looked like a simple love story that flowed beautifully from start to finish. I saw it 3 times, waiting for my copy of the director's film to come. <br /> <br /> Then I got DC and watched it. Blimey! I think this is the first REAL directorial job I've ever seen. It's amazing how much editing in both versions! DC is laid out as a hardcore thriller with a love story in the background. It moves slower than the Korean version. The differences between the two versions are so dramatic that it looks like two completely different films. I thought I would be exhausted watching the movie again, trying to just look at the added scenes. This was not the case. It really seemed to me that I was watching a completely new movie. <br /> <br /> Although the DC is 20 minutes longer than the Korean version, it will be difficult for you to pinpoint where or what has been changed. Here 2 seconds are chopped off. A second added there. The whole scene is added here. Another erased there. In both versions, scenes have been added, omitted, or separated and reordered. In some scenes, entire lines of the dialog have been replaced or reordered - while the scene itself was intact. Even simple sound effects were added / omitted in each version, which had a great influence on the mood of the film, and sometimes even changed the outcome of the scene. What looks like a tender moment in the Korean version is a sad, gloomy one in Washington. The endings of both versions leave room for interpretation. As far as I can tell, both versions end up VERY differently, and were designed that way. <br /> <br /> I assume that most people will get the director's part of the film and find the film quite decent, but a bit long and boring. If so, look for the Korean version. The same movie, but a different feeling. I think there is a deluxe version with 3 DVDs that contains both pieces of the film - not sure. <br /> <br /> Versions complement each other so well that, as a couple, Iâ€™ll watch Daisy more often than any of my favorite Korean films. Alone, I would say that the Korean version is a good love story that I would see once. The director's video, I will look maybe once or twice, and then never, because I find a boring pace. But they go so well together! For what I consider to be the best experience, I would say, first look at the Korean version. Then watch the uncut movie that will help fill in the gaps in the story that interested you. <br /> <br /> Editing is a real movie star.
