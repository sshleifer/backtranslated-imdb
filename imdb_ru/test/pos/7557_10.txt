... that maybe someday people will wake up. People who can resist the desire to share everything and everyone, and who see the 60s as they were. People who can see that these were the people who made those times; not the other way around. <br /> <br /> Forrest Gump comparison is a good one. Both films are watched in the 60s, but “Four Friends” is about people, not about caricatures. FF is deeply aware of the fact that FG (quite successfully!) Is trying to compress and classify as nothing more than a background. But while the Gump keeps the 60s in the attic like old toys in a box, Four Friends picks up and hugs each toy, thereby erasing the lines between what you hold in your hands and who there is. <br /> <br /> If you associate a novel with shoes, you hate this movie.
