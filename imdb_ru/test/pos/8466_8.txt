There were several books that quoted this as the earliest gay movie. In fact, I do not see this as homosexuality in the sense of homosexuality, but then I see two men dancing in what should be the world's first musical, and it attracts. <br /> <br /> There were a few early comments about this film ignoring homosexual nuances. As for those who quickly reject this film as just a stupid experiment made late in the evening after too many drinks ... Well, I heard this story before. <br /> <br /> This film is interesting as an oddity, and if people want to consider it the first gay movie, so be it. Better than the depressed year 1919. Anders dies Andern.
