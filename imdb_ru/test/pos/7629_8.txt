The last dinosaur was one of those out of nowhere films filmed in the 1970s, which was quite exciting, especially for fans of Japanese films about Tokusatsu. Originally scheduled for theatrical release (somewhere when Dino King Kong was absent the previous December), it was suddenly drawn out and turned into the ABC Week Film on Friday evening. Rankin Bass, who was no stranger to Japanese co-production, was the weapon of this production, produced jointly with Tsuburaya Productions of Japan - the people who brought us Ultraman in various forms. Starring mainly American actors, including the late Richard Boone, Joan Van Ark and the late Stephen Keats, he told the story of a prehistoric pocket of time in what constituted a superheated volcanic caldera somewhere in the icy polar circle containing dinosaurs. He is a lot like the films The Land Unknown (1956) and The Land That Time Forgot (1975) in sensations and tempo. Of course, dinosaurs were guys in costumes (triceratops with front knees!), But they were shot this way, the music and the score were so well made, and the cast did a great job that for many we were brought up on Godzilla. The film has a lot of class, from Nancy Wilson's “The Last Dinosaur” to the overall “big” movie experience - the places on the hot springs in Northern Japan were excellent and lush - and Kayu Eig's undeniable feeling for that. There are several amazing sets - the T-Rex Boneyard and the tracking shot that takes us deep into the jungle to see how the T-Rex eats a giant fish from a stream. People from Tsuburaya FX have done their job stylishly here, and, apart from a few tricky matte shots, they do their job well. This film is considered the best "Japanese" film of the 1970s, "kaiju", even for five Godzilla films shot during this decade. Rankin Bass made several other collaborative productions with Tsuburai, providing creatures or miniatures — Bermuda Depths (1978) and Ivory (1980) —but they didn’t fit the epic look of this film.
