Unconsciously she could have Gone with the wind in her brain; Some parts of the story reminded me of GWTW. <br /> <br /> Clio Dyulain is an illegitimate child who returned from New Orleans from France with a mulatto servant (Flora Robson) and a midget servant Cupid (in the 1890s). Jerry Austin) She gave herself the title of Countess and declared herself a widow. Her mother killed her father by accident, and his family avoided her. Clea captures the old estate with the idea of ​​embarrassing her stepsister and father's wife, which she does, attracting much attention to herself. Her plan is to marry a very rich person who can provide her with the safety and respectability that she craves. She then notices Clint Maron (Cooper), a Texan player, and falls in love with him. These two volatile relationships - and he has no money, so she cannot marry him - so he leaves for Saratoga Springs. In the end, Dyulin's family is enough, and their lawyer gives her $ 10,000 to leave the city. It does. She goes to Saratoga Springs and goes to the railroad owner, Bart von Steed. But Clint is always there. <br /> <br /> Bergman is beautiful in dark hair and vintage costumes, and Cooper is stunningly beautiful with his incredible 300-watt smile. How could she confront him, outside of me. And love scenes - oh, what chemistry! The cast is great, Robson and Cupid create interesting characters, and Florence Bates plays the prominent role of a socially famous woman who takes Clio under her wing, knowing that she is a big fake. <br /> <br /> is a bit long, and some actions may seem old-fashioned today, but this is a fascinating story, filled with atmosphere and vivid actions.
