I shot this movie. I am very proud of the film. It was a great experience that appears on the screen. Halfdan Hassi is a great co-author who has a vision, and he was able to capture the film exactly as we imagined when preparing the film. The sets are amazing and well thought out for each character. John York and his team created sets that not only fit the characters, but also worked perfectly when shooting the film, which allows us to move smoothly around the walls and move from one to another. Each character has an amazing arch that makes a great story. I feel that all the actors gave great performances. I disagree with some other comments that say the game was not good. Watch this and decide for yourself.
