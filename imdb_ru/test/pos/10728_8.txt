I thought this movie was pretty good and quite interesting for a movie filled with emotions. I agree with the fact that another user has written about scenarios that sympathize with the three main characters. I think this is what made the film good. These are not the villains neither Mr. nor Mrs. Kramer, and I think it was nice that two people essentially solved this problem on their own and ultimately did the best for Billy. And, although it was a bit strange, I really liked the music in this film. For some reason, the music seemed suitable for a journey in which the three main characters entered. This film went quite well and did not draw, as some emotionally heavy films do. He dealt with a serious situation, but did not take himself too seriously. He just told the story in a straightforward way and worked quite well.
