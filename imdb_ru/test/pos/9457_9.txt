I've been an Amanda fan since all this, and she's still funny. I, too, is so simple. If you like Bynes, you'll love this movie. This is a harmless fun and quite funny in parts. The unusual accent and manner of behavior of Sebastian at Vi is completely unrealistic, but in some moments I laughed so hard that I almost choked on popcorn. <br /> <br /> And everything that makes teenagers read Shakespeare (maybe) is good for me. <br /> <br /> Tatum Channing is very quiet, damn hot. He also does some of the movie’s tougher scenes. <br /> <br /> Some of the side characters are VERY wide, but they are wide in “The Twelfth Night,” so that's cool.
