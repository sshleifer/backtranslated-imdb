“You can't take it real.” -Sheets <br /> <br /> Zombie Bloodbath 2 (ZB2) is a world in which everyone has his own. I really have never seen anything like it. The only thing I can compare with is psychedelic drugs. Sorry for the cliche. I do not just mean that it is incoherent and absurd, although sometimes it is. I mean that you go through such a wide range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly that you are overwhelmed, and when it all ends, you find that all this happened when you were sitting on the couch. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that it is extremely low-budget, as a disclaimer to those who, having seen “Shawn of the Dead”, consider themselves fans of underground zombie films. It should also be noted that it is much more “brutal” than you expect. The children get entangled, and someone mocks a teenage girl before she shoots her in the groin. Her corpse is subsequently "raped." These, of course, are not flaws, and I truly believe that this is the merit of the film. But if it doesn’t look like your movie, don’t waste your time. <br /> <br /> (I don’t want to exaggerate it with regard to cruelty. You shouldn’t expect it) Inside ”or something like that.) I do not dare to part with any plot, because it is really full of surprises. a scene that has nothing to do with zombies is both a classic horror scene and something completely original. <br /> <br /> Dude, I was in three paragraphs and almost did not say anything, which is why I thought the movie was awesome : 1. It is big and continues to move. At some point, you expect it to turn into another NotLD clone, the film "At the Window", where everyone lives in a farmhouse and arguing with each other. By the end of the film, however, the scenes of the farmhouse seem like a distant dream. br /> <br /> 2. Makeup / blood is much better than ZB1. More convincing and creative. Something funny: the early zombies look really lame. Then, halfway through, they suddenly look really good, with prosthetics and everything else. . Some of them look like Fulci zombies, some remind of Mr. Language from the Day of the Dead. And there are big scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling around. Never gets old. <br /> <br /> 3. There is something strangely emotional about it. One character claims that heaven exists, and that our dead / undead main characters are now in heaven. In the context of the film, we believe that this is true. Although the characters behave with the typical stupidity of horror films, they sincerely care about each other, and, accordingly, I took care of them. <br /> <br /> 4. The pace is excellent. Hardly a sad moment. <br /> <br /> My only comment bordered by criticism is that Todd Sheets offers the strangest dialogue I've ever heard. Personally, I feel that it adds experience, but I don’t think he does it on purpose, so I can’t honestly give the film a perfect rating. (Example: when a car breaks down, the owner shouts to the passengers. Then he says something like: "Sorry, I screamed at you guys. You don't know what it is like when your dad is standing over you with a razor when you are five years old. “Watf?” At the very end, it becomes more than I can handle. Includes editing with Bill Clinton, and then some preaching titles explaining the zombie metaphor. In fact, by this point I had firmly experienced my narcotic experience. <Br / > <br /> Highly recommended. 7/10.
