Awesome B-function. Virtual two-handed and installed during the day (you can see its stage origin and even how it should work as a radio show), and although it lasted only 77 minutes, in sequences similar to the present time. Robert Ryan is a psychopath who keeps Ida Lupino trapped in his home. Both are excellent, especially the underrated Lupino, whose initial independence and self-control are soon crumbling in front of reckless violator Ryan. Today, of course, it will be all the courage and bloodshed, but the restraint shown by director Harry Horner (much better known as art director) only adds to the uncertainty that Hitchcock sometimes deserves.
