This film reminds me of great films that temporarily woke me up with the realization that the Emperor was really naked. Our election process is stripped and gloomy. My mind is elevated, and I want to see the world change. After a while, I again return to my little complacency and “bubbly life”. In the best sense of this film, this work will be for me an edible stew, and, as in “Network”, I want to be convicted for saying: “I EXIST WHAT HELL, and I’m NOT going to take it anymore!” ? My energetic youthful idealism was gradually reduced to a caring parent with calm convictions or, rather, “convictions”. "Man of the Year" shows how much I yearn for honest, and sometimes joking, views of our current political situation. Dobbs line "I took a breath because I thought:" What the hell is it burning, is it in my hand, I will inhale it "?" Was it refreshing or would have been when Clinton was president. Why can't politicians be honest and set this tone for debates? We, people, need to realize how much plywood is issued for reality? I'm already tired of this election process, anyone else? Let's remove the curtains and set the agenda for our elected officials and take them on assignment (rather than re-election), when they continue to evade and not represent citizens. This film can inspire us to increase our expectations from politicians, spewing rhetoric. Great movie!
