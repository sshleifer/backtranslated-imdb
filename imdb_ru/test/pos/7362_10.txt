Blimey! My mother bought me this film because it was sold very cheaply at some store in my city, and she knows that I like scary movies. At first I looked at the cover and sighed, thinking that it was some ordinary bi-film trying to be scary. I was so wrong! I made a big big mistake by watching this one, my parents and my brother were sleeping, and it was really late. After watching the movie, I was so scared that I was trembling ... I didn’t even dare to get up and pull the video out of the VCR! I slept with the lights turned on ... <br /> <br /> This film tells about teenagers who drive off the road and spend the night in the forest telling scary stories ... The first story is really scary, and this makes you hold on tight pillow, if you watch it alone ... The second story is also terrible, but not like the first. The third story (my favorite) is really very creepy. That scared me the most stories. We are talking about a guy who rides a motorcycle around the country. One night, when there is a storm on the street, he goes to the nearest house and knocks on the door .. The girl opens and she is mute .. I don't want to tell you anymore, but you will get a chill when you watch him (I Can add that was really abnormal when i watched it). The main story "Campfire Tales" has a really interesting and amazing finale. I know that some guys said it sucks, but I, my boyfriend and my friends liked it, and it’s been a long time since we got scared. everything is much worse.
