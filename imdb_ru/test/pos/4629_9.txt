Well ... what to say. <br /> <br /> I think I'll start with recognition. I cried 4 times in my life. Once, when my father died, twice because of a girlfriend in high school and at the end of this film. This film tells about the real problems of 6 schoolchildren, making them feel uncomfortable in front of the whole world. I have never seen a film that relates to the emotional state of a person, as well as this. everything from incest to incontinence is seen here, and I doubt that there are many people who are protected from being bitten by at least a few scenes. <br /> <br /> It all starts with suicide. at 14:37. then, without letting you know who it is, the story begins to be told from the beginning of the day. it follows the life of 6 schoolchildren until 14:37. it is interchangeable, and edited with personal interviews of 6 teens, allows you to learn everything about their lives. their love, hate, dreams, desires, secrets, shame, false confidence, self-hatred, corruption and arrogance. the overall result of which is a kind of “scum” trying to uncover the identity of a suicide before it is revealed at the end of the film. without spoiling anything, I must inform you. I do not feel like a cheated ending. it contains a very important lesson. <br /> <br /> And now the warning. This film is definitely NOT for the faint of heart. Many people actually left the cinema halfway when I saw it. Aversion to some of its content. Or maybe it is sometimes difficult to face the cold, harsh truth of reality. This is what high school is for many. I'm sure most will agree.
