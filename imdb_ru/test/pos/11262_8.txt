being a high school student, I must complete a health course. This year is the topic of drugs. we learn about the harm they can do to a person. Based on what we are talking about, I still believe and know that drugs can really spoil a person. Anyway, my teacher wanted us to watch this. Naturally, we moan and start to sleep, but, like the rest of my class, I really enjoyed this movie. it was absolutely real, and not covered with sugar at all. the characters were awesome and believable. even the plot was incredibly realistic and believable. What I liked about this film is that he realized that drugs can affect the offender, and the consequences that a person has to face all claim that nothing bad will happen to them. ok, let's get serious. anything can happen in a small town, even with your best friend, such as Sam and Chris. this film shows it. a person can really learn a lot by observing it. it was quite effective.
