Just found time to meet Monster Man yesterday. It was a long wait, and after long expectations and build-ups, I am pleased to report that it passed and met my expectations at all levels. True, you really can’t expect too much when you heard a brief summary of the plot, but after reading some of the reviews I was delighted. I mean, what kind of garbage fan wouldn’t like to see the blood go crazy with the inbred hick who mows people with his monolithic truck? I expected a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and got a lot more. It was a terrible comedy that really worked. The filmmakers got it right when it came to that which made you squirm and howl with laughter at the same time. Kudos to Michael Davis for doing everything he could with blood and pushing an envelope with a sore sense of humor. Let me list just a few reasons why I love this film so much: first, it's a story. It was made to death in many other films. A college guy finds out that his childhood is in love with marriage. He, as a 25-year-old virgin, which he is, jumps in his Vista Cruiser and decides to go on a journey to confess his love, hoping that she will fall over the hills and all this good jive. In the back of his station wagon, a good buddy Harley is hidden. Harley is a talker, a former friend who laughs and speaks like Jack Black in High Fidelity. You can't help loving this guy, but if he were your friend in real life, you would have to keep a bat with a baseball on hand (laugh as much as you like, but have you ever been beaten by one?) To keep him in check . So, he's a little on the disgusting side, to say the least, but you can say that he is a true friend, deep down ... In any case, they are on the way, and when they stop at the bar, they annoy the locals, Now they are chased by a leather-faced clone in a monster truck. That's all. Yes, along the way, they pick up a great hitchhiker, but I'm too lazy and hung over to go into details right now ... so just watch this damn movie. <br /> <br /> The second thing I love is humor, this one had one of the most unpleasant laughter in any movie since Cabin Fever. How confusing is everything? Well, I won't even go into the details of the feline scene, and as for the "corpse burrito," I'll leave it to your virgin eyes. The bar full of amputees was a bit disturbing, and that guy who looked like John Turturro was also bothering me. Harley, although a completely disgusting type of boyish boy, can really throw off all the trouble. I love the sabot, by the way. I need a new couple. <br /> <br /> GORE. This one pours it on heavy. While the first hour plays a crazy road comedy, the last third is covered in blood and guts. If the film didn’t have such a light tone, it would be a bit disturbing, but looking at how it was all played for laughter, there is no possibility that you will be concerned about this. If by the time he comes, you are still sitting in your seat, you will probably also see humor in it, but seriously, there were buckets and buckets of red things. There was a big plot twist that I didn’t expect, and when the loans ended, I was completely satisfied. I received exactly what I came for, and I am very glad that I bought it. As with Cabin Fever, it will get a lot of repetition. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the film was outstanding. There was this obviously cheap look that made it all scream in the late 80s, and I liked the exaggerated colors. Obviously, Monster Man was made with a relatively small budget, but much like Cabin Fever (I'm sorry, I continue to compare them), it really works in favor of the film. The fever was one of the great people of the 70s, it was the answer of the 80s. So take it for what it is worth. No CGI here. This is what we all need. I'm not quite sure why he didn't get a theatrical release, because that's all Jeepers Creepers should be. Thank God for the Lion Gate.
