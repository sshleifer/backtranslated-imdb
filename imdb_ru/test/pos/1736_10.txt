I seriously enjoy Doctor Who. <br /> <br /> Seriously, don’t just dismiss me as a “scientific person” because I’m not a normal person. I caught it because a friend hooked me up when they started watching it. This is actually very funny, and most often it is fast. My whole family is watching this to a large extent, and this is a miracle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Ecclestion is very good, but David Tennant is great. I think this is because he made the Doctor so manic, and it's just nice to have some eccentricity in the TV character again. <br /> <br /> I do not know what it is, but everything manages to work like clockwork. <br /> <br /> All I'm going to say is just to try. One episode (probably better if you do not choose the second half of the two-part).
