What often threatens to turn into a stupid and frivolous drama about misunderstood middle-class youth ends with John Frankenheimer's unexpectedly shaded and depressed film (his first, although he started on television, directing, among other things, an earlier version of this film) scenario). <br /> <br /> We are still in the half-conscious 50s, when teenagers were wearing a jalopia, and jeans were still overalls. James MacArthur (adopted son of playwright Charles and actress Helen Hayes, and then, to enter pop culture under the name Danno in Hawaii 5-0), falls into a small incident in the cinema, which causes him to hit the manager ( Whit Bissell) and be booked at the police station. His father (James Daily), a major producer of the film, receives a call, does not listen to the version of the story of his son and pulls the strings. <br /> <br /> But MacArthur continues to carry a chip on his shoulder, which even his sympathetic mother (Kim Hunter) cannot knock off. In the Coldwater Canyon manor, matters worsen while MacArthur, trying to justify himself, does not reprise the original incident .... <br /> <br /> The film doesnâ€™t completely avoid the relationship ?? and stamps ?? of its time, but gives them a significant nuance: each character receives an honorable rumor; each point of view has its merits (and the reaction to the film will depend on what the audience brings to it). There are flaws (the word "sluggish", the standard rebel euphemism of the era, is used about 30 times more often), but they outweigh the strengths. The film benefits from a strong cast (the most famous of them is the outstanding actor James Gregory, as a police detective) and a decidedly non-exploitative way of telling your story. From the point of view of the new millennium, hot water, which MacArthur finds himself in, may seem a little cool, but the Young stranger remains honest and noble. <br /> <br />
