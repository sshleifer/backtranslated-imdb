Jamie Fox was the embodiment of Ray Charles. In a few minutes you stop watching the film and see the biography of the greatest man. Ray Charles was truly a music genius, and the film beautifully portrayed it. No one has ever written and will not write, play or record music like this musical giant. When he passed the flesh, the world lost one of its greatest American heroes. As for the film, the fact that Jamie Foxx received a scholarship of classical music in college and could play like Ray was an advantage for the director. What could be better than that? You do not need to have a "double" playing the piano, and then try to separate the screen from the hands of others to Jamie's face. It worked great. I liked the fact that he also understood how difficult Ray was. He was not always a good person. You also did not hurt him. He was a drug addict, a womanizer, and sometimes just stubborn. But I think this is what made him a genius, so I can't blame him for that. I choose Jamie for Best Actor!
