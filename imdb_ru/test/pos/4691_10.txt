I have some wonderful memories when I watched “Robin Sherwood” on TV as a child (but I think for some reason I only saw Michael Praed’s episodes). And recently, my brother bought a new complete DVD box. It was great to see him again, and this is the best of all the movies and TV shows about Robin Hood. The cast is great, and the seats mixed with the music of Clannad add this special feeling. Personally, I think Praed is the best of two Robins, but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series. Ray Winston, Nicholas Grace and Robert Addy play amazing roles of Will Scarlet, Sheriff Nottingham and Guy Gisborne. It is a pity that the fourth season was never made, and I also heard that the writer Richard Carpenter did have plans to make a feature film after the events of the series. Robert Huntingdon (Connery) could finally marry Marion (Judy Trott), or maybe Herne-Hunter could resurrect Robin from Loxley (Prades), and he could take revenge on the sheriff. As mentioned earlier; if the producers of “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” were smart, they would get the cast of “Robin Sherwood” and make the film a kind of continuation of the series. As Ray Winston writes in the bonus DVD material, it would be great to see them as older people, like in Robin and Marian's Sean Connery film. Who knows, maybe we will still see this ideal interpretation of the legend in the future. In any case, now we can watch our favorite TV series again and again!
