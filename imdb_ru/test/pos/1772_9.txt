It is sometimes hard to be a pirate ..............., but damn it, Miss Jean Peters tries very hard - and this can be seen, especially during her first friendly Blackbeard sword game (Mr. Thomas Gomez - supremely hissing), when her face clearly shows the joy of performance. With a fifty-year-old backdating, feminists seem intent on seeing this film as a kind of hymn for women's empowerment in a male-dominated society, but I have serious doubts that M. Turner or Miss Peters had such a concept of time . It was an exciting, fascinating family film with no complaints, hidden meanings, or alternative designs. It was fun. M. Louis Jourdan, as her love, is interesting and cunning. Mr. Herbert Chapman is wise and philosophical, as a wise and philosophical doctor. Mr. James Robertson Justice is just as incredible as a bosun. But this is Miss Peters, which remains in the memory. As a teenager, illiterate, tough, but vulnerable, surprisingly agile and, ultimately, courageous, she is the idea of ​​a lady pirate. She had a definite opportunity for her in the role of an angry costume - that she did not decide to take advantage of this is somewhat regrettable.
