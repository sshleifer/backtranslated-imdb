Yes, Barney is nonsense, but when I was a kid, it made sense. <br /> <br /> I didn’t get smarter, but I liked it. As a child, I was ridiculed because no one could pronounce my name, so I changed it. Since I was 4 years old, I have been called Tina by the name of Barney, because I could relate to her from another culture. I am now 17, and Barney is a huge part of my life. ... my name comes from this .... I can't show the show in which I grew up, no matter how stupid it seems now. <br /> <br /> I don’t care if they block me, I don’t have anything else to say. they should not have at least 10 lines, because some people simply have nothing to say. is ready
