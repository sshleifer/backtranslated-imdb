This film is the most impressive Turkish film I have ever seen. Probably Okul is the first Turkish horror film. I have to say that I was excited while watching a movie for a number of reasons. The first reason is that the story is impressive, I mean, at the end of the film you understood all the details of the film, it makes the film attractive. Another reason is that not a single Turk made such a film before. This shows that the Turkish film improves with time. Although the first test to make a horror movie was really successful. I advise all of you not to miss this movie ...
