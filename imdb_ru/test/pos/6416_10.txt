In the last days of 1999, most people in Taiwan died. A strange plague spoiled the island. Supposedly spread by cockroaches, the disease sends its victims to psychosis, where they act like insects. In the end they die. The hole occurs in a crumbling residential building (which is especially well-established; thank the set designer!). His two main characters live right above and below each other. The woman is on the lower floor, and the pipes above her apartment flow violently, threatening to destroy her food supplies, not to mention her sanity. She calls a plumber to check him, and he accidentally punches a hole in the floor in the man’s apartment. These two have never met before, and they come into contact through the hole. <br /> <br /> The script is pretty brilliant. Few films are at the same time so funny, while remaining completely human, deeply exploring the human condition, especially feelings of loneliness and despair. The direction of Tsai is just beautiful. Like many other Taiwanese directors, he uses many long takes. But unlike, say, from Hou Xiao-Hsien, Cai does not abuse them. In fact, I do not know if I have ever seen them better. They are always effective and never tiring. <br /> <br /> It would be wrong to revisit this film without mentioning the musical numbers. Yes, The Hole is also a musical, and great. In the best scenes of the film - something says, considering how good all the other scenes are - the man imagines that the woman is a singer, almost a cabaret singer. These numbers are fully supplied, often with backup dancers and singers. In the brilliant take-off, Tsai made these elaborate numbers take place in a crumbling building, without hiding the signs of apocalypse and decomposition. This creates a feeling of pathos and absurdity. <br /> <br /> “Hole” is a film that is being asked to show. It should be a cult classic, if nothing else. Before I went to see it, I was told that it was a decent movie, but probably the least good movie is Cai Min-liang. Well, if it's true, I just can't wait to see another one! 10/10
