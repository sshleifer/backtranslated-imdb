When Madame decides to let her cats inherit it, it causes problems. Snobber Butler Edgar, the next in line for the inheritance, decides to get rid of cats. Thus, the story can begin, and the cats can go on an adventure that would otherwise be impossible. Adventure that allows them to meet the charming, but not quite trustworthy cat O'Malley. He helps them in many dangerous and funny situations to the inevitable happy end. <br /> <br /> The strength of this film is in its humor and music. Edgar is just jolly, like an insulted butler who is going to settle accounts, and, of course, he himself is being severely beaten. In one of the best scenes he is pursued by two dogs Lafayette and Napoleon. The score is gorgeous, and, like in The Jungle Book, you have scenes that are almost “musical” in the sense that the story does not develop, and the goal is for the main characters to express themselves through dance. And, of course, we like that the score is pretty jazz. <br /> <br /> And, of course, this is pleasant not only for me, but also for my children. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Simon
