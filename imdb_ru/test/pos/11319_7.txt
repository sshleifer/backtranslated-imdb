I lived in London for most of my adult life before I moved to the state, so I missed this film when it came out, and I saw it just now on HBO. I do not agree with anyone who thinks that this was supposed to be a Hollywood performance, the British team created an atmosphere of frightening and gloomy foreboding for him from day one, and for the last 30 minutes I sat on the edge of my place, thinking about what will happen to my home town. And, of course, nine months after the filmâ€™s release, 7/7 happens. Yes, the truth is stranger than fiction. Living in both countries, it is also clear that the likelihood that this will happen in the UK is much higher than in the US, Muslims live in the ghetto and isolate themselves in the UK, in the US they are much more willing to assimilate.
