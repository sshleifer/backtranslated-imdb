Over the past 30 years, there have been many (well, at least more than a few) attempts to create a film that has an “otherworldly” appearance. Suppose that this is the desire of the filmmaker to distance himself from other films or to simply disguise a low-budget and battered appearance, “Born” is in the top echelon of this pile. <br /> <br /> Beyond anyway, the incomparable "Eraserhead." <br /> <br /> Merhige’s painstaking process of disintegrating his film completely changes its structure (imagine how this film would look in a gorgeous, standard Technicolor) - You can imagine it as an artifact from another, unknown culture. Some images are so far from what we expect to see on the screen, they interfere, mainly because of the bias. This is not a disturbance "Last house on the left", it is more like a disturbance "leave your cave for the first time and see the sun." <br /> <br /> See this Fever-Dream if you get a chance and enjoy it. Remember, they make other, more standard films every day. They can wait.
