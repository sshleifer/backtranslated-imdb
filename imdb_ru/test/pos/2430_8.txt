There is no doubt that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia. In addition to the very characteristic differences in appearance (Anderson's eyes are noticeably larger, lips are thicker, the nose is larger and elevated at the end ... etc.), Anderson could not speak Russian - it was ridiculous ... That's why I hate Anna Anderson and her associates. Not many scammers have the courage and endurance to fraud for more than 60 years with such a clearly untenable scheme. <br /> <br /> And yet, to some extent, I sympathize with Anna Anderson. In those days, the life of a young Polish peasant was supposed to be hard. And impersonating another woman for more than 60 years is a difficult task for everyone. She had to keep her fleshy lips all the time to imitate Anastasia’s thin lips, and sometimes she had to go crazy to make people believe that all her chaotic memory was simply the result of mental problems. <br /> <br /> Anna Anderson was a terrific woman who made a mistake. If she correctly used her appearance, taught elegance, endurance, acting, she could become a first-class actress. <br /> <br /> On the other hand: some of the main characters of this two-way actor It seems that they are based on real numbers. Prince Erich could have been a mixture of Gleb Botkin (in the opinion of many of the most probable brains behind this whole scheme), Duke George and Dmitry Leikhtenberg, and several other figures. And Daria Romanova, it seems, is based on the great princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova. But, unlike true like-minded people, Prince Erich in this show was devoid of motives and supported Anna for the love of her and sincere faith in her, which is very touching. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a great show. A bit invented, but still remains true to reality. The strength of Amy Irving's acting skills lies in the fact that she successfully represented Anderson’s self-confidence, a mixture of selfless behavior with others and self-assertion intrigues. Just as Princess Xenia said about Anderson: "She was always herself and never made the slightest impression on the role." Highly recommended.
