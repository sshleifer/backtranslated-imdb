This is really a great and beautiful film. The main theme of this film is an innocent child (Heather Graham as Jolene), who is struggling to make his naive wishes about how the world should be understood, while he is constantly beaten by the real world. This is not an unfortunate film, but vice versa. This is a funny movie with a sad side, but the thought of the movie makes me feel so happy. At the beginning of the film, the beautiful, vulnerable Jolene is confronted with a drug addict who is trying to break into the car of his girlfriend. She talks with him, convinces him to ask for help and gives him $ 30 as a start. At the end of the film, he appears to pay her, explains that he has no medicine, he is fine, and he thanks her. I hear cynical moans. Of course, this would never have happened. This film does not occur in the real world. This happens in a world in which we would like to live. The sad thing is that we do not live there. The happy moment is that there are people who want us to do this.
