This is the last entry in a long series of films with the French agent OS 117 (French response to James Bond). The series was launched in the early 1950s and produced at least eight films (none of which were released in the United States). “O.S.S.117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies” is a small comedy that should not ... DO NOT repeat, be taken too seriously. Our main character finds himself in the middle of a spy chase in Egypt (Morocco is making a replacement for Egypt) to learn about a long-lost friend. This is followed by the standard tricks of James Bond / Inspector Klass. Although our man is something like an obvious xenophobe, sexist, homophobe, this is perceived as a pure farce (as I said, do not take it too seriously). Although there is some rough language and cartoon violence, it is mostly good for older children (aged 12 and over). As already mentioned in the subject line, just sit back, pass the popcorn and just enjoy.
