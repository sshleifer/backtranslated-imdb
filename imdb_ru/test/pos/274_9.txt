"Stepford Children" - the second best film "Stepford" in the series "Stepford". I saw the original “Stepford Wives” in the theater when it came out in 1975. I was just amazed, it was awesome. I have seen all the films "Stepford", and I like all of them. I think Stepford Children is such a fun and funny movie. I recently watched it on tape recently and I really liked it. Shooting in this film was really nice to watch. Barbara Eden did an excellent job. Every role she ever played was very good. Barbara Eden played very well the role when she is a kind and educative person. Don Murray as a husband and father was just perfect in this film. He was especially effective in being an annoyed father for his two teenage children. I made sure that I had the entire film “Stepford” on film, so that you like it.
