This version of Lost Horizon is actually not a bad movie. I think the problem is that people like to choose musicals, especially those that were made in the 70s. I saw the film after its initial release in 1973 (I was ten years old), and I really liked it, especially the music. (Bert Bakharakh has always been a favorite.) The story is fun, a good game, technically excellent. Of course, there are one or two rather silly dance numbers, but hey, you can't win them all. I have this movie on video and I watch it very often ... and I enjoy it every time!
