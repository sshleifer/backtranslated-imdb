Perhaps not the best work of Miyazaki, but I couldn't help but love her to death. A five-year-old boy finds a goldfish stuck in a bottle. He saves his life and keeps him in a bucket as a pet, but in reality it is a magical creature, the daughter of a human wizard and a sea goddess. Ponio, as the boy calls her, takes her back to the sea from her father, who tries to dissuade her from returning to land and becoming a man, but she gets into his magic elixirs and does what she wants to do. The story is simple and sweet. Where the film really comes to life, though, is in its immense artwork. The drawings are more like children than any other Miyazaki works, but their simplicity is beauty. As in all of his films, Miyazaki creates this world of imagination, which I was absolutely delighted with. When I saw him in the theater, I remembered how it was when the opening notes of Joe Hisaishiâ€™s score for Princess Mononoke rushed at me and almost immediately ten years ago made me goosebumps (the score here is also wonderful) I wanted to live in this world and never leave it.
