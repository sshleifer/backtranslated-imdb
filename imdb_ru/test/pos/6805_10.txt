This is the first film I've ever filmed, and 14 years later I still have the same copy. Elizabeth Taylor was as radiant at twelve years as he ever was later in life, Mickey Rooney gave a real dimension to Mi to Taylor, and Donald Crisp was as solid as Mr. Brown. The amazing Anne River, like Mrs. Brown, seemed the wisest woman in the world. After almost 60 years, the warmth, humor and excitement of this film still affect the viewer; we still laugh at the jokes, root for The Pie, and love Velvet for the spirit and ability to love that she shows. I love it as an adult just as I loved it as a child. A must for every family video collection.
