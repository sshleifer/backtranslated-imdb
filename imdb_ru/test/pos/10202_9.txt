This is a kind of hidden gem. It has little or no advertising, fanfare, classic status, and it deserves all of the above! Fritz Lang, one of the great film directors, created a real gem in this beautiful western. Wonderful cast, led by Randolph Scott (possibly in one of his greatest performances), always strong Dean Jagger, Robert Young as an amazingly experienced dude, as well as many veteran actors: Chill Wills, Slim Summerville, John Carradine, Barton Maclaine Zane Gray's other exciting story about laying Western Union cable across the country. This is a tense drama, splashes of humor and great effects. In a sense, this is reminiscent of Demil, but Fritz Lang leaves his own stamp on it. At least it's a damn good western!
