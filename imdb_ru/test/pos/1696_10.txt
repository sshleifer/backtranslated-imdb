Of course, I will think that it was a great movie. I recognized several people whom I had not seen during the shooting. I was one of those who played guard for about an hour in the cinema in the courtyard of the death row and asked me to light a cigarette. I also changed this scene. Initially, they were ordered to go to the river shop and put the prisoner in order, turn him and bring him out. The director said, "It will take a lot of time, what would you do, Gower." I said, “We need to go in, hook our hands and pull him back. That way, your camera can stay on its face when we remove it. ” I also lived in the same prison as a child, since my father was an assistant security chief. I am also a member of the Tennessee Department of Corrections as a Head of the Rwandand Institute for Maximum Safety. Although much of the film was a joke, the role in which I participated was quite a reality. Also on the bar scene, the dancer, beating high into the air and leaving the stage, was a real stripper with whom I worked at a club called “Classic Cat”.
