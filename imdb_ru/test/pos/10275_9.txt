Gilles Mamouni plays the story of Max (Vincent Cassel) in search of his biggest lost love (Monica Bellucci) with an audience just before engaging with another woman. Mamuni uses many flashback episodes without warning, so the best way to find out where we are in this story is to watch an actor's haircut. Otherwise, it can be very confusing ... Still a strong film debut for Mamuni, beautifully photographed by Thierry Arbogast (5th Element, the Messenger), and Monica Bellucci is cute to watch ... I felt a little disappointed end so i gave it 9 out of 10.
