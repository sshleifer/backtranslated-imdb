The newborn Knight escapes from her husband for non-specific reasons, which, apparently, are related to himself. On the road, she gets confused with Kaan, a former football star with a damaged brain, and Duvalier, a stupid but abusive cop. A type of film that could appear only in the 60s. It is worth looking at his non-formulaic plot and at the early performances of future stars. <br /> <br /> Disappointing permission does not take too much away from the rest of the film, which shows an interesting part of life.
