I saw this movie twice, both times on Cinemax. The first time in the un-rated version `s, which is the soft core of porn in It`s better and the second time in the stripped down (cut the entire floor and most of the nudity of the exit) version, which was entertaining in a typical beach movie kind of way. The no-star version has a terrific sex scene with Nikki Fritz, a dude and a bottle of oil that is not from this world (the pun is not intended). Unfortunately, in a stripped-down version, this scene is almost completely cut, like all other sex scenes. By rating or without rating, it is still interesting to observe how all the brothers and sisters of larger stars (Stallone, Shin, Travolta, etc.;) try to act. We also get the appearances of B-Queen Linnie Quigley and Burt Ward (Robin from the old Batman series).
