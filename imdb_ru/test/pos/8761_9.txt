“Traffik 1989” is an Emmy Award from six UK serial mini-series that inspired the Oscar-winning “Traffic 2000” award. The five-hour film destroys the opium / heroin trade for the viewer, ranging from the manual casting of poppy seeds in an Afghan field and ending with the addict's “dizziness” in a main apartment in England. Traffik not only offers entertaining value in the form of alternating dramatic stories, but also provides an overview of the international drug trade at all levels, answering the questions “who, where, how, and why” in relation to the old and incessant machine of supply and demand of drugs. Synergistically entertaining and educational, Traffik will be a good time for teens and older. (BUT)
