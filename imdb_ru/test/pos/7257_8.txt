I usually love historical (historical) films and get new ideas for costumes for my historical group, and a friend recommended this one to me. I like Johnny Lee Miller as an actor, so I thought it was worth it, and I was definitely rewarded !! His image as a member of the English noble class was much more accurate than what I had seen in the past. From the comedic aspect, my sides hurt, the costumes were not terrible, and historically I didn’t frown much. I also noticed the fact that in England there was no proper sewer system much later, but anyone who doesn’t delve into the little things of the past of England will not notice or take care. Absolutely worth a look. I highly recommend this movie.
