When I played the first Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast, I thought it was great. When I played the second, I was hooked. Finally, when Soul Calibur III came out, I bought a PlayStation 2 and a game. <br /> <br /> It really can hold you for hours, with a huge number of characters, lots of content being opened, and don’t mention the BIG combat system, it’s really the best combat game today. <br /> <br /> The strengths of the game are, above all, the gameplay, when two people fight each other, playing for one of the main characters or for the created and customized character. The Create Character option is extensive and allows the player to create thousands of different combinations. <br /> <br /> The only thing that bothers me is that if you create a character that uses the "Grieve Edge" combat style (only kicks) you should wear these funny boots. ^^ <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the best fighting game you can only dream about. Now I just hope the planned movie won't be crap.
