I have never heard of this film until it appeared on cable television, and I cannot understand why. Gina surpasses Arnold as an action movie hero in this movie! Gina is a former CIA assassin who is brainwashed and considered a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural city. She continues this life for 8 years with her husband and daughter. She begins to receive a hint that she could be someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never dies and want to make sure that she does. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, a former police officer. Together they form the same entertaining couple as Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. When Gina finally regains her memory, she turns into a killing machine, which she once performed with the song “She Is Not There” playing in the background. It follows that Gina and Samuel should go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. Throughout the film, Gina must decide who she really is. Killing machine for insensible? A mother / school teacher with a quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Moreover, the bad guys grab Gina's daughter. Magnificent action films that stand in the same row with the films Die Hard!
