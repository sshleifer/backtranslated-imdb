Good film. <br /> <br /> I managed to burn it to a DVD at a local sale. £ 2.99 seems like a good deal, and it is. The fact is that the film is called “Kill for”. To find out his original name, it took a little detective work. <br /> <br /> In the UK, it was rated as 18, and rightly so, although the standard of films depends on the "ability to sell." Looking at Final Destination 3 last night, in my opinion, he should have been 18. <br /> <br /> Maybe the fact that Traci Lords is amazing in him makes the classification board increase it to 18. Such a shame. <br /> <br /> Tracy is a great actress, and she should be given a chance to appear in large and large budget productions. She is able to turn what is under the B-Movies label into a wonderful performance, simply amazing. <br /> <br /> Long live the Traci Lords and her incredible talent as an actress.
