There are many familiar elements of Hitchcock (from previous and later films), and this time they are mixed up into a fun but hardly tense part of the entertainment. You can tell that Dorothy Parker had a hand in the script, the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of the hero Cummings with the blind and his meeting with a rather strange group of circus people. The famous climax on the Statue of Liberty looks a bit tough - judging by today's standards, but also when compared to other finals of the Hitch monuments (for example, Blackmail, North in the Northwest).
