I think FARSCAPE is the best science fiction since Babylon 5 and one of the best science fiction television series of all time (rated there with Doctor Who, Blake 7, Red Dwarf, MST3K and the aforementioned B5) I believe that the characters and Farscape races are much more interesting and more original than the typical “people with birthmarks” that are found in many TV shows. The effects are pretty good, and the stories are interesting. Despite the absence of the main part of season 2 and part of season 1, I believe that character development is very well done.
