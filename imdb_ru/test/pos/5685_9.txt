I live here in the crocodile territory and I remember well the real events that inspired this film. Our guts fall out every time we hear of a crocodile attack. BLACK WATER is simply the best crocodile film I've ever seen. Last year I loved ROGUE for all its effects and spectacular scenes, but it was the local scenes that captured our audience. We laughed at ROGUE more than anything. BLACK WATER, however, really resonates with the eeriness and fear that you may experience being alone in mangroves (you guys call them swamps or bays, but they are mangroves). Every tourist should watch this movie before heading to the Northern Territory. The ending was a little disappointing after the rest of the film, but I will add it to my DVD collection when it becomes available.
