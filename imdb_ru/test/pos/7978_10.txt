This is a cute little film that pretty much gives what it promises - good fun. In the end, when the film declares that it represents the best SASS shooters, you should understand that it is not a likely candidate for the Best Shot Award. These guys are shooters, not actors. Your next clue is that Nicolas Cage or Jennifer Aniston are not filming the film, so you should not expect the hottest names to appear. It should have been just plain old entertainment, and in this respect it is as good as many of the old “lures” that I have seen over the years. <br /> <br /> SO what are you getting "Hell to pay"? You will get 100 minutes of good old fun. You have a chance to see some stars of the past years, who behave almost the same as in youth, but a little older. You will see good SASS shooters in the lead roles and several SASS hams in the background. I had a lot of fun to see the people with whom I shot, visited their homes and that my good friends did what many people only dream about - they live in real life honestly to hell with a movie. They do something for many imitator actors, and the imitator shooters will never get the chance to do it, and I think it is worth it in itself. <br /> <br /> True, not everyone is a member of SASS, and therefore he saw a lot of fun and humor that others may miss, but it is still good, old-fashioned entertainment, and, frankly, there are a lot of films in the cinema now which I wouldn't give a penny, so save money to see Brokeback Mountain, get Hell to Pay and see how some real cowboys have fun.
