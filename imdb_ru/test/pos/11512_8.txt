Reading other comments here in IMDB, I had high hopes to see the “Angels of the Universe”. I was not disappointed, and, having given the film 8 points, I would say that I can justify this assessment. <br /> <br /> In the film there is an incredible acting game, especially the main role, Pall. Supporting actors also do a very good job, like patients in a mental hospital, Pall's parents and brothers and sisters. The music also deserves a mention, supporting the film throughout, giving depth and feeling. <br /> <br /> Although the film is very Scandinavian, it leaves no humor and has a kind of objective authorship on Pall's life. However, if you want to watch a funny comedy or something lighter, this is not for you. This is a story about people with mental disorders, about how they are treated in society, but, above all, the story of Paul. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all movie lovers. This is one of the best films that have ever left Iceland, if not Scandinavia.
