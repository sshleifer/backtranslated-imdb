I am from Germany, so I apologize for my writing style. When I first saw Chucky 4, I was a little surprised, I knew that Chucky is the usual scary movie of the 80s, but Bride of Chucky was very different from the old ones. First, this is the work of a very good director Ronnie Yu, whom we still remember from the story of the Chinese ghost. His visual style is similar to the wired Francis Ford Coppola. Chuckie and Tiff are also very impressive voices. I also really liked the script, especially the scene in which Tiff throws a bottle of champagne in the ceiling mirror. <br /> <br /> I give him 9.0 votes for funny, bloody and progressive entertainment. If you have any comments in my opinion, just send me an email. MFG Chavez
