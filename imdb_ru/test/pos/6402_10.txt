Agree, it was one of the best episodes of this show. I remember the show well when I was in the Florida Keys, when the show debuted. I was looking through old cassette tapes that were “guardians,” and came across two that had about eight episodes. I spent part of the Christmas night (and the next one) watching these shows. The singer was Bankie Banx - saw his name appear on the credits. He is from Anguilla and owns a beach bar called The Dune Preserve. He is Jimmy Buffett’s longtime friend, and the classic song “Still In Paradise” is included in the latest Buffett combo “Live In Anguilla” is track number 12 on CD 1 and number 8 on CD. I would also like to sometime see this short TV show on DVD. Save faith!
