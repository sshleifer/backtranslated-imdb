I think it is incredibly difficult to write any full-scale review for Giorgino, simply because it is one of those addicted to the viewer, complex, poetic and philosophical films that carry the brain, if you are trying to enjoy their shell while watching them reach their essence, but there are several things that are definite and unquestionable for any person of art (which I hope I am). First: it is a kind of masterpiece, even of such art, which will exist for a long time; second: this is one of those rare “dark” films in which darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much more sad than depression, such as, for example, the art of Peter Bruegel or Kaspar David Friedrich. As for the essence of the film, someone called it Kafkian, although I do not agree with this, because in fact it is far beyond the hateful logic of Kafka and much more like Edgar Poe’s parables: dark and terrible, but because of this the most tender strings of our soul. In fact, from the poetic side (which is much more important than the narration), Giorgino is a story about eternal peace and love that can be achieved only through the eternal childhood of the soul. Those who have such souls are usually perceived by our society as crazy, but, on the other hand, they all possess the virtue that everyone else lost when they became “adults”: the virtue of God's love. Indeed, Giorgino is a very Christian film: “Be like children” (Matthew 18: 3) is a real hidden tag, although the film never has any morality and focuses only on Christian philosophy, because, I dare say, True God is above all human morality. And yet I think that Budnat is too harsh, portraying “adult” people as a kind of demons trying to steal childhood from rare surviving souls, but this is his point of view, and he has the right to think so. While watching Giorgino, do not try to look for any hidden characters (although they exist), rather look for thoughts expressed through characters and their behavior, and learn from them. Also, I can not fail to mention that the film looks amazing thanks to the excellent photography, especially due to the rational use of color filters, incredibly suitable installation, the magnificent performance of all the roles and, of course, the atmospheric beauty of the winter mountains that reminded me of Bruegel. "Hunters in the snow". Also, which is quite interesting, the scene with Death as an old woman with sunken black rings on a bicycle instantly reminded me of Pest (Plague) from a series of drawings by the Norwegian artist Theodore Kittelsen, depicting how the black plague sweeps the population of a small town in a mountain valley. That's a coincidence?
