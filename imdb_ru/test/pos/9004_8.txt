Like most sports films that have been released in the past, this film is similar to the fact that it is based on facts. What distinguishes this film is that it tells about a rugby team - a sport that not many Americans are familiar with. Leave it aside, this film is a very useful part of the film noir. It reminds me of “We are Marshall,” but with a smaller budget and an independent cinema feeling. Director Ryan Little is a great attempt to tell us a story about a rebellious teenager played by Sean Farris (“Never Give Up”), and Rick Penning finds himself in a strange place, both on and off the field. Despite several holes in the storylines, this film has a heart, rewarding every viewer with good characters with whom we can identify ourselves. Also good performances, supporting actors Gary Cole as trainer Larry Gelvix and Neil McDono as coach Penning (Ricks Papa). When I watched the movie, I experienced many different emotions, in the end I still had a feeling of faith in humanity and hope for the future for my children, especially if there are such coaches as Gelviks.
