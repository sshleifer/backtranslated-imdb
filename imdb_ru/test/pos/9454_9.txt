I thought this movie would be completely crap because of the commercials I saw in cinemas. When my sister borrowed from a friend, I decided to watch it, because it was summer, and there was nothing left. , Needless to say ten minutes in the film, and I liked it. Amanda was a great actor in the film, her comedy time was perfect. The guy who played the Duke was hot, simple and straightforward. My favorite scene was definitely when Amanda passes by a gardener and classmate who is suspicious of her, and she talks to her mom about dresses - because she pretends to be a guy! I reviewed this part again and again ... In short, the film that I thought would be unsuccessful - now I own it.
