I must confess that I have been a big fan of almighty David "Hoff" Hasselhoff since he starred in the popular 80s TV series "Knight Rider". Whether it was his extraordinary debut as a libidine basketball player in high school in a fun and obscene "Revenge of the Fans" or his brilliant image of a dashing prince in the reckless sci-fi treasure Starcrash, Hoff again and again argued that he was simply stunning (and shamefully undervalued ) supreme actor. Hoff stands out here as Gary, a cynical and skeptical photographer who, along with his depressed virgin-writer Leslie (attractive brunette Leslie Cummings), explores the dirty, half-ruined haunted hotel located on a remote island off the coast of Massachusetts. They have been researching witchcraft for centuries, and the last owner of the hotel was an actress who allegedly practiced black art. A family quarrel also appears on site to check out the hotel. Very soon, the mysterious Lady in Black (actually creepy Hildegard Knef) begins to face various disgusting ways. <br /> <br /> Of course, the rest of the cast makes Hoff win his money. forever jolly Linda Blair projects her accustomed charming talent as a pregnant pregnant woman who eventually becomes obsessed (naturally!), legendary jazz singer Annie Ross eats her with joyful aplomb like a frail old bat (poor Annie is burned alive) afterwards her lips were sewn up and she was hung upside down in the chimney) and gorgeous blonde Catherine Hickland oozed a significant sex appeal from every pore as a lustful whore. Competent guide Fabrizio Laurenti, the corresponding eerie atmosphere, brilliant cinematography by Gianlorenzo Batalla (smooth Steadicam sneaking shots are especially good), tasteless special effects, a sharp jitter of Carlo Maria Cordio and Randy Miller, and the glory of the sadistic violence at the height. But in the end, it is the incredibly dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only Hoff that makes this delicious piece of delicious Italian horror cheese the winner: he takes off his shirt once (hubba hubba!), Sprayed with blood and - - WARNING: major * SPOILER * ahead - even Meets a pleasantly terrible untimely end. This picture, created by none other than Joe D'Amato, is generally rated as good, dirty fun.
