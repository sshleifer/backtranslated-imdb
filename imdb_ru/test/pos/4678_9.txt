I wonder how many MINI Cooper cars were sold thanks to this film? This could not fail to add to the sales of this small car, which is shown in this film, along with an attractive cast. <br /> <br /> This is a very, very interesting film about robberies and harassment. It features a cool cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> The best chase scene at the very beginning is a boat race in Venice, Italy. The film does not exaggerate violence, has a rather clever script (with a few exceptions). has interesting characters and is well fortified. The game of cat and mouse between the characters of Norton and Theron is very intense and interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> However, we are again trying to catch the criminals, who are portrayed as "good guys." How many times has this happened since the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in the 1960s? This is a cool Hollywood for you. Here, one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the leader and father figure (Donald Sutherland) in the gang, so he is the worst of all and the villain of the film. In addition, Teron’s character is in Hollywood’s typically bloated feminist style in which women can do everything (including driving a car) better than a man. The third minor annoyance is Seth Green's smug, intelligent attitude, which we also have to agree with, because it is fashionable and cool. <br /> <br /> Despite these obstacles, this is an extremely interesting film, and it also does not go off-scale about profanity or sex .... and, yes, these little cars are cool. Everyone with whom I spoke, who saw this film, liked it.
