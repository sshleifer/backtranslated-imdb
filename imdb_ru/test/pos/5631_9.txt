I made this film for two reasons. The first was all the good things I read about it. I was definitely impressed and could not agree with all the reviews I read. The second reason is that I know these guys. I know Mark is not as good as Mike. He has not changed much in those years that we knew each other. I know him as a “reaper” from a local Milwaukee radio station (WMSE). The way he is in this film is really Mike 100%. One day he gave me a table that he made. It was small, about 15 "in height, on which Metallica was written. It was strange that she had only two legs. Sometimes thought was important, and Mike always thought of others first.
