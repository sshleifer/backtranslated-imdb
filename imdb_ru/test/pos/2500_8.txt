This film was a painful, sweet, pretty romantic comedy, and I usually don’t like it, but this one was pretty enough to interest me. It was really funny at one point (probably why I liked it), and then just as seriously the next. In addition, Ellen was in him, and I always felt weakness for her. <br /> <br /> Basically, the owner of the bookstore Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old sofas in her shop. She thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it. She seems to have separated herself from the world, so this really silences her. In the end, almost everyone associated with her finds this letter, and they all receive mixed signals that create really funny moments. <br /> <br /> As I said, I’m usually not the only one for this type of movie, but I’m really hurt. Enjoy it and highly recommend it.
