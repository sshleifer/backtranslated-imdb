- A group of thugs robbing a train carrying gold. In their escape, the gangsters divided. A thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he can speak. Three men have another part of the “hint” that will lead to gold. Can a banker, a thug and a bounty hunter jointly find the missing loot? Or will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off from Leone "Good, bad and ugly." Various scenes in the film are also filmed from other films by Leone, Corbucci and others. But for me this is done in such a way that disrespect for the original work is not manifested. Instead, Any Guns Can Play with love parodies some of the biggest films in the history of Spaghetti in the West. The initial scene with three men traveling to the city and the final feud between the three main stars is a remarkable respect for the SWs that used to be. <br /> <br /> - Castellari adds a lot of its nice touches - reflected in spilled wine, a stranger with a bright red background and a playful way to find gold at the end. Although incredibly incredible, many wrestling scenes are well set and directed. In particular, the two fight scenes (the battle in the market and the battle in the bath) are done very well. He is also not afraid to try different things with his camera. Tight close-ups, top punches and shots in the corners are common in Any Gun Can Play. <br /> <br /> - Another plus is the cast that Castellari had to work with. George Hilton is always good in these films. Gilbert Roland literally plays Gilbert Roland. And newcomer SW Edd Byrnes maintains himself with two SW veterans. Supporting cast, in particular, regular SW Gerard Herter. <br /> <br /> - Any Gun Can Play game should not be taken too seriously. Pleasant touches of humor can be found throughout the film. If this is possible with the help of SW, it’s rather a “feel good” movie - very much like some Terence Hill / Bad Spencer films.
