Well, you know, I was painting my house today, and Elton John’s song appeared on the radio, which immediately brought me back to this film that I saw in 1971. So long and so far. Ten years later, I was hiking through the countryside of France, and I’m sure I would like to see Michelle. The film is probably not very complex by today's standards, more pitiful, but then it seemed rather sharp. A few years later, the sequel was shot in which Michelle lives in a high-rise building in Paris, and Paul returns to her, as in the life in which they lived, the film was very dull. However, the original was awesome, and if you can get a copy, rent it, just remember to give it your due and treat it carefully. I note that Americans can be pretty sanctimonious, so keep in mind that they contain scenes and themes that can upset middle America.
