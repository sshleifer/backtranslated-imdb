My friends and I saw it at the San Diego Black Film Festival. That was great. Stormy is a strong black woman, and Nana reminds me of my grandmother. <br /> <br /> Rene - WELL !!! Watching him take off his clothes was definitely worth it. Can someone send me their contact information? <br /> <br /> My friend thinks that Flex is the best. Although she has been a Flex fan for years, so maybe she’s a bit biased. The cousins ​​were funny and just as trivial as Nana described them. Lol <br /> <br /> I look forward to this movie again when it comes to movie theaters.
