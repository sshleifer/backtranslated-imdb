So well done, without cgi shit. Has anyone else been on the Crocus Jumps tour of the Adelaide Darwin River? The black water was realistic; Rogue was a bit attractive. <br /> <br /> I thought that the blonde was excellent in this - in fact, had not seen her before. And the other chick is a baby, she is always excellent. <br /> <br /> V. in anticipation - I would compare it with Jaws in comparison with any other person who eats animals. <br /> <br /> I got an Aussie without going into OTT with straights and picks. <br /> <br /> Loved it!
