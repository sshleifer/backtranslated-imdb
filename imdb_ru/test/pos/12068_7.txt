This show is actually very good. Like all shows on TV, he has his good and bad episodes. <br /> <br /> I read where people compare this show to “Married with Children,” and I believe that this is a similar show for the new generation. However, due to what was expected and allowed on television on “Married with Children” days, this show was taken to the extreme to show that it really is a television show and should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> War at Home can be a bit more realistic. Parents communicate with each other, as real parents often do, telling their children about one thing when they turn and do the opposite. <br /> <br /> Of course, some materials can be considered controversial. But I think this show is really trying to maintain a sense of honesty. Whether you like it or not, there are many such families. <br /> <br /> Each episode really gives a “valuable lesson”. Just sometimes the lesson is that you will not find the perfect solution for every problem your family may face, and sometimes the solution is to choose the lesser of two evils. We all know that in some cases, being a parent, the only goal you can have is not to let your children have really big problems, and we hope that they learn correctly and not wrong. <br /> <br /> I respect the authors for trying to keep the show true to life, instead of having some kind of magical ending, as the Cleaver family always had.
