A great acting game is best rewarded by a combination of a melodramatic script that truly enhances the spirit of a person. All the minions who work hard every day, have spirit! Your patience is virtuous. Your tolerance and decency will be proof in ways that you never foresee. This is your Great Story. I do not believe that you can look to the end without a drop of moisture in this hardened eye. Or can you? For me, it would not be so ... the story is merciless! The idealist denied his merit. Anyone say? Oh! but you will need to see the show yourself! to observe the teacher in his prime, without notice, and the peer, which the observer must expect. And why does he continue like this? Yes! You should watch O'Toole play for yourself! I can only wish that it was still “in print” to buy, and then present to my friends as proof of respect for their faithful life.
