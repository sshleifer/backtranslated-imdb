This British version of I Am the Camera is based on the Berlin Stories film by Christopher Isherwood. This is the source material for the famous musical Cabaret. <br /> <br /> Julie Harris, the leading actress of her time, repeats her Tony Award in 1951 as Sally Bowles. She is very far from Liza Minnelli's character, but the main “Sally” is all here, despite the various movie codes that would block this story from filming in Hollywood. Harris may be shy, but she is also as good as crazy and crazy Sally. Her vocal number is clearly duplicated (no less Marlene Dietrich), although Harris seems to sing for herself at other times. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Harvey (with very ugly hair) plays Isherwood with zero charm and cannot even make the character interesting Shelley Winters does little with Natalia’s role (Marian Winters won Tony in the background for the role) and Anton Diffring as Fritz. Ron Rundell plays Caddy Clive, but it seems a little loud. Lee Seydl is funny, like a housewife. <br /> <br /> Despite all the entertainment and cheapness, Harris is central, and she is awesome. This film was released the same year as EAST OF EDEN, in which Harris plays a brilliant role in the role of Abra. A comparison of the two performances gives a good idea of ​​the talent Miss Harris has. These two characters can not be more similar. Sally Harris laughs and growls with a very lustful laugh. She also plays in circles around boring Harvey. <br /> <br /> Without music and with a familiar storyline, many viewers may find a little here to recommend this film, but this is a great chance to see how great Julie Harris repeats what was probably a very shocking role in 1951 year
