Oz is by far the best show ever decorated television. Better than The Sopranos, yes, ER, yes, CSI, absolutely. Uncompromising, bold and disturbing, but deeply exciting. Oz led us past any image of a prison that anyone had ever called on television. Tom Fontana really did a great job writing. No topic is forbidden. Rape, drugs, murder. Oz is proof of how good television can be. He follows characters from different walks of life and all races, but always returns to your resident, Tobias Beecher, to jail for manslaughter on a car. We see what we donâ€™t want to see, pain, death, chaos. Oz will bother you, make you cringe, make you look away, but most of all it makes you think. Seeing Oz is truly great television production.
