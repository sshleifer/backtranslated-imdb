I really like this movie because of all the stars, the dances and the story that accompanies it. Rita Hayworth was the most charming in this musical, and the costumes were great. Although I was a musical, I think that Rita Hayworth also played an excellent dramatic game in this film. As for her dance, I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable greatly endorsed Ritaâ€™s dances in this film, as she commented that Rita danced rings around her own dance, and let's face it, Betty Grable was an excellent dancer. Cinematography and bright colors are also marked. Rita wants to be a magazine cover, but she is also in love with her mentor, played by Gene Kelly. Does she leave Kelly to make her dream come true and love and Broadway fame, or is she left to find the unique pearl that will forever change her life? You will need to watch a movie to find out!
