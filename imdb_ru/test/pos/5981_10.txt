This is one of the very, very few films that are so stunning that you are unlikely to watch it more than once or twice in your entire life (other examples are Claud Lanzmann’s documentary “Shoah and Come and See” by director Elema Klimov’s husband) which covers almost the same unbearable territory, but in a completely different way). <br /> <br /> I believe that this is just as good, given the difficulty of ever seeing the imprint. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this unusually clear Christian symbolism and the recognition that there were active Russian collaborators ensured that it was hardly ever seen in the USSR - and, of course, post-Soviet Russia has very little interest in films of that era . <br /> <br /> Once I saw it in London at the festival of Russian films shown in the era of publicity (that is, probably, in 1988) - however, apparently, it was shown several times in the UK recently therefore, there must be at least one print with subtitles. /> <br /> As far as I know, he has never been released in he is leaving for DVD or video, so if you haven’t seen it yet, your best chance is probably to join the cinematic community and endlessly find fault with them so that find the imprint and show it.
