I was at school in the late sixties and early seventies, and this film is very similar to my school. The school play, in which the main actors kiss, happened at my school. Crazy gang of guys, my school again, only when we went to cross-country running, we will have smoke! "Having received a blow," someone at my school broke into the light of heaven and broke his canes! after that they were kept in a safe !!! And as for certain night activities! what can I say ... The film actually came out in 1982, I remember how it was when I bought my house, and the film was being shown at the same time. If you like British films and films about school, growing up and historical works, then this is for you. Another film very similar to this, “SWALK”, was released several years ago, and I, for example, would like to see it again, also “Kes” in the genre. Highly recommended. (But believe me, 1982, when it came out)
