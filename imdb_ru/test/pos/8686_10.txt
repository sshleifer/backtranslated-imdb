I first saw the Princess of the Nile when I was about 10 years old. I am now 63 years old and I have never forgotten the movie. I also did not overcome my fascination with Egypt. I searched the Internet, trying to buy a film, but could not find it. It makes me wonder if this is one of the lost films in Hollywood. I loved Debra Padget and Jeffrey Hunter together. They have such charisma together. If you had asked me anything about the film, I would not have told you anything except the one who was in it. I vaguely remember the scene of Neal with Debra Paget, with a bunch of other women. I always wanted to see her again. Then I never thought of it as an escape film, but now I understand where it probably took place. I hope they release it on DVD and I can see it again before I die. It was a great movie.
