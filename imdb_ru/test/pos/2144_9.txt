Until today, I thought there were only three people, including me, who considered the Gate of Heaven (1980) to be a masterpiece and possibly the last great West (since 1970), after “Little Big Man” (1970), Jeremy Johnson )), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). <br /> <br /> I was stunned and glad to see that 22.5% of those who voted for IMDB rated this film as 10, just like me. A recent book, The Worst Movies of All Time, includes the Gate of Heaven. Thanks to his production and release, he was defiled, like no other film since Cleopatra, almost twenty years ago. At one time he was considered the most expensive superbudget film of all time, surpassing even Cleopatra. It was blamed for the fall of his studio, United Artists, until everyone finally saw that all the studios were falling. Michael Cimino, just out of his fame with the Deer Hunter, hated and despised for his success and making the film, but it is clear that in the worst case it was petty jealousy. <br /> <br /> As a result, Cimino became one of the great expositions of American experience. This film should not be missed, but any serious student of American filmmaking.
