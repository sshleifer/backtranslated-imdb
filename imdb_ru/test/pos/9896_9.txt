I just watched this movie today at the Phoenix Film Festival and I really liked it. The synopsis was listed in our program as "an old Shakespearean actor invites his three children to a suicide party." I wasn't sure if I was going to see it, because when I read about it, I liked the idea of ​​a “suicide party”, it sounded very interesting to me, but the “old Shakespearean actor” made me worry that the film would be good dry boring. But I decided to try. I'm glad I did. It was not so boring and boring that the dialogue was wonderful, clever, funny, but not pretentious and difficult to understand. Peter Falk was awesome in this role, he stole the show. I was also pleasantly surprised by the performance of Laura San Giacomo, she usually annoys me, but I really enjoyed watching her in this film. I think that the role of Judge Reinhold could have been better with another actor, at times he seemed a bit silly, and it looked like a game, and not that you just watched this character. But the film was so good that I could forgive the awkwardness of one actor. I would recommend this film to everyone and have already told several people to watch it as soon as it becomes available to the general public. Who knew suicide could be so fun?
