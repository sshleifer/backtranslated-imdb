A few weeks ago I lost my beloved companion and friend of fourteen, a golden retriever named Sasha. When I came home alone from the animal hospital, after I made one of the most painful decisions in my life, my teenage daughter sat next to me. , .and we talked about this episode of the Twilight Zone. I may be wrong, but I remember the phrase that Arthur Hunnicut said when Satan tried to deceive him, but his dog could not go with him. , and his dog, in turn, grumpily threw at the gatekeeper, who was trying to deceive the old hunter so that he would “step inside” that it will be “one hell of paradise if dogs are not allowed”, and the spirit of the old mountain man and his dog decided to turn away from the gate (what they considered to be a paradise to wander forever alone). What a sad moment when they meet the “good ole” of the country boy on that eternal road, only to find that he is an angel sent to find them, and “of course, the neighbor, of course, dogs are allowed to go to heaven.” <br /> <br /> I admit that I cried when I talked about this with my daughter while we mourned the demise of our beloved gold. Rod Serling was truly a genius, a voice that in the early sixties spoke out against racism, hatred, “unknowing of anything” and inspired me to become a writer. This episode, which lasted forty-five years, brought solace to all who lost a beloved friend. I urge you to get a copy the next time one of the Twilight Zone marathons, or to buy it. There will be tears, but also comfort. As always, thank you, Rod, for everything you taught us. , .even now.
