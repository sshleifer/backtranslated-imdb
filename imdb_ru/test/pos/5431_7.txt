It was an interesting movie ... semi-comedy, semi-political thriller. There were many good elements in it, although it was a bit predictable. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is starring Tom Dobbs, a popular comedian with a hit show in which he gives political commentary. Think Daily Show with John Stewart. During the recording of one of his shows, a woman in the audience tells him that he should run for president. This, followed by a few jokes taken seriously, was all that was needed to spin the ball and start Dobbs' political career. <br /> <br /> He works independently and equally opposes Democrats and Republicans. He is simple and honest, and is becoming increasingly popular - but perhaps not popular enough to truly win. He is clearly a loser in this election. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a corrupt software company has created a program that will make voting easy and fast for ordinary people - but there are some problems. This error was discovered by a young woman named Elanor (Linnley), who was reassured by a software developer with a lie that he fixed this problem before the upcoming elections. <br /> <br /> Election day is coming, and Dobbs is declared the winner. (Big surprise!) Elanor knows that he is not really the president - he did not win legally - she decides to tell the president ... but complications arise. Her company went so far as to poison her to silence her. In addition to this, she quickly enjoys Dobbs. <br /> <br /> The plot takes several turns before it comes to a slightly predictable conclusion. But it was never boring. Robin, as usual, was great, and Christopher Walken often stole the show as Dobbs' manager, who became a political advisor and best friend. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining movie with a good message. I recommend it if you have a mood for dark satire, or something that makes you think. In general, I give him 7/10.
