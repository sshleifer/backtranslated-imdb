Believe it or not, Mona Lisa was stolen once and almost two years gone. In 1911, "La Gioconda" Leonardo da Vinci (better known as Mona Lisa) was taken out of the Louvre by a petty thief (and a former employee of the Louvre), who allegedly sought to return the most famous work of art in the world to his native Italy. His actions after the theft make it more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal gain. (Of course, he did not hope to find a buyer.) Mona Lisa was quietly returned to the Louvre on the very last day of 1913, staying there since then, except for occasional loans. When Arsen Lupine was released in 1932 (twenty years after the theft), most moviegoers would have remembered this crime in 1911, and their knowledge could give this film some plausibility. The Arsen Lupine is quite enjoyable, with the usual high MGM production standards and the usual smartly effective Jack Conway direction. This film is not without pleasure; What is missing is the likelihood. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is the main culprit of this title: he specializes in committing “impossible” crimes, which he makes even more difficult by informing them in advance ... but, of course, he always commits a crime and deceives gendarmes . Talley Marshall has a good scene as one of Barrymore's victims. Lupine has a tendency to complex camouflage, which allows Barrymore (the ham of the American category "A") to indulge his penchant for tomfoolery. John Lionel Barrymore's older brother, Gershard, is a detective resemblance to Javert, vowing to catch Lupine. <br /> <br /> Karen Morley was an extremely beautiful actress, whose private life was filled with populist political activities; on the screen, she was most impressive in working-class roles that matched her own political convictions (for example, her beautiful performance in Our Daily Baking). In Arsen Lupine, Morley's naturally dark hair is bleached with a terrible light tone, and she is dressed in chic outfits that make her look not comfortable, but sexy. <br /> <br /> PERFORMERS. In the end, Lupine decides to steal the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. He cuts the picture from the frame, collapses the canvas, and then takes it to the basket with flowers. We see John Barrymore casually swinging a tightly folded piece of cloth that is supposedly the greatest work of art in human history. I had to laugh at the directors' mistake. In real life (but not in this film), da Vinci painted Mona Lisa on a poplar board, so it would be difficult for a thief to turn it! <br /> <br /> In the end, Gershard captures Lupine and drags him to Le Calabuse. The scene between John and Lionel Barrymore in a police car is admirable, since their sincere affection for each other manifests itself in the dialogue of their characters. I would find this scene implausible with any two other actors. In fact, I can’t imagine anyone but the Barrymore brothers playing these roles. Well, maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid, but hardly. <br /> <br /> Don't look for a good storyline here, but Arsen Lupine is a delightful example of making an old-style film. I rate this movie 8 points out of 10.
