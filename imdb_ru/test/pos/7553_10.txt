I first met “Four Friends” by Arthur Penn late at night on HBO. Having never heard of this, I expected very little, but I watched, because it was interesting for me to see what the creation of Penn’s team and scriptwriter Steve Tesich would be like. For the next two hours, I sat hypnotized, watching this incredible team of talents and the story they had made. A semi-autobiographical story about a young immigrant in America who grew up in the turbulence of the 1960s, Four Friends tells the story of Danilo, an Eastern European immigrant (brilliant Craig Wasson), from his arrival in the United States after a decade that changed the American landscape. Together with Danilo on his journey, his friends from Georgia (radiant Jody Thelan, unfortunately, she never had equal), Tom (Jim Metzler) and David (Michael Huddleston) accompany him. “Four Friends” covers too much territory for me to try to explain here, but if you have not seen this film, I urge you to find a copy (it has just been released on DVD) and watch it. You will not be disappointed. Tesic's script surprisingly sharp ?? sometimes funny, sometimes incredibly sad, but always exciting and honest. Penn leads a confident hand and an obvious love for that period and the people whose lives we follow. The cast is evenly superior. This film was supposed to make the main star of Wasson, who really is one of the most spent talent of this country. Jodi Thelan, not your standard brainless Hollywood sex sweat, heats up the screen in a performance that makes the audience love her character as easily as the characters in the movie. The subtle speeches of Metzler and Huddleston can be easily overlooked in the shadow of their colleagues, but they are excellent and help to fix the film. Also great are Miklos Simon and Elizabeth Lawrence as Danilo's parents, as well as Reed Byrney and Lois Smith. I have not been left without a copy of "Four Friends" since the day I first saw him on HBO many years ago. It was and remains one of my favorite films for over 20 years. I cannot recommend it enough and I feel that if you give it a chance, you will feel the same.
