Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is rarely my favorite, said that everyone should watch this movie, because this is something that can help heal the world .... <br /> <br /> This is one of the sharpest films, which I saw and commented on Tutu's comments .... I read a lot of comments, and although they range from good to medium and comment on the choice of actors ... The fact is that this is one of the most unusual events in our world. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission ... for the first time, the country decided to talk about its horrible history, find a way forward and create a way to heal people ... <br /> <br /> While the film begins with offering White Police a chance free yourself from violent crimes, and the Black guy is trying to make sure that he does not get away with it, he delves into the humanity of people and the tremendous need for healing that we all need .... <br /> <br /> Definitely great fingers ..... to everyone who participates in this .... Once again, I am proud to be South African ..... <br /> <br /> An interesting comments can be found here: http://www.biz-community.com/Article/196/97/5223.html
