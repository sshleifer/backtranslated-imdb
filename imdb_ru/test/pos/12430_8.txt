It was on Showtime last night, and I thought it would be another crappy festival specially created for the video, such as Earth vs. Spider or any of those other HBO horror shorts. Instead, I found a comedy / blood classic. It was really fun, and surprisingly, the acting was pretty good. Even my wife, a terrible hater, agreed and laughed at the details. In addition, the FX were high quality. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film looked like a parody of Joy Ride / Jeepers Creepers, and the 2 main characters reminded me of a couple from Shaun of the Dead. Definitely worth a look, but don't take it seriously. <br /> <br /> End.
