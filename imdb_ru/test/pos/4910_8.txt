The story that a widowed father (Claude Raines) is raising his four daughters. Emma (Gail Page) loves big fat man Ernest (Dick Foran). Thea (Lola Lane) is in a novel with an old but rich man. Kay (Rosemary Lane) wants to be a singer. Ann (Priscilla Lane) - romantic. Deadly handsome Felix Deutz (Jeffrey Lynn), the business partner of their father, comes to stay with them. All sisters fall in love with him. Then comes the hard cynical Mickey (John Garfield) ... <br /> <br /> A very interesting film was a great success and was nominated for five Academy Awards. He is well directed by Michael Chicken, has a pretty good (if predictable) script and a VERY attractive cast (especially Lynn). It was also the first film by John Garfield and made him a star. It was so popular, there were three or four sequels (which I have never seen). This is an exciting, interesting, big budget soap opera - which is worth seeing.
