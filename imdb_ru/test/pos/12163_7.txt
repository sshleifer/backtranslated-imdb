After being quit their last job and not finding a job in the United Kingdom, six members of the “Wonderful Guys”, better known as the “Crazy Gang”, saw an announcement about finding a job in the city of the Golden Gulch strike in Yukon. This is from a newspaper clipping, and on the back there is a story about Chamberlain, who said that it is better for the country to be ready for war. Off they go to the Yukon and the Ice Borders. <br /> <br /> By the way, the case of inappropriate Chamberlains. The haircut is forty years old, and it refers to Joe Chamberlain and the Boer War, and not to Neville in the current crisis. But this is typical of things that go for this team. I see that Stan Laurel makes the same mistake. <br /> <br /> Of course, when they get there, this is a ghost town in which only young Jean Kent and her grandfather Moore Marriott live. He has been doing for years and is a little touched in his head. Marriott has a gold mine that he lost somewhere, where he goes in his sleep, that is, when he moans. Bande better help him find that my pretty Miss Kent never marries the strong catcher Anthony Halma, but rather the salon owner Bernard Lee, a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> This was my first encounter with the Mad Gang and I can understand why they are so welcome in the UK and why they have never had any impact on the whole pond. Jokes are quick and furious, and then it was a series of things that the Code in the United States simply would not allow. The jokes are also strictly British, and much will not work here. <br /> <br /> The sights are universal, the final scene of the pursuit is worthy of everything that the Marx brothers did in America. My suggestion is that if you watch Frozen Limits, tape it down, if you have a working acquaintance with British history, and run it two or three times just to make sure you’ve picked it all up. It will be worth it.
