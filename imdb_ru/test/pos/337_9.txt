I finally caught a copy of Kannatil Mutamittal through Netflix and spent New Hera's Eve, watching an amazing drama unfold. It all started when Shyama (charming Nandita Das) married Dilipan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka, and then the war seized their romance. Syama is forced to flee to India and is in a refugee camp because she gives birth to a child. A few years later, we see Amudha, a playful beloved child (P. S. Keerthana), who is a favorite (or burden) of teachers, parents and classmates, in the episode "How to solve a problem like Mary." On her birthday, parents Tiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) tell her that she is not their biological child, she was adopted. It tilts her confident, love-filled world, and she constantly thinks why her own mother left her. Several attempts to stroll after her adoptive parents bring her to Sri Lanka to try to find her birth mother. The country is torn apart by a brutal civil war, and the trio is inevitably drawn into disorder. But this also leads to their meeting with a new Syama - the one who finally encountered Amudha and asked why she left her daughter. <br /> <br /> The story of a child who has to contend with the fact that she was abandoned at birth, her obsessive desire to be reunited with her own mother, unconditional love of adoptive parents, demons that control the mother, normal Chennai terrorism devastated by Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam shot a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that excites the soul. Music by A.R. Rahman perfectly complements the magical and poignant moments in the film. In the film, the magnificent performances of Madhavan, Nandita Das, Simran and the absolutely stunning role of Amudha - abandoned - performed by the actress of the child P. S. Kirthana. This performance brought her the National Award. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is visual poetry - every frame is beautifully made and amazingly filmed. I was intrigued by Mani Ratnam’s connection with terrorism, love and obsession. I think his study of these subjects is absolutely outstanding. Mahadevan's character was completely unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, rather, he was well combined with how much he cared about the little girl. His one airliner was fun. Simran’s mother was also multifaceted — she was an idealist, she loved her adopted daughter, but she was also worried about her biological children. Shock, longing and obsession with a child Amudha perfectly portrayed P. S. Kirthana. Her wide blaming eyes made most of the talk. In fact, the mysterious characters were Nandita Das and her husband. Perhaps, Mani deliberately made them mysterious, so as not to give us clear ideas about why they were what they were - the mystery of why a terrorist becomes what he becomes. It also did not allow him to be judgmental - it was another conflict in which he did not take any sides, but simply told, showing human tragedy. <br /> <br /> Kannatil Mutamittal is a visual poetry and drama that inspires the soul — I rarely cry in films, but this one left me with wet eyes and a little heartbreaking. This beautiful film is a treasure and a keeper, if you can find a copy; Please lend or steal one today and watch a movie!
