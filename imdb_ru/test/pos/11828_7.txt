I do not think this cartoon was as bad as some might think. Of course, I was only five years old when he came out. But at that time I found it very interesting and would still look today if I had the opportunity. Batman and Robin were voiced by Adam West and Burt Ward, it was a pleasant touch, and I felt their familiarity, as I also watched replays of the live-action movie of the 1960s Batman at that age. In this cartoon, there are also some new twists, which I completely forgot, for example, "Bat-Mite". Looking back, I am sure that he was probably as annoying as many think, but he did not bother me at the time. As I recall, his voice sounded like a cross between stupid Donald and Orco. Gee, I wonder why? :) In any case, see if you can, and decide. You may be surprised.
