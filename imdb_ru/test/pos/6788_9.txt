My family watches this movie again and again. Even our 3 year old loves it. I like the "kindness" in the film. Giving a stranger a chance ... manifesting goodwill to a person who clearly needs unconditional acceptance. The film gives a feeling of goodwill and victory. Another aspect of the film that makes it so attractive is the identity of the velvet brothers and sisters. Bird lover. Bugs lover. Boy lover! Very cute and funny movie. There is one thing that is annoying. That is how Mrs. Brown often makes Mr. Brown look stupid or unwise. She sometimes comes off as you know all this, but he is like a scumbag, which he is not. Too bad to put it in such a good story. Nevertheless, we will continue to enjoy this wonderful, old film!
