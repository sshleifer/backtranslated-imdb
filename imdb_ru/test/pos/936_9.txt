This is the last film of Krzysztof Keslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. He was going to resign after this film, so in a sense this is his artistic testament. He died a couple of years after the film was made, and although it is said that he intended to return to directing, Fate decided that this was indeed his last incident. And what a movie! <br /> <br /> The last film in the three-color French trilogy “Rouge” is actually very Swiss. Being in Geneva, one of the two main characters - a Swiss judge in retirement, and immediately comes to mind Durenmatt. But more of Switzerland in a cool atmosphere, in the absence of communication of characters, in politeness that envelops the cruelty of life. Several characters, starting with a small number of relationships, will converge at the end in an exciting and human finale that only a great artist could put on. <br /> <br /> Little else can be said that was not said and written a hundred times. Yes, the film begins slowly, and fans of American-style action films or melodramas are discouraged first and lost as spectators. They deserve it. As the movie progresses, it acquires quality, and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real people are more interesting than the Hollywood cartoon, plastic action and characters. The quality of the movie is very original, as the name implies, the image “Study in Red”. Acting incredibly, with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignan - later in what is likely to remain the best part of his old age. <br /> <br /> Great movie. Seeing this again probably adds, and I am glad that it is taped. 9/10 on my personal scale.
