I would like to start by saying that I can only hope that the creators of this film and his sister film “The Intruder” (directed by the great unidentified author of the stylist Jopi Bournam) know in their hearts what pleasure they brought me and my friends in the sleepy north the eastern city of Jarrow. <br /> <br /> From the preliminary credit sequence, which can be slightly tightened, despite the fact that a man crashes into a window on a motorcycle, the ruthless destruction of the lab’s silence, the presentation of one of the most simultaneously annoying and anemic bad guys in the history of film and design costumes that Jean-Paul Gauthier would have found frightening. Make no mistake; This is a truly unique experience. An early highlight is an explosion (getting used to it, much more, where it went from!), Followed by a close-up of our plump heroine and the most fun reading of the word “dad” in living memory. And then ... a themed song ... <br /> <br /> Yes, it deserves a separate paragraph. Sung by AJ, written by people who really want to remain anonymous, he makes songs written for Rocky movies sound like Schubert. This crappy narcissism of the heroes of the 80s at all times at a high level, with such lyrical texts as "it's just me and you, he goes down to the wire" and a lot of talk about the need to "cross the line" (it will make sense in time Our hero cares little about the boundaries of police work. Not to mention the fact that Indonesian "Suprems" are seductively screaming the name of the film. At the moment, anyone who wants to officially disconnect does not have a pulse. <br /> <br /> Our the hero is Semitic policeman Peter Goldson (brilliantly composed by a star - violator Peter O'Brien), “stabilizer" of the title. The human bull in the approach to fighting crime in the Chinese shop and, in particular, his not too noticeable work under cover really leaves much to be desired, but he is undoubtedly an interesting guide along the evil streets of the center of Jakarta, with the local mean ball connecting Captain Johnny to the Evacuator, as well as Peter's own waste of space partner on fashionable crime, Sylvia Nash, who does little. So many bright moments, so little time - “slide, please,” Peter’s arrogance, not too convincingly reasoned case against the main villain Greg Rainmaker (Fans of attackers will recognize the bastard sludge Craig Gavin as monstrous John White - damn well? .), x denotes a local location map, stupidity, our hero takes the terrible advantage of the heroine Tina Probost during weakness on her behalf, the latter appears on the operation with a bite, dressed as a member of the army’s particularly bright dance. And believe me, it barely covers it. <br /> <br /> There wasn’t even time to tackle a story about finding a drug detection system and a kidnapped professor with an alarming but laudable amount of national pride. Or our hero, who appeared at the funeral, dressed as if in “Boogie Nights”. Or absolutely hysterical madness between captain Johnny and Goldson - two guys have never experienced more difficult weather than these clowns. It seems to me that the shoulder blade was too thin. <br /> <br /> Ah, this is lagging behind people, and you never thought that the scenes of senseless destruction and general confusion can be so incredibly boring, but the interaction of the characters is enormous, the dialogue is really priceless and the incompetence on the show somehow fascinates . Oh, and shoe people - beware of shoes!
