A great little groundbreaking film (in 1955) on an important topic. <br /> <br /> I did not expect much from Sinatra's performance and was pleasantly surprised by this. Beloved Kim Novak! She was gorgeous! <br /> <br /> I really liked Elmer Bernstein's jazz score! As great as Laszlo Shifrin for "Bullitt"! I am very surprised that it is not available on CD (if someone knows about the availability of the soundtrack in any other format, he should publish it somewhere here!). <br /> <br /> The direction of Preminger, as usual, was borderline impeccable. <br /> <br /> I didn’t read the novel by Nelson Algren and didn’t imagine how true the script was. Frankie’s plot as a “hot” card dealer was also unexpected, as were some other things. But see for yourself. It is very worth seeing ...
