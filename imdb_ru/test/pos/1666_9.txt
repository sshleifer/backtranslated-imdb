I heard that they are going to remake this French classic in 2007, and I see that it is being developed in 2011. This will be a shame, since Hollywood expelled writer / director Jules Dassin because of the infamous blacklist. They should not have the right to remake any of his films. <br /> <br /> I love the Privateer and Noir films, and this combines the best of both. <br /> <br /> Tony (Jean Servays) comes out after making nickel, and after he beats up his old girlfriend (Marie Sabour), he plans a big bill with his friends Mario (Robert Manuel) and Joe (Karl Möner), which makes him a great caper. Flick is attention to detail when planning a robbery. You see what is reflected in the capers of George Clooney Vegas. Nothing is left to chance. <br /> <br /> Capers plays great, but Grütter (Marcel Lupovichi) sends his sons, Robert Hossein and Pierre Grasset behind Tony and the gang. After they blew him up with Mario, they kidnapped son Joe. Many bullets fly before it ends. <br /> <br /> An excellent film by a great director. The standard by which other caper films are measured.
