There is a great danger when you watch a movie that has had such a profound impact on you for the first time, that 20 years later it will not have the same magic as before. I must admit that I did not expect it to be as good as I remembered, but I was pleasantly surprised. P'tang Yang Kipperbang is still fantastic, as I recall, when I was 12 years old. This film has a certain brilliance, which not many films possess. It's exciting, it works brilliantly, and, best of all, I feel like a child again, and not many things that can do it. The rolls of John Albasine and Abigail Cruttenden in this film belong to the 1st class, and I still forgot how good they are. I urge any teen parent to sit down and look at it and see if it will be the same as it is about me. P'TANG YANG KIPPERBANG EEHHH! 10 out of 10.
