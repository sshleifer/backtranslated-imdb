“Dresser” is a small but absolutely wonderful film in which Albert Finney and Tom Courtney brilliantly starred. How in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to collect the five major Academy Award nominations in 1983 is a mystery to me, but it's nice to know that the Academy can be guilty from time to time to demonstrate good taste “Affection Terms” award - after all, they don’t want to be accused of displaying TOO TOO great taste). <br /> <br /> Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespearean actor in the production of "King Lear"; Tom Courtney is a man who works behind the scenes twice to hold this actor in front of the spotlights. It is both funny and sad to see Courtney’s character show Finney’s attention with love and attention, only to see how his efforts are completely underestimated and ignored, right up to the very end. Finney and Courtney work wonders together, and although Finney gets the brightest moments (he still reads Shakespeare), Courtney is the heart and soul of the film. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
