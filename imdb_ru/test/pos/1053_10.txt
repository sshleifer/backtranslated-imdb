Stanwick and Morgan are excellently played in many ways, which is in many ways the modern equivalent of Dickens's Christmas song in its sensitivity. The success of the film depends on the role of Sydney Greenstreet as the character of Alexander Yardley. Yardley is the modern equivalent of Dickens Scrooge in how he exercises control over his staff until the spirit of Christmas overtakes him. The role is “The Walk in the Park” for Greenstreet, which was one of the greatest falstaffs on stage when it was part of the Lunts company. Greenstreet appeared in films only five years ago, when, at the age of 61, he was shown in what was supposed to be a classic of the film, the first and best John Houston film ever shot: The Maltese Falcon. Scaldles Sacall has probably never been better in his traditional role of embodying Central European gemmutlicheit. The attractive set used for most of the film is a pleasant eye.
