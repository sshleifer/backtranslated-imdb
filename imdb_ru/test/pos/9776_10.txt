As soon as I saw the Changi ad on the historical channel, I realized that I would like it. He fantastically captured the spirit of Anzac - you would die if there were no comrades around you. The Changi characters were strong, and each contributed something of their own to history, and the Japanese soldiers were not criticized, but were portrayed as ordinary soldiers doing what they thought was right, just like the Australians. The directing, the script, the acting and the staging were superbly done, with a clear, understandable plot. Humor was the key to the survival of the soldiers, and it was great to see that there was some kind of humor in the mini-series about the war that is usually difficult to do without offensive people. From what I read about the soldiers in Changi Pou camp, this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years spent there by Australians, British, New Zealanders, Americans and Dutch. I would recommend this series to everyone, regardless of whether you are interested in the war or not. 10/10
