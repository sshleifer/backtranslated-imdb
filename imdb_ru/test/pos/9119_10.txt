I watched this movie on a happy accident. I was standing on 42nd Street, waiting for the bus to go home, and my sister started handing out free tickets to preview this film. I gave him a chance, not expecting much. What was seen on the walls of the metro station, does not give this film any justice. <br /> <br /> The film is about a young rocker who sets off on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal. Leave it there. The film is a heavy comedy, and it is very funny. If you are old enough to remember when Heavy Metal dominated the music scene in the eighties, you'll love this movie. Jack Black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor suggesting that he really wrote and performed songs in this film, he is also a talented musician. <br /> <br /> “Tenacious D” is definitely worth seeing!
