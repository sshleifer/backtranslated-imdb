I liked it, probably a little more than “Horror at Night,” but not enough to give it an extra *. The start is just brilliant when we look at the Nazi agents intending to get a new bomb sight and its inventor in a small Swiss village, only to be ripped off by disguised Holmes, who sends the scientist back to London. Once there, he is doing everything possible so that the scientist does not fall into the hands of the man behind all this - not Hitler, but, worse, the sworn enemy of Holmes Moriarty. Of course, the scientist disappears, leaving a teasing encoded note, and Holmes goes in pursuit, again disguised. The climax in Moriarty’s mooring den is quite exciting, and we can all guess that everything ends well, right? Slightly overly patriotic message, like captions. Now that I think about it, the wonderful feeling of the place, despite the obvious scenery, the use of Rathbone's disguise and the way in which so much of the plot fits a little over an hour - what the hell does it get such extra * and is my favorite from 5 Ratbone / Bruce which I have seen today. <br /> <br /> I watched on DVD, included in the series "50 Mystery Classics" from Mill Creek Entertainment. Many of the programs on these cheap boxes are of very poor quality, but Holmes fans point out that Rathbone / Bruce films (in this set of 4) are all pretty watchable and quite sharp.
