What can I say? Not as bad as many here have done it. The only reason I even watched this movie, which I had never heard of before, is strictly for Ian McShane. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed in the least. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings amazing subtlety to his role. It's always nice to watch him and for my money ... an extremely underrated actor. <br /> <br /> Regarding the rest of the film ... Every other actor in the film showed strong, solid performances. These people, of course, were not paid huge sums of money for participation (as it was a fairly budget film), but this did not mean that some of them “mailed” their performances. All were convincing and irresistible with these roles. them. <br /> <br /> I was even pleasantly surprised by Adrian Paul’s performance, although I have to admit that I only saw him in the HIGHLANDER television series before this film. <br /> <br /> The plot was a good tempo and the storyline is intriguing and very similar to real life, not everything ends up in a beautiful, neat package for you at the end of the film. Anyone who expected a clear, by numbers, connecting dots "conclusion" or "answer" at the end of the film ... CLEAR did not watch the film carefully enough! This film does not tell you what the "meaning of life" is! The idea is that after watching a movie, you can go and discuss unanswered questions with friends over a cup of coffee. I certainly did. <br /> <br /> No car chases ... No explosions ... No fights at the bar ... (sounds pretty boring, right?) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed in the film, and it's just well written A small piece with an interesting hook and solid performances of characters from all parties involved. <br /> <br /> ****** WARNING ... ****** If you are the person who doesn’t like films in which the huge “question” becomes the main engine of the story, then end the film, without answering this particular question directly ... <br /> <br /> YOU CAN'T GET THIS MOVIE.
