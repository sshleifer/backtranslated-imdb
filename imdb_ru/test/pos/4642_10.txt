For a movie that was PG, this is one funny movie. I grew up watching this movie again and again. It's really fun, I donâ€™t know how the audience will react today, but if you grew up on it or loved the 80s, then this is a great movie. Stephen Furst is great in the role of Harold, who, I think, is one of the best characters in the film. Paul Ruebens also appears about 10 minutes. I love nostalgia.
