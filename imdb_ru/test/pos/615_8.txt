In the film "Robe d'Ete" by Francois Ozon, there is not a single boring moment. It's amazing how much is packed in this short film. Lying on a deserted beach after swimming in the nude, a young girl is approached by a girl who is looking for a lighter for her cigarette. She invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. Upon returning to the beach. they discover that all his clothes have been stolen. She lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness, and asks for his return the next day. He rides his bike back to the cottage, dressed like a girl. His gay companion is sexually aroused. Early in the morning of the next day the young man returns to the sea and says goodbye to the girl whose holiday is over. She suggests that he leave the dress as a souvenir of their summer romance. It is a carefree film that reflects the spirit of summer holidays by the sea, but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nude or homosexual topics.
