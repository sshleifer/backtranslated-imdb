Well ... it's time! Van Damme is back and kicks in this action movie, which is his best film in recent years. The plot is not very inventive, but the whole issue of border patrols is interesting, and former marines, as the drug smugglers use to turn, are cool. But what makes this movie awesome is the fact that Van Damme returned to martial arts again. His latest films were more focused on acting, but in Shepard JCVD ​​rejects the bad guys again and looks in great shape. There are several impressive wrestling scenes, and Van Damme shows that he can still pull out the old famous heel kick with a 360 degree rotation. Being a low-budget fighter, he has good scenery and great stunts. Van Damme speaks several humorous lines and shows that he is improving as an actor. I am glad that he returned to applying some Van Damage ... I was disappointed by the lack of struggle in his recent films. Scott Adkins is great in his role, and Van Damme and he at the end have a 1: 1 disassembly. In general, this is one of the best Van Damme films, and it will entertain you. Must be rented for JCVD ​​fans. I just keep my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic, such as Bloodsport or Kickboxer. Nok Soo Kou!
