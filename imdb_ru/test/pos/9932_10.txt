Being a fan of Dario Argento and the Phantom of the Opera, I was eager to see his first look at history, before Dario Argento’s “Phantom of the Opera” was so good. The film is simply amazing, even the plot, which is one of the best in Argento in a coherent story. The way he turns a classic romantic story into a creepy slasher is simply amazing. The film has a very dreadful feeling that helps keep you on the edge of your seat. Colors have never been better in the Argento movie since the time of the terrific Suspiria. The killings are smart and bloody, all done in the Argento corporate style. Dealing with the eyes in this film is simply disturbing, and done much better than in the spray of Fulci. Acting is so-so, but as soon as you watch the movie more, you better understand the motives of the characters and get used to it. My two biggest complaints about this are rock music. I think it was a smart idea to mix beautiful opera pieces with heavy metal, but here it is not very well executed. The ending is VERY disappointing, which is the worst thing in the film, it seems to repeat the previous “Phenomena” of Argento, but it was done terribly, it just didn’t have to end this way. The same thing happened in the director's version of The Exorcist. I would like them to keep the original ending. But, nevertheless, this is a fantastic motion picture and you really need to look, at least for the memorable sequence of the murder of Darya Nicolodi.
