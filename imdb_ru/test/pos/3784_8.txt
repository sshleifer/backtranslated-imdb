Charles Chaplin’s Shoulder Weapon of 1918 was his longest film to date, although for a little more than 45 minutes it was not exactly a feature film. While World War I was only nearing its end, many popular artists of the time contributed to inspire native troops, and Chaplin was no exception. And so cute Tramp went to war! The film begins with Tramps in training, and the character is cheerful even in the most basic military exercises, including marching and firing weapons, to the disgust of his sergeant. Then the Tramp is in the trenches, faced with a more formidable opponent, although the Germans end up being infinitely more incompetent than even he. The tormenting moment, when Tramp declares that he alone captured thirteen German soldiers, “surrounding them”, made me get stuck. <br /> <br /> There are many other great moments in this movie. Chaplin, waking up to find his sleeping barracks under water, and unable to literally find his own feet, is fun, as well as his ingenious use of a pipe from a record player to sleep under the surface. <br /> <br /> However, most of the unforgettable scenes in the film undoubtedly include Chaplin, hiding behind enemy lines in the guise of a tree. The reaction of clumsy German soldiers, unconsciously located just a few meters from the sworn enemy when they are alone disconnected one by one, is very funny, especially when one soldier grabbed an ax with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewood. <br /> <br /> This is a very nice movie, one of Chaplin’s best works until 1920. Highly recommended.
