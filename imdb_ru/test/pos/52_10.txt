This is a must see movie. You will laugh, you will cry, and when it is over, you will want more of them. Well written and persuasive, this film draws you close and holds on tight. The casting was perfect, the characters were purposeful, and the performances were outstanding. “Nanny” is a standard to which all women should relate: strong, forgiving, protective and never judgmental. The “nanny”, for me, is the embodiment of what the Christian mother and woman should be: the true pillar of society. If I were a half-woman "Nanny", I could assume that I was fine. I would have been devastated if Nanny had died at some point in the film, but since she did not die, I would definitely buy it when it was released on DVD. I can only hope that the story continues and Ruben returns to Lackawanna to try to rebuild the city, piece by piece and person by person.
