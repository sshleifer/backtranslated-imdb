I have seen several films by Yul Brynner - but this is his best performance, as the camera captures his close-up emotions when he growls, smiles and laughs. Brynner could be equally arrested in The Ten Commandments, Taras Bulba, The Magnificent Seven, Brother Karamazov, and Mad Woman Shayo, but none of these films captured his range of talents in close-ups, as in this . He arrests and torments, watching each shot. <br /> <br /> Deborah Kerr, equally charming and sexy, without taking off her clothes, is Deborah Kerr. The script allows her to radiate sensuality, not visual, but suggestive - she repeated this role years later in The Iguana Nights. The film does not suggest that she slept with someone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the Russians. In fact, it is shown as fleeing from the Russian major (unlike the history of Maupassant or the story of Isak Denizen). Yet the film explodes with the supposed but real physical charm of the character of Kerr. <br /> <br /> Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress, in my opinion, but she is an excellent actress. She puts her soul into the dignity of the characters she portrays, which is often contrary to the spirit of the character. It is this contradiction that makes her roles in “Journey,” “Kuo Vadis,” and “Night of the Iguana” memorable. <br /> <br /> Why this unusual film? In Hollywood, it is not easy to see Russian characters depicted as good people - Dr. Zhivago was an exception. “The Romance of the Horse” by Brynner was again Abraham Polonsky’s excellent cinema, but was never recognized as such because of his intolerance of the left in the post-McCarthy era. <br /> <br /> The film is also unusual in its film. French actors Gerard Uri and Anouque Amy - chatting with Jason Robards Jr. and British actor Robert Morley. In many ways, the film is international than American. All four are great actors who complement the entertainment. <br /> <br /> Those who read the works of Maupassant and Denizen, will find that the film does not correspond to any of these works. However, the film can stand on its own, as its disinfected (censored?) Version has its own charm - secured by the reality of the night, which led to the release of the group. I think that Litvak deserves one last laugh, providing an interesting and believable turn in the stories that led to the film, while intertwining the bits of both written stories (for example, the last bus ride and the last kiss) <br /> <br / > But I have one grouse-why Hollywood never recognizes sources that inspire stories? Only recently (for example, Insomnia) original works began to be mentioned in the credits.
