Cuba Gooding, ml. will receive an Oscar for BEST ACTER in 2003. And Ed Harris will win for BEST SUPPORT. What a beautiful and piercing film, but do not forget to bring along a box with tissues, because if this film is not available to you, it means ice water in your veins. <br /> <br /> It was 1976. The settlement was in South Carolina, and the Civil Rights Act was about ten years. We have a white school coach and football teacher Ed Harris. In addition, there is a scared but pleasant black guy Cuba Gooding, whose biggest things, including the radio, add up to the shopping basket, which is also used as his bicycle. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris takes a keen interest in the guy for the reason explained much later in the film. He gives Cuba the nickname "Radio", and later it is an absolutely exciting, exciting and penetrating study of the human soul. <br /> <br /> The film is nothing but a masterpiece.
