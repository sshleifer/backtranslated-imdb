America's Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. He has a great hostess, great guests, great products and some of the best professionals in the model world who are contributing to things that have not yet been achieved: imagine a real American model Top Top. Of course, this is not so easy to do, so in the US and the world there would already be 10 best models that compete in this cruel world. <br /> <br /> But it is obvious that his intention is not to present America’s Next Top Model, but yes, the American pop model Next. The show collects a bunch of models without experience with different personalities and big personal, professional and financial problems, giving them a chance to make their dreams come true or make their lives something worthy. It is obvious that Tyra Banks uses all this to his advantage, she gives a dream, but in exchange for this she gets an audience and great popularity. In any case, she deserves it, because she is smart and, if I may say so, is the pioneer of this kind of show. Taira is also an excellent observer and knows how to give informed opinions, differing from other models and the owner of foreign versions of the NEXT TOP MODEL franchise. In Brazil, for example, Fernanda Motta is its owner and “once” is the most popular model. She doesn’t even have 1/10 of Tyra’s professional skills, which keeps Tyra Banks on top. Tyra has professional and personal knowledge of what she says, and she is an excellent mentor, because she not only criticizes, but also points out a mistake and teaches in the wise way correctly. <br /> <br /> The show does not suffer from big problems, it performs and fulfills what it promises during cycles. The models chosen for the show are not really the best unknown models in the whole country, because Tyra Banks is betting on the difference, and she’s right because she (and most of her audience) thinks it’s time to model the world to change some direct options. During the cycles, she and her team really hold fair discussions when the weakest ones leave, and the promising ones have new chances to prove their abilities, but they must be quick to do this, otherwise they will lose it. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting thing is that Tyra also knows who decides who should or should not win, even if she is against the opinions of people. She knows that the one who wins will be known, but he has very few opportunities to become a truly recognized top model in the whole world. At the same time, she knows that sometimes second place is more valuable than first, because first place wins the title, and second place does not receive stigma in the title. She hardly makes mistakes when deciding the future of any model during the show. <br /> <br /> After 9 cycles, the series gets a little tired of old ideas, it's time for Tyra to change some things and lines, because it gets boring, and compared to the first cycles, we see that she is also bored, so she needs to do this, if she wants the show to live a little longer. <br /> <br /> In any case, the show explores the fashion and model world, but it is also interesting for those who live outside of it all. This enables some girls as well as the market, and also gives excellent advice to those from the audience who share the same dream.
