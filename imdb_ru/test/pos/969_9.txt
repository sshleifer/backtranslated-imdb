“Big fat liar” is, in my opinion, an absolutely funny movie from a moral point of view. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - "Malcolm in the Middle") and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - "All That") played these tricks with Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR), I really smiled and felt good. That's what I liked most about this movie. In fact, everything that happened after Jason's essay mistakenly fell into Marty’s hands was ridiculous. I especially liked the camel Jalil White. When I first saw him, I was not sure, but when I asked my mother if he was, she replied: “Of course!” Before finishing, I would like to say: “As I said earlier, this story has a moral and this moral is always telling the truth. ” Now, in conclusion, if you're a fan of Frankie Muniz, Amanda Bynes, or Paul Giamatti, I highly recommend this absolutely funny movie from a moral point of view.
