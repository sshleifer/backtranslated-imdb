I like films about strange people. “One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest” is perhaps my favorite for all time, so you can imagine that I had a blast with that. This is definitely not the one to watch if you want to leave with a smile. This film is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are frightening, even after a few views (because this kind of thing can really happen). This will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the trip. And after you see the end, if you are not very worried, you really should check yourself for a pulse. <br /> <br /> The game was phenomenal. Marcie, with her rather extreme tourette case, moves from bizarrely sweet to completely terrifying, sometimes it seems so uncontrollable that she looks like undead. Seth was great too. The film’s focus is definitely not so much on its side as Marcy, although he tends to gain momentum as a blooming character. <br /> <br /> This is a classic love story with some unconventional twists and turns, and this is also my favorite love story alongside A True Romance. There are two bad reviews here, but one of the people who gave such a review did not express his facts directly and confessed that he hadn’t seen the whole movie, while the other was just looking for the thrill of Hollywood without deep characters. (and may have been a bit confused by the apparent pettiness of the plot, since the end goal revolves around stealing a black hairpin from a toy store). The fact is that this film is not for those who want to see something “normal” or “carefree”. This is confused and indie, as it may be, and will not let you go until a severe climax.
