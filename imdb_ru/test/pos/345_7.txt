Reanhauer (Bill Roy) - the leader of a cult living in the desert who is trying to resurrect one of his people, but he has a heart attack! In the end, he dies on the operating table, and for the sake of revenge his spirit captures the body of the main character (Jill Jacobson), who then begins to crack and chop until her nurses know what needs to be done. to banish the demon. <br /> <br /> Although I know enough about directors' filmography, to understand that it mainly consists of a frank slok, "Nurse Sherry" is actually not that bad. Of course, it is clear that it was very budget material, but all I found in it is blatantly stupid, these are visual effects. Acting is not as bad as you would expect. <br /> <br /> Two different versions are available on DVD. A much more sexually oriented version with abundant T & A - this is the original cut, in which such silly silly vignettes, like the victim and her love interest, share their “weird sex” moments, including fellatio during a lecture in college! br /> <br /> The film will then be cut for the theatrical version with the elements of horror emphasized more strongly. Some scenes are omitted with the addition of new ones (with Stevens, the role of JC Wells, extended). The most memorable sequence of films in this episode is the scene in the foundry, and it works quite well. This piece of the film is more interesting in general; I would recommend the viewer to see them both and compare them. <br /> <br /> Both versions reached their goal in the final third and benefited from the amazing theft of the scene from Bill Roy as the crazy Reanhauer and the grim climax set in the cemetery (though actually filmed in Adamson's back yard!). Marilyn Joy is also worth mentioning as a pretty nurse who attracts a footballer who became a patient to Marcus Washington (Prentiss Malden), who lost his eyes in a car accident and who, by the way, plays a key role in resolving this story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals. The film also funny uses music from the personal collection of the composer Harry Lubins, including compositions for such TV series as One Step Beyond the Limits and Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> “Nurse Sherry” (known for more alternative titles (including “Beyond the Living” and “Hospital of Terror”) than in any other Adamson film) is actually quite an interesting low-budget fare. I had a good time watching this. <br /> <br /> 7/10
