Age cannot tarnish the beauty of this love story between East and West. Without paying attention to the famous and beautiful title song and its lyrics, we have a dramatized biography of two remarkable people who are caught up in countering social harmony, bigotry, war, doubts and the need for tremendous courage. Against the background of Hong Kong, this film tells the story of a Eurasian doctor and an American journalist who meet and fall in love during the Korean War. Like Mark Elliott, William Holden is smart, light and a little weak; Jennifer Jones, perhaps, is almost perfect, as Dr. Han Suyin, in turn, dubious and enthusiastic, passionate and indecisive. Others in large numbers: Torin Thatcher, Isobel Elsom, Murray Mathison, Virginia Gregg, Richard Lou, Soo Yong, Philip Ahn, George Kurtrayt and Donna Martell; many of Hollywood's best eastern actors also played small uncredited roles. The screenplay of John Patrick closely followed Han’s exquisite novel; Henry King's leadership was solid, as always. The essence of the story is how Heng did not want to fall in love with Elliott, with her busy and demanding work schedule as a doctor and her doubts about their future; and how he was not afraid, despite the intolerance and interference that they faced when their case became known. The film is undeniably physically busy, interesting and often beautiful as well. The hill they fall in love with in order to secede from each other, the beautiful bay in which they float is located against the background of an already busy and crowded business city, large social events that abound in streets, hospital corridors and filled with traffic arteries. With Leon Shamroi’s cinematography, Ben Naye’s make-up and Helen Turpin’s hairstyles, superb work by decorators, sound and lighting equipment, art and all interested parties, this should be one of the most memorable productions in a major non-American city. all the time and one of the hardest to shoot on film. And yet here, lovers are remembered most of all, fortunately, not very young, who face disagreements with them and accurately assess what they are, and then go ahead, as if love matters, and those conditions that are set as barriers to love - no. The culmination of this case is Mark’s return to the war; after that, Khan receives her letters, even if she knows that he was killed; they seem to be messages from a better world. A world where hope is all that matters, courage is the price of entering this world, and it is always summer on a high and windy hill, separated from each other and above an area where beauty and individual desires can be pursued, mistreated . Good luck or dismiss the militant forces of evil. In truth, love is a great thing, says Dr. Han; and this film is one of the clearest evidence of this doctrine, shining like a pearl, eternal like a Chinese proverb and beautiful as polished jade on a rough background.
