Ronald Coleman plays the prodigal son. Despite the fact that he is NOT a bad guy, he is a little naughty and did little with his life, besides traveling around the world and having fun. Now that his last venture in Africa has failed, he returns home to England. His rich father from the upper class plans to throw him in his ear, although thanks to the style of victory Ronald reluctantly met him with open arms. <br /> <br /> At the moment there are two women in his life - the best woman Mirna Loy and the rich girl Loretta Young (who is already engaged). How it all works, and whether Ronald will be wise and behave like a responsible adult - these are the main themes of this nice little movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a very good film, and, of course, it will not change your life, but it is certainly very interesting and fun. Most of this is due to the always ingenious action of Ronald Coleman. Damn it, during the heyday of his career in the 1930s, he could play REEFER MADNESS or in some other tree and yet make it interesting and enjoyable thanks to his charming persona. His seemingly casual style in this film makes it easy to love him, and it's easy to see why Loretta Young and Myrna Loy are in love with him in the film! Plus, the script is very witty and makes this cute romantic comedy.
