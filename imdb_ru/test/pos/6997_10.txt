I really liked this movie. It was cool, not being a sociopath. Vin Diesel brought Riddick's character to life and made you feel good and bad because of him at different levels. <br /> <br /> I also saw Iron Giant, and Vin is fine. (The film about snowmobiles - oh yeah, it's called “Triple-X” or “xXx” - was a weak example of his work.) In Pitch Black, he plays the anti-hero to the maximum. I don't think you can make a mistake when Vin plays the movie. Unfortunately, Hollowwood can play in the movie action adventure - wrong! I think the XXX script was weak, which was why Win couldn’t take it. <br /> <br /> In any case, Pitch Black is a great fiction - look! <br /> <br /> - Zafoid
