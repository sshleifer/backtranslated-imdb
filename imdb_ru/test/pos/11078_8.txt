This anime tells the story of the battle for King Mamodo. Every 1000 years, 100 Mamado’s children go to Earth to fight to determine who will be their next king (in the original Japanese language of the creature, Mamono, which literally means a magic / evil object). Each Mamado paired with a partner man receives a magic spellbook. A person can use this book to unleash incredible powers in Mamodo, and when Mamodo is defeated, his spellbook is absorbed by the flame (alternatively, the book of Mamdodo can be captured and burned directly). After this, Mamodo returns to the world of Mamodo. <br /> <br /> The title character is Zacc (Gesh in Japan), a 6-year-old mammo with electric powers. He is paired with Kiemaru Takamini and a 14-year-old genius. Initially, Zacc reluctantly fought, but, having learned that some Mamodos are evil, and deciding that the battle for the king is not true, he decided to fight in order to become a "good king." <br /> <br /> Sunset Bell made a comparison with Pokémon. But the best comparison is Digimon. Like Digimon, Mamodo and Man have one-on-one symbiotic relationships. In addition, unlike Pokemon, both shows have a real storyline. <br /> <br /> Zatch Bell shows character growth and relationship development, as well as some fairly adult plot lines (for example, love against racism; slavery; mind control, etc.). He even has decent plot twists and riddles.
