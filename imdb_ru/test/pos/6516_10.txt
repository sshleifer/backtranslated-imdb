I watched this movie a long time ago, but I always liked it. The story of a young girl, Sally O'Moyne, who at a young age learns that when she prays to St. Anne, an answer comes to her prayers, hence her missing lunch bucket and the wicked neighbor, who is shaking her should give him a black eye for tatling. Well, after a minute something hit him, and he had a black eye. Then Sally believes in the power of prayer and decides to use this power for good. She is well known and loved in the neighborhood, as she has notebooks / magazines filled with all the requests of her friends in St. Ann. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the local boy is returning home from college (I guess), and Sally is surprised at how adult he is. Sally is madly in love with him, but so shy. Should she use her power of St. Anneâ€™s prayer for her selfish desire, or just watch how the most popular girls in school try to catch the man of their dreams? This is a funny movie with a grandfather who is so charming and an Irishman, like a brother who is very annoying, and a sworn Irish neighbor-enemy who struggles with pop music every day. He has his own story about wanting to buy O'Moins property, which is a small house in the middle of two huge residential complexes (his own), in other words, O'Moins house is a wound for his beautiful buildings. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely worth seeing, it is good enough and rare enough to add it to the movie collection. I hope you will like it!
