This film is a refreshing change in tempo from meaningless Hong Kong triad films that I'm so tired of. There are no impressive skirmishes. No car chases. And practically minimal action to talk about. For the most part, the audience is in suspense, although some aspects of the so-called “trick” by Andy Lau are quite obvious. <br /> <br /> The film was called a departure from the genre of the violent triad. movies, as well as "smart" crime film. To some extent it is. But, to some extent, he still does not pass the test of "plausibility". It’s hard to imagine that any member of the triad would be so stupid as to not see Andy Lau’s female disguise in a second. It seems that he fell in love with the fact that "if someone is seriously ill, that someone will regularly cough up with copious amounts of blood," it seems that Chinese films are constantly used. <br /> <br /> Subtle relationship A refreshing change takes place between the two leading characters. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is pleasant, although the concept is not new and there are few surprises. >
