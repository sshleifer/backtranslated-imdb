The film offers comparisons with Shakespeare. Mandarin is beautifully written and verbally, and the plot is complex and intriguing. Gong Li never looked better, never had the glory that China is better represented on the screen. The balance between political unrest and personal intrigues, which Gladiator hinted at, but never gave, is here in peak. Just unbelieveble.
