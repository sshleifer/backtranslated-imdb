I was lucky to see the screening of this wonderful short film by Joshua Leonard before his premiere at the 2005 Sundance Festival. For twelve short but refined minutes, Leonard sends us on a life-changing journey, as he explores one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society. The film embodies elegant directing, touching performances and heartbreaking history. Kelly Garner and Lucas Haas radiate like two lovers. And in his first adventure in a dramatic narrative, Leonard turns out to be a director with a favorable future. I feel that this short should be expanded into a feature film. It's hard to describe talent, but as this debut film shows, you will know about it when you see it!
