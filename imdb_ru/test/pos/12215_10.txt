Someone asked why it was canceled, I tell you, because “reality” makes money. The surface of the show was canceled so they could replace it with a reality show, NBC would follow, I and about half of my high school, only about 1,000 people vowed to boycott NBC until they returned the show. in my neighborhood (I don't know about other places), but they had a wonderful thing with the Sci-Fi channel, where the Sci-Fi channel showed the episode of the last weeks at 7:00, and then NBC showed the new episode of the week at 8:00 it it was great because it was a little refreshing in what happened in the last episode. I was so angry when I learned that the show was canceled, and they were just going to leave them on top of the church!
