This film is not only the latest work of the Three Colors trilogy, but also the best of the three and one of the best films of the 90s. There is hardly any other film that is so wise and therefore requires humanity and respect for every person. <br /> <br /> Valentina (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Although she has a boyfriend, she seems rather lonely. One night she gets into an accident and injures a dog, which leads her to her owner, a retired jugde (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who is cynical and follows the phone calls of her neighbors. He dislikes that she cannot leave, and they meet again. Two lonely souls meet each other, and they become friends and develop deep love for each other. <br /> <br /> The story itself is too complicated to tell it completely, there is another connection between them in a young man who represents real love and judges, and Valentine, and in their relationship there is something more than just friendship. <br /> Actors wonderful, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant develop a deep and genuine friendship. <br /> <br /> Themes are endlessly relevant, fraternity not only in contact with each other, but also in relation to the right to privacy. Unfortunately, we seem to be losing this right more and more, which makes films like this even more important than it could have been in 1994. <br /> <br /> Red is one of the strongest colors that represents inner turmoil, love, anger and passion. Used here as another protagonist, he brings unparalleled depth to the film. Masterpiece!
