A man with a golden hand, a controversial, panoramic crime drama by Otto Preminger, plays himself among the mental descriptions of his living and architectural inhabitants in a rhythmic, weaving arrangement. The opening of the film, close-up from Frankie’s bar, looking out the window, already tells us that the subjective experience of the protagonist will be comprehended. Stretching to the side of more and more confined spaces, the film is turned off as the local gangster’s protracted poker game shuts itself off from daylight, striking because Sinatra’s Frankie Machine is locked in a room on the famous scene of his painful struggle to overcome his habit. Delving into the forms and faces of his jazz city harbor, the visual traffic in the film “The Man with the Golden Hand” characterizes the distorted psychological circumstances that form an all-consuming environment, as evidenced by repeated follow-up shots at close-ups of Frankie's eyes. <br /> <br /> The grace of this fiery drama, striking even at the moment of an exciting opening tap, shows the team over the perceived world, which allows the production of the studio. Wonderful, dilapidated urban sets define an independent place without beginning and end, an indefinite state, of a kind which, in fact, hardly lasts until this row of skidding seems to be refined or evened out. The feeling of some speeches, in particular, Robert Strauss as the wonderfully named boss in the criminal world of Schwifki and Arnold Sting as a faithful four-eyed boob Frankie, happily turns into this fiery surrealistic feature. The premise of addiction, Sinatra's powerful work, Elmer Bernstein's infectious, strong jazz score and Saul Bass's famous, influential and controversial debut sequence based on the animated paper cut of the heroin addict ensured that in his era the Man with the Golden Hand crushes the cause of realism in still secluded hollywood. As I said, he is impressionistic and subjective, but his intention, his strength and his spirit are much closer to home. <br /> <br /> What attracts me most in this film is his gangster movie. It has illegal card games, short minuses, fights, weapons, double crosses, characters on the run, a femme fatale, stunningly sexy weapons, shady nightclubs and a cityscape, but he doesn't just use this entertainment medium. Indeed, this is an ideal environment and genre in which you can tell this story, a city in a crime town, where it’s too convenient to run through a bottle or two, or three, or four, or drugs, a temporary dose that actually just functions to keep a person in ignorance from any enlightenment and all the clear scenarios that the world can offer.
