What can I say about Thromo and Juliet, except that if you like the perverse machinations of Troma, then you MUST see this movie! This is my favorite Troma film, and I've seen almost all of them! Penis monsters, caesarean birth in rats and popcorn, lesbianism, paired plexiglass sex scenes, incest, nipple piercing, dismemberment, Troma shameless plugs and computer masturbation ... How can you go wrong? This surprisingly follows the original story very closely. YOU SHOULD SEE THIS FILM !!!! Oh, and speaking of shameless forks ... Watch Jane Jensen's "Comic Book Whore" CD on Interscope recordings. It is excellent!
