This innovative film is truly a work of art. I went to the show in Indiana with very low expectations, having already seen 2 other films with “gamer” in the title (both of which were so bad that by the end of the second I took out one of my own eyes with a straw and a twisted clip I found between the seat cushions). But from the opening credits of "Dorkness" I had to. The moderate Northwestern environment created a beautiful backdrop for the drama surrounding the disillusioned game master, Lodge (powerfully depicted by Nathan Rice) and his unsuitable group of friends who lay down the real dramas they face every day, in the face of the fantastic dramas in the Lodge setting provides for of them. After the first scene (in the fantasy world they inhabit), they are forcibly pushed back into the world that they are desperately trying to escape. It caused so many comparisons with my own life that I was moved to tears. Rice’s acting is so amazing that I really believed in the first 20 minutes of the film that he was indeed a twenty-year-old man suffering from frustration, male baldness and an annoying group of “friends” who seem to be unable to understand such things as wrong. It should be noted Lodge friends: Leo, the oldest and most difficult of the trio, it seems, the only other character who has a job, except the Lodge. And yet he seems to be socially vulnerable to Gary, the youngest of the group. At first, this seems a bit strange, until you realize that Gary is, in fact, a sexually tangled sociopath who has very few prospects outside of his “fantastic” world. This dichotomy does not serve to confuse, but to inform and raise the audience about the importance of diversity in our society. My only complaint is that the actors who portray Leo (Scott S. Brown) and Gary (Christian Doyle), from time to time, seem to play characters for a laugh, as if they were told that they play in a comedy, and not in hard comedy. shock action / drama. Speaking of action, Brian Lewis makes his film debut as Cass, the third and most influential member of Lodge's colorful team. the tension is always great when he is on the screen, as when he passionately argues about his beliefs in front of the Lodge, and when he demonstrates his fantastic martial arts skills as the “Silence” of his fantastic character. Or even when he suddenly turns his face to the audience, and you reflexively dive into the audience, so as not to be shocked by his fantastic chin. Lewis lights up the screen no matter what he does, and I hope to see it more in the future. As soon as the action begins in this film, it simply does not stop. From time to time, drama and action blend so smoothly that you can tell whether you are in the middle of a frantic sequence of action or a touching dramatic moment. A really exciting trip of epic proportions, I would recommend “The Gamers: Dorkness Rising” as a must-see for anyone who loves the movie. It was almost worth losing an eye. <br /> <br /> ~ Chip Didlenik
