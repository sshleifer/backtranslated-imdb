Saw it for the first time on British television, with good music. The elevator scene is cool, especially when he does the falling thing in the phone booth, and then fiddles with the floor indicator. The transom jump is really impressive, and that’s not all. Besides all that was mentioned earlier, there is a struggle with a man who mocks a woman with a dog - it looks so simple. The only drawback is conspiracy — it mixes with Dead Eye Dan, who then runs away, but does not appear again, even when several more gangsters enter the scene later. The scene where it seems that he is shooting a fat inspector is funny, but it would be better if Dead Eye were the one who pulled the trigger.
