Lang plays Hawks in the same way as Hawks in the first part of this unusual western before settling down in the final in the typical deterministic, gloomy and pursuing guilt of Lang. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that shows its greatness almost instantly, but at the same time very subtle. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) on horseback and pursued, we do not know why - he stumbles upon wounded Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) and decides to take his gun and horse, but having discovered that Creighton is in a bad way, he decides to fix him first. This is transmitted mainly through facial expressions and a very short, cropped dialogue - after 2 minutes we learn that Shaw is outlawed, but mostly a good guy. The show eventually helps Creighton on the path to civilization, and then disappears. <br /> <br /> Reduced after a few weeks or months, when Creighton is recovering and is in charge of the expedition, to lay a telegraph wire running west from Omaha. He hires Shaw as a scout who is trying to leave when he finds out that Creighton is in charge; but Creighton still wants him to pay off his debt and feel something qualitative. The barefoot son of the project’s sponsor’s son is also hired, but it’s not atypical that Richard Blake (Robert Young), an Eastern resident, is competent enough, as he shows it immediately in an amusing, but thrilling, gangster-gangster sequence. Both employers vie for Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), who - again, as a rule - seems to be quite capable of taking care of herself, like any man. Friendly relations between the three men, comedic elements, including unwitting chefs and various rude and untidy types, and wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the film and reminded me more of the Red River by Howard Hawks or “Only” “Angels have wings” than most langs, but they are so well played, and the action develops so naturally that it doesn’t matter and doesn’t change our enjoyment — if it may change our expectations — like more ordinary Langians e theme to pursue past, dark secrets and a huge force of more simple, destructive and evil ways have become dominant in the later part of the film. Shaw's old buddies return to chase him when the train and its wires move west; attacks the team, and Shaw is forced to contend with what, in any case, he must tell Creighton about his tortured relationship with Jack Slade (Barton McLain), the leader of the criminals. <br /> <br /> Perfectly shot in early Technicolor and a fairly smooth transition from sound scenes to western places, this is, in my opinion, Lang's best western film and one of his best films, in which, like in any of his films, just as powerfully conveyed the tragic inability of people to escape from the past and build a new future. Scott is as good as I saw him, showing more with just one eye movement than many actors can do in a paragraph of dialogue, and the rest of the cast is equally good. The inevitable clash between Shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is an extraordinary one and a surprise even for such an old devotee of Lang as I am; and even in 1941, there seemed to be no place more fraught with meaning on the side of civilization than a hairdresser and a dusty street on the street. You can shave, you can feel like a new person, but you can never be like that while old ties are still holding you back. <br /> <br /> Genius.
