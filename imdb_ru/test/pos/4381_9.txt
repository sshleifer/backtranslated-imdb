It all started strange, the middle was strange, and the final was strange, but I really enjoyed it. A modern version of Homer's Odyssey, but it really doesn't matter. Interesting story and casting. Clooney was great, and I applaud him for taking on such an unfavorable role - so unlike all that he has done or will ever do again. Lots of unexpected stars - why Holly Hunter is more. Do something else tonight and watch this really different and unexpected movie.
