SPOILER IS NOTHING, BUT SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to add my name to the list of people who believe that other viewers simply do not understand this. But no one even mentioned the word "s", as far as I saw. <br /> <br /> Although I agree that the child has died, I think we can be more specific: he committed suicide. He rushes down the hill in an old van, shoots from a cliff and ... "flies away". Maybe the whole story about the form of death is an allegory, or maybe he commits suicide in a wagon as stated. In any case, he "flies away" (oh well, not such a tough metaphor). <br /> <br /> Maybe I have something for Tom Hanks, but I was fine with the narration. In addition, he collects $ for the Second World War memorial, and you must love him for it. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I liked the film, and it turned out to be incredibly touching.
