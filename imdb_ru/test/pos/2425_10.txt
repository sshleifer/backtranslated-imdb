This film requires a lot of patience. Since the plot focuses on the development of mood and character, the plot is very simple, and many scenes take place in the same place - in the apartment of Francis Austin (character Sandy Dennis). But the film develops to an alarming apogee. <br /> <br /> Characters create an atmosphere filled with sexual tension and psychological tricks. It is very interesting that Robert Altman directed this, given the style and structure of his other films. However, the Altman Audio Style trademark is evident here and there. I think what really makes this film work is Sandy Dennis's brilliant performance. This is definitely one of her darker characters, but she plays her so perfectly and convincingly that it is scary. Michael Burns works well as a “dumb” young man. The regular Altman player Michael Murphy has a small role. The solemn, gloomy set fits very well into the content of the story. In short, this film is a powerful study of loneliness, sexual repression and despair. Be patient, absorb the atmosphere and pay attention to the wonderfully written script. <br /> <br /> I praise Robert Altman. This is one of his many films devoted to unconventional, fascinating stories. This film is disturbing, but it is sincere and will surely evoke a strong emotional response in the viewer. If you want to see an unusual film - some may even say that it is strange - it is worth it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find it in video stores. You may have to buy it online.
