This is my favorite movie of all time. Nothing special. This is just incredibly detailed. Makes me cry just thinking about it. Geronimo Bill is the nicest guy I can imagine. Money is not important. Bamboo spears are important. You do not need money to get what you need. If you need something, it will just come to you. If people understood that the world would be much better. Whatever you do, don't do it for the money.
