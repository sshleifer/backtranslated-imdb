I have never seen this movie before it was broadcast on a local cable science fiction network. It reminded me of the Irwin Allen series of the late 60s (“Time Tunnel”, etc.). Excellent effects (they won Star Trek 5, made 20 years later, but then it was not very difficult to accomplish). <br /> <br /> I found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production. They would have needed a few tweaks to tie loose ends at the character level, but for a children's film it is surprisingly interesting (especially the view of the futuristic Euro-policy surprisingly similar to today's European Union!) <br /> The plot really resembles the Twilight zone as a whole ( as other users have indicated), but in this case it is a compliment. <br /> <br /> By the way, great sets! <br /> 7/10
