watch this movie. This is a really good trip through the difficulties of making an indie film and what happens when it explodes on the directorâ€™s face. There are many things about punk rock, and the philosophy of this movement and its connection to this project. so if you're passionate about old punk, American punk, you dig it up ... but be careful, there are a ton of bad roles in a bad project ... but they sometimes turn out to be funny, and, in fact, some of the best moments are listening people who had never participated in the pontificate of cinema, and what they experienced during the three-year period it took to put it together. so anyone who is going to make a film, especially if you haven't been to a film school or have worked in the field, you have to watch it and learn from the mistakes of the director.
