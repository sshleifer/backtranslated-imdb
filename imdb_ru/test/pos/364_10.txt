This is another one of Hitchcock's top rated films, and rightly so. This is a story about two men who meet on a train and playfully exchange fantasies about murder. One of them (Robert Walker) takes this seriously, and this leads Guy Haynes (Farley Granger) to problems with the law. Another fast moving Hitchcock film with a lot of great scenes (a scene with a merry-go-round and a tennis match is worth mentioning). Not to miss a single movie - it's a shame that no one will re-release it on DVD with a bunch of additional materials - just a cheap Warner Brothers DVD - that's all there is now.
