A guy who likes guys - yes! Wonderful. Now I can have fun, enjoy the company of my girlfriend and not feel that I can not wait for the end of the film! Easy - but funny. Quality goods. Whatever you do, do not miss the additions to the DVD. This is a great blind date file too. Will Smith succeeds in this - although in a frivolous act - he pulls it all well. The film is a bit slow - do not expect too many actions - there is laughter - and the same with the message - but time is a little slow. Use low moments to whisper or kiss - it picks up. The end makes you feel good moments worth it. Most expect fun frivolous fare - and expect some great support from the support actors - they make the film. The plot twists are predictable - but it's a date, so take the popcorn from the kitchen - and don't make it pause. Calculate more dates after this movie - she wants to see what happens next. Remember the advice of Hitch !!! <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
