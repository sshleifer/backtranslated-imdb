This film is probably not the funniest I've ever seen, and, of course, it does not have much value. In fact, this is just a collection of vignettes interconnected by a free storyline. However, this “do it like me” attitude is good for the film. “Tommy Boy” succeeds in comedy for the same reasons that the SNL guys filmed, which Farley and Spade starred in: their timely senseless nonsense and chaos make them ridiculous, despite their immaturity.
