This is an extraordinary musical film. I felt terribly that Rodriguez died in 1999 before I could see her live. To find out that she performed the marvelous Lincoln Ctr. A concert in 1991, and I could go there, but it was not painful, not to mention the words. <br /> <br /> I just bought my first Amalia record. While the musical recording is fantastic, the opportunity in this film to SEE her face and her amazing expressiveness and passion when she sings these songs of terrible sadness is wonderful. It seems like to see the face of Mary when she embraces Jesus in her arms in the Drink. Watching her in the movie reminded me that I had witnessed such an unusual Mercedes Sosa concert performance in the mid-1990s at Lincoln Ctr. As I sat listening to the singing of a Mercedes, I felt that I was in immense spiritual and musical power, which had an amazing primitive power. Some of the musical segments of The Art of Amalia are touching, for example, Caetano Velozo pays tribute to Amalia and sings one of his songs alone in front of a crowded concert hall. The music segments also convey the incredible international reach of her musical repertoire and the connections she has created. fans around the world. In one episode, she states that she played in every Italian city that has a scene! <br /> <br /> In another section, Amalia talks about her battle. mouth cancer and how she came to New York to commit suicide at the hotel. However, as she watched Fred Astaire’s videos, she gradually convinced herself that life was worth it to kill herself. Amazing Later in the film, she quite boldly and explicitly confesses to the interviewer that, although she could have conquered the world musically, her personal life was pure sadness. She admits that she has never been happy. It is unbearably sad to hear, but beautifully kept. a singer immersed in the fado tradition (which she translates as “bad fate” or “failure”). In addition, I want to hear more about her personal life: what is so upsetting about her? what were her frustrations? <br /> <br /> The Art of Amalia is a little disappointing in other important areas. My quibbles: showing 20-30 full songs in a film, while not providing only an English translation of the latest, seems like a waste (unless the movie was intended only for an Portuguese-speaking audience, which I can't imagine). Seeing the deep pain on her face when she sings, and not understanding the lyrics, is disappointing. As for the other disadvantages: there are almost no biographical materials about the origin of the family of Amalia. There is one 20 seconds. fragment with her singing g. her mother (this is absolutely gorgeous). There is one brief mention of her parents moving from Fr. countryside in lisbon. I would really like to see a film about the village from which she came. The interviews, as they are, are almost exclusively w. Amalie herself (and several close friends). She is a good, but not a very good thing. There are no interlocutors who are experts on Fado or Portuguese culture and society, so we do not understand the depth of its musical roots. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a wonderful film that should interest everyone who is interested in Amalie. see. But this is not an ideal or final work on this topic.
