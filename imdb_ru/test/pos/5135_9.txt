This is a delightful jewel of the film, unfortunately with blue holes, like “only for children”. The plot revolves around a young man, Roy Eberhardt, who recently arrived in the southwest of Florida from the mountains of Montana. Trying to match other children in his high school, Roy discovers a brother-sibling team trying to protect endangered owls at an illegal construction site. Look for Karl Hiassen, the author of the book on which this film is based, as the male secretary of the evil boss at corporate headquarters. Writer / director Wil Schreiner also works as a secretary in the State Archives, where fearless teenage detectives find that there is no compromising report of environmental consequences. Luke Wilson almost steals all the important scenes from charming teenage actors who have most of the best roles. Wilson is a clumsy cop in his three-wheeled electric police car with blue lights and a funny siren. As officer Dave, he tries so hard to succeed, but usually ends up in the dirt, literally! Repeatedly! Jimmy Buffett is rather reserved as a silent teacher of natural science. But the young actors Logan Lerman (Roy), Brie Larson (Beatrice Bear) and Cody Linley (Mullet Fingers) excel in the role of teenagers who finally put Officer Dave on the right path, following the paper trail left by the evil corporate boss, I hope you left this movie, feeling as good as me. Just fun! One small complaint though. I hope that all non-Floridians understand that not everyone from Florida is so unfriendly to newcomers, as shown in this film. We are really friendly group! Just ask Carl Hiassen and Jimmy Buffet !!
