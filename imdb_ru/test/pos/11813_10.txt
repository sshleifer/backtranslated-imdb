The Cure is a fantastic film about a boy with AIDS. I cried about 4 times watching this movie, and it's so sad. I cannot promise that everyone will cry while watching this, but it makes you want to. Very emotional and very sad film "The Cure", which is a must see. It shows you the value of friendship and love and is an extremely good movie. <br /> <br /> At first I didnâ€™t think it would be so great, and I wondered why my mother always cried while watching this. But now I know that this is a stunning film that is so original and so close to real life, unlike most other films that do not make sense. Words cannot describe the greatness of The Cure, you just have to see it.
