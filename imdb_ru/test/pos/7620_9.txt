I loved this movie. Not as good as the “50 First Dates,” but it’s definitely a repeater, especially on a rainy day or with a group of girlfriends. Yes, the plot was “cute” and, perhaps, even incredible, but what's wrong with feeling good in the film. Drew, like Josie, and her love affair with the teacher is so sweet, and the brother-baseball player imitates the addition of the well-being of the movie What's so bad about a good movie that the whole family can enjoy? Do not hesitate while watching with your children! Drew is a terrific actress who seems to be really underestimated for the most part. This is definitely one of her best roles!
