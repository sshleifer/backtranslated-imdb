Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a fantastic movie in and of itself. This is nothing more than a book that may disappoint its ardent followers. However, when viewed by itself, the film is a masterpiece. The views are exciting and the game is not so bad !! Nicolas Cage was great - so different from his usual heroes like action-heroes. Penelope Cruz is great and really holds the film together. I think that this film should be considered as an individual project, not related to the book. Louis de Bernier refused the rights to the script of the film, so the film is an interpretation of the director John Maddon. Go and see this film with an open mind - you will like it; because below is a touching love and war story.
