If you are reading a book by Karl Hiasen, the film looks almost believable, with a few changes for Hollywood. In my opinion, this is a great family movie. Luke Wilson (officer Delinko) steals a pretty good show from a star cast that includes Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffett. The kids in the film do an excellent job with Logan Lerman, Brie Larsson and Cody Linley. <br /> <br /> Brie Larson may be too small to play Beatrice. I portrayed a bigger girl, perhaps 6 feet, 175 pounds, as Beatrice. This could make her more believable in her role as beating Dana. They had to develop her “cool girl” character and bite her through the bus, or hit a soccer ball at a person. She is very beautiful, and I understand why she was abandoned, she is attractive for box office. <br /> <br /> It's almost like PG, like in the movies, these days, without sex and very little violence. This film - the embodiment of the dreams of parents, a film with a strong impact on the environment, with children who deeply appreciate the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. This shows how adults have failed in the management of our planet, and that our children can demand better. One of my favorite lines in the film is when Mullet Fingers says: “Florida could use some mountains, such as Montana. Florida is so flat that nothing prevents developers from clearing it from coast to coast. ” In addition, the wildlife photography of Florida spoke volumes without dialogue. As a family movie with children aged 5-15 years, this is a great movie! As a bonus, parents will be entertained, especially if they are "parrots."
