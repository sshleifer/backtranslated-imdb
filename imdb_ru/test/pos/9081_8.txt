I recently watched this move on the channel Encore. What a great movie, great cast. Flatliners are very hard and unpredictable. The film has a great scene that opens at the ocean, and then a series of scenes that raise questions about life after death, which provide a very strong part in the plot. Therefore, Nelson, played by Kiefer Sutherland, was the first to be tested to die and return to life. Then it becomes very dramatic, returning his wrong actions from the past to life. Then all of the above characters went through the same experience, with the exception of Randy Glass, played by Olliver Platt. The story then unfolds in the resolution and basic understanding of the life, presence, and meaning of God. David Labracchio, played by Kevin Bacon as an atheist, questions his own faith in God. It's amazing to watch Julia Roberts along with Kevin Bacon, Oliver Platt, William Baldwin and Kiefer Sutherland in such a great time of their career. One may ask why we no longer have such a wonderful film. This is one of the best productions of Joel Schumacher. I really like this movie.
