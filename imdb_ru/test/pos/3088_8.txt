After I watched this movie, it's hard for me to understand why so many people hate this movie. I'm not saying that he is in the top 250 of all time, but in his genre this is a great movie. I know that not many people find it funny to see how a legendary story, such as Robin Hood, turns into a comedy. Many people still believe that you should not laugh at some things ... they are wrong. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks did a great job with Robin Hood: Men in Tights. I also saw the original Robin Hood films, but I never got such a good time when I watched them with it. This is just a continuation of funny moments and parodies of famous people and films (Winston Churchill, The Godfather ...). <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone who wants to laugh to watch this movie. For those who think that Robin Hood should not be spoiled, you are mistaken, but you'd better not watch this, because you are likely to be offended by this. I give this film 8/10.
