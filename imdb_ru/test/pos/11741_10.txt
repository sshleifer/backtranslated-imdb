It plays out the war correspondent William Holden, who falls in love with a stunning Eurasian doctor Jessica Jones against the backdrop of stunning Hong Kong. The cinematography is great because they are found on a hill overlooking Hong Kong. The story deals with racial tension, a society condemning mixed relationships and extramarital relations. But what I like about it is the strong character of the heroine, portrayed by Jessica Jones, who is a Eurasian doctor, who remains modest and steadfast in her altruistic mission and true to her love. Despite this, she is fired in the hospital for jumping with a married man, gossiping senior officials. Once William Holden is summoned to the Korean War, which he covers, and then on that ill-fated day, she learns of his demise. The end, of course, is tragic, I cried when she walked to her mountain. It was a very sweet ill-fated novel. This won all chances, the fact that she was fired from her job, as his wife would not give him a divorce, but their great love survived - they experienced great love despite all this. Personally, I don’t believe in extramarital relations and I think that he shouldn’t have started something when he was connected to someone else, and she shouldn’t have allowed herself to allow this to happen, but despite this really great film. I think the heroine overshadowed the hero. Jessica Jones is hot and gave a great idea, although it seemed to me strange that they did not hire a real Asian actress or someone with Asian blood. I agree with one review, Jessica Jones exudes sexuality when she lies on the ground and looks at William Holden, who speaks calmly, but her eyes say: "Come and take me now." <br /> <br /> I’m sorry that the most wonderful films were made before I was born, many Hollywood films lack depth, great acting, and they are completely dependent on stunts and hard sex scenes. This is truly one of the most haphazard love stories in the movie.
