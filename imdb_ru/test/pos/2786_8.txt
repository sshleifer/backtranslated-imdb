An amazing, witty, funny and completely fascinating film captures a little-known reality: a student who studies in the Erasmus program. The start is wonderful, as the story begins, of course, it has a few sleep in the middle part, and the story sometimes moves away from the main character, but the viewer does not worry - the film is young, fresh and light , you no longer become part of this universe. But it's just me. The film is deep and at the same time very light. Cool and recommended.
