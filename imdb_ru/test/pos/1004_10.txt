Can you seize the moment? When will you first hear the rain on the roof? Some things go beyond the sum of their parts, expressing the poetry of life. Things that matter. <br /> <br /> Poet Dylan Thomas captured the seemingly ineffable: "A good poem helps ... expand everyone’s knowledge about himself and about the world around him." (Bob Dylan named himself in his honor). So why did the film about the great Dylan Thomas take so long? A simple biopic might miss the point. Writer Sharman MacDonald chose a different, better approach. <br /> <br /> In the film “The Edge of Love”, she creates a world of passions and difficulties that fill the verses so that we can swim in them. The life of four friends. Dylan, who craves and loves fully. Wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller), his furious support. War hero William (Cillian Murphy), who rescues him from a street fight. And there is his childhood, dear. Vera. Dear Vera. Breathe, Faith. She is Caitlin's closest friend. William's wife. And, like a muse, the "star" in the dark sky of Dylan. <br /> <br /> It all starts in the 1940 London Blitz with underground bomb shelters. Enter Vera (impressive Keira Knightley) under the improvised spotlights of the scene. She first meets Dylan in recent years, her heart has turned red. Their eyes shine through the smoke of the room. The purity of their past passion. Dylan (native of Wales, Matthew Rhys) is not a consecrated, purified poet. Master of his vices, he must experience them all to the fullest. He introduces his beloved wife, and then continues to care for Vera. <br /> <br /> “The Edge of Love” is a visual pleasure. The soundtrack leaves much to be desired. The performances are perhaps the best of these actors in their careers. Like a lush love story, it's pretty good. As an understanding of Dylan Thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives, it’s not bad at all. And as a tribute to a great man who inspires. <br /> <br /> Production was struggling to project the spirit of Dylan Thomas, without compromising historical accuracy too much. Dramatic tension implies cravings between artistic freedom and generally accepted morality. An audience looking for experience based on the latter may be disappointed. And it will not play so well for viewers whose boundaries coincide with Albert Square. <br /> <br /> Sharman MacDonald seemed to be aware of the stubborn nature of artistic freedom and its limitations when she spoke with producer Rebecca Gilbertson (the granddaughter of this William and Vera). "Think of everything you don't want me to write about," she said, "because I need a blank check." For Macdonald, there were limits if she were to insult Dylan's memory. But for many artists, especially men, there are restrictions on which their wife and family can set. A woman is not going to allow high ideals to intervene in practical problems of common sense and even puts the interests of her children in front of her own (sometimes it happens the other way around when the towering genius Virginia Woolf refuses to let a loving Leonard bring her to the earth in hours) <br /> <br /> Despite the tension between Caitlin and Vera, these two women are becoming closest friends. This is one of the main (and very beautiful) themes of the film. <br /> <br /> Movie colors tell the story by themselves. In wartime gray Britain, Kaitlin and Vera are bright highlights in the ocean of gray. Shortly after the meeting with the bright persona on the stage, we meet with Caitlin through her burning blue eyes, sparkling in a darkened railway carriage. Her spectacular red coat penetrates the streets of colorless uniformity, triumphing on the beautiful staircase when she reunites with Dylan. But the red brightness of Faith lipstick is less persistent. For her, marriage is the second largest, even when she became obsessed with sincere love for her husband. <br /> <br /> Outstanding cinematography extends to the use of editing to match images, like poetry, matching unrelated words to create further meaning. The terrible scenes of the war in Thessaly intersect with the cries of Faith during pregnancy. Childbirth or is it an abortion? We were not told right away. The pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to the present day. <br /> <br /> Constant echoes of Dylan's poetry throughout the film take us beyond the limits of earthly opposites. It reminds me that Marlon Brando reads "Eliot" in the Apocalypse Now. Light beyond the horrors of the world. Another way to see things. “I will transfer you to the time when bombs did not fall from the sky and no one died,” says Dylan to Vera when they walk along the beach. Elsewhere, Caitlin recalls her childhood with Vera: “We are still innocent in Dylan,” she says. <br /> <br /> There is time to leave your panties at home or share a universal cigarette. (Perhaps not literally.) Time for inspiration. Enjoy perhaps the best British film of the year.
