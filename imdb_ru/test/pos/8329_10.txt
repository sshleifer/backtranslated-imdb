Walking With Dinoasaurs is a new and exciting program that uses amazing visual graphics to display live dinosaurs. The information presented here is staggering. Moods in the series change to get your attention, things like dramatic music when fights start. There is clear evidence of one amazing documentary here! My many thanks to the writers, directors and producers, and not to forget the other people involved. If you stumble upon this video in stores, I suggest you buy it not only for graphics, but also for extreme efforts and productive work that the series can offer. 10/10
