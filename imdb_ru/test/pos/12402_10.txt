I just watched the DVD version of BORN BAD and found it to be hard, sandy and, towards the end, too graphic for the faint of heart. Justin Walker (Clueless) and Corey Feldman turn into excellent performances. For a low-budget movie, this picture delivers. Character depth and intelligent dialogue are two things that are usually not visible in the picture of Roger Corman. Check it out on DVD!
