There are 3 of these films, all equally processed and each very funny. Red plays the baby monitor Wally Benton, also known as Fox, who is trying to sort out real crimes with her fianc√©, played by your typical wartime neighbor, Ann Rutherford. Many of the one-liners and gags are stupid and probably were in the 1940s, which I expected. But just as many actually made me laugh out loud, which was unexpected, to say the least. Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong presence on the screen, surprisingly, I say, because I grew up on a much older version of a man whose charm really didn't play very well in my amazing years. I have to give these films permission, though - if you're in the mood for this type of nostalgic fare. I almost threw in a frivolous heart, but in fact people are in vain and beaten, and, I dare say, from time to time well above average. As with most films of this era, he gets a PI rating (politically incorrect) for reasons you can imagine. War time is probably fun, and again these films. Watch one, watch them all.
