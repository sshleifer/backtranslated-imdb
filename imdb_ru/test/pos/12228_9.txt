I once came across this movie while watching a channel. and decided to give it a chance. To my surprise, I liked this film about the dark horse. I felt some genuine chemistry between Chellen Cates and Malcolm-Jamal Warner. It was such a carefree and warm film that when it was over, I felt happy. Of course, this film was predictable from the very beginning, but I highly appreciate how he felt me ​​when it was all over. I have to admit that I have never seen Chellen Cates before, but I feel that she can definitely act. When you combine her good behavior with her sweet face and attractive figure. She has intentions to at least become a famous star.
