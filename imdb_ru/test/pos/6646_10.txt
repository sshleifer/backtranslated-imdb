Scammen Bergman is one of the most realistic images of war ever filmed in the movies. This is by no means an action movie, although the pace goes faster and there is more action in it than in any other Bergman film. This is not the romance of war or patriotism, unlike most war films. In fact, the gritty realism and the deliberate ambiguity of the character's loyalty have a very modern feel. <br /> <br /> Scammen is a darkly lit film that needs to be watched at night to make it work, it's magical. Many of the effects are transmitted indirectly, but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity with a modern, insanely huge budget film, such as Saving Private Ryan. Of course, the action in Scammen has a much smaller scale, but, nevertheless, it is impressive. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the style of film production looks modern, the atmosphere of the film is felt out of time and without space. War-ravaged countryside and even an untouched provincial village can be anywhere, anytime. And this film is not so much about specific historical events with specific names and dates, but about universal human reactions to adversity and chaos. <br /> <br /> The actions in Scammen, although impressive from Ullman and Sidov, are not of primary importance in this film, unlike most other Bergman films. For most of the film, they are the same viewers as we are. Bergman imposed a war on them, and through them the audience, and their reaction, may be any of our reactions. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 10/10
