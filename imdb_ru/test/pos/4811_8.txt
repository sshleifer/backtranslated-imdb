I recently saw Anh Jean. Not because it was a Hong Kong film, but because I was looking for an alternative to the films that are produced in the USA here. In my humble opinion, I believe that the film could easily compete with the militants that are produced here, with the exception of the traditional idiosyncrasies of the Hong Kong film. The one that still bothers me was the main character of the inspector. I still do not understand why there should be a character in a complete idiot in the style of comics, even in serious films coming from Hong Kong, but I can live with it when the film is so good. Characters are plausible, even if the situations in which they find themselves are not. The story quickly unfolds and really draws you into it. For me, the real scene was two bus rides, which are taken by a thief character. In general, a really solid film.
