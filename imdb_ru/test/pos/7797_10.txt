This film is an amazing comedy. The script is too funny. If you watch it more than once, you will like it more. Although comedy is sometimes stupid, but it really makes you laugh !! Salman Khan and Amir Khan paid tribute to their roles. After 1994 I have not seen a single Hindi film that would be so funny.
