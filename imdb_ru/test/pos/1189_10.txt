Thank God for this movie. This is a document about talent, which after three decades seems even more unique and rare in retrospect. <br /> <br /> The music is just extraordinary, filled with such a great talent in writing, performing, arranging and producing, that it is absolutely infectious. Lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. Performances of undervalued talents, such as Nell Carter and Ren Woods, raise my spirits every time I hear them. Although the film may differ from the stage version, I prefer the soundtrack for the album, which I think is really tedious and not well developed. Here the arrangements are filled and transformed into dynamic pieces that could not be created in the stage environment. <br /> <br /> But music is not the only thing that is unusual in this film. The juxtaposition of almost hyper-realistic dialogue scenes (reminding me of Altman's films) intersecting with abundant musical and dance numbers really works. All the talents in this film - directing, writing, photography, editing, music, choreography, casting, acting, costumes, directing - fit perfectly into one of the best music films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I think it is amazing how much we know about the characters in “Hair” based on very little information or plot. They are drawn not as caricatures, but as realistic and very humane people. We see small glimpses of where they come from, but the portrait is complemented by vignettes that paint characters on the surface through action, directing and editing. There is a hidden theme of misogyny by Berger and Had, which colors their characters, exposing their reckless macho-hippie ideology. A scene from Berger’s family life reveals important details about his psychology, and a brief introduction to Claude’s house tells us about his origins through simple, realistic and genuine interaction between Claude and (presumably) his father. <br /> <br /> I like the fashion in this film. It defiantly mixes ideas of the sixties with VERY seventies views (you need to ignore the hair extensions Treat Williams ...). This is a document about how chic the end of the seventies was, contrary to the generally accepted opinion that the era was about bad taste. Claude's beige knitted tie was a hot trend in 1979, and the hair and clothes of singers and dancers (especially white on the Central Park stage) blend decades in a way that indicates the eternity of the musical. These elements merge with Twayla Tharp's extraordinary modern choreography in a way that enhances the mastery of both. <br /> <br /> “Hair” is not a film that encourages cynicism. If you come to this with expectations, then most likely you will be held captive by artists who are not bound by your rules. For me, it opened my eyes, ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialogue about war, friendship and family, which goes beyond its time and is still significant and relevant to me to this day.
