Renee Zellweger absolutely brilliantly looks like nurse Betty, easily one of the most charming, original and carefree comedies of the year. <br /> <br /> When a waitress obsessed with soap opera Betty Sizemore witnesses the murder of her unfeeling husband by two hired assassins (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), she snaps and thinks that the actors in “Reason of Love” are real. She decides to go to Los Angeles to find the famous heart specialist Dr. David Ravell (character in the show). <br /> <br /> While the two strangely coupled Hitmans, the caustic Stone and the pontifical Freeman make a very funny impression of chemistry, and Greg Kinnear also has fun with his cunning persona behind the scenes. Renee Zellweger turns into an innocent, covered with candy, and sometimes terribly sweet role in the role of nurse Betty. She exudes good, warm and irresistible. Although the script is sometimes reminiscent of a sitcom, it is sometimes full of incredible characters and contrived situations, Zellweger is so cute and so disarming that it all turns out together. <br /> <br /> With just a few black splashes, Nurse Betty is a great comedy with interesting things, Zellweger's triumphant performance, a great cast and a literate script. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
