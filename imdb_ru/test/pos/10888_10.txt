You wear only the best Italian suits from Armani, hand-sewn and fitted to your exact dimensions. Your car is the best that German engineering can offer, and is equipped with the same number of gadgets as horses under the hood. You are a member of the best polo clubs, often dine in restaurants such as Spago, and you are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. Your pocket watch is used as a nuclear explosive device, and a reliable pen can also be used as a semi-automatic weapon of 22 caliber caliber. You ski in the Alps, make deep sea dives in the Caribbean, dive into the sky over the Andes, and all the time your hair never goes away. You are Bond, James Bond, the most famous spy in the world, the beloved son of a good queen, a bad boy from the British SS, and perhaps the most desirable man in the world. The James Bond character was created by Ian Fleming and is the longest film industry icon, having been the subject of more than fifteen films spanning over four decades. The last person to play this role is Pierce Brosnan, who in 1996 took on the role of James Bond from Timothy Dalton and made his debut in the film Golden Eye in the year 007. <br /> <br /> This is the scene for the first major title. developed by a third party on Nintendo 64. Goldeneye, developed by Rare for Nintendo, has been on the market for some time. His constant dominance in the sales charts is just one indication of how good this game is, and no review library would be complete without it. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - in most cases, games with a license for movies flops. Although these two things seem to be a good combination, the results were, for the most part, terrifying. Games like Cliffhanger, True Lies, Lethal Weapon, and not to mention all the dips in Star Trek, are enough ammunition against this mix. And, note, I'm not a fan of licensed games, especially if I watched the movie. At least that's what I used to think. In the case of Goldeneye, I had more reservations than usual. Although the film “Golden Eye” is not so bad, it did not have much appeal, and I do not put it in the top ten Bond films. However, as a game, let's just say that this is a completely different story. <br /> <br /> The game is a first-person shooter, and for success you will need at least as many brains as musculature. For those who have seen the film, which, I think, most of you are reading, the story is very consistent and follows the path of the film with slight variations. In the USSR, a conspiracy began to control the most dangerous satellite in the world, the Golden Eye, and in the process a beautiful woman was captured. Your missions will be many, the danger is extreme. You will have to rely on your mind and experience to go through the most grueling missions the world has ever known. M will inform you as soon as you are ready. Good afternoon, James.
