[CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!] <br /> <br /> Garfield and his owner John Arbuckle were in a rut. They had no life at all. All they did was lay around and thought the ceiling tiles John even organized his sock according to color and fabric. He needed a life. Therefore, he consults a book on this topic, which refers to meeting with a woman. The bar for singles was a great place to start. Unfortunately, when the music began, and John went to the dance floor, we see what caused the disco to die: John killed her. Then John tried to pick up the girls in the video store. He ended up feeling in his mouth. Literally. Self-service laundry was also not a prize when John and his potential girlfriend saw each other's underwear. John tried to play all the power on the beach, but he soon angered a real lover of guys, which made John feel his mouth again. Literally. Then John tried to catch the passing girls. To no avail, John pulled out a guitar and sings the blues. Unfortunately, when he mentioned that his cat was a fat, fat man, he came up and stamped Johnâ€™s guitar. It was hopeless. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for John, the ad flashed on TV: "Lorenzo School for the Disabled." This guaranteed life to a lifeless person in a few simple steps. John and Garfield attend classes. The building did not look exactly the same as on television, and Lorenzo did not behave as cheerfully as on television. John sat next to a beautiful girl named Mona. Therefore, while Lorenzo taught his own lessons about how to present yourself, test your pulse and pretend that he speaks a foreign language, John and Mona get to know each other. They leave together, forgetting everything about Garfield. At home, John and Mona were just sitting on the porch talking. Garfield envied Monet for fear that she would take John away from him. Garfield foresaw the future: John and Mona got married, she moved, and soon she gave birth to little Arbuckle, who was beside himself with the pleasure of telling Garfield story. Back to the present, Garfield will not stand for it. He tried to get John to get rid of Mona until she started scratching her ears. But then John found out that Mona is allergic to cats. So this was basically the end of their relationship. But they still saw each other from time to time, and Garfield was sure that he would be with them. <br /> <br /> Another fun special Garfield TV! This one was made during the screening of "Garfield and Friends" on television. Garfield lost some weight. Somewhat. Since the early 1980s, cartoons. The scene with John trying to pick up chickens is funny, as is the scene in which the fat guy stomps on John's guitar. Good old Lorenzo Music is back as Garfield. Tom Huge - John. Frank Welker (Third person out of 1000 votes) - Lorenzo. And Jun Forey (woman with 1000 votes) - Mona. If you like Garfield, then I recommend you to see how Garfield gets life today!
