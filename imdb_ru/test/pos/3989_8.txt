I always liked this film, I saw it many times, but I always liked it :) The story is interesting and special. But the only thing I disagree with is that I donâ€™t think that Max lived in a Romanian monastery or something like that: P Mureshan played pretty well, but, as someone said before me, his English should improve. <br /> <br /> And there were some funny moments and tragic / sad moments. Worth seeing, I thought it was cute that the giant wanted to find his love. I recommended to all of you. This is not the best movie, but it was good!
