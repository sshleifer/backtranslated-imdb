I am very sad that this film received so much negative criticism. I think this is a good little comedy and really funny. The humor in this film is warm and innocent, and I like it. I also like the character of Madonna, and I do not agree that she played herself. She created a character and responsive. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes were fighting on top of a sinking machine, where Madonna climbed over the fence in a fancy dress and demanded love. The humor in the film has a slightly syrrealistic touch and maybe this is not a cup of tea for everyone. But this is their problem, not a movie. <br /> <br /> I found this movie useful and sunny. In fact, that day when I first saw him, for some reason I was incredibly sad, and this film lit up my day. And Madonna can act. Just take off your negative thinking glasses.
