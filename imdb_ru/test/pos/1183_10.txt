For people like me who were born many years after the end of the 60s, we can learn about this era only through cultural artifacts, one of which is Hair. This is definitely a well-made tour de force. You can understand how things are with the hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene - at least for me - is when a group fails the party of rich people. As for the final scene of the film, it can be interpreted as a symbolic end of everything that represented the 60s. <br /> <br /> But no matter how interpreted this film is, it is important to understand that, in spite of the 60s, they may have ended by themselves, the movements that typed them still exist in small enclaves. This is a time that people will not soon forget. <br /> <br /> In any case, this film is one that I definitely recommend. Milo≈° Forman scored another great one here, right between his two masterpieces, "Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Ragtime" (so why did he later make a piece of shit like "The Man on the Moon" ?!) Beverly D'Angelo.
