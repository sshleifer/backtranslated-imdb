I give it 10 out of 10, not because the plot was difficult to reveal, because it was not ..., but because it leaves the care of the characters. The acting of all the actors is great, especially Joan Hickson, and this is a wonderful episode because of his heart. <br /> <br /> Miss Marple was caused by Jason Rafielâ€™s dying request to investigate and solve a murder that happened about seven or eight years ago, and she must find out why and when she is progressing. Mr. Rafiel is the same Rafiel as in the Caribbean Mystery, so there is some connection here. <br /> <br /> Nemesis is certainly one of those amateur psychologists among us, and if you are one of those who are satisfied only with a lot of blood, courage and loud sequences of actions, then you will not like it, but if you look like me, one who loves to know about PEOPLE and find out what makes them tick, then Nemesis is for you.
