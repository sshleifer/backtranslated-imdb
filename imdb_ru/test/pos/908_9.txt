Stan Laurel considered PUTTING PANTS ON PHILIP as the first “real” L & H film. “Gag” up to certain situations). - among them, the accident of Oliver Hardy with a leg of lamb, which led to the fact that Stan had to replace him, and the extra money that he would provide for himself and his new wife Lois, - led to his historical return to execution, as well as to writing , directing, editing and participating in other areas of production), but also realized that he was part of a team that worked well together. Thus, it is a historical and very important film in the history of comedy. <br /> <br /> This is also an amazingly funny little silent film; rather different from what Laurel & Hardy will become known for, and from what they are more closely associated with today. The characters "Stan and Ollie" do not appear - Scottish Stan Laurel plays the nephew of Oliver Hardy, a respectable man from the city who does not want to be seen with this strange-looking guy with a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girls. In this well-made, charming little film there are some very funny moments, and the performances of these two Kings of Comedy are just around the corner - watch Stan’s little “kick” and smile, which says: “OK, waddaya, you know?” When he sees girls, or, for example, a scene in which hair at the airport is disheveled. Happy. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, if you can, with backing music from The Beau Hunks Orchestra (available in VVL video releases), which enhances the feel of the 1920s and is very, very pleasant to listen to. This is a brilliant and underrated little film, so I said that it was “amazingly” funny.
