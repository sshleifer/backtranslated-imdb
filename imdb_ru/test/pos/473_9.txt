You Are Alone is a beautiful, almost delicate film, elegantly directed, clearly written, with two complex and exciting performances and a twist of the finale that no one will see, but make you want to see the movie a second time, go back and learn all the clues, which you misunderstood. <br /> <br /> A story about a high school girl who is buried in depression and awkwardness, working several hours a week as an accompanying “schoolgirl” at $ 500 an hour, and a depressed neighbor who learns her secret and hires her for an evening call to a hotel in the center of New Haven, shows the breathtaking performances of Jessica Ball, as a girl, and Richard Brandage, as her neighbor. <br /> Bol in the role of Daphne gives a breakthrough performance on a par with Maggie Gyllenhaal in The Secretary. She catches the adolescent's fear of growing into her own skin, and when she says that she is always in control, you begin to realize that she doesn’t control the situation at all, but is in danger of going through the deep end, which I think that way she does. <br /> <br /> Brandyge, like Buddy in depression, angry, with a broken heart, the shell of a person. But only after the startling conclusion of the film will you understand the full understanding of his pain. <br /> <br /> After a very short initial segment, which most independent movie lovers will hook on, and you will have the religious right to run to the exits, we were led to a hotel room. At first you are not sure about these people or in the style of filming. Shaky, annoying ... like characters. Until you understand their background, told in short memories. At first they are confrontational for some reason, like the camera. But as they open when the story settles down, so does the camera. And, I don't know, after 20 minutes, come on or take it, you can't take your eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> Just after seeing the world premiere at the Brooklyn Film Festival - where did the director ask the audience if anyone was waiting for the final and nobody answered yes ?? I almost wish the film was already in the video so that I could watch it again. Since now, recalling some conversations in the film, in particular, a very frank dialogue about fantasy and climax, I really thought that things were going in a completely different direction. But now I understand that most of their conversation meant something completely different than I imagined. I need to see it again !!! But no matter how gloomy and sexual conversations, if to put it bluntly, at least, I found myself laughing more than I could expect from some candor, which definitely falls into “things that we think, but do not have the courage to say” . out loud "category. It is very stupid, especially when you realize that a lot of it has a completely different meaning. In part, it will make you feel uncomfortable, especially if you watch" Are you alone with a partner? "You will definitely have something to talk about ?? arguing about ?? after that. Maybe it should come up with a warning: you MUST be alone when you look! The music is awesome. I would come home and buy a soundtrack from my favorite online music store if I could. The film looks the same good as all that filmed on film. After the film was shown by director Gorman Bechar, they asked what process he used to make digital shots look so good. His answer is no. They could not afford it. <br /> <br /> I have to pay tribute to Beshard. a big fan of his two shorts, "Pretty Women" and "Objects in the Mirror", but even they could not prepare me for the complexities and surprises of this film. <br /> <br /> To everyone who participates in this: bravo.
