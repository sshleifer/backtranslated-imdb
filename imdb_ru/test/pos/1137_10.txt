I saw this film once a long time ago, only once, and I didn’t know where it came from, and I searched for it for about six years, and I finally found it here on IMDb.com! It's just that the concept of the film itself is gorgeous, I believe that this is somehow related to the race of bioengineering creatures who are following us and our planet, but there is one person who does not absorb into conformity. And the way he does it, not to be discovered and discovered, is what keeps the film interesting. I don’t remember exactly how it ended, but I remember it ended with a big climax and a good turn.
