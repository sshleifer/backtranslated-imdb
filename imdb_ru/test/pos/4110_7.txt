Ross Hunter’s remake of Fantasy 1937, based on the long-running bestseller by James Hilton, was almost immediately written off by critics and audiences in 1973, which caused a negative reaction against musicals in general, which for many years gave the genre a bad Hollywood reputation. A group of disparate British and Americans are in an emergency flight from an Asian country torn by war, but their plane is hijacked and falls in a snowy mountainous area; a rescue squadron arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun always shines, and most of the residents are young and happy. Some of the performances of the classroom cast are not as stylish (the effervescent mood of the play, the gentle melodies of Burt Bacharach-Hal David, as well as the easy direction - all this will make the performers look a little silly). Peter Finch is an international peacemaker who has a tangled affair with a resident Liv Ullmann; Sally Kellerman - unhappy, laying out such lines as: “I was tired of photographing people with their heads torn off, so that people with ONE head — usually under hair dryers — could take the final blow before turning to the last recipe"; John Giguld "like Chang" , an Asian who learned to speak English when visiting Oxford, has a lot of fun with humor (but why are there no songs for Chang?). Hal David’s foolish lyrics are sometimes just awesome (“On a good ship, a lollipop / like Christopher Columbus / sailed by sea ? "), And the rhythm gets stuck with all this b It’s about the world around and how nothing could be more pitiful today, However, the production is lush, and the overall management has a strange effect. Two-dimensional characters are so serious that they actually become cute and the nonsense of the film is infectious. very fun. *** from ****
