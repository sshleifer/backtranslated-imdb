Hey, this is only TV. Of course, this is STAR TREK, the most favorite blah blah, and it's great, but everything is relative. What it comes down to is the guy in the elf's ears, rummaging around with a pizza-colored terry pattern swatch. <br /> <br /> In the hunt for the tunnel there is something like the THIRD MAN, and it is worse than in many episodes. In the end, this is one of the best TV shows. The wait is actually suspended. Danger really feels dangerous. As a small child, I cried when Spock told me that this disgusting creature was as sad, scared and frightened as the people it ate. It was one of my first lessons on empathy, a lesson supported by the episode of EMPATH, which was, although less exciting, even more melancholic. <br /> <br /> It bothered me when I was five years old that this thing, which looks like meat and tomatoes, actually consists of stone in one way or another.
