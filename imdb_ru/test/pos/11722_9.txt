This is "Citizen Kane" by Bert Reynolds. Unfortunately, nothing else he ever participated in came close to approaching the Sharkey Machine. It seemed to me that he had invested in him everything that he had. This is a movie that is in love with movies. . The last sequence in which Detective Sharkey single-handedly rescues a bus with a load of hostages is an incredibly exciting part of the movie. Everything moves as fast as it begins to go wrong, as it seems, it begins to live its own life, brilliantly achieved effect. On the streets of Mr. Reynolds looks cold, tense and dangerous. The precinct house looks dirty and tired, full of desperate people on both sides of the law, screaming, cursing, trying to make deals or just to stay alive. The newly degraded Sharkey, the reward for a failed drug, descends into this underworld. because of the corrupt policeman) - he and his team are part of the vice squad. The information they collect about crooked politics brings them into the world of high-class call girls and ruthless drug barons. Watching the apartment of one of these call girls (Rachel Ward), Sharkey falls in love with her portrait on the wall (I know, I know), and when in one of the rooms they find the body of a woman with a broken face, he thinks that this is hers. (Well, I said it was a movie that loved movies). The scene in which she enters, works great, even if you saw the original. The film is full of good touches, I especially like the military history of Charles Durning, finely played and shot in sharp contrast to the abduction and torture of Sharqi, who are respectively harsh and brutal. I must mention Vittorio Gassman and Henry Silva as two separate but equally evil brothers who have absolutely no redemptive qualities. They are "overcrowded" every time they are on the screen, and they do not suffer losses for society, when their time comes, the end of Silva is really special. As already mentioned, this is a Clint Eastwood film that Clint never made. The biggest compliment I can pay to Sharkey’s Car is to show that, in my opinion, Clint Eastwood couldn’t handle it better. The soundtrack has an equally high standard, featuring Sarah Vaughan, Joe Williams, Julie London, Chet Baker and other top-class artists. “Street Life” by Randy Crawford plays behind the title sequence, and I can never hear it without seeing Sharkey walking along the sidewalk. Like other correspondents, I never understood why this film was a little flop. I hope this is due to a critical review, especially at a time when there are so many police films and shows that have a quarter of their energy, freshness and pure joy. Vivre praise from the roofs. If you ever felt like thinking of Berthe Reynolds as a burnt pony with one trick, put the Sharkey Machine in your VCR. I promise you will not be disappointed.
