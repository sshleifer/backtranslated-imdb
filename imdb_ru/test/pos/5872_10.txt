I first saw this film as a teenager (I'm now over forty), and I have long believed that this is my favorite movie. The story is incredibly touching, without sentimentality. Acting, especially in March and Loy, is dead. And the fact that Dana Andrews is too old for her role does not detract from the credibility of his novel with Teresa Wright (which I consider to be the only hero in the film who is still alive). This could be another post-war melodrama, but the script and the actors are just too good to make it happen.
