Really funny mid-1950s British comedy about girls' school. All the girls are involved in pranks and disorders, make gins in the baths, smoke and play games of chance. Alastair Sim plays the main role Millicent, and also plays brother Millicent. A policewoman goes to the undercover school to see what's going on. This movie is funny, with great spectacles, and Alastair Sim is great. Just a classic British comedy, very fun and not too cool. Joan Sims and Sid James, the stars of many films “Carrie-on”, play small roles, but this film is about girls. Watch and enjoy where it all began.
