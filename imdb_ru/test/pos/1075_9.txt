Just watched this movie 2 days ago. It is very interesting to look at people and our world through the world of wine. I have no particular interest in wine, and yet I found it very instructive. The director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people as they are. While he exposes a lot of things that are below the surface, he manages not to stand and leave it to the viewer. He shows great compassion for people (and dogs) and empathy and allows people to tell their story, and at the same time demonstrates what they donâ€™t want to tell. <br /> <br /> The film shows us where our world is going, what advantages and what high price we pay. This is a film about the love of wine and the love of creating a large, personal and global character, character and formulas. <br /> <br /> For me, the real stars of the people are mature wine-makers with a disappointed look. on the world and on themselves. <br /> <br /> It takes some time to get used to the hectic movement and camera editing, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
