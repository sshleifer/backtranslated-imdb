This film was not about stereotypes, nor about dance moves, nor about pick-ups. This film was about the vulnerability of people's hearts. It was hard to believe that Kevin James could play a convincing role, that Will Smith could satisfy inaction, and that such a hackneyed movie genre could succeed in that way. I'm not going to sound too cute with this film — it wasn’t “groundbreaking” in any way — but it was a film worth seeing. Was it believable? Not. New York can not be so simple, and in the history of mankind there was no man who would have had a Hitchpoo. Of course, there are carnations, but not those that can get a chick at any time, with the exception, of course, of a seven-rake. What worked most in this film was that it focused on the dramatic side, not just comedy. It was a funny two hours, no doubt. But another two hours forced you to sit down in your seat, immerse yourself in the characters and smile.
