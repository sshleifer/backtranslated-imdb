I really enjoyed every minute of this movie. Jack Black and Kyle Gass definitely brought thunder in this epic story of friendship, hard rocking and fate. <br /> <br /> Brimming with unnecessary curses on every sentence, toilet humor and a general violation of the rules, this film must be seen by tough D fans in the world. <br /> <br /> We follow the journey of young Jables (Jack Black) and Kage (Kyle Gass) when they are trying to regain their choice. fate to win the night with an open microphone and become the greatest band on the planet. The duo must overcome obstacles such as a room full of lasers, a man with one leg, and a devil to complete his task. I will show you whether they do it or not. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack itself is good enough, and now we see D personally, making this experience even more magical. Must see everyone who calls himself a staunch fan of D. Beware of the jokes from the first album!
