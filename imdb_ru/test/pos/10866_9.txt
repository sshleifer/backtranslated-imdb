Here we have a sensible mix of typical Hong Kong filming, world destruction themes and intelligent filmmaking. Not that there were no big holes in the script and some special effects looked a bit cheap. But cinematography is an optical pleasure, and the soundtrack is first-class. A mixture of fast action sequences and colorful slow, sometimes almost poetic parts, has no comparison in its kind of film, so the classification is rather complicated. The nearest genre is a disaster or a terrorist movie with deeper human and political notes than usual. Well worth seeing around the world in cinemas. But I hope that there are so many other (mostly Asian) films before, and no one seems to believe me. Unfortunately.
