Forget all these juicy romantic movies with laptops and couples locked up with their lips, which somehow manage to escape into the world together after a long life on screen due to the overly simplistic unrealistic romance. Forget all these shameless "dog gives its life to save his family" clicks (although I have to admit that I have a weakness for them myself). Forget that Ricky Schroeder is already showing his penchant for replay at a tender age (now that one was shameless!). <br /> <br /> This television film, which, unfortunately, never again goes on the air, is the champion of all time. jerky, hands down. And a well written and well played story. Ann-Margret took the risk to take this role. There is nothing bright or sexy, and this in itself is a monumental achievement. Based on real events, she plays Lucille Frey, a terminally ill mother who dies to death trying to find good homes for her ten children, instead of leaving them in the hands of unpredictable government agencies. Frederick Forrest does an excellent job with her husband, a good-hearted but unreliable breadwinner, whose debilitating arthritis and personal demons make him unable to care for children. <br /> <br /> The film tells us about the heartbreaking process of Lucille to interview future parents, and then watch her children leave the house. It also gives us a glimpse of the children themselves and of the father who is grieving for the tragedy that is happening now and that will surely follow, and upset by his inability to do more. The scene in which the youngest of the children (Stephen) is taken to his new home is the most heartbreaking one I've ever seen. Now I grew up as a “hopeless romantic” and have spent many years since then, turning myself into a tougher, more cynical shell. I usually find more ridicule than sympathy in the sentimental cinematic deceit imposed on us these days. But this pearl of the early 1980s still kills me. <br /> <br /> I would really like someone with a marketing tone to release a DVD version of this drama. Among the special features you need to turn on the television broadcast of the Emmy Award next year. AM was nominated for this role, but the award for the best dramatic actress went to Barbara Stanwick for "Thorny Birds." In what was supposed to be one of the greatest moments in what is now a truly gray show of awards, Stanvik began to cry during her thank-you speech and said: “Ann-Margret, I love you!”, Which brought Ann-M in tears. . <br /> <br /> Last remark. IMDb rating "Who will love my children" at the time of this writing is 6.4. However, more than 75% of the ratings are in the range of 8-10 (mostly 10's). No matter which handicap system this site uses to change the overall rating of the films listed by IMDb, it does not fully fall under this rating. This "crying" for all the time, and damn good TV movie to download.
