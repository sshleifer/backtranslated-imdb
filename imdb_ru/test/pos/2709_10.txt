I first saw this film in 1994 or 95, when I was a freshman in high school, when he was on Lifetime. After I first saw it, I thought it was wonderful. Of course, it may not work longer, but it is as accurate as possible, in my opinion (no matter what someone might think). Cynthia Gibb superbly portrayed Karen, and Mitchell Anderson was fine, like Richard. Louise Fletcher (yes, who played "Nurse Ratched" in 1975 in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest") was also fine, but I discovered that her version of Agnes (mother Karen and Richard) was a bit ugly. I am an EXTREMELY HUGE Carpenters fan, and I believe that Karen’s voice has been and remains so wonderful. This really saddens me with the fact that she left and left this earth too early, but thanks to the endless popularity of her music and her angelic voice, the music will live on. In any case, returning to this film, for me and, perhaps, for other people (fans and non-fans of Carpenters), this is really a mystery as to what caused Karen to have this health problem. Is the media responsible or is it just Karen? I would not believe that this was her decision. It could be the media from a single article that was published about her somewhere in the 70s, when their hit hit “Close to You” came out (from what was shown in the film). There are other moments in the film. Richard's fight with drugs and Karen's short wedding. I did not hear about her loss in February 1983, since I had not yet watched the news; I learned many years later. I do not know whether there will be another film about Carpenter or Karen, shot in the future, but until then this film will be fine. I will say this: if Karen ignored the false details of this article or any future articles that might have been published with similar content, calling it “puffy” (which must have been pretty offensive), it would still be here in this land Today. I know that she is in heaven and probably entertains everyone with her beautiful voice. God bless you, Karen!
