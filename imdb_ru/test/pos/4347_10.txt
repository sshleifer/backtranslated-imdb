Charles Bronson is back in his most famous role. In my opinion, this is the best movie of the series and my favorite movie in the entire history. This film does not take itself seriously, because the filmmakers knew that all the social comments that were needed were placed in the first film. Golan and Globus made this film for Bronson fans, not for critics, and it works. DW3 was unfairly criticized as "garbage" and "weary record in a worn out row." These statements would be true if the film was created in order to take it seriously or distribute the statement, but it is not. If you take it for what it is, then DW3 is just a fun, action-packed game in which Charlie does street punks what we all would like to do. The action is non-stop, the atmosphere is great, and the film is the best movie of Bronson ever. You can say that the Cannon group, which pulled for a penny, spent a lot of money on it. It is believed that Bronson thought this film was too cruel, and that is why Winner did not make any of the following recordings. I can understand his concern, but, as always in the case of sequels, you need to move on to skip the previous entry. In any case, this film was no more brutal than any other film shot during that time. What makes DW3 the best of all the TV shows and my favorite movie (not the best, just my favorite) is action, the presence of Charlie, unforgettable villains and the ability to make the audience jump onto the bandwagon. The first film may be the most technically well made, but this one is the funniest. This time, Charlie actually has a few clever lines (although he doesn’t say much) and a half interesting story, picture, action, and guidance that would support him. Charlie has never been more intense or super cool than this. Yes, this is exploitative, perhaps he is promoting stereotypes, and perhaps this is the same story as before, but Bronson’s films have always been and always will protect the common man and give his audience what they want to see. Many argue that the DW series manipulates its audience, I answer that the films do not manipulate us, the fans are responsible for them. We demand that Bronson blow off a decent scum, and Winner and Co. deliver the goods. And for those of you who still want to write it down, remember a few things. DW3 was America's No. 1 film when it came out, and was among the favorites of watching millions of people on video and television, because they understand that not all films should be epic, they just have to be fun. ********** / 10 You can not get better.
