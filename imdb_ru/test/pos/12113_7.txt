Lloyd Hamilton was one of the most creative (and among the funniest) of all the silent film comedians. Why is he completely forgotten? Unfortunately, the original negatives for a large percentage of his films were lost when Fox’s warehouse burned down in the early 1930s. Hamilton was not handsome or graceful, like Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd; nor was he as vigorous as Raymond Griffith. And unlike Harry Langdon and (again) Chaplin, Hamilton did not try to sympathize with the audience. <br /> <br /> However, his films were extremely popular during their initial release, and today they remain fun. Oscar Levant once said that he asked Chaplin if there was another comedian whom he had ever envied, and Chaplin immediately called Lloyd Hamilton. The character most often portrayed by Hamilton on the screen — a flat hat with fastidious gestures and duck treads — was later adapted by vaudeville comedian Eddie Garr (Terry Garr's father) and then adapted by Jackie Gleason as his 1950s TV character “Poor soul” . <br /> <br /> Kino, directed by the pseudonym Roscoe Arbuckle, is one of Hamilton’s most innovative shorts, and it's fun. First we see him as a village boy, saying goodbye to his family behind the house in which they lived, on the way to the big city. Then he moves away from the cottage, and we see that he is in a big city with heavy traffic around it! <br /> <br /> In the end, our hero enters a restaurant (without a loan, but this is a Montmartre cafe) in downtown Los Angeles), where all the actors of the film eat between takes. There is a funny gag when the characteristic character of Hamilton meets three actors in costume and make-up, such as presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt: this anger would have been funnier if the impostors looked more like the originals. Finally, our guy sits down at the table hoping to meet a celebrity. Of course, to go to a restaurant and sit down at a nearby table is a big movie star ... none other than Lloyd Hamilton! There is a very well-done, double-exposure shot — the connection is almost imperceptible — when Lloyd Hamilton himself welcomes Lloyd Hamilton as a country guy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the peak of Hamilton’s creativity was very short, He began his career in gross farce films as half double action (Ham and Bad, opposite Bad Duncan), and he had a short and sparkling period of glory in shorts at the end of a period of silence. Sound films were not kind to Hamilton, and he was quickly ousted from the cast in some rude early conversations. Then he died young. Fortunately, “The Movies” is a pretty funny and great introduction to the style of this unique comedian. I rate it 7 out of 10.
