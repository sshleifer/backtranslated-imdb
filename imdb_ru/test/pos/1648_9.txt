The penal battalion is a story that only Russians could tell about the Second World War. Ironically, the largest front of the entire conflict was the least visible subject on the silver screen after the war. While the hostilities of the Western allies were depicted in almost all possible details and manners, the East was left without attention, or the work was left only for some old propaganda films that were not very different from historical material. <br /> <br /> There is no chance that Shtrafbat could compete with the Band of Brothers in all its details, but you also do not want to look at the screen, considering the minor visual effects. The fact that the soldiers are Russian is a reason enough to forgive the less exciting battle scenes, and you can focus on the most interesting story. The war on the Eastern Front and the character of the Russian army were so different that you could wish people to produce more dramatization from other fronts and armies. <br /> <br /> The fine battalion is not perfect, but it does have some rare specialties that increase the overall rating. This tends to destroy the myths that people have about World War II, the real heroes were the Russian people, not their leaders, who sent them on missions, where they could only die. Another great mythical bust is that he represents an enemy who does not raise a weapon as an equal person - progress that was also difficult to try out in many famous films. The Shtrafbat shows how the war on the eastern front was a war of survival, and how a clash of people turns people into dust.
