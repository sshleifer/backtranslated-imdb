There is something that says one of the characters (an aging director who pretends to be dead) that can summarize the whole film: "In Italy, the dead rule." True! This is a country without a future, in the hands of old and exhausted people. And the mysterious portrait of Bellocchio about the country, based on the obviously meaningless story of the director who has to shoot marriage parties in order to earn a living, manages to say a lot about what doesn't work here. But foreigners may miss the moment, as this is unclearly expressed. I understand that Australians or Canadians who watch this may be boring, and they wonder if there is a sense - well, it makes sense, but it is understandable only to people who live here today and open their eyes wide ... like Bellocchio. Of course, this is not one of his best films, and he is not as powerful as Buangioro, but worth seeing ... for Italians who live in Italy.
