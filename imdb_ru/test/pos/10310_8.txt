I think the film was really good. The subject, acting and music of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan were amazing. Although the director was able to show the situation of women in rural areas and how they suffer from a male-dominated culture, he neglected Fulhan's character a little and paid more attention to the violence she faced.
