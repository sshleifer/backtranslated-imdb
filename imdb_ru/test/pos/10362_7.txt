I like this movie. Many people call it "Sabrina teenage feminist." They do this with a lot of movies starring Melissa Joan Hart. And yet she really surprised me in this film because she was great in the role of Mary, who fights for justice when her roommate is raped. You could say that Hart was extremely determined in this film, and he showed. I also liked Lisa Dean Ryan as Mary's roommate. She very effectively made me feel sorry for her character after rape. Josh Hopkins was good as a cocky and selfish rapist. Lochlin Munro convincingly played his character. In my opinion, the action in this film is better than in most television films. <br /> <br /> The film was pretty predictable. In addition, I expected more from the final, it was too sharp. Delivery could be better. But the speeches and the general plot fill these problems.
