The theme of this film is potentially depressing: a man of thirty, without work, with little education, three children from a failed relationship, living in his parents' house, but dreaming of making feature films. But after about half an hour in the film, you realize that Mark Borchardt has an unlimited supply of drive and ambition - all this is simply aimed at his need to make films, and nothing else will make him happy. The film covers the entire emotional spectrum, but in the end you leave feeling happy because you just met wonderful people. Look at this - in the end, you want it to be longer.
