OhMyGAWD !!! MAGIC GARDEN, perhaps, one of the most vivid memories of my childhood 70s. Two hippie ponytail chicks, Carol and Paula, rocked on a swing, told jokes they took off from a bandage of laughter, put on costumes that they found in a giant chest called "Fairy Tale" and argued with an annoying pink squirrel named Sherlock, who lived in their trees. They could also play a good acoustic guitar and sing a beautiful melody. It was a great baby show. The feeling is very 70s. But the problem is: they no longer do such shows. Pity that. You could say that these two girls really had golden hearts and loved children, they were really cute. MAGIC GARDEN is one of those exhibitions that if they let out a box set, people WILL buy it, because this is such a HEALTHY walk through Memory Lane.
