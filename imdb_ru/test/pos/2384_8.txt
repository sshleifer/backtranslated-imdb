cool movie is nice to watch. Hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon. I really like setting up a location with all the links in New York. it was interesting how it all unfolds at the end. the expectation factor was effective, and the action, although it remained simple, was also effective in depicting characters. There are tons of little tricks in this movie that make things better. I think that the supporting actress did an excellent job with her role. the actors and directors in this film seem to be seamlessly stitched, and the quality of the shooting is quite impressive. the film is not without soft moments that gives it a good sense of balance.
