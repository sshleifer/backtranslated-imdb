Walter Mattau was remembered most of all because of a long series of comedies, which he filmed with his equal comedy partner Jack Lemmon from the movie “Luck” and “Strange Couple II”. But people tend to forget that in the late 1970s, he appeared with another partner in two films — a female partner. It was Glenda Jackson, the English double Oscar winner, who demonstrated her comic abilities against Mattaw, first in HOUSE CALLS, and then in HOPSCOTCH. Mattau's role was slightly larger in both films, because his characters were more important to the plots, but the chemistry between them was pretty good. If you ever want to see two professionals demonstrate how sexual intercourse can be insanely funny, look at how Walter and Glenda as Dr. Charlie Nicholson and Ann Atkinson experiment to see if two people can have sex on the bed according to the old rule of coding films of the two sides each one foot on the floor! Never before has sex been considered from such a clinical and mechanical point of view. <br /> <br /> Charlie Mattau had just been widowed before the movie began. In his life there was only one woman - his wife. So now he is an acceptable bachelor. He is also the lead surgeon in the hospital where he works, but the principal surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney is obviously senile (there are moments later in the film that show that he turns his old age on and off - see the scene where he rams Richard Benjamin’s car). Amos is ready for re-election (Charlie is his closest competitor to this post - if he wants to). However, Amos manages to convince Charlie to let him keep his job for reasons of self-respect. <br /> <br /> One day, Charlie notices Ann in the hospital. She had a small accident and was resting in bed, but Amos placed her in a cage-like apparatus (Charlie’s comment has not been used since around 1920). He pulls her out of the device, and soon romance her. She joins the hospital staff, but she criticizes Charlie’s willingness to serve Amos and criticizes some of the selfish tendencies that she sees among doctors in the hospital. <br /> <br /> Amos’s failure causes the death of a rich hospital patron (Lloyd Gough), who owned a baseball team (his greatest innovation was a separate visit to double headers). Amos tries to calm the young widow of the team owner by giving a speech at the funeral service (the line in the above summary is the line of sermon). However, she still intends to sue (her lawyer, David Thayer, says the hospital is the most incompetent he has ever seen). Thus, Amos suggests that Charlie arrange a romance for the widow to satisfy her from this expensive lawsuit. But how will Ann respond to this? The film is quite funny, and was so successful that, in addition to causing a sequel for Jackson and Mattau, it also led to the creation of a television series.
