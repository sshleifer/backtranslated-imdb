Went out with friends and watched this movie last weekend here in London. We didnâ€™t know what to expect, the poster gave a part of it, and I will not speak anymore not to spoil the plot, but we found that it was a great movie with great acting, convincing plot and scary as hell! Having done some research on making a film, I have to pass it on to those guys, directors, actors, writers, etc., who collected such a film with such limited resources. Post-production is also very well done. For all this, I give them 10 out of 10, and I hope that they will continue their excellent work. Keep it up guys. You burn!
