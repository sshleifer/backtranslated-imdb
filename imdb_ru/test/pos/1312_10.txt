This film tells about the life of the author and poet Mishima. He jumps over his past, on his last day and through some of his stories, but is skillfully built as he moves from section to section. It reflects the taste of man, his work and his times ... difficult 1960s. <br /> <br /> I think that the most remarkable pieces (literally full of "surprise") are excerpts from his works, the Kits (specially designed for working with the camera) are amazing ... stylized, beautiful and effective. They can be used as samples for any decorator. I woke up at night, dreaming of the Golden Pagoda. <br /> <br /> Stories were powerful studies of human nature and art. After watching this movie, I wanted to learn more about the work of this artist. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics or the history of Japan.
