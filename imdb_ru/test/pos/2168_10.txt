Black Scorpion is a funny movie about a gorgeous superheroine woman who wears leather tights and drives a car that turns into her smart armored Scorpion Mobile. She fights with the evil spirit and all this is a great recipe for a good time IMHO. I really liked the fact that she said “Yo” to make the machine computer take orders! Breathalyzer is so angry that he wants to give asthma to the whole city! It's all so great, and that's the beauty! The scene where Black Scorpion "attacks" its partner, steals the show. You will know it when you see. This DVD also has a funny interview with Joan Severance. She is a doll. Black Scorpion is a fun DVD. Loved it!
