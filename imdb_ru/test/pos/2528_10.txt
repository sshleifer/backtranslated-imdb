I come from Brazil ... the sad thing about this film was the exploitation that was made with this boy. They told the story of his life, and he never received a single “centavo” (Brazilian cent) from this film. Fernando is not the first and not the last to pass this lifestyle in Brazil. It's sad ... but this is the world we live in. It's about making money, not saving lives. Question: Where is Fernando today? Most likely ... dead. We strive to live in this "disney-filled fantasy life." When someone comes to the plate to help ... a higher power comes and says: “What will I get from this? Where is my cut? ”- I would like the conscience of the people to speak!
