I liked Dracula’s house much more than Frankenstein’s house. Carradine is much more tolerable, and his game is not so funny and overboard, as in the HOF. Actors deliver quite respectable performances. The plots (for example, monster, village gangsters, village idiot, hunchback nurse, etc.) are well mixed, therefore none of them becomes a strange fragment, as in HOF. It is better to run than the HOF stitched together. The hunchback nurse is as cute as the hunchback in the HOF. The doctor is very good. In addition, Lon Chaney adds a stylish touch with his wolf. Worth seeing twice. Classic universal horror with the typical 1940th, long lost talent. The results of the doctor’s work before and after his blood has been infected with Dracula are especially good.
