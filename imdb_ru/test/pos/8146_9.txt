When I was told about this film, I was not very happy to see him, although, according to the latest estimates, it was one of the best films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie itself. pretty visual (scenes from a man to a man, you don’t see everything) would not be a gay movie if it weren’t ... <br /> <br /> the film is very frivolous with humor and contains some very funny parts. I highly recommend this film, after about three-quarters you really feel the main characters, and this, I think, unites the whole film. <br /> <br /> once again, very well put together ... plus a cute Mormon.
