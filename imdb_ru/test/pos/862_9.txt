Wow, Stella Shorts are great! Many regular visitors from The State and Stella. I never knew that Stella could have been better than they were on the Stella TV show or even at Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I also never knew that short comedies can be useful. My favorites were pizza, Racking Leaves, The Woods, and David arranges a meeting with his long-lost cousin Greg. I think over everything that David was the funniest. It's funny when it doesn't make sense. I like the music in shorts. This is what I pay attention to. They always had good taste in music. I wish they still did shorts, or this, or bring there a sitcom. I hope they keep making a good and funny comedy.
