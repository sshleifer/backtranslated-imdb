This film may be too long, but 45 years later it still has charm. The lead roles seem more appropriate for Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. I didn’t care about Gary Cooper, but Ingrid Bergman is fine, especially with dark hair. The film is worth a look for supporting actors: Flora Robson is amazing as a mulatto servant. She is a white woman with a black face, and can have the expression of evil or voodoo mistress. Jerry Austin as a servant-servant plays a delightful role that makes you laugh, despite some too long scenes. Speaking of scenes, Florence Bates steals most of those in whom she’s a widowed social lady. I did not understand what happened at the end of the film in a railway fight, and the last scene was purely Hollywood. A strange feeling when you realize that the name of the film refers to the railway, and not to baggage!
