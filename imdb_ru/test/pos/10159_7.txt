I don’t want to admit it, but I haven’t found it to be one of Hitchcock’s best, but thrilling, climate thriller. In a remake of the 1934 film Hitshok with the same name, Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) ?? a man who knows too much - and his wife Joe McKenna (Doris Day) are vacationing in Morocco with their son Hank (Christopher Oslen) when a case of erroneous identification occurs and fall into the network of a conspiracy to kill. The conspirators go to any lengths to prevent them from interfering in their conspiracy: to kidnap their beloved Hank. <br /> <br /> I found it surprising that Doris Day, whom I usually associate with the comedies of Rock Hudson, was thrown into the Hitchcock film. When I watched him, I soon realized that it was more of a family film compared to Hitchcock's other works (for example, Psycho), and she had the singing abilities needed to create Que Sera Sera, which she did perfectly . She was good, like herself, and James Stewart had chemistry that helped the couple to believe. <br /> <br /> Compared to other great director works, I think it's not so good, but it’s still an extremely entertaining family thriller / mystery. There is also an extra bonus to Que Sera Sera, which turned out to be a hit for Doris Day. Well directed, well acted. Great movie.
