This film is my favorite comedy of all time, and I have seen many comedies. First of all, I should not have this film without a script. Just a storyboard. The dialogue is almost entirely written by actors. What makes this film absolutely hsyterical. The cast is one of the best comedy ensembles you've ever seen. The story of the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia and some of the contestants for them. The laughter stems from the absolute pity of the characters. ***** / *****
