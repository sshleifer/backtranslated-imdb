The series as a whole is Jim Henson's best work. John Hurt * - Narrator Often, Oscar screenplays are not surprising when you consider what Minghella is writing. Oscar actor, always. <br /> <br /> Sapsorrow - everyone loves "Soldier and Death", but something in Sapsorrow pushes him one iota higher in my favor. In the first ballroom stage costumes, music is perfection. It hurts and the dog, as a rule, partially interacts with the story, but this time Minghella raises it to an additional level in the “ring” scene between Hurt and Sapssorrow. The chemistry between the characters is especially well developed, more than usual in the series, with regard to the friendship between Straggletag and the prince. Saw it? Look again. Pay more attention (to those of you who are not fanatically adoring this 22-minute piece of cinematic perfection). Never seen it? I am very, very sorry. <br /> <br /> Good luck, child - not as difficult as Sapssorrow, but very clever in itself. This is a story about irony. Irony in irony, in irony ... I love it. Each character is perfected, with the exception of the ferryman. He was doing drama; all others engaged in a romantic comedy. I forgive him. This is my favorite episode, mostly comedy, Sapsorrow and Soldier and Death are examples of more dramatic episodes. <br /> <br /> Note: Greek myths. What he lacks in the subtleties of Minghella (another writer), he partially compensates with boldness, since he portrays the four selected myths with more sympathy, respect and history than usual. Also check out Jim Henson's Hour if you can get it. For the narcotics narrators, there is a person in it himself, representing myths, a lion from the "True Bride" and ... No annoying introductory topic! Half storyteller, half pure, immaculate wit.
