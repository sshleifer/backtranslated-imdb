As a fan of history, mythology and fantasy the show "Mystical Knights" pulled me from the very beginning. It has a decent script, costumes are fantastic (there are exceptions), a good game, heroes and villains play well with each other. <br /> <br /> SCENARIOS - Half of the script is pretty cool, the other half did not work, but it all mixed up, which means that many episodes turn out to be so-so. In addition, some key players are constantly given dead lines (for example, King Conhobar and Angus), they need to be given something ... more. I'm not sure what, but authors should be able to come up with something. ACTION - In addition to some excessive actions on the part of the villagers (terrible features in which they put too much effort), the casting was very well suited for choosing their leads and so on. Everyone, good and bad, work well together! COSTUMES / WEAPONS - casual wear that everyone wears is impressive! The Mystic Knight's armor, which fails, is owned by Deirdre and Garrett. A bikini with chain mail is likely to have better protection in her case ... and will not look like plastic; it looks like a bunch of brown plastic pieces when it should look bronze. Ivar's trident looks like it was bought at a discount store, and although Garrettâ€™s weapon looks cool, it also looks ductile. <br /> <br /> Recently, the Mystical Knights have acquired too many features of the Power Rangers, if you watch the show, you will understand what I mean. However, as the series develops, it must find its niche and improve its style. In general, this is a wonderful show that should appeal to all ages (most of my friends and I watch it, and we all are over 20). The plot thickens and twists, although in some places it becomes a little juvenile, and everything becomes more interesting. This can be interesting for fans of the movie "Willow" or the series T. "The Adventures of Sinbad." A lot of adventures, a little mystery, a little romance, the spread of forces in nature ... Check it out! (My rating: 7/10)
