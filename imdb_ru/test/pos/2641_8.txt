While I consider my predecessor, “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” the standard with which to compare other comedies for teenagers, “Wildlife” is one of the less well-known films of the time - and a worthy sequel, if you can call it that. I believe that his slogan reads: "From the creators of FTARH, something else is faster." This is definitely true. Although he may lack the depth of the first one, which solves such problems as first dates, teen sex and abortion, “Wildlife” is, nevertheless, an excellent film. This is pure chaotic fun, especially because of the main character of Chris Penn, Thomas Drake. If Spiccoli had fed on coke, not weeds, he would have been a Drake. Eric Stolz, in his first leading role, is gorgeous, like the carefree Bill Conrad. Two characters work well with each other. Think of the younger, weird pair of Hippers with the brilliance of the 80s. Besides these, there are many other wonderful things in this movie that are worth mentioning. Lea Thompsom never looked prettier, especially during the scenes of her work in a donut shop. Jenny Wright is amazing and fun to watch. Rick Moranis plays a great nerd / pervert who wants to get into her pants. Thomas Drake's fellow wrestlers are hysterical, especially Benny, a little Puerto Rican, who utters quite memorable lines. In particular, one day, which he shouted out at a strip club at night, I first found myself on the floor. That says something! Finally, the film ends with one of the best parties of the 80s on film. Pay attention to the special performances of Ron Wood from the Rolling Stones, Leo Penn (father of Sean and Chris Penn) and the occasional Michael Jackson, like a party. Add to this no one but the man himself, Eddie Van Halen, and you cannot go wrong. For Van Hagar fans, keep your ears open to riffs that can be found on albums such as 5150, OU812 and For Forfulful Carnal Knowledge. <br /> <br /> If something disrupts the course of the film, this is a small story featuring Randy Quaid as a burnt vet in Vietnam. It just seems inappropriate and unnecessary. Other than that, it's almost perfect. If you are a fan of senseless, but funny movies of the 80s and have not seen this movie yet, something special is waiting for you. RENT NOW !!! <br /> <br /> p.s.-The authors say that Cameron Crow has a cameo as one of the cops in the film. He turned his back during his scene, because I have not yet found him. Someone please help me.
