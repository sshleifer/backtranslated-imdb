It was the best film I saw in 2000. The Cohen brothers never let me down before, and, of course, this time too. <br /> <br /> This is one of those rare films these days - it's witty, smart, and extremely interesting. I left the movie with warmth in my heart. Of course, there are a lot of things Cohen has - strange characters and unusual gadgets, a well-developed plot and magical camera work. But no Cohen film is like another Cohen film, unless of course you notice their overall quality. <br /> <br /> The big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good. But the real masterpiece in this film comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the actors are great too. <br /> <br /> The film is a light comedy with a musical undertone, which tells the story of countrymen and old country music, full of wit and intelligence. This is a very unlikely combination. But that is exactly what this picture is.
