Many Americans are lazy, and this is evident even in our DVD viewing. Many of us do not like to spend time reading one and a half hours (or more) of subtitles, so we prefer not to watch a lot of foreign films. One movie that is FULLY worth your time, no matter how mundane your task is reading the subtitles, is Green Butchers. This is by far the best foreign film I've ever seen, and has led many American films I've seen lately. This is a difficult situation, told in a surprisingly simple and fun dialogue. The depth of character obtained in this film is amazing. The way Sven and Eigel (sorry if they are written incorrectly) feed each other with contrasting characters is absolutely amazing! The actors were well chosen, and I very much hope that the sequel is under consideration ... he needs very little Bj√∂rn and what is on her face ... just give me Svendu and Eigel on some journey support for the characters and more amazing dialogue! To the author of this beautiful script I say: write more! The story itself is pretty perverted, but you'll still be rooting for the bad guy ... without remorse. PLEASE, watch this movie!
