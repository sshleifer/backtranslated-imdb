This comic classic of English school antics - and was one of the great classics of art house. Then the art house disappeared with the advent of videos. And the audience of this film, too. The loss is not for art houses or for this great film. Loss for those who will never have a real opportunity to see this memorable laugh filled with cinematic masterpiece. But I preach to the converted, not me. Who else will be looking for this movie?
