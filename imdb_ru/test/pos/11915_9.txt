I recently rented this film as part of the nostalgic phase I am going through. I was born in 1980, and therefore the film from the mid 80s to the mid 90s occupies a rather important place in my growing up. <br /> <br /> This film was one of my favorites, and I was very excited when it became available in the UK. Over time, the situation has not worsened, it is still a great fun movie, exciting in its own way. Of course, it fades in the shadow of big, big budget films, but don't let it stop you from enjoying it. <br /> <br /> Worth renting or even buying at discounted prices that you will find for.
