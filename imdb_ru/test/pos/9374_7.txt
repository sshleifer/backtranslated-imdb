I did not read the source, Richard Brooks’s novel “The Brick Chanterelle”, which I hope is not as unfortunate as its name, but I understand that the real villain was a homophobe, not an anti-Semite. (And honestly, Sam Levine is written as a gay guy who picks up a drunken soldier.) But, okay, you need to go with the flow. Consider the year 1947. Even anti-Semitism on the screen has not yet been considered. Many of the people responsible for modern films were themselves Jews, but anti-Semitism was verbose for many years because it was considered unpleasant. Therefore, we can hardly blame the creators of this film for not leaving the victim to a homosexual. Now it is REALLY unpleasant - and besides, perhaps many of the spectators were rooting for Robert Ryan to get away with it. We are by no means free from prejudice, but we still have come a long way since 1947. <br /> <br /> Watching this again for the first time in many years, I was impressed by the rather slow pace of the first half of the film, the many shots of two people talking, the shadows, the time that passes between the question and the answer, boring editing. But I could live with that because of the plot of the film and a few other things. <br /> <br /> One of the things that keeps me abreast of events that unfold so deliberately is the game of Robert Ryan. The guy does a great job. Sometimes he may seem thoughtful, fun subordinate and helpful to the police - “Anyone I can help, yes, sir.” Then, alone or with another soldier, boiling hate rises to the top, not so much because of what he says, but how he looks. Frown, piercing gaze, shiny dark eyes. Wow. <br /> <br /> The film caused a lot of heat because of the false talk of Robert Young about the murder of his grandfather. It doesn’t bother me at all, although I think Dimitrios didn’t need Young to shove his face into the camera when he talked about “Mixes and Popists”. However, given the context, this is one of the most shocking moments of the film. Part of his influence is due to the almost random delivery of the message by Young, and partly because the message was not heard on the screen before. <br /> <br /> Another feature of the film that makes it almost surreal is the character of Paul Kelly and his relation to whore Gloria Graham. Holy Guacamole, what an elliptical conversation Kelly. “You know what I told you? All those things that I just told you? They all lie. ” His character gently intersects the pathos with eeriness. It is impossible to know what to do with it. He adds almost nothing to the plot, but the film would have been much less without his presence. <br /> <br /> This is a dark, dark movie. His people live in the dark. And there is a murder. Almost no one screams and no screams. The horror that these people have experienced and which some of them still carry with them, like malaria, seems just below the surface. <br /> <br /> See if you have a chance.
