When I saw the original when I was 13 (and, yes, I was stupid enough to watch it while I was babysitting!), I was excited to see this remake. <br /> <br /> Camilla Bell performed the role of Jill Johnson perfectly, and the fact that a teen horror movie could be made in 2006 without tremendous vulgarity and bloodshed made the movie even stronger. I had a great time trying not to bite off my nails! <br /> <br /> This film will not bring anyone Oscar, but it is interesting and worth the price ticket that I bought to see it. I think that girls all over the world should watch the original and the remake ... and then decide never to babysit again. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that I am glad that I am too old to look after children! Just in a dark creepy house with sleeping children, there is something that makes this movie classic. No blood, no blood ... just good psychological fun! WINNER!
