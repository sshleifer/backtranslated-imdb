I first saw this film recently. If you ask me, he will not get the credit he deserves. It's a bit like an American pie meeting Fast Times in Ridgemont High, but with more depth. He solves the same problems as both films, but in such a way that there is some truth in it. The ending is sad, but such is life. I think everyone should see this. I have it on the DVD form, and it took so long to find it too. That should say something, heh, and one more thing I’ll add is that it’s pretty hard to find a soundtrack. I believe they stopped it, but the soundtrack for this film is amazing. It features songs by artists such as The Commodores, U2, Devo, REO Speedwagon, The Cars, KC and the Sunshine Band, and many others.
