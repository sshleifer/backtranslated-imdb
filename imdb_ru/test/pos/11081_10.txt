... sings David Bovi in ​​this film. BUT THIS!!! It's ALL about America, so don't be ashamed to watch it. Think, if you can, to prevent more damage ... You know, you're the same ordinary guy next door, so be careful! One of the best critics of "healthy" mind and friendship. Still not care? Try the music - it's worth trying, just close your eyes, and Pat Metheny and David Bowie touch you so deeply that you start screaming! And while watching, if you dare to open your eyes, please do not make popcorn and all that, you will be very bored. You may think that this is not worth it, but think twice - and do not look at your neighbors' lawn - you never know what to find there ... Is it worth it? Try! Just do not die and do not gloat ...
