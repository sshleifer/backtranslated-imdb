One of my desires is to become a director, and I just have to say that I can’t compete with the powerful War Home War drama. The reason is that the acting is perfect, and when you watch the film, you will understand what I'm talking about. All I can offer is to watch it, I got so carried away with it and was very impressed. <br /> <br /> Estevez’s relationship with Tire on screen was simply amazing. <br /> <br /> And his relationship with his mother too (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes include this 2. <br /> <br /> Just like the relationship between Sheen and his daughter, Estevez's sister in the film. <br /> <br /> 10/10, and definitely in my TOP-10. I want a DVD!
