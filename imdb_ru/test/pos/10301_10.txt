This film is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people. There are only three places (school, shop and coach house) that are actually used. However, mainly in the house of the coach. The film does not need special effects or stunning views to be amazing in itself. <br /> <br /> Four friends who were connected during their basketball days are dating. A person is rich, important and has no real love beyond money. Someone wants to be mayor again, but his rivalry makes him sour. One wants to be a school leader and take care of his family. One of them is a traveling alcoholic. <br /> <br /> First, I love the actors of this film. They were all nominal to me. They have proven their worth here. <br /> <br /> One of the most important moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, blows up the coach. He screams and talks about how the coach cheated in the winning game. He blows the trainer's whistle and shouts out his catchy phrases: “Forgive me, father, for I have sinned!” This is amazing, with energy that just cools you. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended to anyone who understands human emotions and does not need bright effects to interest them.
