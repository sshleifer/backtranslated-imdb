A very good “Precoder” with Dick Bartelmes in the lead role, who in some way reminded me of Hawkes “Only Angels Have Wings” (1939), in which Bartelmes also played a role. This film was shot by master William Wellman, who was responsible for the outstanding aviation silent film "Wings". <br /> <br /> Bartelmess plays a pilot of an airplane who can take care of the devil who is accused of an accident. After that, he meets and falls in love with cute Sally Eilers, who participates as part of the law in a traveling air circus; but when Brother Bartelmess appears on the scene, a three-way relationship arises. <br /> <br /> There are many exciting moments at the Central Airport, as well as a few touching and touching scenes thanks to the excellent chemistry that develops between Barthelmess and Eulers (which, in my opinion, in this film is very similar to actress Dorothy McCaill ). Tom Brown is good as Brother Bartelmess, who has just been successful in Wyler’s Tom Brown of Culver movie. <br /> <br /> Great special effects, good flight stunts, fast-paced film; overall very interesting. Do not miss it when TCM transmits it again.
