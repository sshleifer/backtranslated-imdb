Psychopath (1973) Journey through a memory alley. I saw this movie many years ago on old black and white television. The host of the children's show, Mr. Rabbi, is avenging himself for the brutal violence that parents inflict on his kiddies fans. Mr. Rabbi (it seems he is always on the verge of losing) finally puzzles and decides to go hunting. Watch out for bad parents, because Mr. Rabbi is on a hunt! What happens next is priceless. However, trying to find this movie will be a daunting task. <br /> <br /> This film is notable for the fact that Joe "Maniac" Spinell made a short promotional roll for a film based on this. In his unfinished film, he plays Mr. Robbie, a TV channel. a clown (who looks like a plump, not in the shape of Edward James Olmos), who avenges his young fans for abusing children by stalking their parents. Unfortunately, Mr. Spinell could not find the means to complete the project. The film was going to be called Maniac II: “Mr. Robbie”. Rabbi or Robbie, the similarities are too close for comfort. Pretty cruel for pg film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
