This is the best movie I've ever seen. Davey / Mr. Slaussen at the same time: <br /> <br /> 1) Torture due to his talents (for example, “I can control it; I can! I shouldn’t have to do it! It's good!”) <br /> <br / > 2) Desperately need friendship, for example, <br /> <br /> “How is the soup? <br /> <br /> “The soup is very good.” <br /> <br /> “Would you like some crackers with soup?” <br /> <br /> “I would like more crackers, please”. <br /> <br /> “How is it?” <br /> <br /> “Yes, the soup is very good.” <br /> <br /> 3) I am proud of my accomplishments (for example, “A rather elegant trick, eh?”) <br /> <br /> 4) Lady (for example, “You are so beautiful. Why don't you like me?” ") And <br /> <br /> 5) Sometimes very, very angry (for example," You can not leave! ") <br /> <br /> Connors had to receive an academic award for the best male role in this film . I mean, who was maybe better ?! the stars of this masterpiece did not have a brilliant career. I highly, highly recommend this with a movie! It is available at amazon.com. Everyone should own it. Do this overnight and eat the soup while watching.
