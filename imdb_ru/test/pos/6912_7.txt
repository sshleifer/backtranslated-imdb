Dramatic license - some hate it, although it is necessary when retelling any life story. In the case of Lucy, all the highlights of the teenage life of Lucille Ball, early career and a 20-year marriage with Desi Arnaz are all included, albeit in a truncated and revised form. <br /> <br /> The main emotional moments from the life of Lucy became clear: the struggle of Lucille to find their niche as an actress, finally turned into a brilliant comedian who made the character of Lucy Ricardo a legend; her tumultuous, romantic and ultimately impossible marriage to Desi Arnaz; Lucy and Desi created the first television empire and forever consolidated their place in history as the most memorable pair of comedy television shows. <br /> <br /> Like Lucille Ball, Rachel York does a commendable job. Do not expect to see the same wonderful transformation as Judy Davis, who played in Judy Garland, but York makes Boll strong-willed, but pretty, and in itself very funny. Although her comedy time is different from Lucy's time, she is still believable. The film never went into details about her perfectionist behavior on the set and her mistreatment of Vivian Vance in the early years of "I love Lucy", but watching York portray Lucy, rehearsing in private, is a pleasant inclusion. > Daniel Pino is thinner and less charismatic than the real Desi, but he has his own charm and he does mostly decent work with a Desi accent, especially on the debut scene. Madeline Winter was decent, if not too memorable, as was the teenage Lucy. <br /> <br /> Vivian Vance and William Frawley, fortunately, were not so good, because Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing in roles, not that they were not good actors in themselves, they simply were not suitable for the people they played. Most of the actors were from Australia and New Zealand, and depressed accents are sometimes found. <br /> <br /> Although the basic structure of the film adheres to a historical fact, there are many deviations, some for seemingly inexplicable reasons. , Jesse Oppenheimer, chief screenwriter for Lucy's “My Beloved Husband”, which began in 1948, is depicted in this film as arriving on stage to help with “I Love Lucy” in 1951, completely ignoring the fact that he was creator! This film also depicts Mark Daniels as the main director of "I Love Lucy" throughout the film, completely ignoring the fact that he was replaced by William Asher after the first season! In addition, although I believe this was due to budget constraints, Ricardo is shown to live in the same apartment throughout his stay in New York, when in reality they changed apartments in 1953. The kitchen set is slightly larger and rolls over from the original as well. A house in Connecticut looks pretty close to the original, except for the fact that the right and left sides of the house were compressed and rebuilt. <br /> <br /> Desi talks about buying RKO in 1953, during the Lucy incident, despite the fact that RKO did not appear on the market until 1957. These changes could well be radical, and the film does. to work on the transmission of basic facts, but it would not hurt them to show a little more respect for Oppenheimer and Asher, two vital figures in the story "I love Lucy"? The biggest blunder occurs in the "I love Lucy" holiday scenes, at least some of them. It is always risky to recreate something that was captured on film and was noticed by billions of people, but even more so when REVIEW CHANGES occur. The scene with a giant loaf of bread was truncated, and anyone who was familiar with this episode would immediately notice the difference! The number “We have a child” was also reduced, but otherwise it was almost dead. Of course, the best was the scene with the “roar of the grapes,” when Rachel York did nail Lucy’s manners. The producers made the wise decision not to try to directly recreate the pieces of Vitametavegamin and the confectionery factory, instead showing the actors to rehearse them. These scenes have proven effective due to this approach. <br /> <br /> The main mistake of the film is that it makes the assumption that viewers already know a lot about Lucy’s life, since much has been missed or missed altogether. In general, however, this gives a decent portrait of Lucy and Desi's marriage, and factual errors can be missed when character development works effectively.
