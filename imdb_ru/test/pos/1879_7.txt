The Man With the Screaming Brain is not a perfect film, of course, but I am sure that he was never more than a star car for Bruce Campbell, that is, he works as a summary of his entire career. sarcasm, cheese, action and happy endings. As a writer, Campbell is uneven - there are many things in this story that do not make much sense (why does the robot suddenly have a breast just because a woman’s brain is implanted in it?), And some scenes resemble replays of other, better incarnations ( where Egor and William are fighting for control of William’s body, right from Evil Dead II). However, there are many small touches and non-tenets that look pretty shiny, for example, when William is in the midst of a panic and shouts at the statue: “What are you looking at ?!” The film looks like an original sci-fi channel, perhaps because it was. The game is actually pretty good. I especially liked Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; Yes, she was ruthless and cunning, but at certain moments, it seemed to look tragically at her, that history had never explored. Ted Raimi coped with the standard role of “clumsy assistant” quite remarkably, and Bruce is funny as an arrogant, sardonic, indulgent American moron. (Now, when he is writing his own films, one might think that he will give himself a role in which he was no longer a typographer). “The Man with the Screaming Brain” is a strange, meaningless B-film, which should be pleasant for anyone who can avoid taking the cinematic experience too seriously.
