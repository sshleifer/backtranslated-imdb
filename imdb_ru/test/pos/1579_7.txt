GUTS OF A BEAUTY is slightly better than its predecessor GUTS OF VIRGIN. Although this film is not really a continuation in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the down payment, I found that BEAUTY is a little stronger and better assembled in all respects than VIRGIN ... but on the other hand, it is not enough that says. <br /> <br /> BEAUTY begins with a rather rude and frank exploit film. A pair of yakuza cats hold a young woman in captivity and begin to rape her forcibly. As this abomination continues, the main guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in Africa, and that they would do the same to her. Then they shoot her with drugs and rape her again. She somehow escapes and finds herself in a clinic where a nurse there listens to her sobbing. Rape eventually drives her previous experience into stress and commits suicide. An employee of the clinic, inspired by the story of a young lady, decides to take revenge on the gang, seducing one of the lower level guys and trying to hypnotize him to kill the yakuza leaders. This whole plan backfires, so now Ms. Vigilante, the clinic worker, is subjected to the same treatment as our initial rape, only worse (after rough group rape and pre-rape ...). She also receives drugs, but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly unhappy victim ----- she turns her into a raging hermaphroditic blood demon !!! (no, damn it, this is what really happens !!!) This is when BEAUTY really takes off with some pretty crazy scenes of insane murder - including very stylish rape that looks like a cross between someone else and bad porn, and my favorite muffling head engulfed-on-demon-vagina (complete with demon-vagina-tina ...), which must be seen to be believed ... <br /> <br /> Of course some promising things happening in GUTS OF A BEAUTY, but still very fragmented feelings. BEAUTY almost feels that two different films are not compatible with each other. However, I have to pay tribute to the film - the scenes of rape are very rough and misogynistic, and the scenes of the murders are just outside the wall. Solid 7/10 for another crazy J-horror "classic."
