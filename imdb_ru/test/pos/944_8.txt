My mom, Frank, starts off as a warm, friendly comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, short for Francis, played by Sinead Cusack), who shakes herself up in dismay when she enrolls her son at the university. Most of her friends and family are terrified, not least her son (Matthew Newton), who is in love with his best partner's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile, Frank provoked the ire of his disapproving English teacher (Sam Neal). <br /> <br /> Matthew Newton completely disarms David; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character is alarmed. He generates valuable goodwill by guiding the audience through some of the more awkward, broad comedy moments of the film. Shortly after halfway through, the first scriptwriter and director Mark Lamprell expertly directs his film into darker emotional territory and gives Cusack a real chance to shine. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is full of familiar and welcoming faces (Lynette Curran, Sasha Horler, Nicholas Bishop) and all the directors (including more lively than usual Sam Neal) are excellent. Despite the fact that this will change a bit by the end, My Mother Frank delivers more than it promises, and is a true Australian viewer.
