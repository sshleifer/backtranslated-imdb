It is inexplicable that I first watched this film just a couple of days ago and from the very beginning I understood what was going on. This film kept my attention from the beginning to the end, and ran through the whole range of emotions (and, perhaps, would help me discover some of them that I never knew about). <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman is absolutely brilliant, like Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing as a person who has to combine at least three different problems in life: an abandoned husband, a workaholic, and a chief executive and a loving father. Meryl Streep in the role of Joanna Kramer was not so important for the film simply because Joanna was absent for the most part, but when she was on the screen, she let Hoffman escape for his money. However, the really outstanding (in my opinion) was supposed to be a young Justin Henry in the role of Billy Kramer. Children are always an innocent victim in the breakup of marriage, and Justin seemed completely natural and quite plausible in this role, as he deals with conflicting emotions around his mother and his adaptation to life with his father, only to have confusion around why gotta leave his dad when his mom got him. Young Justin, it seems, did not miss the slightest blow in this very difficult role. <br /> <br /> In general, this is an excellent Oscar-worthy film, the only weak point of which was that I thought it was really a disappointing decision to make a happy and happy ending that was completely unrealistic given the destructive battle over Ted and joanna. But there is nothing to complain about. <br /> <br /> 9/10
