This is a rather obscure, dumb horror film in the 1970s Everglades. This is really stupid and unconvincing in the first half, and then begins to improve in the second half. There is a scene in which the hero runs to save his friends, interspersed with cadres of singing of the church group, I do not know. It is fascinating. I was impressed with the night scenes, because in reality it looked like night, unlike most low-budget horror films, where it still looks like daytime. I feel that the director was really talented, but worked with a tiny budget and a tight schedule. In the end there are several scenes, one of which was mentioned above, as well as the final credits, which are very cool. This film could become a real classic if it left its symbols Scooby-Doo and went straight to the throat. I was surprised at how good this film was. I could not take my eyes off this, and I had to ask myself "why?"
