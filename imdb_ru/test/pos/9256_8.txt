This is the last episode we deserve. At the end of last season, everything remained in the mood of "life goes on," which was hardly the completion that this realistic series deserved. Although this series was not happy, this series always made you think (a rarity on television), and this is no exception. “Is death justified by reasoning?” “Does the morality of society reflect or is it shaped by the morals chosen by the few in power?” “What is a fair death, and can it exist?” their final thesis. Excellent acting, excellent writing, great camera work, brilliant editing, clean manual. If you saw the series and missed it when you first start, then somehow get a copy. If you have never watched the show when it was launched, it will stand up by itself, but it can be hard to keep up with keeping up with who all the characters are and what they refer to in their diverse past. For those of us who have been avid viewers of the show in the past two seasons, this is a very enjoyable experience.
