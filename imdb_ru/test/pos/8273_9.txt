When it was first transmitted at the Masterpiece Theater, it had a profound effect on me. It is beautifully filmed and filmed. I immediately read the book by Mary Webb, and she remains one of my favorites for all time. Janet McTier is beautiful as Prue, and I fully expected that she would become a regular member of the British drama scene. I guess she decided to focus on the British scene instead. <br /> <br /> I hoped that thanks to the American success of Janet McTire after a few years (with Tumbleweeds), this film would be available to us again. Alas, it has not yet been released on DVD. If someone is listening there, please do it again!
