I have not seen this film since 1979, when I was a teenager. I grew up on Sesame street dolls and later realized how much time and effort it took to bring these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master of the muppeter. When I watched this movie the other day, he took me back when I was younger and everything looked much simpler. For this time travel, I rate this movie as 10. <br /> <br /> The plot tells how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. Laughter and fun - this is classic mappetism. I am glad that these films still exist for the next generation. I hope I never grow up the magic of the doll.
