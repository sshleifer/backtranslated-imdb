Although this film changes reality, making it more heroic and interesting, sometimes fantasy is more pleasant than real life, and nothing can be more real than Errol Flynn playing Caster. It remains the best movie about Custer. The music by Max Steiner is great and the Irish song “Jerry Owen” is also played throughout the film, which was Caster's favorite. There should be more villains in the film because they are trying to concentrate all the bad guys in Arthur Kennedy. The relationship between Flynn and De Havilland flow, like no other, in their films together, and directed by Raoul Walsh with his experience in outdoor scenes with many actors at their best.
