I saw this movie on TV back in the 60s, and it still feels good even after the brilliant speeches of D. Lee Ermey, Lou Gosset and even Frank Sutton (in a comic key) on USMC Gomer Pyle. I was not in the service, but my brother had a record as a trainer in the Air Force, and it was scary. Other family members who were Marines told me that Ermey and even Sutton were good players. The only thing missing in “D.I.” is language. In 1958, they still could not use offensive language in the film, but Jack Webb faced the hell out of it without him. I think this is his best role. In Dragnet, he was pretty tough, I admit, although not as bad as George Raft, but he used it only to influence "The I.". You will never forget the funeral of a dead flea! The romantic part was just to stretch the film, but in fact did not interfere with the main plot. Don Dubbins was pretty good, but he never excelled this film in his career. As for patriotism, Jack Webb was a TV presenter, John Wayne. In some episodes of Drahna, he went too far, but not in “I.” After 40 years, I was hoping that the film would be able to withstand the films "Full Metal Jacket" and others; and did it!
