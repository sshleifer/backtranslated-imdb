This is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. Gorgeous Technicolor demonstrates the beauty and showy hair of Rita Hayworth. She was supposed to make more color films, but then Colombia could hardly allocate money for Technicolor performances. <br /> <br /> Rita - WOW, like Rusty Parker - she is in some ways not behind the most sparkling numbers ever. She also looked beautiful in a dress of the century, so she was given the opportunity to play her own grandmother. <br /> <br /> The film begins with "The Show Must Continue" - it looks great to me - but Danny McGwire (Gene Kelly) is not impressed. His motto is work, work, work !!! One of the dancers, Maureen (Leslie Brooks), intends to become better and is going to audition for the "Golden Wedding" competition from Vanity. Just Grow also turned out to be auditions. In a very funny scene, Maureen had just auditioned like this and, seeing Rusty, gives her some tips on how to impress the judges !!! "Do not be shy and more modest - chat and sparkle." Grow does it with pleasure !!! <br /> <br /> They choose Maureen and go to the show to see her, but John Cowdair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - she reminds him of someone from his past. Cornelia (Yves Arden) is still having nightmares because of listening to Grow. “Whose complaints” is a genius (Phil Silvers) and dancers dressed as working girls (Rusty is a taxi driver). <br /> <br /> John remembers long-lost love (Grandma Rusty, Maribel Hicks) For the first time he saw her singing "A Sure Thing" - at the races. Meanwhile, Danny, Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls in a local diner. Then they launch the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - “Get to tomorrow”. <br /> <br /> “Try me” is an energetic song and dance number featuring Danny and Rusty. At the same time, Rusty was chosen as a cover girl and Danny McGuires is a place that can be seen. Lee Bowman appears in the role of a romantic rival Danny and interferes with things. Lee Bowman is probably the most boring lead man, so Danny doesn't need to worry. <br /> <br /> Rusty (nicknamed Martha Mears) sings "Long Ago and Far Away", and Danny and Rusty dance it beautifully. The dresses that Rita wears are stunning. Travis Benton and Gwen Wakeling designed them. Danny wants the best for Rusty, but he is afraid he will lose her. Gene Kelly is also great at Alter Ego, where he dances with himself. <br /> <br /> “Poor John” - this is another look at the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song, making fun of rich relationships - Hayworth looks great in an amazingly fancy dress. Look for Norman in "Poor John" and "Of course." He was an amazing eccentric dancer who appeared in several early musicals, including The King of Jazz and Paramount on Parade. He was easy to spot. <br /> <br /> The "cover girl" dance is just wonderful. Rita was so talented - a beautiful and magnificent dancer. After a lot of beautiful models go through the covers of the best American magazines, Rusty bursts into a beautiful golden dress, dancing down the ramp to the very memorable song "Cover Girl". Gosh, I just love this movie !!!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
