I watch a lot of movies - DVDs, features and classics, you name it. That night, when I watched Jericho Mile, my wife (who ordered it on the Internet) said that she remembered this when she was in high school, that she had stayed with her all these years. Somewhat reluctantly, I sat down (with our daughter and son), and was chained from the initial sequence to the final names. We were all. <br /> <br /> She who remembered the original, and our children (18 and 16 years old), who had no idea what the film was about, could not believe it. Our favorite scene? It is possible that Peter Strauss bangs his fist so passionately and says: “I would do it AGAIN!”. He did not defend the violence, because it was a crime of defense, but it caused such intensity that we could not believe it ... when his cellmates gave him food to support his efforts, we did not have a dry eye. <br /> <br /> Anyone please make more films like this one. Incredible !!
