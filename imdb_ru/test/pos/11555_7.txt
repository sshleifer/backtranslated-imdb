This film starts rather slowly and runs to the end. Not that it was bad, it was done to illustrate the character trait characteristic of the main character. Therefore, if you are not in tragedy, this is not your film. The philosophy of this film makes you wonder. If you liked Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, “you will probably like it at least for comparisons. The intriguing question the film poses is: “What makes a famous writer completely ignore his publicly approved ideas for another set? "" New ideas are completely opposite to the status quo - if you are a conservative, you will not like this film. <br /> <br /> In addition to other philosophical questions, I must admit that the film was also aesthetically pleasing. The grassy hillsides and beautiful landscapes helped me overcome a slow start. Color symbols were also used to represent the state of mind of the main characters. If such things don't impress you, skip this. In general, I give this film 7.
