Background information - both films "Octopus and never say never" were shot in the same 1983, and, of course, people compare them. Moore vs Connery. Bond against Bond. <br /> <br /> I have heard many people claim that the "official film" Octopus is much better. Well, I just watched Octopussy. Bond rides the plane at a speed of 100 miles per hour (it's impossible - the wind will carry it away), using his legs to make the plane land, and then jumps at a speed of about 60 miles per hour (again it's impossible - try jumping out of the car - in the end you will get a broken body). How should this octopus scene be “good” in any sense of the word? Suddenly, Bond has superhuman strength and a titanium body. And he does all these tricks at the age of 56 years old ??? Complete crap. Incredible. Farse. <br /> <br /> ---> Now let's compare the aforementioned scene with Connery's “Unofficial” “Never Say Never”: he doesn’t have the same polish because of the status of an independent film (less money), but at least You can believe that Connery is a real spy in real danger. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the fact that Bond shows his age (he is 50 years old) and is sent to recovery. It is quite believable. But, of course, for the world-famous spy there is no such “weekend”, and Bond quickly finds a goal, even inside the hospital. From this point on, the story unfolds into another adventure, where Bond is trying to find his assassinated assassins and ultimately prevent an attempt to steal a nuclear weapon. <br /> <br /> As usual, Sean Connery did a brilliant job and avoids excessive effort. Top unbelievable stunts This movie looks like a natural successor to Connery's latest movie, “Diamonds are Forever” in 1971 ... old-style Bond ... before the franchise became stupid. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
