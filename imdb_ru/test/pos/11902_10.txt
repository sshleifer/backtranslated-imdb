I was lucky to see the El Padrino test show a couple of months ago in Santa Monica. I was shocked. You no longer watch such movies. In the spirit of Skoza, Chapa cleverly tells Kilo’s tragic story when he maneuvers on the tough streets of Los Angeles to rise above his ranks to become an eskobar drug baron. The characters are complex and contradictory. Emotions are real. The action is quick and violent. Expansive stunts. And Tilly is HOT. She hasn't looked so good since “Connected.” I would recommend this to everyone. This is a fantastic respect for the epic action films of the late 80s and early 90s. And for all skeptics out there ?? look again; You obviously closed your eyes for the first time. Congratulations to all involved in the film. I count the days until the sequel is released. Does anyone have a date on this?
