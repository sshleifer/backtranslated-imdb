This video was my first acquaintance with the tenants, and I could not stop playing it in the last three days. Visual effects are dynamite, more inventive and technically complex than anything I've ever seen on the big screen or on a small one. <br /> <br /> However, the DVD loses points for the meaningless addition of new music. The original Residents music is like nothing else you have ever heard and truly tunes your brain in the best possible way. New music, however, is equally uninteresting and in most cases rather bad compared to some classical tracks. In addition, the unfinished video of Vileness Fats seems VERY incomplete, and I was able to understand the plot of this story only after a detailed reading of the notes on the disc. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the notes on the disc, this DVD contains a lot of cool Easter eggs, which will surely be enjoyed by long-time fans of the inhabitants. Hint: look for icons on the pages of notes that should not be there. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the disc is one of the best available DVD transfer options. There is almost no noticeable pixelation, and only a bit of sharpness at points with strong contrast. <br /> <br /> Kudos for top quality presentations. This CD really deserves your attention.
