Director Peter Chan, script Maria Maggenti. <br /> <br /> Based on the novel “Love Letter,” Kathleen Schein, the director’s film version of Peter Chan, released in 1999, was not a big box office, even for a romantic film with some comedy elements. Although he was not so popular in cinemas, he soon became a favorite film on cable television and on VHS / DVD. Located in the port city in the good old USA (I forgot the exact location), this is the story of a mysterious, passionately written love letter that evokes emotions and confusion among the main characters, each of whom thinks that the letter is addressed to them personally. By the end of the film, we do not know who is a lover or a loved one, but the power of writing has changed the lives of almost everyone in a small town. The cast included great actors who showed themselves well on television and in movies, including Kate Capshaw starring middle-aged beauties Helen, owner of a bookstore, comedienne Ellen DeGeneres as her girlfriend / employee Janet Hall, young beauty Tom. Everett Scott as Johnny, a young guy at the age of 20 who falls in love with older Hellen, and elder Tom Selleck as the firefighter George Matthias, who must compete with Johnny for Helen's feelings. Starring as the old Hollywood actress Gloria Stewart, known to the modern audience as the elderly Rose in the movie “Titanic” (1997), as well as the episodic role of her own daughter Keith Capshaw (with her husband Steven Spielberg) Jessica Capshaw. The love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an elderly man and a young man, each of whom is equally passionate about Elena as the author of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Elena’s indecision. Will she choose the right person? What man can offer her the most? Johnny is in a relationship with a girl of his age who loves him with all her passion, and is in fact a kind of reminder of what Helen was at her age. George is in the process of divorcing his wife and living a worldly and rich life. A cultural intellectual, he takes Helen on an opera date where the tragic death of the ultra-Italian heroine Puccini Tosca causes Helen to burst into tears. There are many beautiful vistas of a charming coastal city, created beautifully by cinematographer Tami Reiker. The score is a paradise of romantic and lovely songs - “I have never fallen in love before,” “I am in the mood for love” and “Only singles”. Ellen DeGeneres in the role of Janet Hall, who is constantly late for her job at the Helen bookshop, which endlessly meets with men, not being able to find the right guy, is simply wonderful. She has not lost her comedic talent, although at this point in her career she did not appear on television or in movies, because just two years before her television series "Ellen" in the mid-90s was canceled due to her "release "like a lesbian and a new lesbian story show. Here you will even find the comedian Jack Black, long before he made him big, in the bat part of the fisherman. This is a touching film about human emotions and making important decisions, about the human need for passionate love and common love for escapism brought not only by books, letters and music, but also sincerely loving and safe relationships. This is a great movie with great moments and an infectious romantic spirit.
