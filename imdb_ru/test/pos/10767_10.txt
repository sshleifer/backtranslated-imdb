I attended the "Furious People" show at the 2006 Woodstock Film Festival. I hesitate to call it a “premiere” of any kind, since it was filmed in the spring of 2004, and its world premiere took place in Tribeca in 2005. This year he played several festivals. The release seemed inevitable, then it disappeared. Poof. Gone. Or so it seemed to the public. Rumors of a theatrical release or a DVD release appeared from time to time, but everything turned out to be unfounded. Then this show was announced. Maybe this can be called "re-premiere"? Of course, it seemed to me that I had witnessed the hidden treasure. And what a treasure it was. <br /> <br /> I suppose one can characterize the “Fierce People” as a drama of majority. But it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as secrets. And a little slapstick. In short, real life. This complicates the game, which puts it in the category of indie, and not in a Hollywood film. But his high performance, the feeling of a big budget and the cast of a star caliber diverge from the indie label. So let's call it a hybrid. And perhaps that is why he was "lost." It can not be categorized. <br /> <br /> Meet Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin), 15, whose father is absent. In fact, Finn never knew him. But he sees it and hears it through a collection of home movies sent from South America. Papa is a well-known anthropologist, and he made a name for himself by opening a shop with a Yanomani tribe, a tribe of "ferocious people" who live to kill and, of course, breed. All their activities are built around these two “tasks,” and Finn is fascinated by this. Mama Liz (Diane Lane) is also somewhat missing. Although physically present, it is lost in the world of cocaine and alcohol. So Finn becomes an adult in his little lonely world with his films. <br /> <br /> One summer, the mother decides to drag Finn along with her into the wilds of New Jersey. A masseur, my mother took care of a wealthy client Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland, performance on the road), and he invited her on an extended home visit to his luxury estate. Osborne's "Tribe" includes many eccentric rich children, servants, and village idiots, among whom Finn will be part of his own anthropological research. Will his experience with dad movies help him live his life as a visitor to this tribe? Will he be accepted? Or will he be viewed as an outsider, while simultaneously fighting his own teen identity? Such is the story of fairy tales, and I suppose it would be if it were not for the dark belly that director Griffin Dunn and writer Dirk Wittenborn contributed to this magnificent story. <br /> <br /> With Anton Yelchin’s voice-over, interrupting fragments of Dad’s home films, Finn must learn to return to becoming a teenager, whom he never had a chance to become, stop being a parent of his mom, let the newly-made mother become a parent for him and learn responsibility for the path to adulthood, as it should have been all the time. And yet he needs to make this transformation in a dangerous dark world, where playing with fire is stupid for this broken family. <br /> <br /> This is, first of all, a plot film, and Griffin Dunn emphasized in the introduction to the film. He bought the rights to the Wittenborn novel, even when it was written, and Wittenborn's own script comes alive in the hands of Dunn's workshop in such a way that it is a miracle. <br /> <br /> This is also largely a character-driven movie, and Sutherland has never been better. His star turned when Osborne stunned those around me, and probably hit you too. Diane Lane's character ultimately manifests so many personalities that it’s hard to imagine another actor doing this so well. She is breathtaking. But most of all, “Fierce People” is a film by Anton Yelchin. He has a long resume as a child actor, but very little as a teenager. In addition to the little-known “House D” (also a precious stone), it is best known as Baird in the television Huff. In January, he will be seen in the film “Alpha Dog” (he has also been on the shelf since 2004, a film that I saw this year on Sundance and in which it is “heart and soul”). His performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young, and is nothing short of spectacular. <br /> <br /> This complex, bizarre film has long remained out of sight. "Fierce People" is a treasure filled with light and shadow, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but mostly a miracle.
