Don't get me wrong, it was fun to watch. It has a nice animation, except for strange-looking bugs and nice music. And the outstanding scene was, of course, the dance of Elmer, Bugs and Duffy on the floor, it was such a pleasant and funny touch. In fact, the whole cartoon is nice to watch, but overall, this is not what I call exceptional, like Carrotblanca. There are some very good gags, but they were used before I felt, and I would find little that funny. And is Duffy joining forces with Elmer? Somehow, seeing that he was the hunterâ€™s goal, is it not strange that he would make friends with him. Although, I confess, it was great that Duffy was there. The voice acting was also above average, but for some reason I missed Mel Blanc. <br /> <br /> In general, an unusual, but very cute cartoon. 7/10 Bethany Cox
