As noted in many reviews, there is a strong dark streak in this film. The director he most reminds me of is John Landis (yes, go and cry out what kind of a peasant I am). Arkand has a gift to explore frivolous things in a dark, gray way, then turn around and explore the horrors of life with a light touch. <br /> <br /> The cast, without exception, is above average. Thomas Gibson, like David, is an outstanding center of sullenness and self-deception, around which the rest of the characters revolve. He says a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to admit. Gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993. It was hard to look at him and see Greg Montgomery, not to mention the Hotchner agent from The Criminal Minds. <br /> <br /> Maybe not the best scene, but the one that I like most of my “rewind scene” is the section where Candy is waiting for a visitor, and one uninvited person after another appears at the door. As Candy’s interpersonal environment is increasingly out of control, David is becoming more vigorous, energetic, and more enthusiastic, like the gaunt Gen-X Tiger.
