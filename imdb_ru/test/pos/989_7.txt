I can not appreciate it very well, because I can not say that I liked it. But I was worried about the story, not the implementation of the film. Game, direction, atmosphere, music - everything was fine. Just after you see a group of people who do things that you cannot truly relate to, the film ends. It is informative in the sense that it shows the horrors of war seen from home, and that feelings should not have any meaning or be strong, but that’s all. The plot covers a period of several years, during which the poet Dylan Thomas was taken under the roof of the former ex-girlfriend. He is married, brings up a wife, and then a child, and the former (Knightley) marries some other guy. But the tension is there, Dylan is an obsessed dork, and the new husband returns from the war with a small case of PTSD. Add some pretty temperamental characters, and your hands will be full. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: you must be “in the mood” to love this movie. The hard part is determining this mood. I don't think I've ever been in this yet. Ever So it’s probably better to watch adults who understand weird, complex human behavior and are probably interested in Dylan Thomas.
