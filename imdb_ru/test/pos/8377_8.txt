Fast paced and entertaining noir in Vienna immediately after W.W.11. Donald Buka is a refugee who cannot find a legal job because he does not have documents. The lack of documents means the absence of a work permit, which means the inability to obtain a passport. He survives driving a friend's taxi at night. If he is caught, then three months in prison. One night, he picks up the fare in a large hotel and takes a person to the airline office. Buka takes the luggage and returns to the car. There he discovers that his client has received an unnecessary hole in the back of his head. What to do? Call the police? Without a work permit, they will quickly catch him. No, he needs time to think it over. He travels to a secluded place, emptying the pockets of a man and hiding his body. Now he has an American passport and a lot of money! He falls due to contact with the underworld to change the passport photo. Now he just needs to go to the hotel and pick up a plane ticket. His ticket to freedom! Needless to say, that would be too easy. The hotel is waiting for the dead lady Joan Camden. Camden is on the run from his rather nasty husband, Francis Lederer, Lederer, of course, the pig that hit a man in Bukiâ€™s cabin. Camden calls the police because he believes that Buka has robbed her lover. Buka shows his new passport and manages to get out of the mess. Camden breaks down when hubby Lederer shows up at the police station. Lederer convinces the police that Camden suffered a mental disorder, and she was released to him. She runs away again, finds Buka, and both decide to flee the country together. Lederer reappears, and Buka must decide whether to help Camden with his freedom. This film is much better than I voiced it. Buka is best known as the killer of low-level policemen in the 1950s "Between midnight and dawn." The film is made by actor Turhan Bey.
