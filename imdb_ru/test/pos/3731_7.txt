I saw it today with little experience as to what to expect from the storyline. I go to the cinema as an escape, to leave everything behind and enjoy the "story." I found this to be a good movie, not a great one, but a good one. It was worth my money and my tears :) <br /> <br /> Diane Lane, as always, was gorgeous, Richard Gere is not an overacacan He held himself and has a certain presence that we always expect. He brings his style to the film. <br /> <br /> I think it was a love story that is not always told. It was dirty, and they had other priorities, but they wanted to be together and wanted to wait for each other. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend it!
