For anyone who has ever sought happiness, “half empty” is obligatory. This original intercultural musical comedy has fun numbers that make the "producers" seem dullly balanced. Writer Bob Patterson puts his soul into sharing his thoughts about life, wisdom and happiness, even sketching inspirational comments on the cards when his girlfriend pours out her heart, ending their relationship. When his book about happiness, "The Northern Star," does not succeed in the States, his publishers send him to Germany for a book-signing tour. Explaining his decision to Bob, the meeting room erupts an inspiring song that Monty Python is proud of. Since his arrival in Hamburg, Bob’s complete ignorance of the German language has put him at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, he continues, ignoring the true feelings of his masters to him, until a wildly devoted fan arrives and changes everyone's reaction to him. <br /> <br /> Original songs set the film in motion, often describing the implication of the story in the accuracy of the separation of the parties. The actors, led by Robert Peters, demonstrate an immaculately dry sense of humor and inhabit their characters as if they were not acting. See this for: a case study of how good intentions make no difference; How ruthless Americans are abroad; How few reasons to burst into song and, above all, for silly, entertaining, unconventional laughter.
