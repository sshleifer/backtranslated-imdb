I first saw this short film when I recently bought a random DVD with short films. This is the only short film on DVD that I liked, but I don’t just like it, I like it ... if you spend some time with me, you’ll see it. it's beautiful, simple and passionate, without bells, without whistles - it could have been done with a cheat (but don’t get me wrong, the animation is elegant and insightful - this person obviously spent a lot of time with cats - but just black and white) and then they write and music ... it's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> I eat chocolate, drink wine and watch it again and again ... <br /> <br /> nothing else matters, I am waiting for Pedro Serrazina to come up with something else.
