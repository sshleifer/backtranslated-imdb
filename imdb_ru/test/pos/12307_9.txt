Saw this film at NFT in London, where it was shown during the BFI John Houston season. I was not sure what to expect, and the first few minutes of the film yielded very little. In fact, the rest of the film continued to give a bit! No real story, no action, no waiting, a very small drama and, with the exception of a short piece at the very end, no scenery. <br /> <br /> However, the lack of all these features resulted in a great movie. I don’t quite understand why, but I think that his understated nature made the film almost completely perfect. The acting, the script and, most importantly, the casting were in place, and I do not remember that when I left the cinema, I was so good, but I still can not understand why. I just know that I’ll get a DVD (this is one of those films that I’m sure will be just as good on a small screen as a movie theater, provided you can find somewhere a quiet place to watch it!) And I I will watch it again soon. I would also be interested to know what my family and friends think about it. I am sure that this will not be the choice of everyone, but I am convinced that a large number will agree with my opinion. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
