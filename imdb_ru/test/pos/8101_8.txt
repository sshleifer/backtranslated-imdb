From the very beginning of the film, I laughed, trying to keep quiet, so I didn’t wake anyone up in the house, it didn’t continue until the end of the film, I didn’t find everything to “laugh out loud” funny, but still I found some things quite funny. At first I had to keep laughing when he throws a very clever-looking hand grenade into his sleeve. Then there are scenes where you just smile, for example, when the Hairdresser falls through the roof into someone's apartment, I see that it is quite funny, but in today's days and at the time that has been done quite a lot, it did not seem original , although at that time, I am sure it was. I loved the explosions of the Hynkels (Hitlers) furious German with a beautiful subtle English translation. <br /> <br /> The final scene is wildly discussed, because, well, this is absolutely true, and very cleverly constructed. Although the film is sixty-eight years old, the last scene is still relevant today, if it doesn’t show how great the writer Chaplin is, then I don’t know what will happen. The acting in this scene, in particular, was quite good, Barber exceeded the point perfectly and made you realize the seriousness of the film, while enjoying the humorous side. <br /> <br /> Another element of this film is the fact that it was such a bold film that it is almost ahead of its time. Of course, Chaplin did not know what would happen after 1940, he did not know about the Holocaust (obviously), he also officially declared that if he knew that he would not have made this film. The fact that this film is so anti-Hitler is interesting, more interesting is the fact that it was not anti-German, that it would be very easy to do in those times, Chaplin could easily make this propaganda film, but instead did something more he made an honest movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend to anyone who is interested in this movie remotely, to watch it, as well as to those who studied or study Hitler and the Second World War to watch this movie. At the very least, this is interesting, it does not have the annoying outdated sensation that was in some films of that time. Unlike most comedies, this film actually contains a message that it is trying to convey to you, watch this movie, you will be better off if you saw it.
