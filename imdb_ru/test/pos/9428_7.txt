For the sake of propaganda during World War II, Sherlock Holmes was moved to the then present. One result is “Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon,” in which the main roles are played by Holmes, Basil Rathbone, as well as Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atville, Dennis Howie, and Kaaren Vern. Holmes was instructed to transfer the scientist Dr. Franz Tobel (William the Post-Junior) and his weapon design to the British government before the Germans could get it. However, once a person reaches England, his problems are just beginning. Can Holmes decipher the message left by Dr. Tobel before falling into the hands of evil Morianism, save a weapon and, possibly, a scientist? This is a spectacular story of Holmes, taking place in the atmosphere of Switzerland and darkened England. The series worked fine in our day. It was not without problems, but these problems had nothing to do with the time period. Whose idea was it to make Watson an idiot? The characterization of Nigel Bruce — supported and instigated by scenarios — has always been a false note. I very much prefer the characterization of Edward Hardwick in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series - there he is an attractive, intelligent and believable companion for Holmes. In the Rathbone series, Holmes is often forgiving and treats Watson as an awkward fool. However, in this particular film, Watson has a chance to be quite useful in several parts. <br /> <br /> I admit that I was a complete read juice by Rathbone of Richard II - "... this blessed conspiracy, this land, this England" - I cannot imagine how much this meant to the British, who watched the movie in 1942. Sherlock Holmes really served his purpose.
