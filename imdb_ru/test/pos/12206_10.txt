The surface was awesome, I don't know how many Mondays I survived at school, just thinking about a new episode of the surface. I liked it, sometimes I had to call home and ask mom to write it down for me. I was very upset when I heard that it was canceled, I mean, damn it, a way to let us hang. So they might have their new Tina Fay comedy (you couldn't pay me to watch this, I think the ad made me dumbfounded). I will miss my evening repair of the Surface, even if my sister made fun of me. although the kidnapped people really look good, and they still have L & O: SVU (I think I still have to check) (I wrote only 2 lines above because they said I need ten lines).
