When I first looked at the Flatliners, I was amazed. It had all the necessary features of a good movie: the cast was excellent, the plot was excellent, and in the case of thrillers there were real “thrills” everywhere. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland offered an amazing game of playing the role of a man in a picture depicting a scientist who believes he can find answers to questions about life and death, killing himself, and then returning to life, in essence, “stealing” secrets of death. Kevin Bacon offers an excellent game as Keifer’s more morally worthy partner, and Julia Roberts offers her most convincing role. William Baldwin portrays a student who stands out in class and, apparently, in communication. And Oliver Platt, in another outstanding presentation, portrays the voice of reason for the group and the most innocent. <br /> <br /> The story is relatively simple, but original, and the action is refreshing - the film definitely stands out for the genre, and the one that set the standard for measuring other thrillers for me. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
