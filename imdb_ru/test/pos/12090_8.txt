A European musician and composer intends to capture the musical diversity of Istanbul. Experimenting with sound Alexander Hakke (from the German avant-garde band Einstürzende Neubauten) wanders the streets of Istanbul with his mobile recording studio and a “magic microphone” to create an inspired portrait of Turkish music. His journey leads to the discovery of a wide spectrum, ranging from modern electronics, rock and hip-hop to classical arabesques. While he wanders through this seductive world, Alex collects impressions and tracks from artists such as the neo-psychedelic band Baba Zula, fusion DJ Orient Expressions, rock band Duman and Replikas, independent rocker Erkin Koray, Ceza (Turkey’s response to Public Enemy ), breakdancing performers of Istanbul Style Breakers, digital dervish Mercan Dede, famous clarinet player Selim Sychi Sli, Canadian folk singer Brenna McCrimmon, street performers Siyasiyabend, Kurdish singer Aynur, "Elvis of Arabesque" Orhan Genchbay and legendary Mhy Szy Szy Sai abebeendyndyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyuyyyyyyyyyyyyuyyyi .
