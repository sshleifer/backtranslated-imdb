Lightning flashes; sprawling cemetery; Adam's "Batman" West's name: everyone pops up on screen before the opening credits are even finished, and yet, despite these rather naive elements, One Dark Night is not as stupid as it may seem at first glance. <br /> <Meg Tilly (Sister Jennifer) plays a pretty student, Julia, who reluctantly agrees to spend one night at the mausoleum as part of her dedication to the exclusive clique of Sisters High School. What Julie doesn’t understand is that the other sisters are planning to scare her with some monstrous pranks or that the latest body to be buried in the mausoleum is that of Raymar’s “psychic vampire” who feeds on the life of frightened young women. <br /> <br /> True, this is not the most original production, but, fortunately, it’s enough inventive strokes to help make this film out of competition, my favorites are the creepy kind of everyday objects embedded in the walls of Raymar’s apartment and the creepy manner in which moldy corpses float along the cold marble corridors of the mausoleum during an excellent finale. The impressive cinematography of Hal Trassell and the amazingly terrible special effects of Tom Burman also greatly add to the chilling atmosphere.
