A couple of weeks after I watched this film, he began to remind me of John Carpenter’s “In the Mouth of Madness” film (not for history!) Because of the atmosphere, the quickest elements of surprise and dreams. On the other hand, this film blends image and music very well (note the 4th chapter of the film)
