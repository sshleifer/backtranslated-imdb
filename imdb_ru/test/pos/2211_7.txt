We have a character named Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She is sweet, friendly, often smiles, but strangely cruelly honest. Evie has a secret too. Her idiot sister tells the original poetry, which causes the community interest in writing sister. Unfortunately, this is Evie's poetry. While their mother becomes happy again, and the boy next door shows interest in Evie, Evie is just trying to figure out what she really wants to do. <br /> <br /> What should be remembered, while watching this film, who Evi really is. For such a brutally honest person who does not mind telling ivy league types that she does not respect them, it would be strange that she would be able to commit a lie. For someone so happy and fun, she’s completely insensitive when it comes to certain issues. This is not the flaws of the characters, this is the development of the plot, and they mean much more than it seems at first glance. <br /> <br /> This is basically a melodrama: the character’s lies, the personalities of other characters promote them through drama, because relationships are at risk. But in terms of writing, he is very fresh and bold. The acting is very good at writing (perhaps an idiot sister could play better), and it’s very nice to look at. <br /> <br /> Direction and cinematography are not so good, They are acceptable, and Evie’s world is shrouded in color and light, which makes some very beautiful images, but this is not very consistent. This is actually not so much a disadvantage due to low production value, but in the same value there is some genuine narration and real concern for the characters. So, although this is not a perfect film, it is definitely a pleasant one. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
