This is a great concert, which featured the best songs of the bandâ€™s 30-year career. Lee, Lifeson and Peerte were lively and fun on stage and presented a great show. At the same time, I think that the audio recording was corrupted on the mixing console and / or during the mixing process. However, this is not the fault of the boys. They even mentioned that the show was set up at the last minute, so the band and their team obviously did their best. They just shouldn't have put the show on public display. The sounds of the Nile are far and the bass of Geddy has good harmonic content, but there is no lower end at all !! They should hold out at this concert and wait for a better occasion. Buy this DVD only if you are hardcore Rushian. There is no audio quality in the audio section.
