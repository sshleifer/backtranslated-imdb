Soft Spoilers <br /> <br /> .... and this is the "top ten of all time." One night, I accidentally stumbled upon “Two Hands” (perhaps it made him even more special - without too high expectations) at the IFC, and I could not believe that I had not heard anything about it. Now that Heath Ledger is becoming more and more famous in the USA, I am sure that it is more accessible. At that time, I was telling friends about the film, and no one could find it anywhere except for the occasional showing of IFC. <br /> <br /> In any case, in the black comedy / gangster genre, he blends well with my friend favorites, and everyone in the film really seems to end up with what they deserve. Brian Brown is hilarious as the main gangster who makes origami with his little son and plays scrabble with his minions. Also funny is the fate of the occasional hijacker. Even Heath was pretty good at it. At that time, I vaguely remembered him from a short Fox series called “Roar”. I hope Gregor Jordan will take another hit, but as far as I know, this is his best so far.
