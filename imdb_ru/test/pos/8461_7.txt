Christina Lahti (Sandy Dunlap) and Mary Tyler Moore (Holly Davis) worked well with soap material, Ted Danson did her best with the ungrateful role of Chip Davis. The assumption of this was that the friendship of two ladies, one seemingly happily married woman, the other - a professional woman who knows how her biological clock ticks. I found the relationship that Ted Danson's character had with a single woman, played by Christine Lahti, is pretty nasty. He behaved badly, but left two "widows" growling over him and sobbing. I found it disgusting, when Sandy told him that he wanted to break him after meeting his wife, he called her, saying that he missed her (did he call his wife? There was no sign of that). He behaved like a heel. Perhaps he would have made a more interesting film if he had not been killed. Perhaps both ladies would have invented and abandoned him. I liked the friendship between the two ladies, but it was spoiled by what they have in common: Cad husband.
