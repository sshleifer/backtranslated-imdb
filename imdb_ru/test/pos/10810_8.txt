Danton was a hero and one of the founders of the 1789 French Revolution. This film is set five years later, and the revolution turned into something ugly. Although the revolution initially promised freedom, at the moment a small committee that governs the country is extremely repressive and is a dictatorship. Danton and his friends were unhappy that in 1794 the country was no better than before they got rid of their king, so they begin to criticize the government. The film begins with the beating of a printer who makes critical pamphlets about the government, and his business is ruined. So much for “freedom, equality and fraternity”! Thus, as a result of such silence, Danton and his colleagues began to publicly criticize the government. In the end, Robespierre (the leader of the committee) and his associates fabricated accusations, conducted a demonstration process and got rid of dissent. Some mentioned that Polish director Weid also wanted it to be a criticism of his own nation, which was Soviet at the time, and also very repressive. It makes sense when you see how the film unfolds, especially when the government destroys all dissent "in the name of the people." <br /> <br /> The game is fine, the story is irresistible, and I don’t seriously criticize the film. However, I would really like the ending to be handled differently. Moreover, besides lovers of history and the French, most likely, they do not even suspect that this execution helped end the government. After this purge in Danton in April 1794, Robespierre himself was executed in July 1794 because the country had just enough - besides, the French survivors knew that they too would face guillotine sooner or later if this sick system remained in place. Some kind of epilogue would be good - for example, showing the soldiers following Robespierre. He answered, trying to kill himself first, but he managed only to throw away a part of his face - he was still alive, soon after that he was guillotined. It would be a great little epilogue, and it could be done in five minutes. However, not showing the link between the death of Danton and the fall of the government is a strange thing to miss.
