The way I found out about this movie was when I watched American Pie 2, at the beginning he had a trailer for Ali Ji's Indian home, I watched the trailer and he just made me buy a DVD, it looked incredibly funny! so the next day I went to my local store and took it for £ 3.99 (a bargain!). The film is about Ali G, who is the "gangster" of the massive team of western spots, and the rivals are a massive team of eastern spots. Ali has a group of children “Cub Scout”, where he teaches them how to survive in the “ghetto”, teaching them to swear and steal cars, after Ali learns that the government stops the money entering the leisure center where Ali teaches. children, he is running for deputies for spots and overthrows another deputy in his attempts to get rid of the leisure center in order to make room for the airport in spots. Throughout the film, Ali teems with laughter when Ali begins to do crazy things! Borat appears for a few seconds in the film, it is definitely a must-see movie for all of you, fans of Sasha Baron Cohen!
