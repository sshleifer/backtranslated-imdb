This is probably the best film from director Hector Babenko. This shows the Brazilian reality, unknown to foreigners, which is the same reality that haunts all Latin American countries, poverty and the survival instinct. In this reality, children who are left orphaned or abandoned by their poor parents, who are forced to repeatedly turn into a “dog eat dog” society, suffer the most, falling into the abyss of crime, prostitution and crime. Very well played and with the no-nonsense approach, this film will fall to you. Great plot, there must be a film in someone's collection. In the lead role, Fernando Ramos da Silva, a young boy caught in a wave of crime, was killed a few years later during a robbery. I would advise people to watch the movie "Who Killed Pixot?" so that you can have a deeper understanding of the life of these characters. Some other characters from the film had a similar fate, some died, and others in prison. Nevertheless, this film will long remain in your memory.
