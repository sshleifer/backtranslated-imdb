This film is a little slow at the beginning, about the first 10 minutes or so. But as soon as he kicked, you can't turn it off. Adam Beach and Rose McGowan play the best roles and do an excellent job with their acting work. You can never guess who the killer is. I gave this movie 9 because in some places Adam Beech needs to talk a bit so you can hear what he is saying. <br /> <br /> 9/10
