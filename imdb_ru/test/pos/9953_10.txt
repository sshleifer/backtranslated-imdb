Hey. Hello and goodbye. but before I leave, I want to talk to you. I just want to quickly mention a few key points about this movie. first erotic. especially homo-erotic. <br /> <br /> yes, good. Let's start. When a man and a man love each other very much, they merge together in an exciting, not to mention gentle, explosion of cinema, which we call the merchant Venice. <br /> <br /> Homo-erotic love was sensual at worst. and even more sensual at best. it was terrible and emotional. it touched me inappropriately, and I'm almost sure that I touched it back. and when no one looked, I also lightly touched myself. <br /> <br /> I laughed because Portia refused. she was second in line to our friend, erotic love. about Antonio Anthony. just tony. I love you. more than you loved this guy. whose name may or may not contain the letter "B". he was very ugly. <br /> <br /> Anthony was very fat. he washed his body into a shell from his own fatty layer and sensual juices and proceeded to twist the screen and introduced himself to a guy with a name that I like in the film, finally, watch the film, if it were not for the homo-erotic connotations, for the love of a person like anthony just tony.
