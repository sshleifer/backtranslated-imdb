This classic has so many great odnostrochnikov and unintentionally hilarious scenes that I do not even know where to start. If you want to get advice about dating, its here. Just completely ignore the person you want, and then pour out classic lines like “Chicken is good ... I like Chicken”, and before you know it, you will have one night in the basement (this is a good basement) a woman who is 35 years younger than you. Bronson does it all in this movie. He buys a car without a good reason, just to kill two gang members ... by paying "CASH" ...... chunnng .... He buys ice cream simply because "this is America, isn't it?" and ends up spending someone named "Gigler - he laughs when he runs" just because he stole his camera. By the way, this “giggle” is so fast that the usual Bronson pistol cannot even catch him, he needs to order a special one, just to get this elusive creep. He is only cleaned so that he can truly stinky food (stuffed cabbage) in a rat trap with a pair of elderly people who like to wear heavy clothing in 90-degree weather. He is engaged in dentistry. It seems he always finds a crowbar when he needs (and the same one!). Last but not least, he seems to always have a rocket launcher at his disposal just in case he needs to blow up Richie Cunningham’s older brother, Chuck, who is now terrified and in need of repair. In any case, it will all make sense when you see this classic ... all I can say is to enjoy it! "I owe you that one dude"
