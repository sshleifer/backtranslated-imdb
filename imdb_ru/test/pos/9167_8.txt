I think the main idea of ​​any movie is to entertain or inform. If you need information, you watch real life and historical films. Sometimes it's the same thing. The other side of the coin is to entertain. Did Hitch entertain me? Yes it is. Well, the formula is standard. The boy meets the girl or in this case the boys meet the girl. They get together, and then together again. However, the way it happened in this film was refreshing. I especially liked the scene with Hitch and Sarah in the bar. Allegra's Albert romance was amazing to watch the unfolding, most REAL men feel shy when it comes to courting a woman of their dreams, and if I had Hitch's advice, I would probably have pulled my wife onto the altar twice. The first commentary on this film, which seemed to suggest that the film was played safely and well, caused some more laughter. I tend to disagree that you can gather so much laughter into a romantic comedy without turning it into a farce. In addition, the relationship has serious moments. In general, I found Hitch quite interesting, the actors did a good job (I will look for them in other films), and Hitch is a film that I am very happy to have in my DVD collection.
