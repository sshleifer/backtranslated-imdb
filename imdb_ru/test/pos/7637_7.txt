Cherry talks about a naive, unmarried virgin who decides to have a baby, but is not quite sure how to do this. This cool little sleeper is full of bizarre characters and mocking situational humor. Fresh, fun, mold-breaking material, I really liked this film ... by all means. Recommended for fans of romantic comedies who want something else.
