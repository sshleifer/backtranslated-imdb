This could be my favorite movie, so this is the stunning movie of all time. Like many preschoolers of the 80s, the replay of the ninja's revenge spawned the ninja phase of my childhood. Man, I thought Sho Sh. Was damn then. Jet Li can lift him with both feet in a cast! There are crazy crossovers in this movie, including flashdance, exorcist and the TV show Lee Van cleef ninja. ugh. but, as my friend says, anyone can get a good film, because to create a film that starts with a ninja, who is going through 17 shots from a shotgun, long enough to capture the body of an arbizic instructor to get revenge. Wow. While previous commentators have noted that the sword flies out of the closet on a rope, no one has yet mentioned the powerful love scene. Where a sexy lead cop takes off his shirt to show a mane on his back. The fun never ends. Rent it !!!!!!
