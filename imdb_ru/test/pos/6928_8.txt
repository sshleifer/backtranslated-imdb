At first, I thought this movie would annoy me. As if I had seen this movie somewhere before. The disappointed hero, father figure and 9-year-old sister, who are older and wiser than their years (see Girl Gregory), but then, less than 15 minutes later, became a loud laugh, a funny decoration of the film. Dylan Moran (who, it seemed to me, was just going to hurt me), was great. Like Mr. Gambon and the insane Scottish killer. Lena Hidi was incredibly sexy. For half the film, I tried to remember where I had seen her before. Parole Officer. She has the most amazing smile. But it is clear that the real hero of this film is Mr. Kane. This man should do a lot more comedy. This, along with some of his best comedic roles (Without Prompt, Dirty Rotten Rogues). He is pleased to watch all his scenes, but especially for the end. <br /> <br /> No one can say exactly how Michael can. <br /> <br />
