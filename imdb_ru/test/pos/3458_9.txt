A great movie that told so much about disability that usually scares people. It showed how minds can be captured by less than voluntary bodies and how difficult it is to witness what happens to others who are wanted for a disabled person. <br /> <br /> Love, friendship, fear, disappointment, joy, humor, and many other things were so well sealed. The two main characters were very well played by two capable bodies by actors and invited your laughter, tears, anxiety, joy and confusion. <br /> <br /> I approached this film with a mixture of interest and thrill, fearing that it might be too big a game for sympathy or to dwell only on negatives. However, it was a beautiful story of two friends. <br /> <br /> I really liked her.
