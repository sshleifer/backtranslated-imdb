If Sicily is a baroque territory, with its doubling of perspective, this is part of the call of this film to realism. And it gives great pleasure, surpassing Fellini not by one, but by three directors, and, of course, by this Bellocchio, who made some really great films and should not be upset because of his honor. There are many duplicates and improvisations on Manzoni’s “I promessi sposi”, somewhere out there, with a real marriage. Sicily is also considered the territory of sculptural surgery (you already know this version of the island, so the spoiler is not involved), the comic version of which makes the picture worthy of attention for the work of Sergio Castellito with guard dogs on the floor of the great hall of the palazzo.
