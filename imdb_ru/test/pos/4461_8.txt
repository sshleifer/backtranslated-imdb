“Do not torture the duckling” Lucio Fulci draws an exceptionally unflattering portrait of the small town of Sicily, tormented by a series of brutal murders of young boys. This surprisingly well-made film (especially compared to the subsequent burning festivals of Fulci) is characterized by a general atmosphere of perversity, nastiness, and two truly grotesque scenes of brutal violence. The children who will soon become dead are portrayed as carelessly cruel and budding peeping volumes: Bruno’s almost seduction by nude Patricia (Barbara Bush) really needs to be seen to Believe. I highly recommend it - especially when paired with my other cult favorite "House with windows that laugh" (1976).
