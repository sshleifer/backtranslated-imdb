H. G. Kluozo worked in France with difficulty after in 1943 he made Le Corbeau, which was released by a German company and later evaluated by the French as part of anti-French propaganda. Louis Jouveau, an admirer of Klozo’s work, invited him to stage the thriller “Quai des Orfevres”, where he played an ambiguous police inspector investigating a murder that happened in a Parisian music hall. Without knowing each other, the seductive cabaret singer Jenny Lamour (Susie Delaire) and her jealous husband-pianist-accompanist Maurice Maurice, who is madly in love with her (Bertrand Blier, father of director Bertrand Bleier), are trying to hide believe that their involvement in the murder? Included is a tenacious policeman (Louis Jouvet), who is determined to find out the truth. Jouve practically stole a film with an amazingly cynical and sentimental performance at the same time. "His character, his aquiline profile and his unique way of speaking made him unforgettable." Quai des Orfevres, a witty and atmospheric observation of human weaknesses, was the great return of H. G. Kluozo, an excellent director of French Hitchcock.
