“The tourist trap” is one of my favorite horror films of the late 70s - early 80s. A group of young people are going somewhere, one couple is in the car in front, and this car has an apartment, and our film starts with a young man, Woody, pushing a tire in search of a service station. He finds a seemingly deserted place, and yet he hears voices and investigates, and as a result, he has to bite the tube through his stomach for his efforts. Together with the rest of the young people (in VW Thing) they pick up Woody’s girlfriend and find the same place, Oasis of Slausen, or something like that ... and then Mr. Slausen happens while the girls enjoy a dip in the stream. Of course, the VW Thing mysteriously died at this moment, so the strange Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) offers his help. Mr. Slausen has a museum with a lot of wax figures, and he lives in a museum, but behind him is a big house where, he says, Davy lives. And who is Davey? Yes, Davey Crockett, he says ... but if it was Davey Crockett, they all probably would have been safer. The girls are left alone, while Slausen helps with fixing the car, but, of course, curiosity takes over, and she begins to investigate and finds a house full of creepy dummies and one rather lively by name ... Davy. This is followed by a rather terrible night of horror, when one after another they are captured by Davey, who says that he is the brother of Slausen. One girl (abducted earlier) is subjected to a gypsum facial treatment, which leads to her death when she cuts off the air supply. In any case, there is a twist in this, and the good (but strange) Mr. Slausen is not quite what he seems. A good, creepy horror movie from the late 70s, and a lot of dummies create a very creepy atmosphere. 7 out of 10.
