I can never understand why people spend time watching movies that they did not fully understand. I know that people will read horrible reviews on these pages of this film, and this will not allow them to look for copies of this completely forgotten film in the style of the late 20s, but of 1932, which probably should be called “indecent”, because main titles. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy, better known as a comic actress in countless fateful roles, shows that she is mistaken in all of them. She was a real drama actress, which I didn’t know before watching this film, which preceded all her famous roles. She is thrilling and touching, two things she has never been to against the graceful and sophisticated William Powell. I'm still shocked by how good she is. <br /> <br /> Becky Sharp (1935), the first three-color Technicolor function, is more familiar, but it is much better artistically and is an adaptation. It is also very touching as an expression of the style of the film that was supposed to die. You can't take my word for it, you have to see it.
