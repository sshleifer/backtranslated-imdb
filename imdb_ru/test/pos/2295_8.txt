MISTER. Baseball is a film of paradoxes. Written and filmed as a “light sports comedy”, it really has a hearty heart, as human and universal as some of the best in Capra. At the plot level, you have the paradox of baseball, a beautiful old American game, because it is played in Japan - inverted, with American values ​​dropped and Japanese values ​​captured in the game. (Some of the superficial sports comedies stem from Jack’s misunderstanding of how Japan plays bass-boro.) You also have a protagonist who is represented as an aging baseball star, but which is actually quite immature - a professional ball allowed him to postpone growing up. And you have the main character, who is rudely resisting the changes in his life that are being imposed on him, refusing to accept the magic ball that life has given him in the midst of a new country, a new manager, a new team, and a new girl who has all welcomed him and tried him. Sounds like hard stuff? Not really. This is a charming comedy "The Clash of Cultures", which takes place at the national, sporting, romantic and professional levels. But if you look at it sensitively enough, you will also find a wonderful story about a man who must give up his immaturity and grow up too late (causing some personal pain) and succeed in places where he did not expect it. I like this story, but I also very much respect the performance of Selleck; he exposes his (literally) venture to portray an ugly American insulting people and arranging hysterics publicly, and then allows us inside this character to understand his confusion. It also wouldn't hurt if you are a big fan of Takakura Ken, like me. MISTER. BASEBALL is an amazing story about the loss of innocence.
