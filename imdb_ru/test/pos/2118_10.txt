I like this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl in the shower. There are no films for small children. I loved this one because the worst was when one of the boys said "stupid." I applaud them for coming out and making a real family movie. I rented it the first time we saw it and decided to buy it to add to our collection. My daughter can't stop talking about it. It fits our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family films like this. She even called one of our calves "Hokey Pokey Keen" !!! I can't say enough about this movie. I look forward to many more films like this one.
