It's really nice to see that the Van Damme film has been gradually improving lately, especially when compared to the C-class flops "Derailed" and "Second in command", which were tragic and not very good. Shepherd: Border Patrol is a good action movie with really great fighting episodes. It's nice to know that Van Damme still knows how to kick, because in his latest movie “To Death” there were no martial arts at all !!! <br /> <br /> As the saying goes, this film is significantly inferior to “To Death”, which was a really good turn for Van Damme. “Until Death” lacked the over-acting of most of the Van Damme films, but it was grim and grim, and Van Damme’s performance as an actor was surprisingly good in this film. Nevertheless, The Shepherd is definitely worth watching a movie, especially for Van Damme fans or just for action movie fans in general, but if you are looking for a movie with a slightly larger storyline ..... you can skip this one! <br /> <br /> I really believe that this film was made quite well, especially with the small budget for which it was made. The only real problem I encountered in this film is the title; "Shepherd"? I do not understand! I believe that the “Border Patrol” simply does not have the same ring without the word “Shepherd” in front of it !!! <br /> <br /> My rating of this film is 7 out of 10, but this Van Damme Film Standards do not belong to any other category of films. <br /> <br /> i.e. That's good for the Van Damme movie.
