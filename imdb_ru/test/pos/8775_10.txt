I really enjoyed watching this movie. I think this is a brilliant, underrated film by Alfred Hitchcock. Everyone is familiar with the famous scene of the Statue of Liberty, but before that there is a really great film. Robert Cummings is great in that I consider his greatest role, and beautiful Priscilla Lane shows that she also has many talents. But I think Norman Lloyd gives the best results. His character, Fry, is so angry and cunning. Despite the fact that he did not act in it for a very long time, the film would not have been the same without him. <br /> <br /> “Diversant” is a great film that every Hitchcock fan should see. I give it 10 out of 10!
