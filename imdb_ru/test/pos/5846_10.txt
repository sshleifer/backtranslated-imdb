So, I read most of the reviews on this film, as well as the comments left by visitors to this site, and it seems to me that most people who wrote reviews did not really like this film. That is why I am writing now - I represent a minority, because I did it. I admit, I went to see the film, because I was very impressed with Ryan Gosling’s irresistible abilities, and the projects he had participated in lately were just incredible. He is a terrific actor. In addition, I wanted to watch this movie because it seemed intriguing to me ... why? Because this is a date in which you know a “date” from the very beginning, and this is quite unusual. <br /> <br /> In the story, two teenage boys are trying to commit a “perfect crime” because they believe in distorted behavior. philosophy, according to which only through the commission of criminal acts, people become truly free - free, and let us remember, innocent, acting on our own. The relationship between Richard and Justin was complex, hinting at homosexuality, and they were brilliantly acted upon by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. Gosling was a manipulative, controlling, even man, and Pitt was extremely clever in his books, a socially awkward outcast. Enter the character Sandra Bullock, who, it seems, most people did not particularly like. I think that when people see that she was an executive producer, they automatically take on whatever role the actor plays in this is a thing of self-praise. I have not seen this as an occasion here. Without Cassie's personal story about a former husband who almost killed her, which, unsurprisingly, shared similar traits with Richard Hayward, she would never pursue her instincts about Justin and Richard. The case, it would seem, was tight against Ray, an unsuspecting school cleaner and boy's friend. Even when the boys were interrogated at the end of the film, neither Bullock nor her partner had convincing evidence about them, except for the fact that they lied that they knew each other, and Justin’s vomiting remained in plain sight. This is the genius of the film, because the philosophy that the boys tried to prove with the act of killing, innocent action by will as “true freedom” ended up working against Justin, who ultimately had a conscience (and part of his conscience at the site of the body dump). Without this important evidence, they almost had a "number kill". And for those readers who are puzzled by the title just like me, I looked to him and found that something made by “numbers” (for example, a picture) implies careful and critical planning and exactingness. There is also a Sting song called "Murder by Numbers", but this is irrelevant. :) <br /> <br /> Many readers questioned the need for a relationship between Cassie and her partner, but I think it really meant to show how cynical and manipulative she became because of her story. Like it or not, her story plays an important role in this film, because without it, she probably would never have followed her instincts about Justin and Richard. Yes, it was a cliché of “women despise, a woman plays vendetta in all aspects of her life,” but I think that without the depth of Cassie’s character, you have another movie about teen killers, and they just might have gotten it over with. There is no movie. <br /> <br /> And to a reader who noticed that the teenagers clearly did not commit the crime committed, because the police were stalking them from the very beginning, may I remind you that the reason was because of intentionally placed and fully traceable fingerprints shoes. The guys wanted to participate - it was a game. They were so confident that they had committed the crime committed, that they wanted to see from their own experience what difficulties the investigators would face in uncovering what they thought was true. What they didn’t expect was that Cassie Mayweather had excessive instinct working on her side. A bit unbelievable? May be. But many crimes were discovered by police who followed their instincts. However, this is a movie! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in theaters about three times, and each time it showed me more and more, and I liked more and more. The longer I watched it, the more I was captivated and frightened by the psychological depth of Richard Hayward - there are people who really are. My main claim to the film is that they had to have Justin and Richard's relationship a little more central (because let's face it, the whole movie is intriguing), and my main details go to the characterization - every character was very different and interesting in its own way. It was very well played, although I would give Ben Chaplin a little more depth to work with him (he is a good actor) and, perhaps, cut Bullock's character under cover. <br /> <br /> I think everyone should stay in. Keep in mind that for a Hitchcock type thriller like this, basically telling “whodunit” at the very beginning, it’s very difficult for writers to keep the attention of the audience right up to the end. I think they did it very well, using a few small plot twists, slowly revealing the dynamics of various characters, and illuminating the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. I think that if we remove our innate cynicism and try to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are, we can look behind any obvious holes in the plot and see the real texture and quality of this film, at least in the characters that were brilliantly depicted. Especially Richard Hayward. Not that I'm shifted. :)
