Of course, this film is not for everyone - but for everyone who has a sense of humor and love for a historical film - buy it immediately! Where else can you get acquainted with the fashion of the 70s, a historical textbook on vocabulary, karate-trained prostitutes, crime, a rap about drowning Titanic, gunfights, and one of the stars named Queen Bee (see the early stage crying in the early stages) at the Guardians office! With a style of shooting thatÕs a mixture of porn / Dawn of the Dead / and a car wash, you can’t go wrong. This is one to look again and again - after you put the children to bed.
