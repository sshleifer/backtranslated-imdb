I have watched this film countless times and never could not be fascinated by its homely simplicity, sincerity and kindness. The magnificent characteristics of all the actors and cute little locomotives that play such an important supporting role. I admit, I fell in love with Robert in 1970, and she still touches me. Shown on TV in New Zealand for Christmas, the best gift I could have.
