After the last terrible Ast√©rix movie and the fact that we only get the Swiss German version in theaters, I went to watch it with a little trepidation ... Unreasonably, as I was glad to know ^ ____ ^ <br /> <br /> The film is funny and modern, with good jokes, good animation, funny interaction of characters, good vocal composition (Note: I can only speak Swiss-German!), with the exception of the daughter of Viking leader Abba (her name is great, despite the not very inspired voice acting of the actress). .. <br /> <br /> I especially I liked the Justforkix character (Goudurix in French, Grautvornix in German. This is a young man who is supposed to be put on the form ...). He is a very funny character of a city teenager wearing a sleeveless jacket; but he is very cute, despite his teenage manners ... XD The interaction between Asterix and Obelix and their young wards is fantastic and very interesting. <br /> <br /> It cannot be compared with old films, since one is completely different ... Which, surprisingly, does not make it bad. On the contrary. When they tried to modernize the last film (twelve years ago), they blew it up completely. This film, however, proved that it can be done just fine ... ^ - ^ <br /> <br /> I left the theater merry ... Always a good omen ^ _ ~
