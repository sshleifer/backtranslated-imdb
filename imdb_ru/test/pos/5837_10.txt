Oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time! The best word to describe is “genius”! scripts, acting, storylines ... everything in this show is amazing! <br /> <br /> I just discovered the show, and immediately became addicted to it, and I was very surprised that he did not receive the recognition he really deserves. This is violent, and for most characters they are not meant for you to like them, but the show is written in such a brilliant way that it allows you to look through violence and criminals and see them as real people. They are the lowest forms of filth, but they still find a way to allow you to understand many characters and even take care of their stories. <br /> <br /> This requires violence in the series. as realistic as possible, but the show is not about violence, as some people might believe. This is truly a work of art, and I'm sure someone will give him a chance to love him as much as I do.
