Jewel Thief is a rare breed of film. There is nothing unusual in her story, but there is nothing in the presentation. A young man Vinay, superbly played by the recently raised face of Dev Anand at the age of 40+, is suspended from his police dad and finds a job in a jeweler's shop. Soon random people come up to him and call him Amar. Using just a few meaningful moments, we see the presence of a double. Then comes the woman Shalini (Vijayantimala) and declares that she is engaged to this double. She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar), who is so convinced that Vinay is really Amar, he forces him to take off his shoe and prove that he is not Aamr, six-fingered. Super cute daughter jeweler Anjou (Tanuja) is completely in love with Vinaya. In the midst of all this disorder, there is a thief of Jewels in freedom, and he steals according to his will. Gradually, we learn from the meeting Vinay with a very hot singer in a nightclub (Helen!), What a thief is Amar, a double. Many many beautiful women (Anjou Mahendra, Faryal) pursue a hero. Police forces, including Father Vinaya, are completely confused. Vinay slowly falls in love with Shalini / Shalu, and her brother seems to be blessing the union. The action goes to Sikkim, since it is here that the next Amar robbery will take place. The rest is for you to look - duplicates, girls, men who hold on to every word of Vinay, thinking that he is their boss Amar, a duet of loving brothers and sisters - nothing seems right, and this requires deft history (and direction) Vijay Anand to complete this story in a very interesting manner. There are many moments in the film that you will wonder about until they delightfully wove into the grand finale of the dance in the palace in Sikkim. <br /> <br /> I was not a big fan of Vijayanti, but she is competent enough here, although she is plump She can add to the confusion in history in a subtle way, but itâ€™s best when she is sad or dancing. Tanuja is good as a button, and I loved her in this movie. I wanted her so badly to get a man. Dev was, well, Dev. If he had not walked like a man with a congenital defect of the shoulder (one shoulder is always lower than the other), I would be surprised who they found to imitate him! And yet his style, charm and charisma were unchanged. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara, only Dev could look cool, carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached! Ashok Kumar was just awesome - Dada Moni did not miss the entire movie and turned it into one for history textbooks. <br /> <br /> SD Burman spun magic with numbers such as Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas (Helen into a blood-red rooster imitating dancing on the top of the bar), Aasman Ke Neche, Ruhla Ke Gua Sapna Mera and my personal favorite seductive room Raat Akeli Hi Budj Gai Die. <br /> <br /> If you crave a great story, with more turns than a pretzel, wanting to keep guessing, but entertained and entertained, then go buy or rent Jewel Thief. It is better to buy it, then you can come back and see it again with your friends. This keeper.
