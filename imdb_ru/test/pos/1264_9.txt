Saw it at the Hong Kong International Film Festival more than three years ago. I did not expect it, since at that time Christopher Nolan was unnamed, but it sounded interesting and turned out to be one of the best things I saw at this festival. He worked well on the big screen, with a technique of cutting scenes from a sequence that adds mood. Mr. Nolan at the end gave a good account of how he acted, and this is enough to let someone go when he began as a director! I liked it better than Memento, although this was perhaps due to lower expectations. And the fact that it was rather an art house cinema.
