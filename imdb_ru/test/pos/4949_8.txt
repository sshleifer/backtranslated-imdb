Iron Eagle may not be the most plausible plot of the film, but the characters are well written and very well played. If you can't believe the characters, the movie is a failure. <br /> <br /> I think that photography, especially aerial photography, is great. I believe that it is far superior to Top Gun, with which it is infinitely compared. This is one of the best aerial photography I've ever seen. The soundtrack from Basil Paledouros (sorry for the spelling) is great and blends well with rock tunes. I wish this part of the soundtrack was available. <br /> <br /> Jason Gedrick succeeds as a teenager who suddenly has to grow up, as well as the realities of life, death and responsibilities. Lou Gossett is stunning as Chuppy, and cruel, and yet a man, because he remembers the death of the pilots. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of movies that you watch once and donâ€™t want to watch again. Then there are those films that get you for this or that aspect, and you can watch it again and again! Iron Eagle is such a film!
