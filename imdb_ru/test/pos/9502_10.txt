Cecil B. DeMille filmed a series of homemade comedy dramas in late teens and early 20s. He found his ideal leading lady for these provocative works in Gloria Swanson. In Do Not Change My Husband Swanson plays a bored housewife, whose wealthy businessman husband (Elliot Dexter) pays more attention to work than she does. She is pursued by the beautiful Rowe (Lew Cody) until she relents and divorces her boring husband for a new lover. <br /> <br /> Soon everything becomes familiar, and Swanson discovers that the new husband is just as careless as the first. Worse, she discovers that Cody has a woman on the side (Julia Fay). After several confrontations and comfortable meetings, everything is decided. <br /> <br /> It was a hit in 1919, thanks to which Gloria Swanson became the main star. Although she was only 20 years old when she filmed this, she is very good, like maybe a stupid wife. She looks great and wears some amazing dresses. <br /> <br /> There is one unforgettable scene, 100% composed of DeMille, in which Cody lures Swanson with promises of wealth, pleasure and love. When he screams at her, she imagines scenes. Pleasure is Swansonâ€™s fantastic scene in a spider hammock swinging over a pool while people dance around. Wealth is the scene in which Swanson dresses like the queen of Babylon when servants bring her chests of jewels that are thrown to the side. Love is the scene in which she is a forest nymph who makes love in a forest glade with a Pan-like character (Ted Shaun). Pure hokum, but very interesting, and Swanson looks great. <br /> <br /> Dexter is very good as a soft husband who shaves off his mustache and starts training to get his wife back. Cody is also good at a fake spellcaster who is a liar and a deceiver. Fay is funny, like another bitchy woman called Tudles who gets her. Sylvia Ashton plays Mrs. Hackney. Ted Shawn was married to Ruth St. Denis, and together they were innovative and influential modern dancers (from the Denison school). <br /> <br /> Swanson amazes me more every time I see her. She seems to have been such a natural actress, and yet there is a way that the camera captures her expressive face, which simply fascinates. Its fun to watch. <br /> <br /> A very interesting film with many colors in different scenes to liven up life. And many interior items are in fashion again 86 years later.
