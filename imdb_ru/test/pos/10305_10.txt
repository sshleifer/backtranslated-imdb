Very touching and thought-provoking film, which raises issues of mental health, incurable disease and euthanasia. Is the sound too heavy? This is not much, but all of this is perceived as realistic and straightforward in the history of the changes that occur with a family that deals with these things. This is a positive story about how to resist life and responsibility, which is not overwhelmed by the subject. <br /> <br /> Afterlife is a beautifully filmed and made in our day film, shot in modern conditions and dedicated to contemporary issues. This is an inspirational character, an exciting movie with a strong cast and some very good features. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not the film that always works well at the box office, so catch it while you can.
