It is very bad that no one knows about this film. I think that if it were cut down a bit, and if it were not so low-budget, I think that one of the main film companies might want to take it. I first watched this film when I was 11 years old, and I thought that he was so strong thanks to many wonderful, but illegal roles that Mitchell went on to keep his family together. It inspired me then, and it amazes me now. If you are lucky to find a copy of this movie, do not miss!
