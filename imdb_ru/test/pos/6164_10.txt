Absolutely one of the best aviation films of all time on so many levels. Hardware addicts will drool because of the largest cluster of flying Spitfires outside of the Battle of Britain. At least eight flying Spit on hand for very accurate ground and air sequences. <br /> <br /> Those who are amazed at the knowledge of flight and get foggy eyes, repeating “High Flight”, identify themselves with the respect of the central characters the freedom to be fast, free and high in their Dark Blue World. Be careful: romantics and even dog lovers enjoy a very emotional trip in this film. The basic idea is that many war veterans share, because their best hours, the period of their life, when they felt most alive, were in fact during the war, when everything else was sad and gray. <br /> <br /> The story concerns Czech pilots who flee their country when the Nazis invade and join the RAF Free Czech Squadron. There are several plots, each of which deserves close attention. This is just an old great movie that will please even the most ardent anti-apparatus romantics (keep Kleenex at hand). Beautiful photography, first-class acting, accurate details of the life of the RAF during the battle for Britain. Easy candidate for the personal DVD collection of any aviation enthusiast.
