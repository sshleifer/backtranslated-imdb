"The Tale of Two Sisters" is a brilliant psychological horror of South Korea, which deprived me of speechless. The film offers some amazing moments of terrible horror and very creepy. The small cast is truly superb, especially in the lead role. Im Su Su Joong is memorable in the lead role. Directed by Kim Ji-woo, well managed, and the cinema is absolutely gorgeous. The plot is a bit confusing, but some scenes are amazingly creepy. The action is rather slow, but I was not bored in the slightest, I was extremely curious and intrigued. The house where the film takes place looks incredibly menacing and isolated. The Tale of Two Sisters, along with Ring and Cairo, is one of the most original Asian horror films I have. saw this masterpiece as soon as possible. My rating: 10 out of 10.
