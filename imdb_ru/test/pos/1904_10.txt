Citizen Kane .... The Godfather, Part II ... Dolemite D'Urville Martin. This is the largest piece of celluloid ever created and released to humanity. Rudy Ray Moore in the role of Oscar, in the role of Dolemite, the worst cat in the universe. He obviously does not take the jive from the turkey (I myself, unfortunately, the turkey) and proves it with his abilities to knock, pimp and chop karate. This is the best game, a brilliant example of a genre with its low budget, mistakes of continuity and hatred for eating rat soup, which can be exposed. The True Godfather of Rap (and not this new crap Ali) Moore is something like a comparison of acting technique; somehow you manage to be the most charismatic horrible actor of the 1970s, and that says something. These are STRONGLY recommended people, if not only for one-liners.
