The time has come. Kate Jackson got her credit for this film. I remember watching it and trying to understand it on TV. My grandmother was lying in bed, dying of cancer, and I was only 15 years old. I didnâ€™t find years later when Richard died a long time ago, I miss him in other shows / films he has been in. <br /> <br /> I have a copy of VHS tapes, but it is NOT "CC'd" or hidden subtitles for the hearing impaired, and this is the ONLY flaw in the film that I can remember or learn today ... I could not find a copy of a DVD or VHS that has subtitles even in English. If anyone knows any copy on VHS or DVD that has CC'd or has English subtitles, please let me know. <br /> <br /> thanks - Cofffeenut
