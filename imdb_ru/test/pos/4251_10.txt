This film has gotten better with time. I cannot believe that forty years have passed since I saw this at the age of 15. Yeah, right. Film ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could enter any movie. Imagine how it was for a child of my age to see the Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swap in the same year. Imagine time. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King were just killed, but the following summer a man walked to the moon and Woodstock. Putney Swap was a chance for the Woodstock nation to tie him to this man. You will see where Robert Downey Jr. got his sardonic brilliance. His old man was an instant hero for children like me. In this classic there are no beats, and the aging hippies will rejoice, experiencing this era. We hope that the new children of flowers will be encouraged by this, and the current era of fascism will pass under the same scrutiny that my era has been subjected to.
