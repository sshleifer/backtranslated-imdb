especially considering that on the one hand I can count on romantic comedy films that I have ever liked. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is very good as a patient who has undergone a heart transplant and is mysteriously associated with the recently deceased wife Duchovna. (I can recall a few terrible films that used this storyline - I think there was an LMN film with Jane Seymour) This film, however, is the guardian. <br /> <br /> The spiritually sympathetic, and the scenes with his dog are cute and sad - the dog misses his late wife. All his friends want him to find a replacement, and there is a funny scene where he is on a blind date, and the driver is a waitress. His date is terrible, and he finds himself intrigued by Minnie Driver. <br /> <br /> Carol O'Connor is also good in one of his last roles, like a smug grandfather. Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi (this is the only film in which I liked it) complete the comedic aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a good film, because the story works, it is not too romantic, and does not offend the intellect of the audience. 9/10 highly recommended.
