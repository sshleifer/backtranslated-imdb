This game is a combat action / adventure. There are quite long periods without a fight, but in other cases you need to get rid of various types of monsters. Monsters are not like anything that you would see in real life, and you need to get rid of them in order to continue your quest. The whole game is a quest. You play Adam Randall, whose father contacts him from outside and asks him to come and save him. The game is from the mid-1990s and should be played in DOS. I used the dosbox and was able to play the game pretty well. The graphics are not as good as in some games, even at that time, mainly due to the fact that the resolution is not high, and some scenes look rather faded, but others look better, but don't let this push you away from the game. The game is very original, it is long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear from nowhere. Not for young children, who are probably not interested anyway, but this game may appeal to people over 13 or 14 years old. This is a combination of horror \ mystery \ action \ adventure \ fighting. I thought it was a great game. He had to be found now. maybe ebay. But remember that this is a game for DOS, and you will not be able to play it on more modern computers. it would be difficult to play on fast computers if you are not using the Dosbox. Oh, and the acting is also very good.
