Some time ago I saw it when HBO showed it, and from what I saw, it seemed like a good movie. so I'm in a blockbuster today and see him there from the DVD, and I decide what the hell. So I rent out. After I finished watching it, I was shocked by how good it was. <br /> <br /> This film only touched my heart. Everything about him was so amazing. Stories, actors, dark humor, MUSIC !!! Oh, don't get me started on the music in this movie. PT Andderson is one of the greats. Definitely the best that could come out after Quentin Tarantino (god). <br /> <br /> After I finished my first viewing, I looked at him again with Anderson’s comment (I was surprised how cool he was) <br /> <br /> Anyone who is interested in cinema should Watch this movie if he hasn't done it yet. Anderson is obviously a movie buff. In the film, he rips off so many other movie directors. For example, a pool scene with a camera following the girl across the water. Obviously, ripped off "I'm Cuba." But I have nothing to do with this. The film is very respectable with this rip-off. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who can deal with some of the movie’s content (porn.) <br /> <br /> 10/10
