In this TV special John - the one who needs life. The highlight of his day is counting tiles on the ceiling and moving the box for socks. Not content with this forever, John takes Garfield to a self-help group to meet people. How many people are interested in a lonely 20-year-old, who is the best friend - a cat? <br /> <br /> After several unsuccessful attempts to get a girl, including one dance scene that competes with David Brent in the movie Flashdance MC Hammer in The Office (Disco Is Dead?, says John), he is more than shocked to find a pretty girl which is as cheeky as he is. <br /> <br /> Naturally, they get along, but Garfield is concerned that John will forget about him and would prefer to have children rather than a cat. Fortunately, the new girl John is allergic to cats. <br /> <br /> With more pleasant animation than in previous TV shows, this is similar to the longer episode "Garfield and Friends".
