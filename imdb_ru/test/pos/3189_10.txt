Love in Limbo is my favorite movie of all time. (set in W.A) It is fun and has an excellent cast that includes a group of three great actors, Russell Crowe (like Arthur), on the day he really looked HOT with short hair and no facial hair. Aden Young (Barry McJannet), and Craig Adams, like Ken Riddle. <br /> <br /> Ken is a high school student obsessed with sex, and becomes expelled for selling pornographic pictures of his classmates. He begins a new job at his uncle's garment factory and moves closer to another new guy, Barry McGunnet, who buys a car so they can go out and pick up the chickens. They become comrades with the crank Arto Baskin (Crowe), and these three guys go to Kalgoorlie to visit the brothel and lose their virginity ...... <br /> <br /> Look, this is a classic !! For so long I tried to get a DVD or soundtrack, someone let me know if you have them.
