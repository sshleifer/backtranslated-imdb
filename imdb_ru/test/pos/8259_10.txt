Superbly adapted to the screen and extremely faithful to the historical novel by Mary Webb, this film is a true masterpiece. In addition to the exceptionally talented rising star, Janet Maktir in the title role and one or two recognized actors, the film used mostly little-known names. And yet the drama was all the more convincing. Social and personal tensions are almost palpable, and I felt that the actors react to each other as if they were acting in real life. I saw one commentator asking if Janet McTier really had a cleft lip, a testimony to how good her character was. I saw it on TV when it was first shown, taped, and then, unfortunately, the tape was lost. But it remains clear, like everything in my head. If you have some kind of love for the social period, you definitely need to see it.
