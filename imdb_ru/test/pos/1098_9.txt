It was a casual rental video store. But I was impressed from the start. “Wooden Camera” is the pearl of the 2nd storyline from the director. The film captures deeply insightful moments, and young interracial friends often experience some often frustrating and complex social interactions in modern post-apartheid South Africa. Young actors are quite good and well oriented in their approach to the main material, and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich in visual effects, providing a frame-by-frame study of a deeper understanding and implementation, without falling into cult stereotypes and clichés. The musical accompaniment to the film adds to the body of the film, without being intrusive. After watching it a second time, I searched for a DVD on Amazon and since then I have been happy.
