This is a talking, challenging contented, alcoholic ass cop! I saw the first and second episodes. The decoration and animation fit very well (pay attention to facial expressions, laughs). The main character is what he wears with a weapon, wears a badge, a couple of cheeks in the ass, shoots at someone he considers offensive or "guilty". Until now, the episodes have been simple and understandable scenes that work very well with the investigations of Assy. Don Sanchez, Assy's partner, play - the sobering replica of Assy A.A. antics and random "I guess" leads. Assi strings are very funny and clever, here’s one of them, for example: “I have one bullet and you have your email address on it, don’t make me press”. New mail. "Thinking at the headquarters of Assi McGee is so far consistent and visual. As for sound, it’s perfect, sound effects and dub 9/10. Assi sounds like Sylvester Stallone drank everything, Don Sanchez, mayor, police chief, everything they say that it “fits" in this person very well. I recommend it to anyone who wants to laugh a little before going to bed, since on Sunday evening he lets the air out during the swim for adults. Very funny, original, visually excellent comedy . 10/10
