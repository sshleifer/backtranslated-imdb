This film was my favorite and connected with the Christmas holidays for me for two reasons: (1) in the 1960s everything was connected with space, from advertising to television programs, and even Santa Claus was on a spaceship during this. the era; and (2) I saw this movie on Christmas shopping, when I was ten years old, and it brought me fond memories of my favorite TV shows when I was younger (Supercar, Fireball XL5 and Stingray, ) So I’m a bit biased when it comes to this movie for personal reasons. <br /> <br /> However, being a long-time student of the film, it’s mostly a film for Jerry Anderson’s fans (and Barry Gray, oh, this is a great score!) While the casual viewer of the film will be removed by future vision (dig these wild cars, commercial planes, clothes, etc.) And the so-called “plot twist” that will make someone moan. However, if you look at the past after “2001: A Space Odyssey,” the desire to make a science fiction film with a “distant” storyline, and if you like creative special effects, then you will enjoy this gem from an era when a person just walking on the moon, and people still looked at the stars with wonder and hope for the future, and did not look down on the commonplace attributes of the actual 21st century.
