"Belief in the Big Other as an invisible power structure that exists in the Real is the most concise definition of paranoia." ?? Slava Zizek <br /> <br /> This is a review of "Marathon Runner" and "Falcon and Snowman", two films directed by John Schlesinger. <br /> <br /> Although Hitchcock and Lang brought "conspiracy thriller" to Hollywood ", the genre flourished only in the late 60s and 70s, with the films" Parallax Look "," Z "," Marathon Runner "," Capricorn One, Manchu Candidate, Three Days of the Condor and All People of the President. It was the era of Vietnam and Watergate, the public was deeply suspicious of all political leaders. <br /> <br /> This genre remained calm in the 80s and early 90s, until the TV series “X Files” came to life, with such slogans as “Truth Exists” and “Trust No One”, the series represented a world of vast conspiracy soviet government plots, ordinary people dominated by all manner of ridiculously complicated schemes. The only way out of the labyrinth? Fight the future! ”as the slogan of the final season of the series is proclaimed. , which provided our own freedom. <br /> <br /> This trend ended with the Internet boom, conspiracy thrillers are now giving way to "documentary plot". The Internet generation has collected such independent documentaries as "Loose Change" and "Zeitgeist", while Michael Moore basically spread his audience with such things as Fahrenheit 9/11. All of these documentaries believed in a “secret order,” a click of wealthy politicians and businessmen, who conspired to reduce human rights and enslave the world. They are struggling to create a mono-myth, combining various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single narrative story, which explains the purpose, meaning and future of everything. <br /> <br /> This is necessary for “streamlining narratives” to make them more “effective”, reflected in the scientific community, which is fighting to create a “theory of great unification” and, ultimately, a “theory of everything”, uniting everything from quantum mechanics to the special theory of relativity into one giant, covering all formulas. /> <br /> Ultimately, the conspiracy thriller is rooted in a person’s desire to control. A modern subject is one who demonstrates direct cynicism towards official institutions, but at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies (the invisible Other, pulling the strings). This clearly contradictory link between cynicism and faith is closely connected with the death of the big Other. His disappearance causes us to build the Other from the Other (conspiracy) in order to avoid the unbearable freedom that his loss causes. Conversely, there is no need to take the Big Other seriously if we believe in the Other Other. Therefore, we are allowed to show cynicism and faith in equal measures. <br /> <br /> Thus, a person seeks to establish control over a wayward universe, to create a kind of paternal nanny (whether it be God, a mathematical formula, a conspiracy theory, an explanation of violence / conspiracy / murder / war, etc. ). ) which provides meaning and symbolic order. Big Other gives assurances to the believer. This is a “lifestyle choice”, akin to religion, in which its place in the world depends on pure irrationality. <br /> <br /> The problem with most conspiracy thrillers, starting in Hitchcock’s innocent Topaz days and ending with the modern board, such as The Da Vinci Code, has two sides. First, they are not mistaken in asserting that something is “wrong” among the “elite” or “best people”, but they are wrong in the individualization and personalization of social, collective and systemic processes, an approach that implies that it is just a matter of personal morality, not social structures. Secondly, and most importantly, these “conspiracies” ignore the fact that the Big Other simply does not exist. There is no symbolic order of stringing. <br /> <br /> Some modern conspiracy thrillers (Eyes Wide Shut, Existenz, etc.) confirm this, with their incomprehensible web of lies, accidents, truth and half. true, non-summarizing, meaningless, real and hyper-real, truth and desire, everything is blurry, without any identifiable epicenter, but mostly films of intellectual directors. <br /> <br /> Compared to these modern “conspiracy thrillers,” “Marathon Man” and “Falcon and Snowman” are clearly archaic. “Marathoner” is a graduate student (Dustin Hoffman) who is involved in the business of his older brother (Roy Shader), who unfortunately has to do with spies, weapons, double agents, diamonds, and evil Nazi dentists. Scheider is courteous, Hoffman is superb, and Schlesinger amazes us with some neat visual effects (the Eiffel Tower revelation is stunning), but what is most interesting in the film is that its various storylines do not overlap to 1 o'clock, even then it takes half an hour to things began to make sense. Unfortunately, the film ends with a bright fight between the villain and the good guy, everything is neatly decided and explained. <br /> <br /> “Falcon and Snowman” is a bit more ambitious. Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton play two friends who sell government secrets to the Soviet Union. Hatton works for a civil defense contractor and takes information from his office into the hands of Penn, a small drug dealer, who has no doubt that he is selling the KGB. Penn does it strictly for the money, while Hutton is disappointed in the American government (especially in his attempt to overthrow the Australian leader) and therefore sells secrets strictly because he hates how his country conducts crimes and spy games. In other words, a film about conspiracy in response to conspiracies. <br /> <br /> Marathoner ?? 7.9 / 10 <br /> <br /> Falcon and Snowman ?? 8/10 <br /> <br /> In addition to the strange car accident and its cliché ending, “Marathoner” is an effective thriller with a few neat scenes. "Falcon and Snowman" is even better, Penn turns into an unforgettable performance.
