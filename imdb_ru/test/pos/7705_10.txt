“Dope Sick Love” is a truly wonderful documentary filmed for HBO, about two couples of heroin lovers who roam the streets of New York. I managed to catch it one night by chance, and it turned out to be absolutely fascinating. There is no narration there, and we never see any interviews with objects, the camera simply follows them, like a third eye, completely cut off. People who are being watched do not even suspect that they are being shot! (or at least they don't seem to care). Frames surprisingly frank. Some of the most outspoken that I have ever seen. This is as real as possible. Nuts and bolts of what it is like to be on the street and addicted to heroin. We see them taking drugs, taking them off, inventing, inventing and even posing as policemen to rob people, and about a million other tiny details that documentary filmmakers would have ignored. <br /> <br /> Some shots are really terrible How to watch as one guy is desperately looking for a fix he lost. I found that I prayed that he would find it, just that his suffering would temporarily stop. And when he finds it, the guy literally dances on the street. <br /> <br /> The cyclical nature of addiction becomes very apparent by watching it. EVERYTHING is about getting the next score for these people, but the next one seems to be worth the huge problems they face. <br /> <br /> I would like to get a copy of this if anyone knows where it is available. Highly recommended if you can catch it on HBO.
