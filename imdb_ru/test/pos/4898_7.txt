There are two ways to turn a series into a movie. <br /> <br /> First, the most common and least successful, is to make a full-length television episode - to see the catastrophes of the “Steady Son” movie. Secondly, to do something else - something completely different, for example, Monty Python. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the creators of the cult TV series chose the second option and came up with something unique. , smart and funny - it could not have been less like a television episode. <br /> <br /> Try to think it over - the writers, playing themselves, face their alter ego Royston Vasya, played, of course, they are told to continue writing TV series, otherwise the apocalypse will overwhelm the village. <br /> <br /> A high idea, contrived and easily screwed up? Yes, but somehow they managed to accomplish this. Perhaps not for every taste, and the finale delays, but fans will be delighted, and he may even defeat the uninitiated.
