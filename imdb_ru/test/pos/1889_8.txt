These are the films that I loved and still love to grow up. Unlike big budget films that create huge holes in the plot and never recognize them. This film takes everything in stride and just does what you can sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Earlier there was one student who complained that it was not a list of materials. But this is not the main thing. The point of this film is that not everyone likes huge films filled with CGI Clich√©. There are many people who like movies that are meant only to entertain you, and not to get as much money as they can. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is also nice to know that good old Bruce is not dead yet.
