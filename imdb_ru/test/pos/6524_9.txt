Fans of apocalyptic films will love this well-made, low-budget thriller, which is essentially a remake of George Pal's classic 1951 film “When Worlds Face”. The comet moves into collision with the Earth, and when its fellow scientists ignore its death warnings, eccentric scientist Peter Crawford (Dennis Hopper) gathers a group of private investors to secretly build an underground shelter. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds through the muscle-bound veteran of the Gulf War Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati), who inadvertently discovers Crawford’s hidden refuge, and then decides that Crawford is wrong to hide his project from the rest of humanity. As the comet approaches, the topic of who should live and who should die creates an interesting drama. <br /> <br /> Although the special effects are not in the same league, I liked the story more than the Spielberg War. worlds because i feel that this script is better. Some suspension of scientific reality is required, but it makes sense to develop a good story. I highly recommend this movie to fans of the genre.
