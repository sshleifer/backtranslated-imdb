This one person show can be the most fantastic show I've ever seen. To call it simply an act of resistance is to make it a big injustice; there is a definite reason why it was a Broadway show. John Leguizamo is a master so that people of all cultures feel at home, listening to his story of growing up and interacting with family and life in general. I would recommend this show to anyone if they can master the language.
