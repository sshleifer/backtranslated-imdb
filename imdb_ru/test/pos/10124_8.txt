Inspired by True Events, Radio is one of the most popular, soulful dramas I've ever seen widely released. This is definitely one of the best films of the year 2003. <br /> <br /> Stars Radio Ed Harris, who nonetheless deserves an Oscar in this film, as football coach Harold Jones. Coach Jones teaches football his whole life and loves the game. However, Coach Jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter performed by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day, the radio played by Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance from the time of the Men of Honor, goes to the football field while the coachâ€™s team is preparing for the game. Some team members then link the radio and throw it into the building. Then they knock on the building, and finally, Coach Jones suspects that something is wrong. He comes in and helps the radio, which is scared, and from that moment on, trainer Jones and the radio have a special connection. Radio is becoming the highlight of every football game, and he really likes to participate in football games and school activities. He also becomes the main interest of coach Jones to life over football, which at first was his main priority over family and radio. <br /> <br /> The film deals with all sorts of problems from real life, including what your priorities in life are, to accept people as they are, even if they are different, death and family relationships. The film touches on all these issues and much more, and it is very well done, and directed by Michael Tollin should be proud of this film. In the radio, I really liked how real it was. The performances were similar to how in real life something happens right before your eyes. The radio had a great combination of comedy and drama. Some parts were pretty funny, but others were very serious and sad. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I feel that critics have ignored the radio a lot, receiving only average reviews. They must be sticking out there, because it's amazing how this film can get only 2-star reviews, and something like a school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars, for me it doesn't make any sense. Also, the performances, as I mentioned earlier, are first-class and Oscar-worthy. In my opinion, and Ed Harris, who, I think, is underestimated as an actor, and Cuba Gooding Jr. should both get some kind of nomination for this film. Radio is one of my favorite movies of the year and gives me a reason to watch some of the biggest Hollywood movies. My final rating for Radio is 9/10.
