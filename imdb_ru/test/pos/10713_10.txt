Just as Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is about to take a break from his professional life, his frustrated wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) finally had the courage to leave him, leaving Ted to take care of his five year old son (Justin Henry). Being a single parent is not an easy task for Ted, and he suffers professionally, but at the same time he finds out that he has a lot more to do than a career, as he continues to get involved with his son and gets to know him for real. But then Joanna returns and intends to return her son, which leads to a brutal trial. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs. Kramer is a superbly well written and superbly played human drama that will leave only the coldest ones. the viewer is not touched. Hoffman's growing relationship with his son is so well depicted, and the film never comes out easy. This always seems to be very real, and thanks to the low-key approach of the film it makes even more effect and can easily affect multiple viewing, the dramatic impact of the film is not reduced. <br /> <br /> Easy recommended; 10 out of 10.
