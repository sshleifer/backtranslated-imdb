This is quite an interesting experiment to observe. This is the first attempt in the world to combine vision with sound. In it, two people dance to the violin (perhaps William KL Dickson himself), who stands next to the recording cylinder of Edison, which captures the sound. <br /> <br /> The sound and images were not related to each other, as one is still. And only recently sound and image have been added technically. This is probably the reason why people do not dare to call this film the first sound picture in the world. <br /> <br /> The film was shot by William KL Dixon, assistant of Thomas Edison himself, who ordered him to think of a way to combine pictures and sound. The answer he gave was a Kinetophone, a Kinetoscope (mostly a large wooden box with a peephole inside so that people could watch moving images) with a cylindrical phonograph inside for sound. This is the first thing we know about the surviving film experiments with this technique. All later films using the same technique were made, as silent films and sound effects were recorded later and separately. Thus, the Kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images, but rather an attempt to have images accompanied by sound. In some cases, people could even choose one of three sound cylinders, showing 3 different orchestral performances accompanying the images. Only 45 Kinetophones were released, so the Kinephone can hardly be called successful. In addition, after this experiment, attention was focused on other cinematic technologies, mainly on film projectors. <br /> <br /> Thus, the experiment itself, obviously, was not crowned with success, since another 30 years passed before the appearance of the first films. with sound were made and commercially released. They just still could not technically synchronize and connect the sound and images at that time, and even if they could and the technology would be available, it would be a very expensive job. Therefore, these are not really the most influential or historically important films from the history of cinema, but it is very interesting to observe how people constantly tried to improve the quality and methods of early cinema and film production. <br /> <br /> 8/10
