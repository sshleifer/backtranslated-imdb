Designed to become a classic even before it was conceptualized. This game deserves all the recognition it deserves. While first-person shooters such as Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament are attracting the attention of computer gamers, graphic adventures are a dying breed. The Curse of Monkey Island is a game that will appeal to people of all age groups. Life can only improve after playing the Monkey Island Curse. * prediction * the continuation of Escape from Monkey Island is already destined to become a classic. I guarantee it.
