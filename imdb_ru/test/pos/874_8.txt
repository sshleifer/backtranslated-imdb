I slowly collected films available on DVD for both Catherine Deneuve and Francois Truffaut. Both the actress and the director have done some abominations in their time - fortunately, the Mississippi Mermaid is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Next to “Soft Skin”, coincidentally staring at Sister Deneuve (deceased Françoise Dorlik), should be my favorite Truffaut film. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing, Truffaut also wrote the script. Something that always strikes me in Truffaut is his almost childlike innocence in presenting a story — it can be called almost naive. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film there is a scene in which Belmondo returns to an apartment in Lyon. with the remnants of prey. He rings the doorbell, and Deneuve answers in a negligee. While Belmondo gets to their room from the street, Deneuve dresses in a dress, puts on the best pair of stockings and shoes, then lies down on the bed and pretends to sleep. This is a scene that can almost come to the head of a child, but for you this is Truffaut. <br /> <br /> Watching Catherine Deneuve in her late 60s films is truly sensual pleasure. She is so extraordinarily beautiful that it almost hurts us to watch. By the way, for those fans in this film there is a pair of her scenes with topless - really sinful pleasure. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with previous posters. I don't see anything in the Hitchcokian movie. As for the "appearance" - I like the look of old films, used in the 60s. It certainly gives the films of this period a unique appearance. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for Deneuve and Truffaut fans ......
