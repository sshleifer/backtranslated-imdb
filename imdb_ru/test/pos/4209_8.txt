Great movie. John Garfield's character is a distant relative of Jean Valjean from Les Miserables, and Detective Raines remembers Javert Victor Hugo, the ruthless hand of the law. <br /> <br /> As in many films about noirs, the city personifies evil, while country and nature represent sanctuary, redemption and a second chance for those whose lives seem doomed forever. But even in bright daylight, danger may appear suddenly, as the excellent scene on the reservoir shows. John Garfield-Actor, who, as Leonard Maltin points out, should be rediscovered: I have never been disappointed in any of his films, except for his role in the “gentleman's agreement”, but it was not his fault - he gives a soulfully sensitive and the audience side is with him as soon as he is unjustly accused (the first sequence shows a rather unkind hypocrite, but all his tests atone for him and how we treat him during the last scenes with detective Raines. bavlyayutmnogo joy of life, which is required. Humor is also present in the game of poker on the strip as Dead End kill the larvae of a rich child. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film.
