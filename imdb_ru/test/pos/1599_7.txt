I'm not sure where to start. In short, it was a disappointing film. Having studied the novella, I realized that turning into a film would not be easy. The film has several interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach), but it does not represent the debate on art, which basically forms the novel. <br /> <br /> First, I was expecting the elder Ashenbach and the younger Tadzio. Tadzio is fourteen in the book, but he is described as pure, perfect, innocent, whereas in the film he smells like sexuality and teasing. He is an accomplice of Ashenbach, he always looks back at him, almost provocatively. In the book, this is Ashenbach, who steals glances at the boy. As for Ashenbach, I imagined something more similar to the professor who became a clown in the Blue Angel (as told by brother Thomas Mann Heinrich) than this forty-year-old teenager with barely gray hair. In fairness, I think Dirk Bogard did a good job, but either someone else had to do it, or he had to look older in the beginning. <br /> <br /> I know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story, but the film minimizes the talk of art and the duality between the inspiration of Apollo and Dionysus and focuses instead on Ashenbach Tadzio’s obsession and does not justify it. I liked the fact that Mahler’s music was used because in the end he inspired Mann to write his story. I'm not sure that turning Ashenbach into a musician was a particularly good move. Or the creation of Alfred, whom I do not remember in the book. <br /> <br /> One thing that really struck me was the sound and how it didn’t fit the actors ’lips. I was wondering if this was duplicated, because I expected it to be in Italian. But then I remembered that every Italian film that I watched had this problem. It just bothers me, because these directors (Fellini is another person I think of) should embody perfection in Italian cinema, but their characters laugh without sound, and then you hear a noise that does not fit their faces (I think about scenes when Ashenbach almost falls and starts laughing. This scene could / should have been the strongest, but instead it annoyed).
