Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Yes, it is difficult to distract from this attractive beauty (creating a brilliantly beautiful presentation), because she just hang out tongues. “One Night at McCool's” is an insanely quirky and rough black comedy with old-fashioned shades tied to her familiar but skillfully thoughtful and chaotic narrative in which three men crave one woman and she milks her in their own interests. When you see Tyler, do not you wonder why they are passionate and will do something ?? This is all to see her “happy and alive” her dreams. As with Tyler, there’s something pretty intoxicating about this function: we see people like Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser (who’s great), and especially Michael Douglas (who plays the assassin with a casual ease, but dubious hairdo) have a good time with their roles. The plot begins with the fact that the three main characters (Dillon, Goodman and Reiser) tell their story about how they were faced with this divine presence and about the possible consequences that it has on them, which leads to an insane climax. There is an unpredictable chain of events (from fruit to sensual), where everything will actually be associated with a certain ironic (snowball) twist of fate for the characters (who see that they are leaving their reserved comfort zone to fulfill this girl). The direction of Howard Zvart colorfully shyly balances the script's quick shots and insanely funny, if difficult situations. One of the best comedy comedies in the last ten years, in which you'll be under Tyler's thumb.
