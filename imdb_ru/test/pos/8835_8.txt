The history of television adaptation to films is replete with aberrations, which almost convincingly prove that tradition should never begin from the very beginning. There are, however, some examples that cope simply. At first glance, it seems that Rising Damp will be the latest comedy series, suitable for viewing on the big screen, as this funny series was based in the tiny borders of the northern bed. In addition, the writer, Eric Chappell, did not receive enough money to spend time creating a completely original script, so he put together a series of television episodes and put them together to form the main part of the film. In itself, this does not necessarily mean that the script will fail. David Croft and Jimmy Perry did the same with their script for the Father's Army, and it worked great. Although the early episodes of “The Army of the Pope” with their balanced tempo and excessive plot plot were much better suited for the film adaptation. The Rising Damp episodes, however, were high-energy affairs from the first scene to a lifeless climax. As a result, when one story ends and the other begins, the scenes in the film become incoherent. Another trap for the TV version of the film is the inevitable comparisons. In this regard, the film fades compared with the brilliant series of Rising Damp. Despite all this, Rising Damp the Movie manages to be interesting and sometimes fussy. It is perhaps not surprising that the best moments occur during episodes written specifically for the film. This includes a rugby match where Rossiter makes brilliantly calculated time. Indeed, while all the actors do an excellent job with their roles (with the exception of the actor who replaces the non-standard for the deceased and truly great Beckinsale), most of all he is played by Leonard Rossiter as Rigsby. In fact, “Rising Damp” should have been shot as a film, so that Rossiter could claim an Oscar, such is the magnificence of his acting talent. Criminally, he was not even nominated. Ultimately, the film does not match the dizzying heights of the television series, and at the same time managed to hold on as a comedy in itself with some perfectly played moments. Recommended view. <br /> <br /> One more thing: opening and closing music is by far the worst in cinema history.
