Thus, Koreans are now knocking down American horror films. But they do it with style. DOLL MASTER is an exact copy of PUPPETMASTER and DOLLS, in which there is even a small CHILDREN'S GAME. Several young people are invited to attend a special event in a gallery filled with dolls, only to discover that they are the targets of a vengeful spirit. Dolls come to life and do quite unpleasant things with children. The blood level is quite high, photos and set design and production values ​​are first-class, acting is not so bad, and fears are definitely present. DOLL MASTER can not be in the same league with "The Tale of Two Sisters" or even "Deadly Friend", but it is close. Give him a watch. You will not be disappointed.
