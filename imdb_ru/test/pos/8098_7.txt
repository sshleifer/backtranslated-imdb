Being a big fan of Charlie Chaplin, who follows a good vibration after watching Gold Rush first and then City Lights, I really wanted to see The Great Dictator, because I was told that this was probably his best movie. I was also intrigued by the fact that it was a walkie-talkie; My first, wise Chaplin. <br /> <br /> The beginning is typical Chaplin and clear evidence that when it comes to sound, the chaplain can cut it off without relying solely on music to set the mood and talk; it's funny, timely, and the elements of farce, such as the fall of an anti-aircraft gun, are well connected with jokes. It was nice to attract the viewer to this “classic Chaplinsky” discovery and at the same time give an excuse to introduce the characters to each other. What was also well done was a way of faking Hitler. Any scene with the participation of Hitler or "Hinkel" in this film was funny and even now; makes you remember how you know exactly who it is forging, and creates some kind of internal reaction. The way English is mixed with German during the dialogue scenes is another proof of how Chaplin managed to adapt to the age of conversation. My favorite joke was the five-minute speech that Hinkel delivered, only for an English translator to translate it into several words; forcing you to recall the shots with Hitler, you may have seen a performance at some point in your life and even laughed at it. <br /> <br /> Historically, the film also had the right things. Hinkel can be seen as being photographed with children; something that Hitler did for recognition when he manipulated the media, but here Hinkel is yawning and bored; prick in the backstage technique of Hitler to conquer the German public through sympathy (Oh, he embraces and kisses the children. He must be fine!). The film is also given a fantastic assumption that a Jewish civilian was re-installed in the ghetto among all the parodies that took place, but with a catch that he did not notice. Films like The Pianist and Come and See are two good examples of Nazi cruelty to "lower" people, who today we can all look back and shake our heads, while in the late 1930s, when it was filmed, the fact that he had cruelty and exploited her makes her an even more striking achievement. Chaplin succeeded in replacing his guns and batons with tomatoes and pans, and he was still pulling them out. <br /> <br /> What I didn’t like about the film was that after opening it turned into a real story. This slowed down the film, and this is very noticeable, since the leg has somewhat moved away from the gas. The film began to hint at stories and subtests. These include the hairdresser and the neighbor in love and the alleged destruction of the Hinkel Palace, although none of them have actually been developed. The gags of "letting a woman shave" and "the one who has the coin in the pudding does business" hinted at these ways of the conspiracy, but in the end simply materialized into nothing more than excuses put forward by unfunny gag that disappointed. <br /> <br /> During the final straight, “The Great Dictator” receives support from the fact that the Italian dictator is introduced, which adds a bit of much-needed life and justification for the comedy to the film. This is a pleasure, as we see them arguing, and a more hidden tactic is used when Hinkel tries to “defeat” his Italian colleague with a series of dirty tricks (although they are frustrated with humor). Despite some weakness in stimulation in the middle segment and the fact that I felt that the message at the end was a bit overwhelmed to my throat, the Great Dictator withstands watching today, but this is only because he risked exploiting things that no one else I really did not know what were there.
