I do not want to go into criticism of the film, which, in my opinion, for a film with a large budget is quite exceptional and audacious. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to point out that I was really tired of the studios of politics and the laws of different states that treat their viewers like children. In the database we find at least 4 different versions of the film, depending on the time of work. But, of course, it is likely that there are many more different cuts. <br /> <br /> As a result, there is complete confusion, and you can never talk about the same movie (if you donâ€™t live in Argentina, where the movie runs for 115 minutes, which sounds pretty full). <br /> <br /> Later on the DVD and video studios are trying to rob us by selling us an alleged directorial cut (in Germany, this version already exists, it takes about 110 minutes). <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the studios not only thought about the money they make with their films, but also thought of their products as a work of art, even at the risk of an unfavorable rating, so I like The viewer should not feel deceived, and they take me seriously, not just as a source of money.
