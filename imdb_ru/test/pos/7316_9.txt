All the beloved trio of clumsy assholes played out in the hospital in this incredibly hoarse and often hysterically funny vanity. These guys, without a doubt, are the only most incompetent group of doctors who have ever made their way around the screen. Among the comic moments: Stozhi, constantly breaking the glass panel in the door, their meeting with an abnormal patient, who claims that the rats used to go out of the loop of his shirt, Stoja ride through the corridors on a giant bicycle, a huge horse, and miniature racing cars, and our sublime stupid threesome, accidentally leaving the tools in the stomach of the unfortunate patient after they finished working for the poor man. Directed by Ray McCarey talks about the crazy comic fraud with a suitable non-stop fast paced and with great pleasure prepares a wide spanking. Mo Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard are all in peak form, thanks to the excellent support from Dell Henderson as the long-suffering hospital director of Dr. Graves, with the creaky voice of Jeanie Roberts as the hiccups of the nurse (the scene in which the Stooges make absurdity) improvised group, sang along with this girl, completely idle!), Ruth Hyatt as a whispering nurse, Billy Gilbert as an angry crazy patient and “Little Billy” Rhodes as an angry tiny patient. A lively madness for a moment does not give rest, thus turning this beautiful madman into one of the best walks of the Stooges.
