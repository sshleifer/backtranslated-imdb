Well, this is great work by Aparnadji, and some where such people make us believe that there are still many more concepts to express, and the film is an excellent tool for that. Well, all the great actors are together, so you can’t say anything about acting or directing, but the film gave us great information. He perfectly predicted how the human mind would be adapted to the mind of the patient. We all believe that what we believe is true from our own point of view, and we want to solve all problems accordingly. Therefore, from the professor to the maidservant, everyone tried their own way. Therefore, when Dzhoyduip discusses with his wife, he says that "she is looking for something that will never get," and the wife replies: "Are not we all?". So it was a great comment, which after the film left me with a big question: “Are we all sick?”
