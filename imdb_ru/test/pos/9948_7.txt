If you like movies about Japanese monsters, you will love this battle with battles, in which alien invaders are fighting with the intention to conquer the Earth and the "giant robot" with an arsenal of super-weapons. The alien, the Emporer Guillotine, from the planet Gargoyle, has an army of thugs called (of course) the gargoyle gang, as well as an infinite number of huge hostile creatures that usually spill onto Earth to destroy buildings. , make loud noises, panic the masses, etc. A young child named Johnny Sokko has a giant robot that he calls and, if necessary, sends a robot to beat and then blow up these creatures. Johnny joins a group of "good spies" called "Unicorn" and tries to help save the world. <br /> <br /> Despite the unpretentious nature, the unintentionally humorous dialogue and the fact that the target audience was obviously children, this film has a non-stop action, colorful characters, decent special effects, and it's just fun to watch. The battle scenes are well-executed and frequent, as required by the storyline. The good guys and the bad guys made sure that they have an endless supply of bombs, lasers, ammunition and attack schemes against each other. Despite the fact that the film was built from edited episodes of the series, the plot actually develops and reaches the final result. <br /> <br /> The film has a positive outlook and is liked by everyone (especially children). ) the desire to destroy evil in many of its manifestations. Children can be a target audience, but everyone has fun laughing at his ridiculous nonsense; yet, at the same time, rooting for the good guys to win and "save the world." The action is flawed in places, but this is the beauty: there are several lines of banal dialogue (perhaps translation errors or deliberate jokes from the filmmakers), and you will find yourself quoting these ridiculous lines later. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, this film is not high in production quality or budget. Nevertheless, whatever the case, unconstrained science fiction, it is pleasant to laugh. I recommend it to anyone who has a sense of humor for this sort of thing.
