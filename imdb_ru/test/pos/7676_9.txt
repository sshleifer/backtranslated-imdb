I have been looking for this film for many years. I have wonderful memories of first-class acting and singing in this film. I never knew that the reason why the film was unavailable was because of the actions of the Gershwin family - ENJOY THEM for what they tried to suppress in American Classic !! I can only hope that they will soften and allow the release of this film to American audiences. <br /> <br /> Sammy Davis Jr. in this film shows the absolute best qualities. His only performance, “Anna Lukasta”, is another stunning film that I would like to release on DVD. <br /> <br /> Porgy & Bess was a first-class star character. throw. Hopefully one day you will see everything yourself.
