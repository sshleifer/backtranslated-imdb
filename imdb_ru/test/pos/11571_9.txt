2005 and more than 15 years have passed since this cartoon was released. I have not really watched it seriously or closely for 10 years. Now that I'm 30 years old, I can seriously look back and watch the episodes again. <br /> <br /> In essence, the cartoon is partly a tribute to the classic Looney tunes, but also its own original show. There are several episodes that are structured like old cartoons. For example, there is a singer who attacks Buster, and therefore he longs for revenge at this singer's concert - just like the old cartoon Bugs Bunny. The resulting cartoon looks like Looney Tunes, just in a different era. If you look at the old Looney Tunes, they did a lot of things, just like Tiny Toons. The old Looney Tunes have made a lot of social comments and parodies. There were celebrity imitations. There were many banal jokes, slang and dialogues. The comedy was surreal and dumb. You can say this for Tiny Toons as well. The comedy style is "spiritually" the same. Most definitely a return to the classics, which was not done well (if at all) in cartoons decades before this show. We learn cultural references in Tiny Toons and can roll our eyes when we don’t like something. But the reason we don’t think Looney Tunes is commonplace is because we weren’t alive in the 40s. In addition, in those days Looney Tunes were original, but today the cartoons are being reviewed again and again. So Tiny Toons is easily perceived in an unfair light due to the fact that we are exposed to current events and overexposure cartoons in general. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are differences in many ways - timing, delivery and, obviously, the duration of the show. These are two different styles from two different periods, made in two very different circumstances: Looney Tunes for adults in cinemas and Tiny Toons for children watching television. Despite this, they did an excellent job creating an original show with original jokes and, nevertheless, paying respect and creating patterns after the comedy styles of the old Looney Tunes. <br /> <br /> Since Tiny Toons had a lot more time to play with, they had some genuine moments of great lively inspiration. You only have to look at episodes like 1 minute before 3, the episode of the toilet of the child Plucky .. there are many more. For example, one of the best animated comedy exchanges that ever existed is in ThirteenSomething when Babs and Buster talk on the phone on a split screen, hoping that everyone will miss the other. Misunderstanding is impressive. It is noteworthy that the character development in this episode and in some others (usually written by Dina Oliver or Sherry Stoner) is pretty good. Female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, which is unusual, given that the opposite is usually true for cartoons from that period. <br /> <br /> This was the first modern cartoon in which there was a lot of both pop culture and self-advertisement reference humor. It was far ahead of its time. Tiny Cartoons really opened the door for writers to take on the jokes that are so widespread in cartoons today, instead of doing the boring old nonsense that we experienced in our 80s childhood. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Cartoons completely moved away from it all. It was a breath of fresh air. Bakshi's new adventures about the Mighty Mouse may have been the forerunner, but Tiny Cartoons made this surreal comedy cartoon style a real success. <br /> <br /> In my childhood, I completely missed some jokes. For example, one episode is a tribute to the Marx brothers, whom I completely ignored when I was a teenager. Now I have a new respect for him. There are so many inspired jokes that I never noticed that they are really brilliant. This is such a comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I have never noticed such a comedy in childhood. I thought about this in most episodes that I recently watched. <br /> <br /> You would have noticed such things if you watched the show. Unlike some other reviewers, who, as I know, unjustly judge this, I looked at all the episodes and thought them over carefully, exposing both the child and the adult. <br /> <br /> We can say that terrible concern for the voice game, too. I'm not just talking about the main characters, but the side characters were made very well and creatively. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were great. Tress McNeil, in my opinion, showed the best results in this cartoon. Since then, she has not been the same. Rob Paulsen also did something incredible here. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there were no bad episodes in the series. There were many. He also had a lot of mediocre. But, of course, there were many really funny episodes. Especially when it first went on the air, it was really fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Out of 10 I give the show 8.5 - and thanks for the fact that he opened the envelope and broke the doors leading to a new era of cartoons.
