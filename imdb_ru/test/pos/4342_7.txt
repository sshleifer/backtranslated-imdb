Paul Kersey from DEATH WISH 3 is very far from Paul Kercy from the original film. If you remember the film of 1974, remember that Kersi was “Cum” during the Korean War and that he was physically sick after he performed his first execution. Ten years later, Quercy seems to have learned hand-to-hand combat and how to use anti-tank weapons in his spare time. But I will lose sight of this, because DW3 is the best of the sequels, bags of scum with a low standard of living are shot, burned alive, teeth are broken, and housewives of middle age, armed with wide brushes, kill them. Yes, I know that gang members are multi-ethnic and for this they deserve some respect, but even if they are not racists, they still kill scum who deserve everything they get from Quercy and innocent citizens. Who needs Mayor Rudy when you have Paul Kersey, an anti-tank rocket and a bunch of old-age pensioners to win streets from criminal creeps. Paul Kersey, I salute you, sir.
