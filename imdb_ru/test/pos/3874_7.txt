"Back in the day" - an interesting, but erroneous effort. Ja Rule plays the role of Reggie Cooper, an honest but sad man trying to cope with the death of his father. He meets his old friend J-Bone (Ving Rhames), who is trying to get Reggie to commit a criminal life. Reggie also falls in love with Alik (Tatiana Ali), who is the preacher's daughter. Now he must choose: Love or Crime. <br /> <br /> Jah Rul does a competent job as Reggie. At least he is trying to act. Ving Rhames is perfect as a J-Bone. He brings a lot of energy and threats to the role. Joe Morton as a preacher is his usual excellent self, but he does little. The same problem for Giancarlo Esposito as Reggie's father. He needs more time to screen. I don't want to say this, but Pam Greer is pretty awful, like Mrs. Cooper. She replays each scene and makes a film. Tia Carrere and Frank Langella are involved in this, but they are not doing anything essential for the plot. <br /> <br /> At the end: you should see this for skillful performances by Vin Rames and Joe Morton and the rigidity of writing and directing.
