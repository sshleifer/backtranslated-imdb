In many ways, the perfect movie. The Incredible Journey and the story of Horatio Alger come together to make a positive turn on the usually depressing subject of existentialism. In essence, the sufferings of the dolls are reduced to the final song of the film: “Life is like a movie, write your end, keep believing, keep pretending”. They create their own reality, in which there are all the attributes of each epic tale: a lofty goal at the end of what is necessarily expensive with obstacles; a constantly growing group of like-minded partnerships; a hideous set of villains who do not go beyond redemption; and a big budget Hollywood finale because, damn it, they CAN. <br /> <br /> Only Jim Henson could handle this. He passes the line between sentimentality and philosophy, without delving too much into one of them. Of course, it seems strange that they put such weight in a movie with starring puppets, but in the end, perhaps they are the ideal puppet to make these glasses. The atmosphere of the film allows you to enjoy the Hollywood dream, the "happy" end, unnecessary cameos and burst into song in the blink of an eye. Usually these aspects are anathema to the quality in the film, but the self-deprecating way in which the story is presented makes it a no-blame preview. One of the few films that can rightly be called "suitable for all ages." <br /> <br /> Other mappet films (including “The Empire Strikes Back”), although pleasant to the taste, but not related to the simple grace of this film. Take, for example, the musical number “I hope that there is something better ahead,” a duo of Kermit and Rawle. It is funny in its reckless stupidity, but at the same time it makes the critical question about the motives of life choices. Brilliant.
