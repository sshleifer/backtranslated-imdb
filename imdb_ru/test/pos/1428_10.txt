I saw this mini-movie when it first aired, and I really enjoyed it! It was fun to see how far people would go for the money. It's also fun to see how many guys you can beat. "Whipped" is enough to kill. I think the cast was great, especially the character Christine. Without her smooth conversation and deceiving looks, the film would not be the same. <br /> <br /> I never watched the USA, but now this is one of my stations. <br /> <br />
