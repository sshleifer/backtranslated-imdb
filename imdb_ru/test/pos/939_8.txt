A brilliant Australian film ... At first a little slow, but as soon as it starts, you will not stop laughing. When I first saw the film, I vaguely knew the storyline, since Iâ€™m not sure that many people know that this film is based on a true story, and especially the director and his mother (obviously, the names have been changed). I only knew about this because the director is each other of my family. When I watched the movie, my stepmother somehow hid that we should meet Matthew Newton after the show ... Such a good gentleman (except for a particularly unpleasant incident with his ex)! Brilliant casting, as well as with Sam Neill and others! A great reason to keep supporting the Australian film industry.
