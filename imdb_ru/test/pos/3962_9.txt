This is a fun, smart movie that is worth your time. In my opinion, this is much better than American Pie and other films of the same genre, which seem to be constantly unsettling. I have not heard of this film, so I think he did not get much press, which is a kind of disgrace. It does not take itself too seriously, but at the same time delivers a serious message to people about life and life experience, and also about what is important ... Unlike the film about a group of desperate guys trying to be fired for the first time and one dude shoved your d ** k in the cake, but in the end, everyone was put on the street and fell ... One thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome, and not the usual crappy American pop punk. .. They actually had a real punk in those days, like the Ramones ... Itâ€™s by itself made the movie better! Honestly, I did not expect much from this film and was pleasantly surprised how good this comedy is.
