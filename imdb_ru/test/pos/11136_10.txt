I have seen and enjoyed all the films about Chameleon, and I must say that with each of them they are getting better and better. Bobby Phillips - Fantastic, and my granddaughter wants to be the same as she. I'm glad they brought the character "Brother" to Bobby (Kam), so we can expect more exciting shows. Bobby is beautiful, sexy, sweet and independent, and all that any woman can wish for!
