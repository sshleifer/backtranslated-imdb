I like this movie. I'm not a big fan of horror films, so I can't comment on the similarities between this and other films of this genre, but I found this film quite exciting. The storyline, although a bit obvious, had some really scary / tense moments, and in any case, the acting (especially in the lead role) was not bad. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm a little surprised at the low rating this film received. I watch a lot of movies (working in a video store has a tendency to help), and this is really not as bad as people think. I have some criticism though. The last call from the policeman was awful, almost overzealous, the dead girl in the bathroom looked like she was sleeping a little (probably because of the amount of tequila that she said she drank), and the reaction of the children to what was happening led me to hope that eventually they were killed <br /> <br /> hope this helps some people
