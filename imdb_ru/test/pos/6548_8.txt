Having opened the “Ring” trilogy, I greedily devoured all those other Japanese and Korean films that either go or follow the movement. <br /> <br /> I don’t have a simple definition of horror, but of course this film pushed some of my buttons, although I cannot say that the film makes a lot of sense. I am squeamish, so there were several moments in the film when I simply did not want to watch what was happening on the screen. The film upset me, and I began to fear seeing what I thought I was going to see. <br /> <br /> This is a creative film offering excellent visual effects. It also gives food for thought. And a lot of stuff to argue about when the film ends. <br /> <br /> Characters are clearly defined, to say the least. Can they shoot such films in the West? <br /> <br /> In the end, it does not make sense, but when a person has an appetite for the occult, supernatural, bizarre, otherworldly, then no Film will bring the final, all explaining payback.
