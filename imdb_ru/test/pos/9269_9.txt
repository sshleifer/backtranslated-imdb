I entered The Closer She Getts, knowing that it was the story of the mother of the director fighting cancer. I expected this to be a very heartbreaking movie. And although the subject is certainly emotionally agonizing, positive information is noteworthy in this film. This shows the full commitment of the family to solving the problem of cancer together. They refuse to lose faith in each other, even in the darkest moments. <br /> <br /> The most touching moments for me are when this belief opens. The small comments that mother and family make to each other, which reveal her (and their) will to survive, and their defiant emphasis on love and family unity. So this is an inspirational and encouraging film. We should all be so lucky that in such a serious illness we are surrounded by such a family.
