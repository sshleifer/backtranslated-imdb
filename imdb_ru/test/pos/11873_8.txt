I must admit, I liked this film, and I did not find him a woman hater. It can be subtitles, three ways to look at Tyler LiV. Three different men become possessed by the same woman and tell their stories to very different characters; one man (John Goodman) tells his story to a priest (very funny Richard Jenkins). For the character Goodmans, the character Liv Tyler is idealized by the saint, the second coming of his saint wife, Teresa. For Paul Rieser's character (who tells the story of an unbalanced (beautiful, understated presentation of the great Reba McIntyre), Liv Tyler's character is just an object of (strange) sexual fantasy. Finally Matt Dillons, a rather vague character, tells his own side of the story to a sloppy killer played by Michelle Douglas All three of these stories of obsession are told at the same time, and they are all funny. I will not give it up.
