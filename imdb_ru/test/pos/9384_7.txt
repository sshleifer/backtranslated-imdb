Among other things, the big bed, possessed by a demon, eats people. I do not invent it. <br /> <br /> Completed in 1977 and not officially released until it was released on DVD in 2003, “Death Bed: The Bed That Eats” is a film whose story is impossible to describe. Most likely, you are aware of this because of Patton Oswalt's excellent role, as well as Stephen Trowers’s important book The Nightmare USA. While watching, you ask yourself: <br /> <br /> - Who is George Berry and what kind of drugs did he smoke / inject / smell before writing and making this film? <br /> <br /> - Is it a horror comedy? The combination of a horror movie and a feature film? A strange joke that the audience is chasing? <br /> <br /> - What the hell am I looking at? <br /> <br /> “Death bed” really defies any explanation. I know that this term is used too often, but it can not be more truthful than here. This is a truly indescribable description. This is a horror comedy, as well as a feature film / horror hybrid. But all this is so surreal, it must be seen. The score sounds like electronic fragments from the old Candlemass album, the game is terrible and comes off from everything, the direction is surprisingly competent, and the film sometimes resembles the film of Jesus Franco, that is, if his films were deliberately funny. <br /> <br /> In the end, there really is no way to describe this film. The Lord knows that I have tried, but in reality, several films are so strange, unique or unbelievable, like this. See it ... but you were warned. This is also the only film that George Berry has ever made. By this he definitely left his mark in the genre of exploitation, I will tell you very much.
