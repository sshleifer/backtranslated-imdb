About as funny as the British comedy of the 50s, BELLES OF ST TRINIAN'S almost shut up ... and at the 91 minute make an amazing time. Other films that I equally recommend from the same period are Titfield Thunderbolt and Green Man. In fact, any film with Alistair Sim or Terry Thomas, George Cole, Richard Wattis or Joyce Grenfell, or any combination thereof, is a delight. in ST TRINIAN'S, we get a double dose of Sims playing two roles with this cheerful scorn, which he constantly gives to the wavy excitement on his face. Joyce Grenfell as Ruby Gates (oh God, that is the name!) Plays his constable "funny hockey sticks" - incognito to cheerful perfection. Perhaps the best laugh comes from George Cole as Flash Harry (who emerges from the bush when he is whistled) and Miss Fritton's (Sims) various visits to the explosions (“Oh, poor Betty!”) labs (“Just send a few bottles of this to my room.” ”Each part of the film is funny about the characters, their costumes, pranks and scenery. There were sequels, but the first three were the best: including this, BLUE MURDER AT HOLY TRINYAN, and then in color GREAT HOSPITAL TREATMENT OF THE HOLY RINYANA.
