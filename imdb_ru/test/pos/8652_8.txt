A very interesting addition to the Scandinavian surrealistic collection. Recommended for viewing by those who like their complex films. My interpretation of the “strange” ending will be that Andreas’s journey ends in hell. He does not like the empty purgatory of purgatory under the direction of the consumer; something like "alive", but not progressing, that is, it is not going anywhere - even the city’s metro stations do not stop at stations. He has a metro system, as if you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never take these trains. He can not reach the fragrant, sensual paradise and eventually continues his bus route to the final destination. The old Scandinavian version of Hell (Hades, NOT Hell, earthly city) does not burn like the British version, its cold, frozen land Niflheim (the land of cold and fog) It seems that it was in this that Andreas could not access Heaven through that tunnel.
