I found West Point a pleasant movie, although I doubt that I will watch it again. The performances were convincing, with William Haines as with another unpleasantly funny young man, whose revival by the end of the film. It is hard to believe that fame beckoned Joan Crawford less than a year after this film was shot, as sometimes it looks rather awkward. <br /> <br /> I would also apply to this film a comment by another author concerning Huddle by Ramón Novarro (1932). There is a big film here waiting to be shot, but something is missing. Backgrounds and Corps integration were well utilized, but I was less involved than I thought I would be. Perhaps the character Haynes went too far or got away with it. His "repentance" did not seem sincere enough; and what message did he send him to launch each game in the last minutes of the army-navy game? Where in this "case"? You could also kill the other ten people and let him do it all himself. In addition, I very much doubt that the weak, small character of William Bakewell will ever have a real colleague at West Point. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the film is sometimes very exciting and inspiring. This is an excellent look at the daily practice of a reputable institution. Thank God that tradition still means something at West Point, in contrast to the empty "traditions" of Ivy League schools, which today are only half-heartedly engaged. <br /> <br /> Regarding the assessment: she was belligerent. But there was a clear overuse of snare. Using them to knock on the door, transitions between scenes, etc., and also in more than half of the scenes should be quite tedious. It rather reduced the viewing experience. I was ready to say: "I already got the point." <br /> <br /> With this, enjoy the movie, but don’t expect too much emotional involvement.
