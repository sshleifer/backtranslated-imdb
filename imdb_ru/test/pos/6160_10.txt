Nothing but great photography / cinematography in this movie. The fact that you continue to search for and hope for more flights indicates that there are enough of them. The game is fantastic, the stories are smoothly woven, and the dogs are great ............... <br /> <br /> You need to rent, watch or watch. <Br /> <br /> Don't be afraid of subtitles ........ <br /> <br /> worth a bit of disgust <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br>
