I like it. Others showed spoilers, but I will not. It was an unusual premise, actually some kind of strange, but I completely agreed with her. Camille was hard to convince convincingly; maybe that's why some people hated it. But I think that Sienna was excellent, and her acting skills allowed her to play a great role â€” without being deceived or funny. I do not know why she even became interested in a loser, like James Franco, but she still married him. I love him as an actor, and also thought he did an amazing job. He has nothing to be ashamed of. There were films with similar settings, for example, "Ghost". I just love Sienna Miller and agreed with the situation as written in the script. I feel that her great acting talent is greatly undervalued, and I hope that the audience will become more recognizable. I thought all the actors played their roles very well, and I hope that more people will see the film. I highly recommend it. I was surprised that about 10 copies were available at my local Block Buster store. I definitely plan to buy it.
