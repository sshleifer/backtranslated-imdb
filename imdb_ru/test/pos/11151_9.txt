From a simple description of the main elements of the plot of THE TOLL GATE, you might think that this is a revisionist western of the 60s or 70s. <br /> <br /> * Our hero is a robber, a murderer and arsonist; <br /> <br /> * love interest is a single mother whose husband left her and her child without a change; <br /> <br /> * Twice our criminal hero is “unofficially” released by the authorities in exchange for some good deed, and this is presented as a laudable act; <br /> <br /> * the only acts that are truly evil are the betrayal of his family and the betrayal of the criminal; <br /> <br /> * the hero tries to go straight, but returns to the criminal life after he cannot get a job; <br /> <br /> * the hero is on the run from both the sheriff and the criminal gang; <br /> <br /> * The hero's final atonement is achieved by strangling a person with his bare hands and throwing his body on a cliff; <br /> <br /> * and the “good bad man” finishes the film, sending the young mother and her child back to civilization and leaving alone in the Mexican desert, never (supposedly) to pay for their criminal life. <br /> <br /> I just want to show you that there is nothing new under the sun. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Gate is not exactly the cynicism or moral nihilism of its successors: the hero’s redemption comes when he surrenders to the detachment after reading a Bible passage. I can't imagine Clint Eastwood doing this. <br /> <br /> THE TOLL GATE is an excellent movie by any measure, and Hart was a very good actor, not taking into account the wide history often used to convey emotions in times before the sound. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
