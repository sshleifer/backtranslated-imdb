There must have been some interesting conversations on the set of Wing of the Eagle, with Martin Sheen, shot immediately after Apocalypse, with the actor he replaced in the film Coppola, Harvey Keitel. This film’s unloved child, dated by the last major series of westerns in 1979–80, was greatly offended at the time when it was filmed by a British studio and director (conveniently ignoring the fact that many classic American westerns were directed by European immigrants), looks like an overreaction. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is simple, because inexperienced catcher Martin Sheen discovers that he fights with Kayowa Sam Waterston, a non-syllabic warrior, for possession of a beautiful white horse, Eagle Wing, through a harsh and primitive landscape for a time “before the legends began. In addition to the captive Irish governess Caroline Langrish, the cast doesn’t have anything in common (Stefan Audran can't even open his mouth), and he's a little slow, but Anthony Harvey’s movie boasts an amazing Scope photo by Billy Williams and Mark Wilkinson's good result.
