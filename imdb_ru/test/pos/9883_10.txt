This film presents expensive irony, storylines about shaggy dogs, woven with subtle cultural landmarks, classical parallels, masterful use of rich saturated color and an incredible performance of scenes of a chase a la Keystone Cops. <br /> <br /> Ensemble work of the cast and the entire “Charming” film crew. Literally. How else could I go further? <br /> <br /> This film speaks to everyone. Skillful and perceptive use of many universal archetypes: this is what makes this film so deep, satisfying. <br /> <br /> As a mature student of film, I believe that Checking Out contains all the vital elements. Of course, and Bergorra, it is not the DIVINE, but it will perfectly serve as a follow-up action; The obligatory play "Tragedy" "Satir", which sweetly binds our collective cathartic wounds. <br /> <br /> Go to the theater and watch this film, and you will find a unique masterpiece.
