That's what I thought when I heard about the cast of Inglorious bastards. And I'm from both Germany and the movies. <br /> <br /> This guy is over 50 years old, and until now he almost played only on mediocre TV shows - and even there he didnâ€™t play leading roles. Obviously, no one ever noticed what he was capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he got one chance to change it - and - let's say - it was bingo! He is living proof that the great exorcist Tarrantino. <br /> <br /> By the way, I think it is an honor to watch a film in German - to be able to understand everything. And the German dialogue is written almost as well as English. <br /> <br /> Now I can repeat what many others have written here before. I will briefly say: finally, QT is back.
