If you can watch a Bond film in 1983, which is not as good as Octopussy, and still enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If you can accept production values ​​that are not much higher than the level of a television movie. <br /> <br /> If you can look at Sean Connery with the wrinkles on his forehead under an obvious wig and still see James Bond. <br /> <br /> If you can get past the inexperienced Basinger, a weaker Largo and a fun question. <br /> <br /> If you can learn to love a kind of musical score, don’t worry with Barry on his worst day. <br /> <br /> If you don’t believe in hyperbolic reviews, this was greeted on release. <br /> <br /> If you can meet in a poker battle and in a video game, you can fight and enjoy them equally. <br /> <br /> With you never say never and everything that is in it. <br /> <br /> Moreover, you will probably like it, my son!
