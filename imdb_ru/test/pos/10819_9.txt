First a word of caution. The DVD box describes this movie as a comedy. I do not think that this was the goal of anyone associated with the film, except for some marketing morons. Although it is light and a little funny in places, this is NOT a comedy, and if you expect you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I have never even heard of this film and had absolutely no expectations in either direction or the other. Considering that the other two DVDs I took were big disappointments, I was so happy when I saw this movie. Acting, writing and directing were excellent. The story itself has definitely interested me, since you usually do not watch films about the last month of France before the Nazis captured in 1940. She gave some insight into the parasites that so quickly gave up and agreed to share their favorite country. Along the way there are scenes with the participation of a selfish and weak actress, which Isabelle Adjani played very well, which looks amazing after all these years. She kills the former lover, and then finds a bad juice to take the fall. This juice escapes from prison and finds her - along with another lover - a high-ranking government official and affection played by Gerard Depardieu. In addition, a story is introduced about how a Jewish physicist is trying to take deuterium out of the country, and as a result it becomes the main plot. The plot has a lot of nice turns, a slight sense of humor (not trying to be a comedy) and some genuinely disturbing moments. Together they create good packaging, which is sure to please.
