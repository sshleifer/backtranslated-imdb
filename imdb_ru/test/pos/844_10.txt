I liked this show. I think that the first time I tried ice cream on a rocky road was connected with this show. Wasnâ€™t the store located right on the beach or something? I actually corresponded with Marcy for several years. I have lost contact and would like me to be able to reunite now as adults. Does anyone know where she is now? I would like them to release it on DVD. I seriously doubt that, as I think it can be, like five or six people who even remember how the show is on the air in the first place. They just don't do these shows anymore, do they? I wonder if it will survive in our time? Do you guys know anyone who could burn a DVD of the show they recorded on VHS? I would be willing to pay (within reason).
