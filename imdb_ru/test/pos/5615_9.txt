I really liked this movie, and I'm not a fan of classical music. The story of how a cool street kid discovered classical music and changed his image was great to watch without being sentimental or too incredible, although some details made me scratch my head (Frankie and his dog can live in the basement of the school without any or the teachers who discovered him? Where did he eat? Bathed? Did he ever get a change of clothes? How did he feed the dog? The school owner did not think it was important to notify the police that he found the missing person. live in the basement forever? :-)). But we can allow such unrealistic details to slide and simply enjoy a touching, fun and a little disturbing (for me, anyway) story and amazingly talented children. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene with the mothers standing shoulder to shoulder. on the steps that forbid the police to enter the school: I doubt that they can get away with it in our time. And I liked the nice touch about the boy Frankie stole when he turned the tables on him (although in fact it did not disappear), and how Frankie's friends helped him in the end. <br /> <br /> In general, great movie for everyone!
