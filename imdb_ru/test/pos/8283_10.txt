It was one of the best movies you could ever find. I lived with Chipmunk Adventure from 4 to 8 years. The story of this film was: Dave goes on a business trip to Europe and connects the boys with Miss Miller. Playing the “Around the World in 80 Days” video game, two villains, Klaus and Claudia (brother and sister), go round the Chipmunks and Chipett in an adventure in which children must fly through the air across the globe. What they do not know is that the "game" is really a diamond smuggling ring. And when the villains found him at the airport, the chase began! And what ends up is that Klaus and Claudia are sent to prison, and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Janette and Eleanor are safe with Dave and Miss Miller. But I warn you now, this is a musical, and damn good. Most people hate musicals, but I'm not one of those people, I damn like musicals like Rocky Horror, Fat, Sounds of Music, Cats Don't Dance, and almost everything (except my beautiful lady). If you see this, share with your children (if you have one)!
