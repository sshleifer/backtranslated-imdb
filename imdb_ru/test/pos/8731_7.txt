I was very surprised to learn that Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for this film. She seemed very lifeless and fully trained 54 (!) Summer Bergman in the scenes where they are near. If it had been written today, I think that Bergman and young man Ivan would be together (Ingrid is much hotter than Goldie ...), and the two self-taught characters that Mattau and Hawn played would have remained cold. But it was written in the late 60s and resembles the Plaza Suite or Barefoot in the Park. However, Mattau's one-liners, Houn's innocence and Bergman's cool performance make it quite enjoyable to watch.
