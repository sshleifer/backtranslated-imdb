Incredibly stupid anime, just six episodes, about the unfortunate courier named Kintaro (well, he is called a courier, although he should be over twenty), and about the adventures he makes in his travels. In each episode, he arrives at a new city, acquires a new job, develops something of love interest, before each episode ends with his departure. <br /> <br /> Gently sexist, minor, sometimes very immature, this is the anime that simply brings a smile to your face. <br /> <br /> Not for the beginning, if you are not an anime fan, as it certainly will not convince you of the genre, but for those who have already been reequipped, this is an entertaining fluff.
