I am not in a reality show so much, but this one is exceptional because at the end the viewer gets something useful besides entertainment. I have no children, but SuperNanny lessons will be very useful when (and if) I ever do! My only complaint is that the show was relaxed, as it was in the USA. I prefer the British version, with a more strict babysitting approach. Is it just me or someone else who thinks the American version is a bit soft ... now this is a "kinder, gentler" nanny? I think we, the Yankees, need a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine in the end? However, there is nothing wrong with a happy ending, is there?
