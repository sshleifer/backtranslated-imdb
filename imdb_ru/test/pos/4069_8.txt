I read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb, and many seem to miss the mark. I noticed that many reviewers call this film a typical "buddy." De Niro is by no means a friend of Murphy for most of this film. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anyone. <br /> <br /> Murphy really shines in this. He came back to do what he does best, acting like a full ham. He is a policeman who wants to become an actor so much and he likes being in a reality show. De Niro is beautiful like a straight man who thinks that all this is stupid. I thought both of them had excellent chemistry and they were the perfect choice for casting. Rene Russo is also great as a TV producer. Of course, she likes everything that Murphy does, and he struggles (along with Murphy) makes DeNiro work too. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers touched on a funny scene with William Shatner, repeating their role in the role of TJ Hooker, teaching Murkhpi and De Niro how to “act like” the police. But my favorite scene involves Murphy in the "confessional", hoping that he can get the cop Wesley Snipes-like instead of De Niro. Man, that was fun! Comedies often depend on your personal tastes. Of course, you can make holes in the plot, most often with comedy. I was excited when I saw that Murphy and De Niro were mating ... I think Murphy had the best, and it was nice to see him again at the top of his game. I can only imagine that it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rated 8 out of 10 stars.
