German freshman Stefan Hitch travels around Paris during the summer holidays, where he falls in love with a mysterious young woman whom she meets on an ugly Parisian scene. He then follows her on the famous island of Ibiza, where hippies meet Wolf, the man who throws the knives of Hitler-Jugend, owns bars and hotels and holds Estelle under his thumb with drugs. The couple is trying to escape from the Wolf, Stefan is keen on doping and jealousy for Estelle, who is excellent and free. Excellent photography and music, the plot is pretty ordinary for that period, but it is not an exploitative film, cool and dramatic. The moral is pretty strong (he was looking for the sun ...), but I wouldnâ€™t say that this is a film against drugs, even if it inspires enthusiasm for drug use.
