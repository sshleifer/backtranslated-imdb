I have already seen this movie twice by cable. The first time I saw this, he took me by surprise. The skaters I saw were the guys we followed in the pages of Skateboarder magazine back in the late 70s. These were the guys we copied and tried to become while riding. I am glad that the film was finally shot, which gives an accurate idea of ​​how it all happened. I am almost 40 years old now, and I think a rather excited guy with all the problems of life; This film did a great job to get me back. Return to empty pools, halfpipes in the backyard and trips to Cherry Hill, New Jersey. I suspect that in order to truly understand this film and appreciate it, it was necessary to live it. Otherwise, it probably will not affect you as I do. But for those of you (and you know who you are) who lived by it, you know exactly what I'm talking about! In any case, I don't care who you are, if you have the opportunity to watch this movie ... do it! I thank Z-Boys of Dogtown for the memories of my youth and thank Stacy for making this movie! WORK WELL MADE!
