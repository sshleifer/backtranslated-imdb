This is a film about which people of a certain age will say: "I did not think that they had already made such films." Walter Mattau shows off his usual awesome features, but instead of leaving teeth marks all over the landscape, there are wonderful grease stains. He looks like that great uncle we all know, who still wears a polyester blanket and confuses everyone, but we still love him. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon’s play reminds us why he received more Golden Globe nominations than anyone else (22). He gives a realistic idea of ​​a “good, ordinary person” even in farcical conditions. <br /> <br /> This film probably will not please people who prefer blunt humor, designed to resist or offend, but people who value a wide farce, played with an imperturbable face, will like it. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is excellent in its ability to play such absurd characters, while preserving the reality of each character. <br /> <br /> Brent Spiner is a great professional version of the lounge. Anyone who knew professional hosts in real life would immediately recognize the type he was playing. It is perfect for this type. His idea of ​​"mucus" is worth exploring as an excellent example of the contrast between the absurd and the pitiful. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly straightforward, the theme of "let's get married", which has the usual results. The fact that the plot theme was made a thousand times does not mean that it is outdated, but means that it is an eternal theme. <br /> <br /> The rest of the support team shows what can happen when professionals demonstrate their skills in the roles that are written for them, instead of fighting for the spotlight. In this film, even second-tier actors shine. It is also obvious that they liked to star in this film. <br /> <br /> The plot can be standard and subtle, but it allows performers to shine. <br /> <br /> This film is a real pleasure for people who want to see professional actors doing their craft. The plot falls off and the performers shine.
