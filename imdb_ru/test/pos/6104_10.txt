The essence of the film, IMO, is that Joanna’s whole life was nothing more than a series of facades. The film opens with the fact that it secretly dies with its gray roots and hides the used set in an empty tissue box. The strange thing is that she hides it from her husband. If she needs to hide worldly things from her beloved person, you can argue that she is hiding more great things from others involved in her life. <br /> <br /> When Joanna accidentally hits Corey, she leaves the scene to call the police. By the time she returns, the police and the ambulance are already there, as well as people from her community, noting: “What kind of person beats the child, and then just leaves her there?” what did But she did not understand how difficult it would be to support her facades ... <br /> <br /> Great movie - I have seen it many times!
