A group of disgusting teenagers goes to the former funeral home for a Halloween party. They fall into the trap inside and become possessed by the demons they accidentally wake up. Obsessed teens start killing others and seem to be led by Angela (Mimi Kincaid), who swims and speaks in a very deep voice. The rest of the teenagers who are not yet obsessed, are forced to fend off demons and try to run away from home. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty decent horror film with great special effects, including Linnae Quigley (who has a couple of naked scenes, as usual), knocking out the guy's eye and inserting a tube of lipstick into her nipple. There is also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin, and the guy bites his tongue. This is a great movie that you can watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating pizza. Although the terrible acting and brutal dialogue almost destroys it. Overall, I would give 7 out of 10.
