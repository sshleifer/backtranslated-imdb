I saw it at the BendFilm festival on Friday against the background of an indecisive crowd of people who were not helped by the bad decision of the event planners, who chose a completely inappropriate short film before the film. And it really shocked the audience when “Modern Love” came out after a light, bizarre short performance (a name I forgot). <br /> <br /> People !!! It was really stupid to mix this short film with "Modern Love" - ​​a serious dramatic film. Film movie <br /> <br /> Spectators get a teaser, which is a comedy, and then ... Modern love. Hmmm “Modern Love”, despite my doubts (strange ending, a bit too tangent), needed a short film commensurate with strange weirdness, so my advice to programmers for the next year is to take more care of planning the show. <br /> The people who watched “Modern Love” didn’t really know what hit them, they were on the way, and it wasn’t their fault. <br /> <br /> Modern Love has great performances that play well. contrary to the tangential convolutions of the film - the film, which its creator, it seems, “surprised out loud”, but did not execute the usual script and made the film. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the public was misinformed. Incorrect placement of sessions, incorrect short film, wrong approach from the good intentions of programmers who, despite their best efforts, need to watch a lot more movies and go to some other festivals.
