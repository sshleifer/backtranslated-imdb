Well, let me start by saying that in general I don’t really like anime. I liked a couple of the often-quoted “classic” episodes, but I view the environment as a whole just like I do American television: namely, that a good 90-95% of them are complete nonsense, with the rest falling somewhere from watchable "To" decent ". In this case, it is not surprising that I do not like self-deprecating parodies of anime. I do not understand most of the jokes, and the environment itself imposes a certain style of humor, which I don’t like at all - loud, hyperactive, low-grade and completely incomparable. <br /> <br /> So when I started watching this show at the behest of a friend, I was disappointed after the first few episodes. I thought that the characters had to represent the clichés of the characters from the outline of the store's outlines, and that their actions should have been just as satirical. I could see where it came from, but I didn’t think that everything was so clever - there are a lot of “silly, funny machinations and continuations of secondary school, only now we are ironic about this.” Approximately in the third episode my opinion changed dramatically. <br /> <br /> It was at this moment that the strengths of this series began to emerge. The oddities of the non-chronological order of episodes, his strange sense of self-awareness and, above all, intelligent humor with a (gasping) well-executed straight man. <br /> <br /> In what I consider a rarity in any environment, this show represents well-designed, witty interactions between diametrically opposed characters. The constant feeling of the vaguely irritated resignation of the protagonist Kayon provides an ideal mark for the actions of the "anime-like" feats of the protagonist Haruhi. This is a break with the formula, and it works incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Based on this solid foundation, the series succeeds with a truly phenomenal level of attention to detail. As mentioned earlier, the episodes of the ether came out of chronological order. At first I thought it was a trick, but it works surprisingly well. The chronological sequence of events is logical, but the ethereal order of episodes more closely follows the traditional structure of the Aristotelian drama. The chosen order does not leave gaps in the narration that cannot be filled with a simple conclusion (but although you can guess what happened in the incomplete “previous” episode, everyone still feels the need to observe how these events unfold), and excellent planning prevents conspiracies or contradictions. I watched this series a second time right after its completion for the first time, and I was amazed at how well even seemingly irrelevant events were related to each other. <br /> <br /> The last point indicates extreme attention to detail in each area of ​​the series. While the “anime” design of the characters slightly attracts, the background image is elegant, realistically presented based on real photographic links. The quality of the animation is also excellent in the important points. For example, at the end of the series there is a musical performance in which the characters are actually playing a song - this may sound trivial, but the subconscious effect of watching (cinematic) animation that actually corresponds to the soundtrack is incredible. br /> <br /> In short, for some reason I love this series. By nature, this is something that I don’t like at all, but its performance is so unique and well executed that I can’t do anything.
