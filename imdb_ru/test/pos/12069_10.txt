“War at Home” is so good that it has become my new favorite show. Me and my neighbors Carly and April watch it together every Sunday and laugh at how true it is for life. I like that everyone is so sarcastic and so worried, and they live on every little problem. When someone does something stupid, he never experiences it, and it is as good as family. The father always talks about all three children about every little thing. I like that parents have no idea how to deal with children. This is so true for real family life and the fact that parents are so stunned and have no idea how to solve the problems of their teens simply put the show on the first place. War at home is so cruel and honest, and so true to the world in which we live. live in that it became a milestone for comedy performances. These are not Happy Days or Brady Bunch, this is real life.
