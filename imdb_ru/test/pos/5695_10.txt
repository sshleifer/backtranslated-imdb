BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely overcome its limitations (this is an indie click), constantly undermining the expectations of becoming an intense experience. <br /> <br /> In the tradition of all good animal-oriented thrillers, such as Jaws, Edge, the original Cat People, directors know that restraint and what is not shown is the best way to strike. The performances are real and exciting, the crocodile is very well made, in fact, according to the Black Water website, this is because they used real crocodiles, and the location of the swamp is fabulous. <br /> <br /> If you’re after B-Grae Gore Fest Croc Romp, forget the Black Water, but if you want a smart, stressful trip that will make you afraid of water and wonder what the hell I’ll do if I climb this tree, then it must be seen.
