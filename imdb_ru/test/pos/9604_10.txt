As you can see, I posted 2 comments on this show since 1991 ... and no, ITV has not yet made it available for general release. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, I recently contacted ITV to find out if there was any way to get a copy, and that was their answer ....... <br /> <br /> "Sorry , there are no plans to release this program on DVD / video. You can, however, buy copies from our viewers' request section. Their email address is: viewers.requests@itv.com. " <br /> <br /> I hope you all have the chance to enjoy this classic short comedy again. <br /> <br />
