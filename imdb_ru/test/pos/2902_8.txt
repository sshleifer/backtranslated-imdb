I saw this film back in 1954 on a double count with The Valley of Kings. These films helped spark a lifelong interest in Egyptology. (I visited Egypt in 1975!) Today, the Egyptian suffers from a flat dialogue and a few clumsy touches, but watching this film is great - this kind of thing Hollywood, alas, simply does not do anymore - and it has a wonderful story Itâ€™s not just the usual story "a boy meets a girl" or "Revenge is mine." It is a pity that the 20th will not reissue the recovered prints of it to be seen on the Big Screen.
