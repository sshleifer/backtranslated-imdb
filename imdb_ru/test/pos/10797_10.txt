In one of the most underrated films of the late 1980s, when Oliver Stone cocked with a platoon and Wall Street (and to his Born on the Fourth of July), he wrote the script and directed this view of the radio world, especially one radio host in downtown texas. This man - Barry Champlain, one of the best in his career from Eric Bogosyan, who wrote the original play, and also co-wrote the script. Barry is like a mix of Howard Stern and one of those wise men you hear on radio stations that many of us can turn off. He has ideas and opinions on his mind, and he is not only not afraid to express them, but also to resist callers. Callers are, indeed, the driving force in the film, as Barry must fight against the insane, obscene, racist and purely dispersed. As this continues, he also has to fight his boss (Alec Baldwin) and agree on a hit or miss all over the country, outside the southern station where he is located. <br /> <br /> Although after watching the film I was curious to see how it was done on stage (I imagine that it was a one-person show, since Bogosyan had some on the side), the direction of the movie is phenomenal. Stone, an almost typical director, is known as a director who loves fast shots, limitless editing effects and effects with camera work styles and other small tricks that give his films in the 90s a distinctive, almost author's look. But in the 80s he possessed this energy and hectic quality for the appearance of the film, and was not as mad as other films. To add the right intensity that is present in the studio and in Barry Champlain's head, he and DP Robert Richardson make the space seem claustrophobic from time to time, gritty, unsure and definitely on edge. The scenes in the middle of the film, when Barry is not in the studio, are pretty standard, but the style and content of the radio scripts are some of the best I've seen in the Stone / Richardson combination. /> <br /> And it is impossible to calculate the performance of Bogosyan, who can be disgusting, offensive, indignant, passive and all that we love and hate in the leading radio shows. There is also a funny, almost distracting support role for Michael Wincott as Kent / Michael / Joe, who jokes, calls him one night, and the next one is invited to the studio. These scenes are a little inconvenient for the viewer, but they penetrate very strongly into the space of the 80s subculture, which Barry was intrigued by as much as he was critical. Stoner may not “get it,” but, as he tells him, “this is your show.” Indeed, it is difficult to embrace everything that happens in a conversation, and there is a lot of it. But it is never boring, and, like Champlain himself, it is not easy to ignore. And when Bogosian goes to his climatic tirade in the air, when the background revolves around in a continuous rotation of 360 degrees, he becomes intoxicating, and the reason why freedom of speech is so powerful. <br /> <br /> Stone was a synonym for the cinematographer of hot-button problems, who takes on themes that were or are still controversial and gives them vitality, which is not always great, but is its property. Here, his skills and ambitions do not interfere with Bogosyan - he is strengthened, at least by forming an extremely skillful vision of what is essentially a one-person show, which is already well written in itself.
