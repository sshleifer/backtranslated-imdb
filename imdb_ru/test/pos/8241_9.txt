Really good Australian movie. Perfectly recreates the look of Sydney in the 1950s. This film made a strong impression on me when I first saw it during its first release into the cinema, and it still works very well. Phil Noysse's excellent directorial work, excellent camera work, thoughtful lighting, and some excellent performances in all directions. Absolutely "Must See" for any student of Australian cinema of the 70s.
