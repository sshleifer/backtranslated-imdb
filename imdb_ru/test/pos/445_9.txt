This film works on different levels. This is a profile of one very cool couple, a social commentary about nursing homes and elderly, a love story, a musical. I have seen Uncle Frank several times, and every time I watch him, I’m not sure who to call first — my parents, my wife, a friend, with whom I have lost contact. But he has a way to make you remember the most important relationships in your life — and want to confirm the ones that are going on. Expect a lot of laughter, and perhaps some tears, if any of the bright characters play here. I am sure they will.
