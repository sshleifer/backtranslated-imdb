How can you love and not love the same movie? <br /> <br /> The plot is very similar to the film Jodie Foster, Sommersby, just not so good. Nicole was great .... Jude was adequate. They did not give him many lines ... is there a reason for this? In general, he is a pretty good actor. She is so elegant, his character is so rustic. It makes you think about what they see in each other. <br /> <br /> Romance between these two was only successful in Lady Chatterley's Lover. <br /> <br /> I think dislike arises from the fact that the film is too long. They could tell a story in two hours. <br /> <br /> The story is good. Good places, good shooting. Character actors were great.
