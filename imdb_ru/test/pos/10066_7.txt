Madonna begins to act again, and she fails again! Who's that girl was released just a year after the huge failure of the Shangai Surprise and two after the successful cult film “Desperately Looking for Susan.” She decided to play it in order to forget the failure of the previous film, not suspecting that this last one could also be a failure. The film received poor recognition from American critics and viewers, while in Europe it was a success. Madonna states that "Some people do not want her to be successful as a pop star and a movie star." The soundtrack album, in which she sings four tracks, sells well, and the single with the title track was very popular around the world, like the World Tour. The truth is that Madonna failed as an actress because the script was pretty weak. But this is not so bad, especially for those who love the 80s: this is such a shabby, trash, colorful and cheerful action movie! In the end it is very funny to watch.
