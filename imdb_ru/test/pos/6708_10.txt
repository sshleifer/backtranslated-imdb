Certainly one of the best science fiction movies. However, to understand the concept of the film, we need different views in order to evaluate not only the special effect, but also the main plot of the film itself. According to my own feelings, this film received such bad reviews, because no one took the time to watch the film as it was supposed to. There are moments that you would like to hurry and pass by, but they are rare. Hooper, who led TKM 1 and 2 along with a remake of "Invaders from Mars", and "The Funhouse" does its best work here. Excellent score, good acting and great effects make this movie an addition to your collection, if you have the opportunity to see the widescreen version on DVD, we highly recommend everyone who is a fan of science fiction.
