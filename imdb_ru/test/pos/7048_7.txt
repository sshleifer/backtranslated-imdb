If you take the film for the fact that it is worth it, you will not be disappointed. If you think that Murray should win an Oscar for his performance, and this is exactly the movie you expect, do not worry. It was funny when I saw him in 1979 and did not lose my charm. Good clean entertainment for children and pointless entertainment for the elderly. The storyline is simple and straightforward. Murray did better, but this is his first film. The film reminds me of a time when we didnâ€™t have to be entertained with blood and guts. Morty - the main uncle and plays a great role. Other advisors are typical horny teens who want to have fun in the summer. One good thing about this movie, it has a message.
