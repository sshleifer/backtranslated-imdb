As if in a circle, the film returns us to the starting point, the image of cranes crossing the Moscow sky. They personify the freedom to realize your life as you like, and strive for the greatest possible achievement. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness, and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in delight. It seems that they can live according to their dreams. <br /> <br /> But man is not a bird. Life develops its own rules, from which no one person can escape and which we cannot change - even making maximum efforts. The war begins, and Boris without hesitation is recorded on the front in order to fulfill his patriotic duty. He cannot even say goodbye to Veronica, because she is late for the assembly point, from which the soldiers are deported. Surrounded by a jubilant crowd, all her attempts to attract Borisâ€™s attention must inevitably fail. <br /> <br /> Boris ultimately dies in the war, and Veronica does not know about it at the moment. His brother Mark, an energetic musician who has been exempted from military service because of corruption, seeks to take his place. At first, Veronica resists, but on the terrible night of the bombing she finally falls victim to his spell. Marries that will never be accepted by the family. <br /> <br /> Soon the feeling of faith captures Veronica, and she realizes that the return of Boris is the only thing she really craves. Therefore, she weakens her bad conscience and despair through her dedicated work in a field hospital. <br /> <br /> When the war is finally over, a crowd of enthusiastic people gather again to cheer on the victorious soldiers. Veronica is again among them, breaking through the wall of bodies. In her hand, she carries a bouquet of flowers until she finally has to give it to completely strangers, since one of the householders has just destroyed her hopes, confirming the sad confidence in Boris's death. <br /> <br /> Once again, cranes invade the sky, drawing wayward lines. But now Veronica herself is watching them, and her eyes are completely different. She had to put up with the impossibility of living according to biased plans, following the instructions of her dreams. After all, all people are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on incomprehensible strings of fate. <br /> <br />
