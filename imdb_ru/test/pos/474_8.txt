Some people are born with mourning souls, their song is sung alone until they meet another soul, as tortured and / or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own, and unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ONE - a brutally honest look at two tormented souls that weave for a moment of understanding and unity, to be torn apart by the difference in the unity of their pain. Death is examined in a figurative and literal sense. This is what happens when the soul is dead or just too alive, too awake to reality. This is a life that you did NOT imagine in front of passersby. This film explores the aching pain in all of us, discontent under the joyous facade, the pain below. Ugly instinctive animalistic thoughts and actions become honest and factual, and then Beshard sprinkles a mixture of unexpected innocence and beauty, knowing that both remain in us all. Beshard, a writer, is an experienced observer of the human condition and, because of his non-judgmental attitude, represents life in the light that we often protect from the eyes, but we are eager to see and understand. As a director, he focuses on the nuances of the actor's spirit that shine through the character they play, on the actors' personal acquaintance with the emotions caused by each situation. This is the most accurately written and directed image of the character from the experience of a man and a woman I have come across at the moment, although a meeting with two characters is probably not a “normal” meeting. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack encapsulates lyrics in each song that the characters will allow their hearts to spill out if they can and will be strong enough. This is the real voice of each character, sung by the beauty, pain, talent and emotional intelligence of novice indie artists who are ready to explode in the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us who have problems - for those of us who admit that we have problems and those who hide them. <br /> <br /> I always like to explore the dark side of life when Mr. Beshard is fascinated by a creative and realistic view of life and the characters that rotate in it.
