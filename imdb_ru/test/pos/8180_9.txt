Another historical work for Chen Kiage ... (I donâ€™t remember him making a modern film!) ... <br /> <br /> Good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises but that's good because of it. The characters are strong, I really felt towards them. <br /> <br /> Understanding Mandarin definitely gives English subtitles an advantage. The film is 3 hours, but did not want to.
