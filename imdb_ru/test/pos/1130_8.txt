I watched the pilot episode for this with high expectations, I just finished college and moved on to “real life”. I was not in fraternity, but many of my best friends were, and I took part in many parties that they had in their house, so I know what is happening to some extent. <br /> <br /> This show is obviously a dramatization, not a documentary about Greek life or student life in this regard, although there is a lot of truth in it, although it is mostly exaggerated. If you watch a show by the value that it contains in the form of a television show, and nothing more, it is very interesting, very similar to films such as “Old School”, “Porky”, “House of Animals”, etc., experience in your your own life in college, you will probably either be deprived of desire, or go mad because they dramatize too many events.
