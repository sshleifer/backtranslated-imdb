I was going to write a review of this film for some time, but it was only now that I really managed to put aside my thoughts for others to read. <br /> <br /> I have never had the pleasure of seeing this movie on the big screen - it is a shame because it is often visually stunning, but I have watched it many times on video many times over the years, enjoying every time. This is definitely on my personal list of my favorite films, and not just in the lead roles of Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon, my two “actors to watch”. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I really appreciate this film because it is attractive to my slightly indecent taste in entertainment. I like my films a little to the left of the center - unpredictable and fresh. And regardless of whether you “believe” the film’s plot line, you must admit that it’s different! <br /> <br /> Everyone has different tastes and opinions, but my impression of some negative reviews about this film is that the audience has never seen it beyond the surface level of this film. They were fascinated by technical questions: “Why should there be green lighting in the subway?” Or “Why do medical students pull such a stupid trick?” and could not see the artistry and psychological depth of the work. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some medical and technical aspects that have no logical sense, but if you are ready to suspend disbelief just a little bit, this can be a very interesting film. <br /> <br /> First, a note about the artistic quality of the film. Some complained of dull lighting and the illogical nature of the scenery - but for me, the use of innovative lighting techniques, plastic and drapery sets, unusual settings in old buildings and damp places, dripping tunnels, the use of sculptures. , rain and billowing curtains - all this adds a poetic flavor to this film, the haunting beauty, which corresponds to the dark nature of the questions that are asked about life, death and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I will focus only on two examples; in the alley, changing lighting allows certain elements of the set to focus sharply and then disappear as soon as the lighting returns to its normal state. This is an innovative means of transmitting the shift in the "reality" of the moment and works great. We are also allowed to see the interior of the character’s apartments — to contrast warm wood, bright colors, golden lighting and the erratic comfort of Labraccio’s rooms with Nelson’s complete white emptiness. Both reflect the characters themselves. Nelson’s lack of “objects” reflects our lack of knowledge about his past. and his carefully designed mask that keeps his companions at a distance. We came to the conclusion that his past is chaos and conflict. He decided to leave it in favor of an uncluttered void. unfortunately, the emptiness also reflects his relationship with others, the realization that he comes to him during his personal journey in this film. <br /> <br /> Flatliners is not your typical horror movie. And at the same time a typical drama or an unknown movie. It is more likely the union of all, in which the best elements of all genres are intertwined in a complex, tense plot. <br /> <br /> This is an ensemble piece, and Starring does an excellent job of breathing life into its individual characters. According to your direct impression, each of the characters is a representative of a well-established “stereotype”: the female ice queen, a slightly neurotic “doctor”, a playboy and a socially “conscious guy”, etc. The characters are even more detailed, they become different sizes and depths. <br /> <br /> The most interesting of them is the Nelson character of Sutherland. Nelson is not a character that is easy to fall in love with - in fact he is a bit of a fool, a master manipulator who definitely puts personal interest above all. However, Sutherland plays him with a hint of insecurity, which gives him a certain appeal. As events unfold, you begin to realize that most of Nelson’s unpleasant personality is a smoke screen, a face shield, behind which lies a very insecure and vulnerable young man, burdened with a terrible secret. <br /> <br /> Revealing the pieces of Nelson’s complex personality throughout the entire film, the writers, directors and actors gradually lead you to greater understanding and sympathy for him. A character who started out as a “jerk” becomes important and valuable in itself — as you learn to “forgive” his previous behavior in the light of new information. Your journey of discovery with Nelson reflects the characters' own journey towards self-understanding, as they, too, are beginning to realize that everyone has value, and "everything we do matters." <br /> <br /> This leads to my last comment. Despite the fact that many of the posters here were devoted to confronting death ... few seem to have touched on what I consider the main premise of the film - the importance of forgiveness and the need to be aware of everything you do, because it is "important" . <br /> <br />
