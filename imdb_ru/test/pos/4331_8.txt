"Death Wish 3" returns Charles Bronson as former vigilant Paul Kersey, now retired. who captured part of the city (again, by the way, New York), this time its war, so Quersey pulls out big (literally) cannons for that. It’s actually quite funny to come up with this film, especially for a few liners and, of course, the bad guys are dying or seriously injured in creative terms, which is always good. This violence is not so personal. First, it is obviously on a much larger scale, something like the bombing of your victims from afar, and not one on one fight. This movie is brighter than the first 2, making it easier to watch. There is not much point in this film, it is more to avoid it than anything else. He is also sometimes crappy and pseudo-inspiring, but the scenes from the hose are falling. they should have left the original “Death Wish” without sequels, but since they did not, they should have stayed here. 8/10
