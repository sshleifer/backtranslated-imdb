I read a book written by Bill Carter on which this film is based many years ago. The book is definitely stronger than the movie. He gives more details than the film can provide, and as a result I thought that the film seemed a bit sketchy on a handful of things. Nevertheless, taking into account all the circumstances and limitations of the environment, the film gives a completely interesting and informative report about the battle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early 90s to arrange the "Evening Show" after Johnny Carson’s resignation. <br /> <br /> The highlight is clearly speaking. I can't come up with a more complex performance for an actor than playing a character who is still alive and well-known on television on a regular basis. John Michael Higgins perfectly nailed the role of Letterman. Looking at him really was like looking at Letterman. Daniel Robak valiantly tried to be Jay Leno, but for some reason did not cope with this as effectively. His whole "look" seemed fake, and he simply did not seem natural in this role. In the less important role of Rich Little, it was not surprising that Carson’s voice was nailed, although his look was a little strange. In the book the most interesting of the central figures was probably the agent Leno, Helen Kushnik. In the film, Kathy Bates was perfect in this role, although not as uncontrollable as the writing of Carter's woman in writing. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is an easy and interesting viewing. The subject matter is not particularly important in the general scheme of things, but it is a funny backstage consideration of memorable time in the entertainment industry. 7/10
