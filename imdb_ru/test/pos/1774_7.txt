This film turned out to be much better than I expected. ++++ Gene Peters actually works reasonably well as a pirate and does a decent job in his sword fights. (To the extent that she can have a counterpart performing the action, it's hard to say ... but Peters herself obviously does it very well and does it well.) Could be a great movie. But it is mostly cheesy. Still interesting. ++++ Not to the usual film by Jacques Tournier, but definitely above the regular film by Jean Peters. The color is typical for this period of the 50s, i.e. too harsh and unreal. The actors for Blackbeard and her first mate and drunk doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a bit weak. I don't think Debra Paget was right either. But, of course, Gene Peters and Debra Page were probably the two most attractive female stars of the 50s.
