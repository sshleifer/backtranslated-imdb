WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> “Rock Star” is one of the hardest rock films I've ever seen. The original idea of ​​the script is focused on the young singer in the 80s, who heads the tribute group of one of the most famous hard rock bands of that period. He not only plays his music on a note, but also lives the life of his idols. When his friends in the tribute group drive him out, in search of originality, fate plays him a good role, and he is hired to replace the lead singer of a group of idols. Dream come true? Almost. Having started living the life of the famous, including drugs and sexual excesses of the 80s rock scene, he will also have to face problems with his fellow girlfriend, and ultimately he will have to answer questions about creativity and I wanted to say something in music groups. <br /> <br /> I liked the film, one of the reasons for which is that this is one of the first times when the life and music of hard metal bands are shown in a realistic manner. Fans of the music genre will be pleased with the soundtrack. The general idea is original, and questions about how an artist lives his life and creates his art are transmitted in a reasonable and balanced way. Behaving pretty well, with Mark Wahlberg better than most other action movies I've seen lately, and Jennifer Aniston in harmony with the role of a sweet girl who knows a lot about life. More problematic is the final, which is rather arbitrary and can disappoint. It seems that the main character, after leaving a large and well-known group, has found his creative path. However, ironically, the music he plays at the club at the end is the worst for the whole movie! <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale. Worth seeing - however one should expect exposure to a high dose of metal. If you do not like this kind of music, you can avoid this movie.
