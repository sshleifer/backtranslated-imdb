This is probably the best Clint Eastwood movie. Here the action is minimal, but with a lot of good play. The Yankee Eastwood soldiers are wounded and taken by students and teachers of the school in the south, where they hide and care for him. Soon after his recovery, all the ladies wanted to have fun with him, and some of them succeeded, including the school principal (Geraldine Page). Erotic scenes go on until the ladies discover that some of them share their “macho”, so they got angry and poisoned him during a farewell dinner. Geraldine Page, though somewhat old, was able to play a very impressive role as a school principal, a woman who has more setbacks in life than happiness.
