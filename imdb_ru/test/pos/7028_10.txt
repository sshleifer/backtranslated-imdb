I first saw this film with my bride many years after its release. I thought I hated it, but to my surprise, it was so stupid that it was great. We spent many hours trying to reproduce parts of the film (“Silvia? Yes, Mickey?” My finances break down every time I imitate Neil. Also the music is classical and it is fun to sing with it, especially on road trips Of course, I do not allow this to my male friends. It is like a guilty pleasure. I seriously watch “Dirty Dancing” once a month or more, and every time it’s just as good. Jennifer Gray is also very cute in this film. It is a pity that her career never began.
