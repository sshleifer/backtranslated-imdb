The brilliant, disturbing film by John Carpenter is a great combination of science fiction and horror, which took over the classic theme of body changing and taking it to the extreme. Redesigned in 1951, the original by Howard Hawks, Carpenter keeps the themes of cold war paranoia and trust against the backdrop of alien invasion and impending doom in the midst of insanity and isolation of the Antarctic environment. The direction of Carpenter, as always, is excellent, as his camera slides over the lonely world of characters whose habitable environment will soon deteriorate due to the initial fear of seizing the body. But here, as is the case with the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter does not hold back the incident, because thanks to some fantastic special effects we are witnessing insane moments of surrealistic blood odor. However, he never loses touch with the human side of history, because in the face of everything shocking, what is happening in front of us, we still have perceived concepts of trust and suspicion. <br /> <br /> 9/10
