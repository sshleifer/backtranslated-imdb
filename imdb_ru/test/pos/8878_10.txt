This film was one of the spinning laughter films I've ever seen. Danny DeVito plays Owen perfectly. Mom is perfectly depicted and was one of the highlights of the film. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, everything does not begin as you expect. Larry is trying to write a book and he has problems. Larry teaches a writing lesson, and Owen marked after Larry tried to get him to read his story. Eventually, Owen asks Larry to kill his mother, and in return, Owen will kill Larry’s ex-wife. The whole movie was really fun. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the film is at the end when Owen writes “Throw Mom Out of the Train.” Larry is furious because he just wrote a book of a similar plot. Turns out, Owen wrote a pop-up book for kids. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie. I gave him 10.
