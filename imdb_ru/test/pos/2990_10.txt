I saw the film in 1972, and, like the other people who commented on it here ... I came back many times to watch it again and again ... I think only 9 times. It's just wonderful how I would describe it ... I was struck by the sound track, the beautiful panoramas of the south of France, the way of life that the children began on their own. The perfect way to live is what they created ... of course, the forces that need to be mixed in, but when I forget this part, I discover that I want to be in the film and live like that! So good that it is now available on DVD ... it has not been around for many years! <br /> <br /> tlw
