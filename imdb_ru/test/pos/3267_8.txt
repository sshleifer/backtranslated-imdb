Jordan sends us to the dismal criminal side of Sydney, Australia, after a desperate attempt by nineteen-year-old Jimmy (Heath Ledger), who links work with a local gangster and must make changes before they get to him. Gangsters (led by Brian Brown) are a formidable group with a comic trait in them. This is what makes the film work, because we always treat gangsters as a rough heap to screw you up badly. But this mob tickles your funny bone. Jordanâ€™s smart structured script has characters that cross paths and fall into plot.
