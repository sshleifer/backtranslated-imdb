I caught this movie on the horror channel and was quite impressed with the gothic atmosphere and tone of the movie. As a big fan of everything related to vampires, I'm always happy to see a new variation of vampire myths, in this case, like a ghoul, a creature living in another Lovecraft. The director did a brilliant job of conveying the dark mood of the subject, using the decadent art scene as a backdrop to what is essentially a story about love, spanning time and space - pure love of friendship, the opposite of bloodlust and life. vampires in history. Characters in this story are transferred to another dimension with a substance that alters consciousness, where a vampire creature that changes shape, appears to satisfy their desires of the heart, while at the same time draining their vital essence. There are some similarities with addiction and loss of control, and how this affects a group of friends in the artistic community. I liked to watch the two main male characters in history, Chris Ivan Tsevich and Alex Petrovich, who were very attractive fans, always a plus in the vampire story for the audience! The makeup effects and creature effects were well done, and the design of the vampire dimension set was very effective. In general, a pleasant look at the myths about vampires, and recommended for anyone who loves their vampires with some intelligence, and not just action. The only thing that was not enough to make it even better would be a little more eroticism and nudity, as this would fit the plot and themes.
