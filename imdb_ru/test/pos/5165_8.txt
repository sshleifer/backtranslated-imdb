Iâ€™ve already seen the side effects of cartoons like the Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry, and Looney Tunes, and most of them are great. <br /> <br /> When I saw the All Grown Up pilot in 2001, I thought it would be interesting to see how Rugrats would look in their teens / teenagers, and there are things in it that usually happen during this lifetime, such as attending a concert, attending school and grounding. <br /> <br /> The real TV show is better because Rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode, and Angelica is not subjected to such punishment as in the original Rugrats series. Tommy and Susie are punished in this series. <br /> <br /> I also noticed mentions of Ragrats in this series and even memories of how Rugrats looked in the original series. In fact, they are talking to adults in this show, because they are 10 years older. <br /> <br /> This show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original show may like this.
