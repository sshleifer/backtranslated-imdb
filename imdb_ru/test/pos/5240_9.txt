I just recently bought the “Big Footprint” {1930}. This is a terrific, awesome movie. I knew this by reputation, but I never expected it to be so great. My version is one shot at 35 mm and I will talk about this later. When the film recalls the Western myth, the names of John Ford and John Wayne are remembered. Well, you only have half the team here, but the whole Myth is there. Raul Walsh gave us a wonderful epic, in which the real story is the struggle for the expansion of the nation to the west. <br /> <br /> There is a plot based on the novel between Breck Coleman {Wayne} and Ruth Cameron {Margaret Churchill} with the main villain, Red Flac, who was unforgettably played by Tyrone Power, the eldest. But it has an almost Random quality when the carriage is struggling with incredible obstacles, both natural and human. Examples are the river crossing, the Indian battle and the crossing of the burning desert. The aftermath of the battle gets a grim touch when the doll is placed on the grave of the murdered child, while the faithful dog rests on the grave of the owner. <br /> <br /> Magnificent panoramas are filled with energy and activity. The opening scene, when the carriage is preparing for departure, the break in the square dancing and the great herds of Buffalo are the ones that come to mind. Amazing use made of location firing throughout. Another feature of this magnificent film is the fact that men and women get an equal rating for their roles in the great struggle to the West. Women work, fight, and face terrible difficulties with the same fortitude and strength as their male counterparts. The finale has a tremendous rise when Coleman and Cameron meet in the giant, elevated Sequoia forest to start a new life. <br /> <br /> The game is quite acceptable in everything. I have already mentioned the theft of the scene by Tyrone Power. Tally Marshall is gorgeous as Coleman's assistant, and Margarita Churchill portrays a woman convincingly who develops inner strength when she is confronted with her own problems as well as external to herself. The comic relief is the weakest aspect of this film, but these scenes are not commonplace and are absorbed by the enormous scale of the film. <br /> <br /> I read a lot of criticism of the work of Wayne ?? even goes so far as to blame his “wooden game” for failing the movie at the box office. I think it is unfair. Wayne was in his first leading role and, of course, did not develop the charisma of his work in the Stagecoach. But he still performs useful work in a role that will certainly play a second fiddle in this overarching theme. After the "Big Footprint" Wayne played in a large number of low-budget B westerns. I have several of them, and you can see a developing actor in them. When the Stagecoach appeared, he was ready for this, and the Great Trail became an important part of this training. <br /> <br /> Earlier, I mentioned that my version is one shot at 35 mm. This is still impressive, but to get an idea of ​​the effect of the 70 mm version, I set the TV screen to 16: 9, which doesn’t cause distortion. Not having the full effect of the Grandeur version, it was good enough to make me want to get the latest version. {besides, the film, shot in the 70-mm film, has several additional scenes that were not performed in the form in which they were made for ordinary theatrical performances}. <br /> <br /> In general, this film deserves to be on any list of the greatest Westerns ever made.
