Being an avid fan of Carpenter, I really liked this film (although the wigs leave much to be desired!), And I agree with many comments that some areas of her life were missing or not affected. Anyway, it leaves your curiosity well and truly unsatisfied, so I decided to find out more. I have to recommend the book of Ray Coleman - Carpenters - Untold Story. The book is clever reading and, unlike the film, it is “real” and mundane. I hope you like it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Glory and Gypsy. She is a singer (as well as a dancer) in itself, and I think that this was the edge needed to create a character. Some other actresses may have struggled with this. It's a shame, the film did not delve into its history. In the end, this is the title of the film, but I felt that we learned more about Richard, but I believe that, like any other artist, it’s worth it to attack, you should always leave him wanting more!
