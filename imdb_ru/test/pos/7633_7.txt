"L'Ossessa" (released in English under many names, and the most sinister of them, of course, the "Eerie Midnight Horror Show") is one of the best Italian robberies of the Exorcist. To truly appreciate this movie, you must have a sense of humor. "L'Ossessa" is at the same time sloppy (but naive), pathetic and sometimes even touching. <br /> <br /> Danila (Stella Karnachina), a student at the Faculty of Arts, goes to the old church to see the statue I am going to restore. This is a wooden statue of Christ, a demonic Christ, who may already be defeated by evil, or struggling with it, or perhaps planning dark deeds. The face shows endless torment. The statue dates back to the 15th century. Danila is impressed by the skill shown by the sculptor - the statue seems almost alive! She lives with her parents. Her mother, Louise (Lucretia Love), lives a depraved life and does not care much about maintaining appearance. Her father Mario (Chris Avram) watches over with a disappointed look. <br /> <br /> The wooden statue will soon take on a human appearance (Ivan Rassimov) and take possession of Danila in a carnal and spiritual sense. Amazing scene! Poor Danila will now suffer from hellish torment. <br /> <br /> Danila (the beautiful Stella Karnachina) was raped, offended, possessed by the devil, and now, following his instructions, she will try to seduce others. Doesn't she imitate her grubby mother Louise (Lucretia Love), who feels great pleasure when her lover whips her with a bouquet of roses? There is a scene so ridiculous as to be sublime and touching when Stella Karnachina in despair runs through the narrow streets (devil-filled, remember?) Of a small Italian town shouting out her heart. Luigi Pistilli is a very good exorcist. His performance, as usual, is intense. The scenes of exorcism (especially the final battle) are very, very amateur, but this will only increase the fun (and / or emotions?), If you really have a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Stella Karnachina is beautiful and looks fresh and innocent, and this is a factor that adds to your enjoyment when she is naked, but I think the film could reveal its natural beauty more. Lucretia Love is a very good companion for meanness (her nude scene with roses ... well. :) <br /> <br /> Other Italian exorcist robberies, whom I would like to recommend for you: <br /> Malabimba (very messy and released uncut and digitally restored). <br /> <br /> Evil Eye (Malocchio) - The Exorcist was the main source of inspiration for Evil Eye, but other films such as Rosemary's Baby should also be taken into account. "Evil Eye" completely rolls over. Not that sloppy, but with lots of gorgeous Italian and Spanish actresses. You'll be drooling all over the movie. The film is funny, the story makes no sense, but if you see it in the right mood, you can feel the excitement! - Devilish sect, obsession, murder, despair, love, investigation and beautiful women around. Wild ride! <br /> <br /> If you like Evil Eye, see also “The Ring of Darkness” (Un'Ombra nell'ombra). This film can be found in the alternative market. Look for this header in IMDb. There are good reviews about this. <br /> <br /> P.S. - L'Ossessa has many different faces. This is exploitation, but it can also be serious and touching. It's cheap, crappy ... mean (but not so much), and it has a fundamental "moral" message. This strange drink can sometimes be very funny. We all already know that "L'Ossessa" is the plague of the Exorcist, so why can't we see it on our own terms? Yes, Mario Gariazzo tried to earn a quick dollar, but he was able to get the most out of a limited budget. The story is well told, the film is atmospheric, and in general the actors are committed to their roles. Watch a movie with an open heart, and you can discover two or three new things.
