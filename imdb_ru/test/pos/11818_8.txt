The topic of terminally ill children is difficult and sad, but the “Medicine” successfully reflects the idea that it is not necessary to be gloomy and gloomy, and, in any case, children need to have hope and joy in their lives if they find peace to the end. It is also a film about the wonderful bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood. <br /> <br /> In the film, Eric, a disabled teenage boy with a distant mother, is moving into a new area where their closest neighbor is. eleven year old dexter infected with aids by blood transfusion After his initial fears and ignorance about AIDS disappeared, Eric became friends with Dexter, and their almost fraternal friendship forces them to travel to Mississippi, where they learned about a doctor from New Orleans, who claims to have found a cure for this disease . <br /> The talent of the two young leaders Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazsello, who play Eric and Dexter respectively, is exceptional. Brad managed to portray Eric's tougher edge, not including the subtle childish innocence of the character, while Joseph portrays the feeling of vulnerability to Dexter's character, but brings the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to emphasize that his illness does not mean that he still does not have this child who wants to run and play like any other eleven year old boy. The interaction of the couple makes the audience feel that these are two boys who are very close and are well tolerated by the film. Annabella Sciorra also presents a touching performance as the mother of Dexter Linda, who adores her son and is glad that he is flourishing thanks to this new friendship with Eric, and eventually becomes a surrogate mother for another boy. <br /> <br /> Set Against the backdrop of the excellent soundtrack, “The Cure” is a very bitter-sweet film that manages to perfectly weave a childhood friendship story that unswervingly survives in prejudice and a deadly disease without resorting to sympathy or unnecessary sweet scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that it is adults who have problems with Dexter’s AIDS status, while children, even “hooligans,” accept him as much as anyone else. What is also very touching is how, despite Eric’s street nature, he is more naive in his determination to cure Dexter, while the younger boy has this obsessive feeling that he knows his fate, but is swept away by the enthusiasm of his best friend about the cure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend “The Cure” because it’s rare to find a film that is both sad and inspiring.
