I cannot say that the source of this film knows, but this is one of my favorite films by Paul Mazursky (director and co-author). This is a replay of Shakespeare's “comedy”, but completely removed from the scene. Without a lot of text, Mazursky and Cassavetta star make a visual crisis of passion and middle-aged goals. Desperate to re-center himself, Cassavett retreats to a remote Greek island, where the locals and the island itself weave a little magic. Especially with Raoul Julia, Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald, this is fiction for adults that is emotionally satisfying and visually gorgeous. And funny. It was not a big box office hit, but whenever it hits a DVD, it will be sold.
