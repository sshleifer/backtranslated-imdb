This film has no age and is likely to appeal to children today, even if there is no Jedi in all this. Of course, Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful child in the world, and her play is great too. Even Mickey Rooney is good; like Ann Revere and Angela Lansbury. When this film came out, the world was different, and this is definitely a great place to visit.
