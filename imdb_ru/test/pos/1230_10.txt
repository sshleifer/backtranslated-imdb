This is a haunting short film. Both James Franco and Rachel Miner speak out with pain, ring true and stay with you. Since this is called a tragic story, it is not so much a spoiler. But I wanted to change the result, even if it was right for the story, because I had already come to take care of these people. I can only think of a few short films that have had such an impact on me. Beautiful shot, shot, edited. High-quality approach to work, even using only the right sound and / or music for the development of the plot. The final credit song finished work, caused me even more emotions. This is the first course from start to finish. Kudos to the author / director and all involved. <br /> <br /> This is my first review of the movie in the comments section. I promised to do this in exchange for a copy of the DVD. The review can be good or bad, only my honest opinion. This is all, and this is the least I can do. I'm so glad I could see it.
