I am not a director, but I know that it is difficult to tell a story and attract people to it in just seven short minutes. I think a good movie is something you donâ€™t want to finish. Erik did a great job of developing the nature of the microbe and made him seem like a "man." Loved the music and voice used for germs. I look forward to seeing what Eric will cook for us in future films. This is one movie that I did not want to see at the end. Great job.
