I was a marine at Camp Pendleton when DI out (1st Marine Division, 11th Marine Regiment, 3rd Battalion, I-Battery). I still remember how I stood in line with other marines to watch a movie in the Star Theater in Oceanside, California. <br /> <br /> We didn’t expect that the film would depict everything we saw in the training camp. but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well the movie was made. The idea of ​​using real marines in the film was a great idea (I think they were all real instructors in the drill). As good actor as Jack Webb, he simply could not “name a cadence,” like a real instructor in a marine drill. <br /> <br /> We all laughed when the mother of the “problem” recruit came to the training camp. talk to the captain. It would never have happened in a million years, but this is Hollywood, and we did not allow this episode to stop us from enjoying the film. <br /> <br /> In the summer, I was at the MCRD training camp in San Diego. 1956, and at that time there were virtually no restrictions on what JI can do for you. The Ribbon Creek event on Parris Island has not yet affected the training camp, at least on the MCRD - San Diego. <br /> <br /> I agree that many other reviewers have commented on the sergeant. Moore "stiffness" around his girlfriend. I believe it was just Webb’s acting style, and although they could have removed this part of the film, it didn’t hurt the shoot much. <br /> <br /> One small note, a character (uncredited) “Pvt. Rodriguez ”played one of my drill instructors, sergeant. Peter J. O'Neill. Sergeant O'Neal told us that once he wanted to be an actor. We secretly laughed at it, but he surprised us all. He was a great drill instructor, and I thought he succeeded in his role. In addition, he really liked to throw knives. That summer, he often showed us his skills at the training camp. I often wondered if he was still alive.
