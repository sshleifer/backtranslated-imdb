Compared to competitors, Soul Caligur 3 is a god among games, a true work of art. However, compared to its 128-bit predecessors, the latest Namcos Superior Slash Em Up series is more ambitious - its attempts to improve perfection are not quite successful. <br /> <br /> There are new modes and settings for the game. I'm grateful for trying to raise the series to new heights - but they just complicate things. Examples? Well, the character creation mode is a great idea in theory, but in fact it is full of limitations and is not as customizable as, for example, in wwe games. Chronicles of the sword regime are fun and provoke thoughts for a while, but in the end, they drag out and seem like a chore to earn money, and not a really fun game. In addition, the “Story of Souls” mode, which is basically an arcade mode with the addition of small pieces of irrelevant history and chengmu QTR bits, is very slow. <br /> <br /> “Oh, God! SaYiNg "is probably what the more overzealous of you think about, but don’t be fooled - I don’t hate this game - this game is great! It still has a classic gameplay (although some character movements have been changed unnecessarily) absolutely amazing graphics and an epic soundtrack for which games are famous.And on the good side, there are new characters (especially Zasalamel) who are cool in their own way (besides Setsuki - yes, I know I'm picky). <br /> <br / > This is just a comparison for the soul of the caliber 1 and 2, it seems that she is trying It’s a lot more than it really is. It doesn’t mean that it’s not a classic, it just means that compared to its own high standards it lags a little behind, despite the fact that the characters have more turns graphics than ever. <br /> <br /> However, Soul Caligur 3 wipes the floor with 95% of the games there - and that means something! Oh, and all those who have marked this review as “useless “They are clearly offended by the fact that I insulted their expensive setsuku. Well listen, fan / girlfriend: IT'S NOT REAL! And even if she were, she would not have been caught dead with you.
