It is important and fair to remember that at the time of the creation of this short circuit between the United States and the Japanese Empire, there was a state of war. Add to this the enormous malevolence generated by the beginning of the war, as well as the Bataan Death March and other incidents, and the only thing surprising about this short and other materials is that there were no more. One more thing: my only problem with this short one is that he seems to be trying to be funny, but itâ€™s not. I'm not sure that someone connected with this really tried to make jokes work, or even cared. It would be much better if they did what Disney did with Education for Death, and would be absolutely serious. But this short version gets a bad rap and should not be evaluated out of context. The times were different, and this is an important consideration. Anyone who spends energy trying to save the world from a sixty-year-old cartoon should step back. Like me, spending energy to protect the same cartoon. This should be available to interested parties, even if not widely available. Not a good cartoon, but sometimes life is not good. recommended
