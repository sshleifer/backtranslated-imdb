A well-made documentary about two Sudanese refugees who are moving to the United States. This is your main story about fish without water with a fantastic twist. It was interesting to see how Peter and Santino lived before coming to America and how they adapted when they arrived here (in Houston, Texas). They were expecting a kind of paradise, but found that it is much more difficult than it seems to cope well in the states. They are turning from hopeful idealists into somewhat more realistic skeptics. Wherever they go, they meet bureaucrats with paper marks that most citizens can take for granted. They worry that they are blacker than blacks here and do not feel accepted because of this. One of the Lost Boys manages to leave Houston to go to Olat, Kansas, where he finds conditions a little better, but still not perfect. In this film, there are people who are trying to help them, as well as trying to harm them. Not shown, but discussing those who put a gun to their heads and rob them, which leads to the fact that one Lost boy negatively comments that "all black people in America are no good." It was also interesting to me that they arrived in Houston in August 2001, a month before the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. I hoped to see their reaction to this tragedy, but it is not mentioned at all. However, in general, a truly well-made documentary without narration. Nothing really needed. “Lost Boys” perfectly explain the events around them, without any help, thank you very much.
