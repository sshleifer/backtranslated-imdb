A wonderful song with the same name as the film won the best Oscar song in 1955. <br /> <br /> Love is a great thing. <br /> <br /> April rose only grows in early spring. <br /> <br /> Love is a way of nature to give a reason to live. <br /> <br /> This golden crown that makes a man king. <br /> <br /> Once on a high and windy hill <br /> <br /> In the morning mist two lovers kissed and the world stopped. <br /> <br /> Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught him to sing. <br /> <br /> Yes, true love is a great thing. <br /> <br /> How can we forget such a beautiful song. Henry King, the director, had the honor of working twice a year with Jennifer Jones in this film and the film with an underestimation of Good Morning, Miss Dove. Jones was nominated for "Splendored Thing", but she could easily have been nominated for "Miss Dove" as well. <br /> <br /> William Holden is great because the war correspondent sent a report on the communist revolution in China in 1949. His love for Jones, the eastern doctor, was very sweet and unforgettable to see. <br /> <br /> Although the finale isn’t happy, it’s still one of the greatest romances ever to appear on the screen.
