This is a documentary unlike any other. It has so many layers and shows us so much that an attempt to analyze everything at once is almost impossible. Documentary filmmaker William Greaves shows us how to make a film from a different perspective. We see the fight of the actors, the director, the sound team and everyone else trying to get there and make this film a success. If it were about making a movie, it would be commonplace. What makes Greaves, it makes it more difficult when the film crew shoots the actors, and then it will be filmed by another film crew, only so that the entire film is shot entirely. Three cameras, each with a different purpose. This has an almost dizzying effect on you, but at the same time is exciting. I like the parts where the team organizes together and discusses what is happening. Even they are a little ignorant of what Greaves is trying to do. Half perceive it as an experiment, while the other half consider it a chaotic and confusing failure. No matter which side you choose, you cannot argue that Greaves does not involve you in this process.
