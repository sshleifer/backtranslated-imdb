I have seen films come and go in my years, and when I see a film about the catastrophe, I continue to hope that I will not be disappointed. And with this I was not in the least. The story of a whole country plunging into the ocean was a great concept, written by Saky Komatsu, a novelist with intense theories about where this earth is going. The characters were top notch, and although I am not Japanese, I do not need a translator to give an idea of ​​how people are in their desperate situation. needs can come together for the common good. The special effects struck me, I literally lay on the edge of my chair, watching the floods of lava waves and explosions of the earth, which must have required months of work to perfect. As for the game, I thought yes, it works at its best, emotions are growing throughout the film, and I cried on the hardest scenes. For moviegoers, you don’t need to speak or understand Japanese to watch this movie, you can get an idea and feeling from each person and character to understand it well and follow it along with how you are there. I take my hat off to Shinji Higuchi for his leadership, I hope that he will be able to transcend his work with another amazing experience. As I said ... Fantastic film.
