I sympathized with the plight of the first man, Schmitter, whom we see killed in this episode. He reminded me of the thrill associated with the fact that at night I was somewhere a lonely guard - I did this kind of work about 20 years ago. Of course, I was never in danger of being burned to the skin, as the head of the colony (Lynch) likes to describe. Monster in the dark, killing members of a deep mining colony, creates a terrible impression in the first act. We really do not see this in the early scenes, and, as many of us understand, the best monsters sometimes remain in the imagination. “Big and Shaggy” is one of the voiced descriptions, but in reality it resembles a large lumpy pepperoni pizza that slides along the ground like a silicon millipede — a budget restriction of the show, unfortunately. It also shows in the latest matte picture, known to Trek fans, the only way to convey a long picture of mining work. <br /> <br /> But, the whole theme of this episode is about what is inside, at least, and not outwardly. Of course, this Orta, the newly discovered form of life based on silicon, at first glance looks like a meaningless monster. Thanks to Spock's telepathic abilities (probably the best use of the Vulcan mind for plot purposes), we learn that this is a very smart, even sophisticated creature. In addition to Spock's instrumental use of his talent, McCoy replaces his usual medical routine - healing a creature resembling stones or asbestos. He also says one of his most famous phrases: “I am a doctor, not a bricklayer!” I found it very plausible in his scene, where he admires his success, although he cannot get Kirk to share his enthusiasm - Kirk is too busy organizing the results. The episode throws unexpected twists and turns into the character and motivation of the audience as the story progresses; Spock advocates the need, perhaps, to preserve this discovered life, since Kirk takes his usual position on preventing the death of any red shirts (without half measures, as in The Trap for Man). But later it was Kirk who, for whatever reason, refrained from firing a suicidal explosion, as if the hunt had subsided, and he had time to think about Spock's point (I believe that during the filming of this episode Shatner found out that his father had died) . Uncharacteristic for most of the first season, it has a happy ending. The conflict stems from the needs of mainstream capitalism, such as the observance of standard quotas, and not the protection of the natural environment and its inhabitants - the version of the space age for the protection of owls from modern tractors. Somehow, despite the many murders and the feeling that everything can go to hell at any time with one raised phaser, Kirk and Spock manage to make an agreement that suits everyone. I think that people and silicates are more intelligent in the 23rd century.
