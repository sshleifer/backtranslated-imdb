I saw the premiere of this film during the Phoenix Film Festival in 2005, and I was very impressed with the skill of director Jeff Hare, who demonstrated this hot topic on screen. The composition of the characters perfectly combined and allowed us to consider the issue of an elderly person who wants to die "on his own terms" very warmly and with humor. Peter Falk was great, as Morris and the supporting group of family members and friends played their parts well. The interaction of family, friends and strangers with Morris created a realistic idea of ​​how families solve the problem of the aging of their parents and their desire to die with dignity. <br /> <br /> Although this film is supposedly a film about a Jewish actor and his family, this is really a film about all families. The jokes that family and Morris break during this hustle and bustle of life “Forces of Nature” are fresh and realistic. Childhood rivalry, the success and failure of adults and the hope of children are an integral part of this scenario. Although many will wonder how you can make the topic of suicide "humorous", I thought that the treatment is logical and timely. If you are not afraid to shed tears or laugh at the wit of a family that struggles with this problem, then you MUST SEE THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> The film was awarded the title of “Best Picture” in the film “Phoenix” Festival.
