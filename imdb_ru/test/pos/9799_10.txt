This story is a great story about two boys who are doing everything possible to get away from a cruel, drunken father. The Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood plays a prominent role in this unforgettable role. This film is one of the main reasons why I have not touched any beer and will never be as long as I live. It may make me sound like a nerd, but this is what I have to say. It's amazing why this is not perceived as a classic American fairy tale.
