emphasizes this good comedy about an aging father (C. Aubrey Smith), who decides to bring together his adult children from around the world. Davis works as a chorus girl in New York when she finds out that her dad wants it. Hmmm, that sounds familiar. Davis's considerable talents as a comedian save this otherwise comedy as she upsets balanced British countryside with her brazen American personality. Not as sharp as some other Davis comedies, but still worth seeing. Ray Milland plays her long lost "brother." Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray and Holliwell Hobbs are also having fun.
