It seems it was made as a vehicle for the W.C. Paul and Carol Dempster, and they dominate him. Fields is already well developed character of the film. Carol Dempster seems to be dancing in the film, and her acting reminds me of Mary Pickford, who also worked for a long time under the direction of DV Griffith. This is typical of the later Griffith films. <br /> <br /> Later it was remade as Poppy (original title) with Fields in the same role
