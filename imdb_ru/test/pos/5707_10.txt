As a longtime resident of Western Pa, I am well versed in this subject and found that it is REALLY refreshing to be so reliably captured on film! Glory to the producers of this epic !!! And what a great legacy for schoolchildren for many years. <br /> <br /> The attention to detail and the realistic description of this complex web of events make it a unique production. <br /> <br /> The audience will be hypnotized by the storyline and fascinated by storytelling. <br /> <br /> Graham Green is great as a presenter. <br /> <br /> BRAVO !!!
