I saw this stage show when it was broadcast on PBS in 1983. At that time, I participated in the local theater and saw quite incredible things from the Dell Arte players, but Bill Irwin discouraged me. <br /> <br /> I was most impressed by how a person of his height (rather tall and muscular) can put himself in a small box, without pausing for tuning, and whispering around the stage without stopping, even a whisper of sound. from his feet if he chose not to make noise. <br /> <br /> The most striking thing for me, however, in this performance was how he got to his feet during the “jack-in-the-box” / puppet piece. Those who saw this show will remember that when he got out of the box and collapsed on the floor with a weak body and limbs, he “pulled” himself up on top of his head, like on a rope, and rose not just to his feet, but to complete ballet points - and made it a smooth, seemingly easy movement. Just think about strength, grace, balance and focus on such a series of movements to perform them the way he does! Add to his physical prowess his strong and believable skills characteristics, and this is the unsurpassed actor / performer. My jaw dropped when I moved, and my heart broke when I depicted a puppet who is determined to be something more than just a lifeless thing in a box. <br /> <br /> As for the unfortunate (yes, “tragic”) it would be better to say) the inaccessibility of this part in the form of home media, I noticed that most of the PBS works are not available on tape or DVD. Sometimes PBS shows will be available for direct purchase from them for a limited time immediately after the broadcast, but they rarely stay on the market for long. Of course, there are exceptions, but mostly they are documentaries about science and history; rarely does a work of art remain in print for long - provided that it is included in VHS / DVD from the very beginning. I do not know why this should be so; Of course, PBS could use the income from the home media marketing of their shows, but they use little of it. It's a shame. There are a lot of things that I looked at PBS that I would like to purchase, but fragments like "The Regard of Flight", I'm afraid this is one shot, once in a lifetime, never repeating on PBS again and will never be available. for buying home media. It really sucks. I was lucky that I understood it. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, our local library received a copy of "The Regard of Flight". And yes, it was stolen.
