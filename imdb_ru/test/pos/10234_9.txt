Adapting his own novel "Cabal" for the screen, author / screenwriter / director Clive Barker created this amazing story of horror and fantasy. Craig Schaeffer plays Buna, a young man suspected of being a serial killer. Policemen shoot him in front of Midian, on the surface of a cemetery, but in reality it is a paradise for monsters that society avoids. When they claim Boone and make him one of them, it has consequences for everyone, including Boone’s pretty girlfriend (very sweet Ann Bobby) and the dubious psychiatrist (the most pleasant David Cronenberg). <br /> <br /> “Nightbreed” displays a wild and distorted imagination that I don’t see in films so often. First, Ralph McQuarrie, an experienced conceptual artist who has worked on films such as the first three Star Wars recordings, helps Barker create great visual effects for Night Breed, starting right from the initial credit episode. The visual and makeup effects are carefully thought out, and the production design and cinematography are quite impressive. Barker and his team do a wonderful job of creating this whole different world with compelling characters. This is a colorful and vibrant entertainment, and it's nice to take it. And, of course, there is a strong sense of social commentary on intolerance and bigotry, not to mention the dire consequences that may arise from a person’s actions. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous auxiliary performances add to the fun. Kronenberg exudes a lot of evil intentions and is a real gas, like a bad doctor, while Charles Hyde is an excellent antagonist like "love to hate him", a rather nasty police captain. Doug "Pinhead" Bradley is again buried under heavy makeup like tired Leilesberg, and hard as a rock. Hugh Ross is very funny in the role of Narcissus, as is Catherine Chevalier in the role of Rachel (as an extra bonus, she exposes her breasts in one sequence). Simon Bamford, who played "Baseball Senobit" in the first two films of Hellraiser, also appears here. There is even a cool cameo of the 50s and 60s, the star of fiction, John Agar. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman delivers another of his fantastic music, and Barker constantly leads us through an intriguing story to an amazing apocalyptic fight. /> <br /> "Nightbreed" is a great genre film worth seeing to anyone who hasn't seen it. I give him a heartfelt recommendation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
