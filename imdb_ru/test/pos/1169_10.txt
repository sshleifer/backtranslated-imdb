The film that I saw and which I liked, perhaps more than any other film. I first saw him in childhood and loved the drama and the great battle for climate. When I got older, I enjoyed it more or more than before, but now because of all the components that work together to make a real classic. The acting is great (especially Keith as T. Roosevelt), the cinema is impressive, the script is full of precious stones, and the direction perfectly combines all of this. It is loosely based on an actual event, and it shows the tide of Europe and the newly emerging America to share the “Sick Old Man” (Ottoman Empire) as it falls apart in a way unlike any other “historical” film I have seen, Humor, drama , an action movie, love ... it's all there and deserves a lot more recognition (much like the "Waldo Great Pepper").
