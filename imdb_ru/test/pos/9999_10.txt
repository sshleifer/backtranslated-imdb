Although I am not a fan of golf, I visited a preview of this film and I really liked it. Historical conditions, glaring class differences and a vision of good and evil on both sides of the dividing line kept my attention everywhere. Actors and their characteristics were fascinating. And I was on the edge of my place during golf segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting, but also easy to follow. Toward the end of this film, Sea Cookies came to mind, although “The Greatest Game We've Ever Played” is a much less complicated story than this movie. In both cases, the fact that events really happened deepened my interest.
