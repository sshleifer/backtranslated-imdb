A clever psychosexual drama about a wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood) who seeks refuge in an isolated Confederate school for young women during the civil war. Gradually, Eastwood begins to seduce every girl in sight, until the tables are turned upside down, and he becomes persecuted in a disappointing finale in gothic tones. Never before has the film been so delightfully erotic, but at the same time alarmingly bleak. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly Eastwood's best hour (those who tune in to “Dirty Harry” will be really surprised), while the rest of the cast gives evenly excellent performances. Try watching a movie on video, as television reproductions usually remove important memory scenes between Geraldine Page and Patrick Culliton.
