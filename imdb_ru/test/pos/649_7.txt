Back in August of '81, there were many oddities in the cinema, such popular hits as “The City Cowboy”, “Anything but free”, “Smokey and the Bandit” were in vogue. For this reason, I suspect that the producers of this film have chosen Honky Tonk Freeway as the name, hoping that this will help get the film’s box office by attracting the same “City Cowboy” crowd. Instead, “Honky Tonk Freeway” was bombed in cinemas, and I suspect that this is partly due to being burdened with a poorly chosen name. This is the same problem that burdens it on video right now, and this is too bad, because it’s a pretty good comedy movie, ahead of its time. It doesn’t matter that everyone who remembers 1981 might like it. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this film was bombed. But I think it would still be, even if it were not burdened with a bad name. This film is ahead of its time. You can watch this film now and see that he is clearly the father or, in any case, “uncle”, compared to the comedies that are made today. At one time, the Honky Tonk Freeway was full of understatements and a kind of frankness about life, which did not become popular in comedy much later. Although he is clearly the child of the “Airplane”, he is more mature, and, although he is certainly not “wounded”, he clearly points in that direction. Characters are more “comedic” in that they are discreet and never think they are doing anything other than serious. The jokes are in choosing what to pay attention to, and to the camera’s views, and how they see themselves and their situations. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the Honky Tonk Freeway is a real-time capsule. A great look back at the extremely early 80s. People in this film are dressed and behave like ordinary people in 1981. It was explicitly intended to reflect the times and to be a cunning comedic commentary about the daily life around them. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if my review helps you, but it’s really a good, sometimes kind of great movie that you should make if you want to see how many people you know today looked like when they were 30 years old younger Beverly D'Angelo is so young that it is sometimes difficult to understand. Like Beau Bridges and Terry Garr. Terry Garr was just about to become a Hollywood toast, as her next film after that was Tootsie, which finally made her a star. Howard Hessmann was perhaps the biggest “current” star of the day the film was shot. Back in 1981, Howard Hessmann was the star of the popular TV show "WKRP in Cinncinatti". He played his main character, the villain night DJ. Daniel Stern was just about to become a star in the role of the adult narrator of the main children's character of the popular 80s sitcom "The Wonder Years". There are also several individuals who are no longer with us these days, it's nice to see Hume Crowin and Jessica Tandy as an old married couple on a journey. Ten years after that, Jessica Tandy will receive an Oscar for Driving Miss Daisy. In one of her latest film appearances, there is the great Geraldine Page. Although she had a brilliant career, she received her Oscar only four years later in 1985 in “A Trip to Abundance”, for which she deserved it deserved, and she died very soon after receiving this award. <br /> <In addition, there are many other actors in this film, actors who are not big stars, but who have done a lot of supporting work. Many people know each other, even if you can't remember their name. <br /> <br /> This movie is a nice little entertainment. A bunch of people with different problems from different places, each of them for their own, unrelated reasons, all, in some uncertain manner of Altman, ultimately go to Florida and without knowledge they meet in the small town of Tiklo, Florida, which, as it turned out, is reeling from the consequences of having been bypassed by the recently built interstate highway, which did not build an exit to Tiklo, which effectively removes the city from the map. <br /> <br /> And this is also the fact that this film is about the fascination with the whole idea of ​​the interstate system, which has only recently been “completed”. It took a generation to build, starting with the permission of Congress in 1960, for many years, when various parts were built and then “earned”, and by 1980 most of the system was finally built and all connected together, and first promise what the interstate system will be, has become what it is. And people were fascinated by this. By 1980, all were largely “veterans of interstate motorways” in the sense that by that time everyone used its parts and knew how they work and how they differed from other roads in that they did not have red lights or stop signs , just on and off the ramps, and that it went to places that were previously less accessible. By the 1980s, everyone could travel anywhere comfortably and without having to stop at anything except food, sleep, and a bathroom. And all this was new then. <br /> <br /> The ending is anticlimatic and not very pleasant, although it is impressive. What makes it great is that the journey, and not the destination, makes Honky Thon Freeway out of time, despite the fact that it is such a product of its time. Forget its name; instead, let him lead you into the past.
