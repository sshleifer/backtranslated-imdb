I don’t know what the critics watched when this film was released, but he eluded them unnoticed. It is well written, witty, satirical, and totally enjoyable. It’s like a video game brought to life. You never know who is behind the door or what will happen next. Violence is neither gratuitous nor excessive for a splash effect. <br /> <br /> And the last word: for you, fans of Mickey Rourke ... Mixster returned and became the coolest cameo performed at the end.
