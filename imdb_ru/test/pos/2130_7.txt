I missed the full four-hour version when she was originally released in theaters, because she played one week. I had to agree to watch a shorter version two and a half hours a year or so, and I was stunned by what I saw. I left the theater, thinking that I was a witness to the masterpiece, and was surprised at what the full version looked like. <br /> <br /> The full version is basically good, but there are so incredibly boring episodes in it that the whole movie is shot and almost drowns under the waves. <br /> <br /> The problem is completely in editing, which should be marked as a final word with an excess. There are times when something goes on and nothing happens. Snapshots of people in the city who go too long without a goal in the narration. We get beautiful perspectives and visions of such beauty that they bring tears to your eyes, but they are too often used as a placeholder instead of punctuation or place setting. Most of the longer version seems to appear on the screen simply because it looked good. <br /> <br /> I tried to sit down and look at the Heavenly Gate without resorting to the fast forward button, but somewhere along the way I am I can no longer tolerate it. <br /> <br /> I would like MGM to regret us and release a shorter DVD version, as well as a huge dinosaur. Perhaps in the form of two packages, so that we can see which version is better and whether Cimino was crazy or not. <br /> <br /> And while they are doing this, why not include the once rumored editorial office of the Johnson War, which is 90 minutes. Supposedly United Artists were busy with a further reduction in the hope of returning some of their money. Whether this has ever been done or still exists in the air, but it would be interesting to see.
