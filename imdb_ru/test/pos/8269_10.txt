Just reading the reviews of this wonderful BBC mini-series reminded me of how I enjoyed it when it was first shown many years ago. At that time, I remember looking forward to the next release and fell in love with John Bow and Janet MacTyr, two talented actors who we donâ€™t see enough on television or in the movies these days. <br /> <br /> I unsuccessfully tried to get some fantastic BBC dramas from the past, including the 1973 version of Jane Eyre and the 1972 version of Green Gables, all the wonderful classic stories that are out of time for the BBC -si doesn't seem to be releasing a video or DVD. If someone finds out otherwise, I would like to hear them. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, we will have to be content with memories of how beautiful they were.
