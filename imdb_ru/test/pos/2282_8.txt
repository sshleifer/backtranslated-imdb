The selfish player of major league baseball is forced to continue his career in Japan, he is struggling with an alien culture, a clearly unhappy manager, an attractive Japanese woman, and his own professional and social instability. There is a certain subtle charm that flows through the actions of Tom Selleck. There is humor, sometimes soft, as in this film, sometimes a slap in the face, as in “The People!”, But it always seems that there is some higher purpose in it. Add to this a person full of self-doubt, who is struggling to solve his personal problems, at the same time adhering to the "right things", and you get a film that is funny and makes you think. The actors come together as a championship team, and even if neither the actors nor the films win awards for their efforts, they will leave the audience feeling good (and perhaps these are the best results in the end). You want to watch this movie more than once, and every time Mr. Baseball hits the hamster.
