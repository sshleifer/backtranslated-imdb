Definitely a movie for people who ask only to have fun and who do not think too much about their films. <br /> <br /> A lot of actions, a lot of great dialogues (for example, funny quotes), a little intrigue and all that explosive. Samuel L Jackson and Gina Davis had excellent chemistry. Cruel, but not bloodthirsty. The fact that the female role was the competent leader of the action is a pleasant turn. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoys it in order to return it to the rotation of my favorite films every 3 or 3 months. At first, I made a film because Samuel L. Jackson starred in the film, but was involved in events related to Samantha's attempt to recapture her memory, and never looked back. <br /> <br /> All that you are - stop disbelief for a moment, take yourself a little less seriously - you can really have some fun!
