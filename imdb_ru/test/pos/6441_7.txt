This is a movie that I watched in childhood and never forgot. This, of course, is not the best film ever made, but there is something special about it that I cannot understand. I like it. I am the person who likes everything that has been explained to me, and for this reason alone this film drives me crazy. <br /> <br /> What specifically / Who is this mysterious sorceress and what is her relationship with Tom? WHY and HOW he became the Water Baby ... why did he grow up on earth? These are questions that just eat at me! I thought that after reading the book, I would get answers, but I just read the article that the book from which this story is “based” is very different. So, I think I will never know what the writer was thinking! <br /> <br /> I still love this film, and I recently watched it with my two-year-old niece. She likes it too, although she insists on calling it "Baby Water" for reasons unknown to me. She likes the part where he jumps into the water, and then declares: "I'm all clean." (You must understand that my niece is the purest 2-year-old girl in the world!) We watched this scene again and again. <br /> <br /> I am so glad that we can enjoy this movie together! There should be more films like this. (But what happened to gay seahorse ?? !!)
