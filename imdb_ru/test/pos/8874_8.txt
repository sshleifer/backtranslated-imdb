You will not see the meaning of the name much later, but you will understand the meaning in the first few minutes. This Golden Globe directorial debut (for actor) Danny DeVito, who also plays Owen / Ned's Elevator, is a terrific Hitchcock-like movie about one person hating his wife’s book (she stole it) and one person hating for his mother. In fact, Owen wants to be a good writer, like his teacher Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), and he is inspired by murder stories. Larry invites him to watch Hitchcock's film, rather ironic, and it was then that Owen had the idea to kill Larry's ex-wife, Margaret (Kate Mulgrew from Star Trek). Owen is inspired by “Strangers on the Train,” exchanging murders, so Larry must kill Owen's terrible mom (nominated for Oscar and Golden Globe by Anne Ramsey). Larry was convinced that Owen killed Margaret, and also that he should / wanted to kill Owen’s mom, but there’s a happy ending when Larry and Owen release books after months, Mom died naturally, and they went on vacation with Beth Ryan (Kim Greist). Also starring Rob Reiner as Joel and Oprah Winfrey. With funny moments, a great director / actor and his support, this comedy is a must. Very very good!
