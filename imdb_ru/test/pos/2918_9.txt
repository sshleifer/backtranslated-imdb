For many years of interest in Akhenaton, I was surprised to learn about this film through E-bay and bought a copy on DVD for 99 rubles. I liked the movie, the plot twists and the fact that the file was mostly about the main character, Sinuha makes him rather a “family saga” rather than a fighter. Costumes and attention to detail were remarkable for their time (1955). Rear projection while riding a chariot now looks awkward. My main interest was in the character of Akhenaten and its monotheistic religion. In this film, he was portrayed as “Jesus,” both in his refusal to wage war with the Hittites, even when they invaded Egypt, and in his final speech about the futility of materiality and political power. Initially, it is possible to establish a connection between the sinuha, which was thrown downstream in the Nile River in a reed basket, and the Old Testament Moses. But this connection is not transferred, no doubt, it will be fully explored in the new film, where a character like Moses takes the monotheistic religion of Akhenaten to a wider world, if such a film is ever politically possible. It is generally accepted that if women are concerned that we, men, are stupid creatures, but the relationship or lack thereof is between Sinuha and Merit, the character played by Gene Simmons is difficult to accept. And the fact that Sinuha, an educated doctor, will be so overwhelmed by Nefer the Babylonian “femme fatale” that he will give her the home of his adoptive parents, and the Tomb is not really plausible, and that his parents will not even have a tomb. In real life, Nefert (Nefertitti) was the wife of Akhenaton. And although Horemheb did become Pharaoh, it was after several others, including Tutankhamen, who was the son of Akhenaten. <br /> <br /> But, of course, this is just nagging, and the film is nice to watch, and this is about Akhenaten and its monotheistic religion - a big bonus. Maybe after the book and film “The Code of De Vinci” this film will be remade, and the central secret is the basis of our present monotheism! I look forward to this film, there are already a lot of books on this subject.
