This intelligent, touching and beautiful film is a study of how people react to traditions (reminds me of the novels of William Faulkner). <br /> <br /> All characters feel trapped because of the weight of the roles that they have to play and find a way to live in these roles, rather than throwing them away completely. But as the story progresses, the two wives who are married without love get closer. Relying on the strength of their friendship and love, they give each other the courage to give up their roles. <br /> <br /> They found that living within their traditions is not a life at all, but a kind of living death. without passion, without a true connection with others, without satisfaction. Although they know that they will have to pay a certain price for their rebellion and freedom, this price is much cheaper than the sacrifice that a comfortable, predictable existence leads to. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderful, acting amazingly. Almost perfect!
