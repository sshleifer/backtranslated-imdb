I like this movie! It was amazingly touching and funny. Finally, here is the story of a group of people who face difficulties, hesitate a little, and then decide to just be themselves and end up being happy; when was the last time you saw this in a movie? When dealing with the fluidity of life, love and sexuality, the characters face real problems (although in often ridiculous situations, such as a group trip to the men's camp and obvious connections), they manage to learn and grow without being preached darkly desperate or too unreal. You will love and care for characters who, without being empty stereotypes, depict real people with a faint touch of truth behind their potential labels. <br /> <br /> Good romcom for a Saturday night, and the only film I've ever seen where sexual fluidity ends safely, and no one has to be who he doesnâ€™t want to be. Much better than Kissing Jessica Stein, a good choice if you're tired of watching funny movies that have a painful lesson and a bitter lesson. Or maybe you just love a good British prank? James Purefoy looks as cheerful as ever, and Tom Hollander is delightfully funny. So go, look, enjoy; You will not regret it!
