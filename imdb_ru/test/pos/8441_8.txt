Large corporations against Diligent Do good. It seems that we are all the time watching similar events (both in real life and in coils), and most of the time greed wins, using all the necessary (dirty) means, and the truth is suppressed. At least in this film, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) got his glasses and paid for them dearly. In recent years, we have seen several more similar films, the most memorable of which was Insider, where Russell Crowe played a tobacco industry scientist who tried to whistle, claiming that the industry added more nicotine to cigarettes. make smokers addicted. There was also this corner of the reporter-protagonist, when the reporter seeks the sensation of his dreams, and the protagonist faces this moral dilemma, when he / she has to choose between righteousness and his life, and sometimes his life. <br /> Jane Fonda played with Kimberley Wells journalist to perfection. She plays a reporter who wants to keep serious news, while her bosses value her more like Eye Candy. She and her team (operator, played by Michael Douglas from Coma, who is also the producer of the film), are watching the accident at the nuclear power plant when they were visiting. Operator Michael Douglas quietly / illegally film this event, despite the fact that this is an area where there is no photo, and takes it from the station. The station refuses to broadcast it and reports to the corporation that owns the nuclear power plant. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Chief Engineer Jack Godell begins his own investigation and discovers many irregularities in the equipment used for the reactor. It starts all the dirty politics of corruption and greed. <br /> <br /> This is a good thriller, and he managed to create more tension in the audience to the end, and the funny thing is that there was no background assessment. offer all the scary moments. This is great and unusual in movies. All the performances were good and I love Jack Lemmon. We first know him by comedy roles, but he is equally good in dramatic roles. I give this film 8/10.
