This is the second film about 1985, the other was “Wedding Singer”. While the 'Wedding Singer' portrayed the pop side of the '80s,' Rock Star 'is fully dedicated to metal. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in the tribute group of one of the famous rock artists of the time. and Jennifer Aniston plays her friend. When his obsession rewards him, his whole life changes in one day. <br /> <br /> The story does not become too dramatic, and it only scratches the surface of a rock star's life. Sex and drugs are very limited in this film, but it’s full of rock and roll! The music is fantastic and the concerts are brilliant! The feeling of the concert is very well captured, as they used a real audience (there is no cgi here). <br /> <br /> Excellent guidance and brilliant performance by Mark Mark, who acts like a real metal dude! <br /> <br /> “Rock Star” is all about fun, and if you had anything to do with the old metal scene, you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
