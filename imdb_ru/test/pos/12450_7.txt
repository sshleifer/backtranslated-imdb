I remember watching this film in the theater in 1984, when I was 6 years old (you do math). I really liked it. I was Tarzan for 2 weeks after I saw him (I climbed furniture, jumped around, making sounds of monkeys). It began to fascinate Tarzan and monkeys, but, oddly enough, a longer love for Christopher Lambert (keep in mind that I saw the Highlander very soon after that). 1984 was the last time I saw this film, about a month ago. It happened by telegram when I was getting ready for bed at 3:30 in the morning, and although it was already late, I was tired and had to be at work at 9:00, I didn’t sleep to watch a movie that I loved as a child. <br /> <br /> After watching, I realized that the film is not so good, and even weirder that Andy McDowell’s voice was voiced by someone else. Jan Holm, of course, was hard as usual, and, surprisingly, the monkey costumes still held, but the most surprising was how much Lambert was like Tarzan. He was great! The depth that he managed to catch in a few lines, his main body language and, most importantly, his ability to lead this character through his extremely large ark, were simply amazing. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, I'm a fan of Lambert. But I'm used to the Highlander, the Hunt and the Fortress. In this film, he was really quite good, and it is a pity that he could not portray the character with such depth again. <br /> <br /> So, if you make the story too long, I was a little disappointed that the film was not so good, but I was glad to see that Lambert was good, and I do not regret sitting up to 6 o'clock in the morning to watch it.
