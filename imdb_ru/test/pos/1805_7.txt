I have seen this film quite a few times, and every time I watch it, it becomes more and more bizarre and ridiculous. Perhaps because of the lack of research related to the “punk” person of Nicolas Cage’s character, or simply because of the liveliness factor, because it was a typical eighties film ... nevertheless, it's a cute love story with extremely funny, unique characters . I think it’s right there with Fast Times and Weird Science (typical eighties movies!)
