I first watched this movie when it first came out, and also bought a soundtrack recording on LP. I liked it so much, I came back several times to see, I can not understand why this is considered a failure. Julia Andrews was beautiful in this film, her voice was in great shape, and her costume was beautiful! <br /> <br /> The film covers a bit of everything, and although some of the scenes were a bit harsh, they were still funny. <br /> <br /> I recently discovered that I could get a copy as a DVD and ordered it ...... I was disappointed that several songs and episodes from the movie were not included in the DVD version I ordered.
