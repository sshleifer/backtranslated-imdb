Born Bad is a well-composed crime drama about a group of teenage children. Teenagers, as well as young people, consider this film to be well-played and interesting. The film is similar to The Black Circle Boys in the sense that a group of teenagers go to their city, creating their own rules and not caring about the consequences.
