Fascinating at its best, intriguing at its worst, the pioneering epic of Francis Ford Koppala Apocalypse Now is one of the most iconic and famous films of the 20th century, and, in my opinion, the greatest film ever described about American involvement in Vietnam . <br /> <br /> What I like most about Apocalypse Now is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. Growing up as a lover of cinema and with a special interest in military films, I saw many films that tried to portray the “images” and “feelings” of Vietnam, but without success. Films like Hamburger Hill and We Were Soldiers fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam, portraying the “heroic battles” that are most often infected with the zeal of Hollywood filmmaking. /> <br /> In Apocalypse Now, there are no battles, no heroes or villains, there’s nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the image of Vietnam through the physical aspects of war. Rather, it is a film that powerfully explores and explores the human psyche when it is tormented by the absolute “horror” of what was the darkest military conflict of the last century. <br /> <br /> The sheer brilliance of the action (in particular, the interpretation of the silent "Captain Willard" Martin Sheen), as well as the exciting cinematography (filmed in the Philippines), which provides crucial realism against the background of the film, make "Apocalypse Now" an unforgettable epic . <br /> <br /> Arousing a lot of emotions and leaving us in the whirlpool of mediation, Apocalypse Now is not for the carefree cinema-goer. This is a masterpiece that requires multiple viewing to be fully appreciated.
