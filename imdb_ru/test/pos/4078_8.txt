I absolutely hate the idea made for television movies. For me, TVM usually involves Jane Seymour or Jacklin Smith as the mother of a sick child who dies from a difficult to treat disease, and all this is done in such a sweet way that the audience doesnâ€™t need tissue, she needs insulin. So when the Deadly Journey was made for a BBC and HBO television movie based on a true story, I vaguely remembered how I appeared on television a couple of years ago, I sat down, expecting me to be bored. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> There was no strike in the last sentence, I was not surprised that I was shocked. Here TVM, which captures you more tightly than the great white shark, in fact DEADLY VOYAGE does not deserve to be assigned to television programs that should have been made and distributed by the leading Hollywood film company because of its absolutely terrifying background and that `More In addition, unlike PAPILLON and SLEEPERS, it is completely true <br /> <br /> For those who do not know the history !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS HOW TO PLACE !!!!! Somewhere in the early 90s, a handful of Africans dragged a Ukrainian cargo ship to France to work there. Of course, it was an attempt at illegal immigration, but the freighter crew was already fined for allowing illegal immigrants to his ship from a previous voyage and did not want to get into trouble with the maritime and immigration authorities anymore - the team kills Africans after detection, they hide in the hold. All but one African, Kingsley Ofus, who manages to escape from the firing squad, but who must try to survive on board the ship, but the problem is that the crew is hunting him, and France is still a few days away. <br /> <br /> Just typing the above paragraph, you will find out how good is FREE TRAVEL. What a wonderful story, and again it - unlike many stories that claim to be - completely true. It is very well written, directed and actor, especially Sean Pertwee (Why is this guy not a celebrity?), And most of all it is a tense claustrophobic alarming thriller that I still remember vividly after six years after watching it for one and only time. I look forward to seeing you again. <br /> <br /> But you have to ask yourself how TVM can be better than most Hollywood action films that appeared around the same time? Oh, wait, I just had a disturbing thought that Jerry Bruikhimer was doing a remake with director Tony Scott and with Denzil Washington as Kingsley, Brad Pitt as Perty, a massive artistic license, received with events, and so on. VOYAGE excellent TVM, not a bad blockbuster
