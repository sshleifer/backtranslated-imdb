It's been almost 50 years since I first saw Jennifer. I did not know the name of this film until I looked at it on this website, but I told many people (especially my grandchildren) that films should not include graphic details in order to scare you and make a powerful impact. History skillfully introduces you to concepts that, in the case of truth, put Ida Lupino in a very dangerous situation. Every time Miss Lupino discovers a new “fact”, she draws the viewer into her confusion and fear. <br /> <br /> This film has such an impact on me that after almost 50 years I still consider it one of the most frightening films I've ever seen. Yet this film does not contain the blood and the blood that became popular shortly after this film was shot. It's amazing what impact a good story and great actors can have.
