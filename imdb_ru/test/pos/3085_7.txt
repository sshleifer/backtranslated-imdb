This is definitely one of Mel Brooks' best films, along with Cosmic Balls (although I openly admit that I have not watched many others, at least for now). It's very stupid and quite funny, during the entire two-hour work time, where you are not entertained, hardly more than a few minutes. Almost all plugs have a great comic effect, only a few of them fall. I watched this movie immediately after watching and viewing Spy Hard, and, comparing these two fake films, I realized exactly how good this film is. Funny from beginning to end, no comedy has overdone and boring. The music is amazing, as is the choreography of the dances and battles. Acting is pretty much what you usually expect from this type of movie ... Elvis is a great comedian and a good Robin. The plot is typical of Robin Hood, more or less all of the legends fit into this film (and forged mostly). If you like Mel Brooks, or you're just a fan of stupid humor, or you just want to watch a good parody of the legend of Robin Hood, this film is definitely for you. It is also worth watching the special film “HBO First Look” about the film, and in this you might want to keep watching the captions as well. I would recommend it to any fan of Mel Brooks films and people who love silly humor. 7/10
