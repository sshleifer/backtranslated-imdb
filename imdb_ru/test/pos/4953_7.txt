In the 1980s, patriotism and, in some cases, the smoothing of hurray-patriotism was quite high. “Will we be able to win this time,” Rambo’s first blood line, Part II, could sum up how many people felt at that time. The pursuit of the style of the films in which they grew up, the balls against the wall: “we are good, your bad ones ... now let's blow something up and go home” adult crowd. Iron Eagle went straight to the children. Canadian writer and director Sydney J. Furry talks about everything you love and hate for this period of time. A blow to the pants shakes the anthems of the 80s (never say “die”, “The Roma Road”, etc.), and sometimes almost incredible action films Iron Eagle succeeded for one reason ... it was F.U.N - Fun. This is the type of movie you can turn on, sit back and enjoy every funny moment of the 80s. You don't need to think about whether this can really happen, or if the acting is really believable, it's just fun ... and that's all you can really ask for in this type of movie ...
