When you think Oliver Stone, the films that come to mind will be his biggest and most controversial, such as Platoon, Kennedy, Born on the Fourth of July or Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio usually does not. This is a rather small movie, actually. More than half of the film takes place on his radio station, Barry Champlain, who speaks at his microphone. But believe me, this is one of Oliver Stone’s greatest films and should not be missed. <br /> <br /> First of all, this is the study of character. Barry Champlain is a rude, self-destructive, risk-taking talk show that says too many things and starts to run into problems with his boss, his lover (s), his fans, and even some Nazis. He doesn’t like his audience and callers, and many don’t like him (everyone likes it or not, but he has no idea why). But at the end he says in his show: "I think we are stuck with each other." <br /> <br /> Watch Talk Radio, even if you don’t like Oliver Stone’s films. You may be surprised. I am sure I was. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
