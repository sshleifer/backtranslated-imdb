For those who are accustomed to comedies on television, be it sketch, comedy or animation, it’s nice to watch something really refreshing. <br /> <br /> “The Hunter” should be the best comedy of this decade, and Seinfeld should be the triumph of the latter. From here, the owners of the urban crusades should correct the situation, make “advertising road tests” and try to get the facts from our politicians a good old-fashioned way. <br /> <br /> Despite being quite controversial at times, the show is of excellent quality from well-made and really funny opening credits to the research of the sketch style (the sketch style is only in time, they are not scripted, at least not the ones that at the other end of the joke) is definitely worth a look. Even the most cynical and intelligent viewer will not be disappointed, and the show deserves ten stars. <br /> <br /> In general, well done ABC for showing it, and I highly recommend it.
