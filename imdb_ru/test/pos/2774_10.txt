Have you ever missed the good old days when Disney made great movies that really touched you? Growing up with Disney, I always found myself fascinated by the characters. Everyone seemed really talented and knew how to behave in a movie. I remember Friday nights and running to turn on the TV to watch their newest films. Susie Q was one of my all-time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even until the day when someone mentions the song "Susie Q", I always remember the movie. If someone thinks to watch this film, I promise you, you will fall in love with it. I don't think I can ever forget this. You will not regret watching this. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, itâ€™s sad to see Disney movies like the Hannah Montana Film. What happened to Disney?
