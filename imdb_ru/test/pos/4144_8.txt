I always liked to listen to Buddy Holly and I felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in a plane crash. He was not in the old rock and roll class, say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he was not far behind. Who knows how great his legacy would be if he sang for decades. Almost everything he released was a hit. <br /> <br /> So I was very pleasantly surprised at how well Gary Buzie played, playing him and imitating his singing voice. He was proud of Buddy, as were the actors (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith) who played in the Holly Crickets group. <br /> <br /> As for the music, there are some of Holly’s most famous songs at the beginning of the film and its really good with a strong ending at the end, as Holly and the boys are shown in Iowa at their last concert ever. Busey not only sings like Holly, but also kills him in the department of appearance. Some thing was the best in the history of the actor, and you did not get any arguments from me. <br /> <br /> I am also glad that they finished the film on an upbeat note with this concert in Iowa, instead of stopping at its tragic accident. The ending could be a real failure, but they didn’t allow it.
