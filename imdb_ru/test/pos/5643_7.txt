The name is a reference to the destruction of crop residues, such as rice husks, by farmers who burn them, creating fires on the plains. This is a dark story about the destruction of the Japanese soldier. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in the last days of the campaign in the Philippines when a soldier with tuberculosis returns from the hospital because, since he can walk, they have no place for him. His senior officers do not want him around because he is too ill to work or fight. Insulted by his officer, he was sent back to the hospital with an order to either be accepted or to kill himself. They will not take him anyway, and he will soon leave to wander through the war-ravaged landscape, trying to find help, a place to rest, or even just food. This is a hopeless journey without hope, only the death and inhumanity of a person towards a person at every step. <br /> <br /> Announced as a heartbreaking journey into the dark heart of man and war, this is also a very funny movie. This is not to say that it is not terrible, it is sometimes, but it is also darkly comical. How can this not be? Here's a movie where insanity and madness flare up, people are constantly trying to push tobacco leaves for food, trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes, trying to stay a Japanese soldier in the face of absurdity, constantly marching, but never getting anywhere, laughing. Of course, everything becomes even darker when it becomes clear that cannibalism, in the direct and figurative sense, may be the only way to survive, but at the same time there is something unusually funny in the human comedy. <br /> <br /> Acknowledged A magnificent anti-war film, his strict photographic style clarifies the insanity of war, even when it blinds us with its beauty. Here we see landscapes full of bodies, including a soldier and a civilian. set among the fields of the forest and trees that would otherwise be, and to some extent still, quite beautiful. This is a terrible feeling. <br /> <br /> What intrigues me is that I read, that it is based on a novel about the redemptive power of Christianity. The director removed religious references to hope and salvation everywhere and instead used them to show that life stinks, war stinks worse and that ultimately there is no hope. <br /> <br /> Intellectually, I admire the film, emotionally I don’t. In part, this is a sharp, depressing account, which, for me, underlines what we see on the screen. It is almost the gilding of lilies, because the images are so strong that it really doesn’t need the music to make you feel anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that you decide. Surely this is unlike any other war film, bloody, terrifying, and real in the sense that films with large budgets claim, but never were. This is not for those who are harmful to blood and gore, because here in the peaks. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
