Hopefully, from his place on the comedy throne of Heaven, Spike Milligan will be able to see and enjoy this film, since Terence Ryan and Ken Tuohy took the book, which the author himself said, writing it, “almost driving me insane,” into the joy of viewing. <br /> <br /> The film tells about the history of the Irish city of Pukun and the problems he faced when the separation between Northern Ireland and the Republic is built, making its way through the center of the village and, more uneasily, through the middle of the cemetery. This leads to the fact that some of the dead, buried in the Catholic church cemetery, are now in the Protestant north - and therefore the local priest, who is assisted by various eccentric locals, seeks to move bodies away under the cover of darkness and thus avoid bureaucratic Britons. border guards. <br /> <br /> It was an inspirational job to play the role of Madigan as the Irish comedian and poet Sean Hughes. He brings innocence to this role, especially to his shots for the camera (where he usually interacts with the voice acting of Richard Attenborough, who plays, presumably, the scriptwriter / director of the film). Dara O'Malley, who plays Rudden's father, also deserves considerable praise; and the rest of the cast, from household names such as Elliot Gould and Griff Rhys Jones, to people with what is commonly called "slices" - for example, Spike's daughter Jane, who plays Madigan's wife, gives 100%. importantly, to the remarkable characteristics given by Spike in the original book. <br /> <br /> I can say that the film is too long, or that Elliott Gould’s Irish accent leaves much to be desired, but these will be only minor points and will take nothing away from the perfection of this film.
