Favela Rising - a documentary about the slums of Rio, especially the most brutal, Vigario Gerala. According to this film, over the past decade, many more children have died in the Rio favelas than in Israel / Palestine over the same period - a fact surprising if it is true, which shows how much the social problem is underestimated in the rest of the world. This is an important topic, especially for those who see hope in mass efforts to mobilize those most in need and most at risk through an active cultural program. This is a compelling documentary film that is sometimes overshadowed by an overly personalized version of events and grainy digital videos and films that can sometimes make you think that you need to check your eyes. <br /> <br /> Drug lords The favelas are ruled by teenage boys, who, like in some areas of Colombia, are the main drug traffickers. Fernando Merell's film “City of God” / Cidade de Deus was accused of celebrating violence (Cidade de Deus is another of the many favels in Rio). But the early section of Favela Rising shows that favela boys actually celebrate violence and want to distribute drugs where there is money and stock. It’s cool to carry weapons there, it’s cool to work as a drug dealer: it's fifty times more profitable than income earned by other means. <br /> <br /> Mochari first discovered the movement of AfroReggae and its leaders Anderson Sa and Jose. The youngest while visiting Rio de Janeiro for a conference and quickly convinced his friend and mentor Zimbalist to quit his job and come to help make a film with his own promise to fund it. The eloquence and charm of Sa and the striking turn in his life make him the center of the film and its main narrator, but, like the favelas themselves, the film is teeming with other people. There is no doubt that Sa is an outstanding leader, organizer and artist. <br /> <br /> Vigario Geral is compared to Bosnia: the shooting there was very dangerous. The friendship and protection of Anderson Sa, as well as caution and diplomacy in the shooting allowed cinematographers to access and take detailed pictures of their stories, while (mostly: these were close calls), avoiding any serious clashes with drug barons or drug traffickers. They also taught the boys to use cameras and left them there on trips home. This resulted in 10% of the footage, including rare violent images, including beatings of the police. It is difficult for an outsider to track police killings in Rio. There was one in the early 1990s that hung over history and inspired Sa, who stopped his early involvement in the drug trade, to lead his cultural movement. Policemen are involved in drug trafficking everywhere, and if someone doesn’t like it, poorly trained police come there (often in black ski masks) and shoot the neighborhood, killing a lot of innocent people. <br /> <br /> This is pretty much the picture we get in Meirell's City of Gods, except that this time includes Sa, Junior and other guys, starting with Vigario Geral, but eventually spreading to a number of other favels to give drum classes that attract dozens of young people - both girls and boys. Their AfroReggae program (Grupo Cultural AfroReggae or GCAR), created in 1993, is a new alternative lifestyle for young black men in the Rio ghetto. This causes them to quit smoking, drink alcohol and drugs (this is the rule), turning into rap, songs, percussion and gymnastics in expressive galvanic performances. In the end, the best artists, led by Sa, perform in front of a large local audience with local producers, and their Banda AfroReggae makes an international recording contract. <br /> <br /> Other centers and groups were created by GCAR or through GCAR. For many years at Vigário Geral and other favelas, he sought to improve among young people, conducting trainings and arranging musical, capoeira, theatrical, hip-hop and dance performances in GCAR centers. <br /> <br /> Not just performing arts Just a focal point. GCAR is also a movement for broader social change. In order to raise public awareness through such speeches, the centers also conduct training in the field of information (newspapers, radio, Internet, e-mail links), hygiene and sex education, in order to bridge the gap between rich and poor. , black and white, and offer workshops on audiovisual works, including the production of documentaries. The program is currently active in four other areas. <br /> <br /> Favela Rising has many scenes with street favela and family life, and they are very similar to the images in the City of God, with the important difference that the focus and the result are very, very much more positive. Not that this is a tough battle. And corruption in the police, injustice in the social system and indifference of the Brazilian population are not directly affected by this. But there is a scene in which Sa talks to young children in another favela, cynical boys who are not enthusiastic about AfroReggi and are determined to work in the drug trade, like Sa himself in childhood. It seems that Sa does not convince any of them, despite the fact that traffickers do not live to be fifty years old. But we learn that the most negative guy in this group, Richard Morales, joined the movement five months later. There is also a story about a strange accident that put Sa out of order, but with a positive result. <br /> <br /> It would be great if the images were clearer and clearer, and if the story was edited a little, but Bright, inspiring material is a dedicated, risky creation of documentaries, and it’s nice that Favela Rising was included at seven film festivals and won a number of awards, including the “Best New Documentary Film” at the Tribeca Film Festival. He is currently shown at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in London. Nevertheless, a wider audience of art-house in the US seems somewhat unlikely. <br /> <br /> Included in SFIFF 2006.
