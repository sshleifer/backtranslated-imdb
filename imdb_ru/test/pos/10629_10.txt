At the end of my review of Cash, I wrote that I was intrigued by Haneke as a director. This is what made me buy a DVD for La Pianiste, which I just finished watching about half an hour ago. <br /> << at the expense of everyone and everything in her life, starting with herself. She suppresses everything that frees her from the will imposed on them, including, of course, her sexuality, which literally exploded to such an extent of madness that she can no longer even understand what she feels like a genuine loving impulse. <br /> <br /> This is a graphic portrait of a serious emotional cripple who has never found the strength to break out of the situation of his childhood and become an adult. I think that this question concerns all of us - we all strive for autonomy, but there are needs, so many contradictory needs, most of which are not even on a conscious level. It also brilliantly considers the contrast between what a person fantasizes about sexually and the reality of these fantasies, as well as the consequences of the choice of dividing one's sexual fantasies with another person. Huppert's character gets what she asks during the film, and it was hardly the emancipative experience she imagined. <br /> <br /> A relatively widely discussed scene in the bathroom: I really appreciate how this sequence freed up all possible erotic charge (for the viewer, I mean) because of the previous scene where she put the glass in the girl's pocket. By the time she plays her “let's see if this guy is worthy” scenario in the bathroom, we already learned that she is dangerously alarmed, and therefore this is not her challenge, her little domination session with our poor is an unsuspecting deception. <br /> <br /> I think another incredible achievement of this film is that about halfway through, he completely forgot that he is not in English and that I read subtitles. This was never in any foreign film, and I saw a lot. <br /> <br /> In this film, like Kesh, the finale is not all wrapped up in a nice little neat bow, but unlike Cache, we at least get some sense of finality, despite the fact that we don't do that. even know for sure Huppert's character is alive or dead. After becoming acquainted with Pianist, when it comes to Michael Haneke, I, of course, are intrigued more than just a trifle.
