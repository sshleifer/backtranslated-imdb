I just watched this movie, and I must say that it surprised me. It was very well done, with good acting and a deep look at high school students from Japan with the love of teenagers. <br /> <br /> Appearance and feelings are very different from many movies, and you can easily get into the movie. Much of the emphasis seems to be in the story itself, which is extremely subtle. The main theme and relationships with other characters are a bit complicated. But the general feeling of realism and size still attracts you. <br /> <br /> The main drawback is, of course, those who love something simple. Which is not here. You must be open to many things, including a new culture, to learn more about the film. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. Worth seeing.
