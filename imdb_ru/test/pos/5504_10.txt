I think this film is the most misunderstood film in the career of Jerry Lewis. It's a bit of a slow start, but after it started, it's very funny, and Jerry uses irony like never before in his earlier films ... that is, who looks after the store, "Nutty Professor", etc. Dirty dock layout, instead of forcing soldiers on death row to carry out a suicide mission, as in this film, you have 4, 4, and 2 tags. Including former star field player former LA Dodger, Willie Davis as Link! HAPPY! I like this film!
