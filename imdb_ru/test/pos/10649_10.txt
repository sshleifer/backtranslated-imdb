Eisenstien's Potempkin (The Battleship Potemkin) is one of the best films ever made and perhaps the best of a silent era. Eisenshten was a pioneer of cinema format, and his use of editing has influenced films to this day. The shots from the “Odessa Steps” massacre are as strong today as the first time they were seen more than 70 years ago. Do not miss the chance to see this movie!
