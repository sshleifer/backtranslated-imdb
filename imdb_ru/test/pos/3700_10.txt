This is one of the best tv movies you have ever seen. Actor's, written and production values ​​are first-class. The performances are passionate about Beverly D'Angelo, who is great because an elderly woman with a teenage daughter and Rob Estes are just perfect as a young boyfriend. However, the best part of this film was how it showed the consequences of sexual abuse instead of going to the usual happy ending. This showed that violence can happen in good families; attract good people; and the ruin of life. Thought provokes and entertains. Congratulations to all who are interested in this exceptional film. <br /> <br />
