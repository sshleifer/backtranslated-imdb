At the beginning of the film, the character Johnny Cave of Cagney tells his peasants at the Weights and Measures Department that last year the unscrupulous store owners deceived the American consumer because of more money than the total national military debt! He then goes out and buys a particularly fat green grocery shop for a short sale to him of a bag of sugar, which costs four ounces (oh, horrors!), And one skinny chicken, which his butcher quite generously announced as six pounds. after which the fur - or in this case the feathers - flies.

The production standards are definitely class B, but Cagney is what makes this film amazing because this is his first film shot with Warner Brothers after he got released in court because of his unreasonable contract, and he seems to be at ease and getting great pleasure - the performance here is intellectual and crackles from its unique energy and impeccable charisma. The presence of May Clark gives Warner a certain feeling to the overall production. Supporting players turn into solid performances, and the story moves wisely after a rocky introduction that seems to start three or four drums in history - but sit back and enjoy it for the Cagney showcase and the exciting time capsule of the Depression-era that it is,
