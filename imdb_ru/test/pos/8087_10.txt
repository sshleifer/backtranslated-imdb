I just watched this film at the Berlin Film Festival's children's program, and he just killed me (and almost everyone else in the room)! And do not be mistaken about this, this film refers to an unprecedented 250! Let me tell you that I am in no way connected with the creators of this film, if you believe in it by reading this. No, but it really is! Never mind the label "children's film", "Klatretösen" ("Girl-climber") in almost all respects is a classic (as in the "biblical")! This story concerns the 12-year-old Ida (magnet: Julie Zangenberg), who is devastated after learning of her dad's deadly illness. A special operation in the United States will cost 1.5 million, and, of course, no one could afford it. So, Ida and her friends Jonas and Sebastian do what every good child would do - and rob a bank! Sounds trite? Do not forget: this is not America, and “Klatretösen” is by no means a jerky Robin-Williams multiplex-plat-du-jour, to which no one is serious. Directed by Fabian Wullenweber intended to make a comedy with a large budget for children and, boy, he succeeded! Let me put it this way: this film is staggering, like no children’s film, and few others have done it before. And this is much more than just “action.” After about a 20-minute exposure “by numbers” (well, of course,) it turns into a monster that: <br /> <br /> easily puts a “mission without shame” (numerous sequences of actions are masterfully organized and look very expensive - take it, mommy!) <br /> <br /> - in almost any other movie, the dwarves are indecisive (not just antics here, they are just children) <br /> <br /> - easily mixes a dense story with enough laughter, so Jim Carrey is looking for alternative career options <br /> <br /> - nods to Damon Runyon and the karate kid for those e seconds <br /> <br /> - comes up with so much evil humor that the computer side that I hear the US rating committee wet their pants from here <br /> <br /> - she really manages to be tender, serious and sexy at the same time (oh my God, what I say, they are children! they are children! - never mind, watch this last scene!) <br /> <br /> - stars Stafan Pajels Anderson, who from past years "Mirakel" is a favorite child an actor of each of us. <br /> <br /> trip!
