This episode is probably most closely related to the law of his partner Do not Kill, because it directly raises a controversial problem: “Why do we kill people who kill people to show that the murder is wrong?” This release is presented in two parts episode: before the murder, when the film shows the dichotomy between the idealistic novice lawyer and the street thug, so captured by his ways that his life is just an idea that he had to follow the period after the trial and before the execution, when both had to suffer for the death for which they feel responsible, and thus share. <br /> <br /> One of the great things about these work on the episodes is in both the small and big ways that the story is fully developed, so that we understand both the motivations and the stories of the characters with whom we can spend a little less than an hour. Despite all his criminal intentions and bullying, the killer is still very sympathetic, spinning the most important part of his actions around the story of the accident. His way of killing is more a desire to control death than any desire to actually destroy. In the same way, the idealistic naivety of a lawyer shows an unwillingness to allow death in a world where he cannot control her. Their meeting is really important; they both must succumb to it without spreading it. <br /> <br /> Also, I wonder how much this episode affects the viewing of Rouge, Kieslowski's later completion of the Trois Colors trilogy. It seems that one of the most significant influences of Kislovsky is the idea of ​​justice, and, given that the Decalogue is a meditation on something that represents Divine Justice, this one seems almost the most shy. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
