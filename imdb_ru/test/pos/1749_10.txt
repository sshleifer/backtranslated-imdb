People who know me say that I have a weakness for animated films. <br /> <br /> To be honest, these people are FULLY right. My real weakness is in exceptionally well-made animated films, such as this vintage family film by Max and David Fleisher. <br /> <br /> You might think: “Well, if it’s so great, why haven’t I heard about it?” Honest Question This film was released the same week as the Pearl Harbor attacks. Inevitably bad timing made the film plunge into relative obscurity. However, the situation is improving, because she finally came out on a DVD called "BUGVILLE". <br /> <br /> It's funny that the film went through all this, because it seemed to reflect the real plot. Although some people claim that the film is trying to send an environmental message (pah), I personally believe that the main idea of ​​the film is perseverance in difficulties and difficulties (after all, the country was barely out of depression at the time). . <br /> <br /> Our grasshopper hero, Hoppiti, desperately wants to help his endangered community. Problem: every time he tries, whether by the evil will of others or simply by failure, he fails miserably ... and gradually begins to earn the contempt of the very people he is trying to save. Although he does his best to maintain a positive outlook, he sometimes fails, and it is only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he gets up on his feet and leads a good fight. Just a healthy reminder that when all is said and done, no one really is self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> “Good,” you say. "It has a good message (two in fact). Does it really make it EXCLUSIVELY GOOD?" <br /> <br /> My answer is: partially. <br /> <br /> This is not just the message that makes this movie special. This is a characteristic. This is one of those films where you can simply see the individuality of each actor in their animation. You almost don't even need conversational lines. A good way to summarize is “energetic” or “lively.” Many films used the point of sale, "an attractive set of characters." Whenever I hear this phrase, it always makes me think about this film. <br /> <br /> Case studies, bad guys: hit a fly and hit a mosquito. There are “cute” villains in many films, but I don’t think that you will find them as funny or cute as these guys. Forget that 3 cartoon Stooges from the 60s. Swat and Smack are the closest thing to the animated version of Mo and Curly (but, unfortunately, not Larry) that you will ever find. Almost all the funniest moments are somehow connected with this terrible couple. Yes, they are rotten non-hooters, but you still care about them. This kind of power you see only from a really talented writer, director and film crew. <br /> <br /> There are two short jokes about racial stereotypes in the film (Native Americans and Chinese). I don't think they were meant to be evil; but they are there, whatever. They did not bother me, but it would be unfair of me not to warn someone whom they might disturb. <br /> <br /> So, if you share my weakness (and I think you do), give it one time.
