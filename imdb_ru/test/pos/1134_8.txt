Therefore, when I first saw the advertisement of the Greek language, I had a few questions about how they are going to approach Greek life, whether they are going to give away the sacred fraternities and secrets of the female society if they are going to focus on the brother and sisterhood, brotherhood. or engaging in fellowship, or what most college students think of Greek life as a huge party. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it covered everything. The plot of the story was great, he gave you a character you need to love, hate, someone you want to be, someone you don't want to be, and, of course, a crazy roommate! <br /> <br /> This was one of my first glances at what the writers believed that Greek life was like, and I can honestly say that they hammered the nail pretty dead. <br /> <br /> I like how one of the biggest things they covered during the season was the relationship between Rusty and his crazy roommate. It's hard enough to leave home and be forced to live in a small room with someone you don't even know, and then find out ... you have nothing in common. Probably every college associates freshmen with a worst nightmare. <br /> <br /> Sister Rusty Casey was a typical campus girl envied by EVERYTHING. What did she not have? Oh, that's right .. Evan is all for himself. Rebecca and Evan had a “romance” at the beginning of the season that made you sympathetic to Casey. Her character developed, and her relationship with Rusty became more and more loving and sociable. <br /> <br /> Keppie is one of the most fun and completely insane characters. One of my favorite episodes was that he was completely crushed in a strip club, and Rusty had to call Casey to help them out. I like the way they solve the problem of gays in Greek homes, Calvin was a very sensitive character, and I really respected him because he adhered to his standards. So Jen K was pretty crazy, but she really liked Rusty. It was amazing, and I kept asking her from the beginning, but, of course, I wanted it to work between her and Rusty. <br /> <br /> I am definitely looking forward to the return of the Greek. It takes you to the truth of Greek life, something that many people look to the past. One of the biggest things that brothers and women's clubs are famous for is parties and drunkenness. Greek is a great show, and it’s easy to communicate with characters.
