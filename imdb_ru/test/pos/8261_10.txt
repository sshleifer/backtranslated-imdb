Please let me know of any versions of “Precious Bane” or “Gone to Earth” in a video that people may know about. I truly love the books of Mary Webb and would appreciate any information on a VHS or DVD. <br /> <br /> I read “The Precious Curses and Gone on Earth”, which are my favorite Mary Webb, many times, and collected other novels by her as well. I was lucky that I found her poems and compositions "Spring Joys", but I could not see the version of "The Precious Curse", which was at the Theater of Masterpieces, or the full version of "Gone to Earth", although there was an American film “Wild Heart”, which was a split version of the film “Gone to Earth”. <br /> <br /> If someone can help me get copies of one or both of these films (full versions), I would be very grateful!
