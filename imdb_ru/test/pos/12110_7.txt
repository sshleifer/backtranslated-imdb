The rare long role of Kinsky in the role of the Mad Johnny, the mad sex criminal who is wanted in San Francisco. The Kinsky character is obsessed with the rape of women - a sexual predator in the old west, who has nothing but theft, rape and murder in his mind. This film may be a big disappointment for many spaghetti-western fans, but not for many Klaus Kysnki fans. In general, he had two things: the excellent performance of Klaus Kinski and the excellent musical accompaniment of Stelvio Cipriani. <br /> <br /> Another storyline for which you had to do a lot more work to be impressive, but still fun to watch! <br /> <br /> It would be nice to see this movie in the future. Since most of the old films are being revised.
