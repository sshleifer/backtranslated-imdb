Fame was released in the United States a year before I was born; I was too young to remember the original version of the Fame, and yet I heard and read many things about it. For example, the fact that he spawned the series and that its soundtrack was led by Irina Kara, the hit Giogio Moroder, "Glory." <br /> <br /> Glory may have been the first of its kind to portray and demonstrate the World of Performing Arts in the form of a full-length film. The life, the struggle, the obstacles faced by the students and some teachers were under the supervision of the audience. <br /> <br /> The performances were great, but I especially liked Gene Anthony Ray. He played a troublesome but promising Leroy. Angry, frustrated and at first rude, his character became less angry and frustrated and more devoted to his training - not only practical, but theoretical. Irene Cara was good in the role of Koko - the scene in which she shot the blouse, while some sly director was shooting her, was rather inconvenient to watch, and also Paul McCrane for his amazing image of a vulnerable but reticent homosexual trying to cope with life he entered the performing arts school in New York after he was kicked out of the army when he told them that he was gay. Ralph, played by Barry Miller, was interesting, but sometimes his character got on my nerves. <br /> <br /> The choreography was excellent, there were some nice dance numbers, and the “hot lunch” scene in the dining room was worth watching. Another great scene took place when the song “Glory” sounded, and all the children began to run out onto the streets of New York and dance wildly and without care in the world. It was a street jam, like no other. <br /> <br /> Debbie Allen was and remains the only star who really benefited from this in the long run, later she became a producer, director and star, although she mostly worked behind the scenes for shows like “Everyone Hates Chris” and Fresh Prince Bel Air. Later, Paul McCrane starred with Peter Weller in the movie Robocop, where he played the villain and E.R. in the role of the judgmental, disgusting Dr. Romano. <br /> <br /> British director Alan Parker shot it really well. he allowed the performers to dance, play, sing in the shower, not wanting to interfere and influence their styles. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, we see various stages that students face during 4 years. years - from listening to the beginner year, right up to graduation at the New York High School of Art. <br /> <br /> “Glory” is one of those films that serves a certain audience or is focused on it. It is not necessarily the generally accepted community of movie lovers - it is definitely not for everyone. <br /> <br /> I, for example, liked it, because I am interested in art - not from a technical point of view, to be a performer, because I am not alone, but as one who appreciates that creativity and artistic expression can be inherited through hard work, commitment and passion for what everyone does with their talents. So if you're a budding dancer, an actor, or just a creative person, you might be interested in a movie like this - although the events in Glory are similar to those in a real-life college / performing arts school? life, then this is another matter. <br /> <br /> A 2009 remake of this film was released recently and, frankly, it almost pales in comparison. <br /> <br /> As for the original Fame, almost 30 years have passed, although yes, it is a bit outdated, but, nevertheless, it is a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is not just a classic, but as the iconic classic of the 80s, according to other dance films of the 80s, such as Footloose and Flashdance, Fame hits the mark. Is it not a coincidence that all these dance films begin with the letter “F”? <br /> <br /> Sandy, touching and intriguing, this one is worth a look.
