I don't have enough cable vision, and I no longer have DirecTV. Therefore, as a resident of the countryside, I have to wait for the DVD releases. Being a lover of blondes, but not blondes, I have, of course, not only "Barbed Wire", but also "Striperella: the full first season." I have not yet found a "VIP" or second season for Stripperella. I have a Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding DVD. I have problems "Playboy", which put Pamela Denise Anderson. I could go on. I love Pamela! There is no one or anything that could make me feel guilty about enjoying Striperella. But there are some elements that I don’t like, but which I like, because other TV shows sometimes mention smoking and drinking alcohol. But these are my personal inclinations, and I try not to let them spoil the pleasure of TV shows like me. I was also embarrassed by the change in style of animation, but I adapted. However, the number of female nudes has decreased, and this is a big disappointment, as many expect it on the show with such a premise. But then I adapted again. One of my favorite episodes of "Mork & Mindy" was when they met Robin Williams! So, of course, one of my favorite episodes of "Striperella" is when Pamela and Tommy visit the club, and the comparisons begin! If there really is “Season 2,” I hope I can find it, because, as the most complete, I need to complete the collection. I recommend this to other fans of the female form and lovers of blondes. (Hey! Psst! "Blonde" and "Blondes" - this is a female form for writing the words "Blond"! Your software should already know this!)
