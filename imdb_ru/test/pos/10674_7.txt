Journey to the Far Side of the Sun (also known as The Twin) is an entertaining science-fiction proposal in the Twilight Zone style by Jerry and Sylvia Anderson (crew from Space: 1999, UFO, Thunderbirds, Fireball XL-5 and others). In the film, Roy Tinnes (from the TV show "Invaders") and the star Ian Hendry in the role of astronauts go on a flight to a planet that shares the exact orbit of the Earth, but on the opposite side from the Sun; hence it was previously hidden from view. Assertive European director of space flight (because of which the late Patrick Wiemark) played the flight quickly, and after careful preparation, the astronauts are ready to go. This is how the best episodes of the film begin: launch, flight and landing on “other” land. Dazzling miniature rocket work (Derek Maddings) and the fabulous, elegant space flight (reminiscent of the best moments of "2001: A Space Odyssey") are the highlights of the film. Landing on the "double" land is both exciting and terrible. After this, the Twilight Zone film begins; with the plot, filmed almost entirely from the classic episode TZ "Parallel". In addition, the film is still science fiction, with some intriguing things from the “mirror world” that need to be chewed on (for example, writing backwards and handshakes with your left hand). Less successful are scenes depicting the land of the mid-21st century; where all men wear turtlenecks and Nehru jackets, and all women wear miniskirts. Some of the relationships with women in the film, by today's standards, are also “not on the PC.” And (in the most consistent failure of most science fiction works of the 20th century) computers, phones, and other equipment are all big, colorful, and awkward (right from Patrick McGuan's The Prisoner). No one foresaw the era of digital microprocessors! If you can accept these shortcomings in foresight, the film will be very interesting, and Tinnes in the role of a worried cosmonaut will demonstrate a solid lead role. And with a beautiful nihilistic finale of the 1960s-early 70s style! For lovers of retro science fiction (like me) this “Journey” is worth it!
