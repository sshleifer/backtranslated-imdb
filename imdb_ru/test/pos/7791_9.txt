The most pleasant thing about this film is that you can watch it again and again, and yet you will not be happy with its viewing. I watched this movie at least 10 times in the last 12 years, and yet it makes me laugh, as if I was watching it for the first time. I really like good comics like Orgazmo, Cheech n chong, Monty Python and many others, but this one in Hindi is one of my favorite outstanding movies. Some of them recently in Hindi are the Golmaal, Munnabhai and Herapheri series. So all I can say is that Hind Comedy is finally developing. But Andaaz Apna Apna is quite different from the films I mentioned above. This is what I call comic in Hindi, and very few of those that were found in 1994 in the Hindi cinema. Hail Rajkumar Santoshi for a brilliant movie.
