Dude, it's great, just to see young and restless star Melody Thomas Scott as something other than frivolous Nikki Newman! A doctor with a brain no less! And it is very nice to see her with such magnificent Lorenzo Lamy instead of Victor Newman! <br /> <br /> Mel plays in the college of a professor of microbiology, who with his son travels to the islands for spring break, only to be a prisoner of an island infected with a rapidly spreading virus. Comfortable for her is the unique character performed by Lorenzo, who has a daughter of the same age as her son. <br /> <br /> Mel shines, as does Lorenzo, with a slight replay from the younger couple. Interesting premises in these times speak of chemical and biological terrorism. Worth seeing, especially for Y & R fans.
