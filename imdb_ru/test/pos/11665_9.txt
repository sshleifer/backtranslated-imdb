The Walking Dead is an incredible movie. All actions are first-rate and realistic, and the scenario addresses the issue of the death penalty on both sides, giving equal respect to both. First of all, it is a deeply touching story about redemption, death with dignity and loss of ego. Any film that courageously and maturely talks about such incredibly complex topics deserves a score of 10/10. Thanks Tim Robbins!
