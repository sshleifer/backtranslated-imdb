David Suchet, (Poirot), “FoolProof”, '03, showed outstanding results as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. If he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin to soak up the excess on his lips with incredible perfection! You can simply look at the detective's facial expressions and see that he never missed an important element in the behavior of the suspects. The beautiful colors of autumn across the English countryside were breathtaking. Megan Dodds, The Bait, 2000, an outstanding performance of a very sexy, wild woman who can hide very important secrets from Mr. Poirot. Very nice movie, if you really like to play David Suchet in the role of Mr. Poirot!
