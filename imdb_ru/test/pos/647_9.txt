Intended to become a kind of social commentary about how our life got out of control in the 1970s, this film looks more like what Schlesinger threw together after a bad day on the freeway. With a mix of nut slices found along the Florida freeway and along the life freeway, the cast basically disappears and is probably on the floor of the cutting room. The problem is that what NOT ended up on the floor of the cutting room should be! Currently available on DVD, itâ€™s pretty funny to see a comedy whose production would cost $ 100 million if it was made in 2004. It rolls forward and is not too difficult to live through, and, oddly enough, in 2004 we are all mostly just <br /> <br /> jumping in our cars and going faster and faster, not going anywhere.
