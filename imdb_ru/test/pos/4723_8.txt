This film worked on two goals: to make a political point of view and tell a scary adventure story. It is often difficult to make a political point of view and still tell a good story (consider the extremely political, but rarely interesting, final season of Ellen). Outside of Rangoon, there is a good balance between politics and storytelling. <br /> <br /> I already knew that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and knew something about the oppressive political situation in Burma, so the political message of the film was basically the dramatization of what I already knew. . But I thought that the film spoke well of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and of faceless dictators who had tried for years to silence her. A way of presenting an unfamiliar environment through the eyes of a character with whom viewers can identify themselves is quite common, but in this film this is pretty well done. <br /> <br /> Of course, the real measure of the film was its entertainment value. Arquette was gorgeous, like a young woman whose sister took her to a faraway, unfamiliar place to bring her out of depression due to the violent death of her husband and son. She is convincingly suspended and depressed. Her state of grief gives her a clear reason for her abstract wanderings in the thick of a dangerous situation, which she does not understand, something with which she might be too smart to face her. <br /> <br /> As soon as the dangers become so obvious that she can see through them even through a cloud of grief, she is trapped and it is not easy for her to escape. This puts her on a journey of adventure, where she needs intelligence to survive. The authors deserve great praise for having made her smart enough and resourceful to cope with numerous dangerous situations, and at the same time find a plausible reason why she could be so stupid that she immediately got into trouble. The director is also strong, maintaining tension throughout the race to avoid the forces of dictatorship. <br /> <br /> This film had an additional impact on me and my wife due to other events of the same time period. We were preparing for a trip to India and heard news about Western tourists who were taken hostage by a terrorist group in India. Avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is not at all something that a repressive dictatorship needs to be avoided. But the film and the news divided the element of avoiding danger in an unfamiliar country. This general description gave the film a meaning that surpasses its skillful storytelling. The film illustrates the worst nightmare of an international tourist.
