Victor Matrei, as a barely civilized and largely uncontrolled mountain man and catcher, may be on the poster, but Robert Preston is like a collapsed Union colonel who brought his men to be “cut to ribbons” by confederate artillery in Shiloh, and sent to the fort in Oregon for its incompetence, has the most interesting part, is married to a young and difficult to find out first Ann Bancroft. An uncivilized mature man thirsts for the colonel's wife, giving the film an interesting and even grim plot that comes to the mention that at some point he craves the wife of another man, James Whitmore, who plays a mature and wise father of a mountain man at a mature age. Directed by Anthony Mann, this film is lost among his more famous westerns with James Stewart, but even then you don’t need an Indian threat to make this film worthy of attention, although Preston will prove his poor judgment as a commander again on a failed expedition to finally subdue Indians, in a well-organized attack in the middle of the forest, which quickly turns into a rout.
