It is widely believed that Hayao Miyazaki is a master of his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful plot lines and similar imaginative characters. His films, from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA and MONONOKE until the recent HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, are not only superbly presented in terms of art, but also in terms of making films. Can this person do wrong? Not really, but it is impossible to expect that each of his films will always be a five-star miracle. His newest film “PONYO”, not ashamed of the family story about the “golden fish out of the water”, is just as pompously animated and animated by interesting characters, as one would expect ... and yet this is his first film, which penetrates the “smaller” territory Don't misunderstand me, PONYO is not a bad film. As already mentioned, this is a sight for the eyes, and it is as charming and charming as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that the story does not stay afloat to satisfy anyone who craves. another exciting, in-depth story. <br /> <br /> In the first hour PONYO's work is the story of Miyazaki's story in all its glory, which is noisy and fun, an overly young goldfish (later called Ponyo) makes a forbidden journey into the world of people, where it is later adopted by a boy of her own age named Sosuke (following the pattern that interests , in honor of the director’s own son.) This doesn’t please Father Ponyo, a mysterious wizard named Fujimoto, who is very angry with people for their destruction of the sea (this topic of environmentalists is not much different from other Miyazaki films) ... a problem that he very much intendsdecide creating jellyfish from the nose of his submarine. He divides the pair and tries to persuade Ponyo to stay under water with him. Goldfish, however, had already tried both Sosuke's blood (healing of a cut on his finger) and part of human food (ham, to which she was inexplicably addicted), and, of course, steals her father's forbidden potions, turning into a hyperactive young girl ( which is May spit from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO). This causes a dangerous tsunami that threatens to swallow the whole world with water. In agreement with his wife, Grand Mamara, a transparent sea goddess, who alternately moves from a large titanium to a human-sized form, Fujimoto decides to test the love of two young people for each other. They do this by raising the sea to the level of the Sosuke house, prompting young people to sail through their now-filled world of the ocean in a huge toy boat (which was made possible by Ponio's own magical powers). <br /> <It is at this point that PONYO begins to run out of steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are amazing, and the scenes with them are funny and cute, they slow down the movie. Unfortunately, the film actually acquires water, and at this moment Sosuke has to prove his love for Ponyo, presented in such a strange way in an anti-climatic and haste manner, which abruptly stops the charming story. This is likely to crush viewers waiting for the next instant masterpiece from a man who has staged much more interesting finals for many of his other films. Remember the destruction of Laputa? Is Satsuki looking for little May? Kiki saves Tombo? Fighting Porco Rosso with Curtis? Saving the head of the Forest Spirit? Or even a test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All these resolutions were much more satisfactory and more complete than this. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, PONYO cannot be blamed. The animation is simply gorgeous, it was created without a single snapshot of computer-generated images, and naturally, Joe Hisaishi gives us another exciting music; The best moments are exciting sequences under water, accompanied by the chorus and soprano voice. And backgrounds with love are drawn and detailed, like any other Ghibli films. <br /> <br /> Having established itself as a worthy translation and duplication of previous Ghibli films into English with excellent results, Disney Studios and Pixar once again provide English. dub complete with mostly capable actors. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke, sounds very natural and believable. Noah Cyrus in the role of Ponyo, on the other hand, sometimes screams out her lines with all his might before finally settling down to the end. Among other things, the rest of the cast includes Liam Neeson as the overprotected Fujimoto (who is unsurprisingly well-controlled with the character), Cate Blanchett as Gran Mamara the roles of the constantly living father of the sea Sosue Koichi (who is good, but nothing to write about), and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of these, Fay is the best voice in the entire cast, filling the character with only the necessary amount of spirit and personality. Her scenes with Sosuke show real chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Lichman, who was as impressive as Dola in The Castle in the Sky, is disappointedly lost as one of three elderly disabled women (she has almost NO ANY line!), Also voiced by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Of these, only Tomlin’s character, a strange woman named Toki, shows some kind of real personality, but if I were to play in the film, I would change Tomlin to Leachman. Probably the only really unpleasant drawback of the dub is the brilliant techno remix of the memorable (but ridiculously repetitive) title song of the film, which, fortunately, does not occur until the middle of the through credits. <br /> <br /> On the whole, PONYO is a good film; Excellent animation work that is ideal for young people and family audiences. However, due to the loss of momentum towards the end, it is far from consistent with the classical status. Since Miyazaki, at least, is still better than most other animated films, I will be generous and recommend PONYO a full star recommendation, because any of its functions are still worth seeing, especially on the big screen. (Be sure to catch him in theaters while you can.)
