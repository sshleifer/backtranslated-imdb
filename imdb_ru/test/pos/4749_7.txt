How did they get this cinematic snapshot of the car, faced with the back of the semi-automatic? And then Roy sits down - great! It looks like the DVD is scheduled for May 2006 - about time! See it on the big screen or in the cinema, if possible, in the cinema to fully appreciate the aspect ratio. My other favorites in this category are: Original Italian work with Michael Caine; Bullet with Steve McQueen; To live and die in Los Angeles with a guy from CSI when he was young; French connection to Gene Hackman; Ronin with Robert Deniro; Point of meeting with Barry Newman; Enemy of the state again with Hackman - What are your favorites?
