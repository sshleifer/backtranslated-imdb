Well, I recognize right away that the Inki cartoons made by Loony Tunes are quite offensive, and I can understand why Warner Brothers took them off the market. Today, the huge and very stereotypical Inca is not politically correct. However, the cartoons were well made, and it is a shame that they were not released with some explanatory prologue (for example, the one with Leonard Maltin, which they included in some recently politically incorrect Donald Dhac cartoons that were recently released on DVD ). In other words, to completely throw out cartoons is to forget our story. In addition, the Inca, Little Black Sambo and other racist cartoons are, especially on the Internet. <br /> <br /> In this Inca cartoon, our little hero is hunting. At first he chases a cute little caterpillar, but later he accidentally hits a lion - a lion who is more than happy to make the Inca his lunch. However, through all this, strange Mina appears again and again ... and in the end you will understand why this bird is so important to the story. <br /> <br /> Nice, well made and smart. I like the Inca cartoons. In addition, Iâ€™m happy to show them extremely thin-skinned liberal friends, just to see how they have apoplectic seizures or even heart attacks. Lots of fun guys!
