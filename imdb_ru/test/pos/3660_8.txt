I was so happy to know that Hari Om will finally come out theatrically in 2007. I saw this film three years ago at the Vancouver International Film Festival and have been waiting for its release ever since, so I was able to send everyone I know to watch. It's like a trip to India ... colorful, magical, thought-provoking. In addition to one rather strange Hollywood-style rickshaw scene, this film is very realistic. This is not a Bollywood style song and dance, but it has drama, romance and humor. The interaction of the Indian taxi driver and the French tourist is a good reflection of the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western lifestyles and philosophy. The characters are a bit widely drawn, but the game was very good. Visually, this film is a pleasure, because you really get an idea of ​​how to drive through Rajasthan ... like in a fairy tale. Sometimes it's hard to believe that everything you see and experience is real ... the film has the same quality. Great soundtrack too!
