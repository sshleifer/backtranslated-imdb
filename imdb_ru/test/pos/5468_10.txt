I have not seen him since 1998, and yet I STILL cannot get it out of my head or stop recommending people to find him to show what impression he made. <br /> <br /> Just a great story. <br /> I just hope to see the stairs at least once in person ... <br /> <br /> I didn’t know much about Mr. Petersen before this film, because I hadn’t seen any of his previous works but his subtle action in this impressed me, and I think that his image of Grissom on CSI just shows more of the same. He knows enough to allow the character to shine through, not to shine through to the actor, which makes him much better than the actor. <br /> <br /> I can't remember enough “bad accents” to comment, but I have to say that I always liked Barbara Hershey in all her roles, and I thought she also did a phenomenal job in this the movie.
