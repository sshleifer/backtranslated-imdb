Here is a well-made military history, beautifully shot and well played. The image of the Italian and German occupation of the Greek island of Kefalonia is well done. John Hurt, like Pelagia’s father and island doctor, is magnificent, Nicolas Cage copes well with the role of captain, Penelope Cruz is well able to be beautiful and beat her eyelashes in Cage. Here, heroism and humor, drama and romance, and all this happens on an idyllic island. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, a very similar, or, I would say, almost identical storyline, with the same characters going through the same series of events, is told in a novel under the same name written by Louis de Bernier. This remarkable historical novel tells the story of beautiful Pelagia, the daughter of Dr. Yannis, and their life in Kefalonia during the Second World War. Pelagia’s bride, the local fisherman Mandras, is enlisted in the army when the Italian army invades northern Greece from Albania under false pretenses. When the Axis finally finally prevails, with great help from the Germans, a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island, and Captain Corelli plays a big role in maintaining the peaceful occupation. When Mandras joins the partisans, the charming Corelli and his mandolin live with the doctor and his beautiful daughter. Of course, this makes a love story. But it is also a military novel, a brief account of the history of Greece, a story about the communist uprising in post-war Greece, a portrait of Mussolini’s madness and, most importantly, an ode to life on an island in Kefalonia. <br /> <br /> Some of these elements are returned in the film, but in general it is an impossible book for the film. I'm glad no one ever tried. <br /> <br /> Captain Corelli's Mandolin, however, is worth seeing. Just make sure you read the book * after * watching the movie.
