I just wanted to point out (in addition to the request for the release of the series on DVD) that the show should not be realistic to be interesting. Nowadays, with all the blood and blood in the news and crime dramas, reality shows, etc. It's nice to get lost in a good, fun show with entertaining characters. PWOG meets all requirements. Was it Emmy stuff? No, but it was awesome. <br /> <br /> I also have to vote for the second act - they were more charismatic than the actors of the first season. I would definitely agree that the first season had a more serious atmosphere than the second, but the last cast was definitely more drawn. Although the series has been taken off the air for many years, I will never stop hoping that it will be released for purchase.
