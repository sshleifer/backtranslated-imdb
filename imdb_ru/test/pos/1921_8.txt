Even if you usually do not like documentaries, most likely you will find it fascinating. Not only does it have a well-composed site, which, although easy to follow, contains its interesting workarounds; it also has a very strong emotional resonance, and not one that relies on a simple, specific tone. Instead, the emotions here are as deep and turbulent as the seas. <br /> <br /> As the saying goes, if you don’t know anything about Donald Crowhurst and the 1968 one-hand race around the world ... as was the case for me ... please stop reading and rent / view This movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOLLOW <br /> <br /> My friend Brian recommended this at the same time that my aunt sent me a clipping linking this film to the work of Antonioni. In 2007, I was hypnotized by several films by Antonioni, still there! To associate this film with Antonioni, I think it’s a bit stretched, the character that you can most likely see in one of Michaelangelo’s films is Francoise Moisier de Casalet. Funny on the main page of IMDb, it is not even listed as playing "Himself", which is probably a function of its long name, unlike its self-realization / renunciation. Since the Moitessier sails straight from the race, it can be considered a bit like Anna in L'Avventura. Quite an important secondary character. <br /> <br /> Although there are many things to love in this film: the actual footage of the time, the fearless best friend, the absolute power of the Roaring Forties, I left with a simple connection. Man, really at sea. There were times in my life when I wondered how I got to such a point, being between dreams and reality, feeling like a free-rider in my own skin. Maybe I read too much in this documentary, and the directors, in turn, read too much in Crowhurst, but I discovered that this feeling is just as fascinating as the other secrets stored in this film. <br /> <br /> On a casual occasion, that Crowhurst’s wife (who looked like a wonderful study of restraint with understandably contradictory overtones) and his children (so young in the frames found and still young at that late stage in the sense of their pain pride in their father), I am sure that the comments here and the film itself cannot catch the person who was your father. However, in his death, he gave the world a glimpse of something like a lost myth, he is an Odyssey before GPS. Never the discovery of his body adds to the atmosphere a fragile immortality, if not the growth of a cosmic being about which he wrote. <br /> <br /> This movie stays with you after watching, as if you are expecting another twist to come out of the deep water. Or at least you are looking to continue the Moitessier. <br /> <br /> Thurston Hunger 8/10
