My mother always told me to sit down and watch this movie, because this is one of her favorite films, which I haven't done for years until I caught one night on TV. This film was great, I do not even know how to explain it. Not only is the great cast (Julia Roberts, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin and Oliver Platt), but the story is amazing. This is strange, but not too scary and makes you wonder. After this film, I was speechless and was amazed at how good the actors and actresses are, all five of these people. Where William Baldwin is gone, he's great. This film should be seen by everyone, if you have not rented it, you will not regret it. Amazing
