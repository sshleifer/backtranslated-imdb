This film is complex and interesting in many ways. This is a non-stop set of emotions and taboo topics. Sex and love. Emotional abuse of women over men, Physical abuse of men over women, Sexual abuse of children, A fresh approach to religion in real life, and all this is connected with very raw and powerful blues music. <br /> <br /> I promise you that if you Sit the first 20 minutes, you will find the connection and improvement of all the characters. And the finale will be more enjoyable than you can expect. The music is outstanding, her composition is powerful, and playing from everyone is brilliant. <br /> <br /> There are several great features on the DVD, including the experience of Samuel Jackson - learning to play the guitar and feel the blues. <br /> <br /> This film is not for children and I even warn parents of teenagers.
