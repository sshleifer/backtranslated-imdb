I love this film. Strained with great characters. The kid from Sandlot is superb, like Corey Feldman. When kids storm the bank, it's pure adrenaline. Inside the bank, this is a bit like the “Lord of the Flies” situation when they turn to each other. Justin Walker from Clueless is wonderful. I saw it on “Showtime” while surfing on the channel. It was a pleasant surprise. James Remar is also pretty good here, like the little town of Sheriff. Taylor Nichols, whom I love from Barcelona, ​​also works well as a federal agent. I recommend this movie for any fan of bank robbery films with lots of good characters. I was shocked when I learned that Roger Corman was the producer of this film, since the film is not film B.
