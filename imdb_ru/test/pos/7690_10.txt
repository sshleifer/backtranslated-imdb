I saw it on TV more years ago than I remember, but I never forgot Sammy Davis Jr.'s performance. I just thought to watch it on video. This performance of Porgy and Bess is a treasure. I would like to see it again and introduce my son as well. I just can't imagine why this is not proclaimed as one of the greatest performances that everyone gave to Sammy Davis Jr. Whoever is responsible for not bringing it to the audience should be ashamed of their ignorance. I will keep looking for it though. Perhaps the leaders responsible for such things will come to understand the forgotten work of many African-American actors.
