Simon Wests pg-13 thriller about the nanny, who gets disturbing pranks while sitting in a mansion, is neither original nor exciting enough to be called a good movie. Despite the fact that there are some elements of expectation, a good look and decent characters, the film is another one, I know what you did last summer, as it is not taken seriously. The performances were fine, but nothing special in this film, I say, skip it, if you are not looking for a mediocre film, you can find better films than this one, for life, well, maybe not for life, but, at least the US or something, ha ha. ... <br /> <br /> 7/10
