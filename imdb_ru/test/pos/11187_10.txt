A group of evil businessmen need to demolish the building to build a huge complex, but they can not rent tenants. Tenants and businessmen with their hired thugs face, until the film ends one of the funniest fights in the whole history! The red-haired guy who says “eeeeehhhh” every time he strikes, and another guy who poses with a knife in his mouth, instead of fighting, only to be knocked out of the camera, will make this important viewing if you want laugh at movies, not with them.
