I loved this movie when I was younger, and I was really looking for it again !! I would love to watch it again !! All the information is correct, but the cover does not look as it would be - although I canâ€™t say for sure. From what I remember, the film was about these children (Alyssa Milano, Tina Yoters, etc.) in the driving class, and it also shows the harm they experience outside the class. Edie McClurg was the mother of Alyssa Milano in the film. I remember what I really liked, so if anyone knows where I can get a copy (preferably a DVD) of the movie listed above (with these stars in it), I would like to know. Thank :)
