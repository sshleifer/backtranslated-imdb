If (as I just pointed out in GOAT) Keaton follows a tradition of comics that conflicts with the law, this short film by Langdon (the last one released before he made TRAMP, TRAMP, TRAMP) was based on another comic trick - to be married to an insightful spouse and try to escape from secret dates. Laurel and Hardy did this in several films, like Fields and Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with this - why do these characters always marry such nasty women? And there is an interesting sociological side problem - why don’t you find female comics married to male counterparts of the obstinate? I can't remember anything except in the Carol Burnett parody, where two more nasty members of two couples discover that they prefer someone to return them as well as they get (a kind of mutual sadomasochism, but also an assertion that they are not married to the Namby-Pamby type). As for the fact that comics really marry the recalcitrant, I suppose that one can imagine that they get what they deserve. Or are they? Does Olli really deserve a wife who throws pots and dishes at him? Yes, he went to that congress in Sons of the Desert, which ruined her plans, but he wanted to devote some personal time — nothing says that he and Stan cheated on their wives. In fact, May Bush screams him because he lied to her when Stan fainted and told the truth to his wife. <br /> <br /> Here, from the very beginning, Harry’s wife (Alice Ward) is shown talking to her mother about how she is keeping him under strict control. We see Harry at his work (this is Saturday morning, and work ends at noon until the end of the weekend - this was before the idea of ​​a five-day work week 40 hours a week). He works in a foundry, where he throws hot metal into a mold (an early joke about Langdon - he is a small, light man, not muscular, to swing a sledgehammer). He just misses his tram, trying to give a person light. He calls home to explain something, and gets Mrs. from two minutes late. <br /> <br /> On the way home, Harry meets his friend Steve (Vernon Dent), who met two cute, lovely girls who just wanted to go on a date. Harry hesitates, but agrees to this after talking to the girl (he agrees to pay for hot dogs for the four - he has a silver half dollar of 1926 in his pocket). But his plans seem frustrated when his wife discovers his hidden "cache" of coins. He hides it under the living room rug and finds it walking along the edge of the rug. But his wife is spying on him and confiscating it all. Later, she hears him talking to himself and scolding her. With scorn she returns him a dime and says that he can treat his date to soda. <br /> <br /> But Harry has a second box of coins, and he puts on a date - and leaves. He and Dent seem to be late, and Dent blames Harry, but Harry is trying to catch up: he produces two prostitutes. They fall into a quarrel when Dent (wisely) says that they are not one of those girls whom he called "nice." In the end, the girls appear, and the date begins. But soon, Harry hides in the roar, as his wife drives past in her roadster, and girlfriends appear - angry at their two rivals. <br /> <br /> Short work works well, funny, and gives a better idea of ​​the person that Harry Langdon developed in his brief glory as a master of comics. He is constantly dressed by others. He misses his tram because some stranger keeps asking for smoke and light, and in the end the stranger gets his own. A cute girl who is dating Harry has a little dog that chases him away. He rests between two cars, which both start to leave, and he is wrapped around a pole. This, of course, suggests that Langdon has already managed to work on his screen. If only he could keep the complex whole together, besides these three first features.
