I am an Australian currently living in Japan. I saw this movie on TV here and was very impressed with the accuracy and honesty in depicting the clash of Western and Japanese ideologies. Whoever wrote the script and made this film, he should know well what it means to be a foreigner living in Japan. The only part that seemed too Hollywood to me was when the character of Tom Selleck kissed the woman in the center of her office, and she let him. Public manifestations of love here are not quite acceptable. Finally a film that emphasizes the true experience of "gaijin"! 9/10
