Good, so I like to play Aidan Quinn even with a bad script. This is not the case in Assignment. As other viewers said, it was a movie that I stumbled across the cable and got so carried away that I didn’t want it to end. Take one Cuban-American Navy (Quinn), who is an honest, worried soldier and family man. Add a crazy agent (Donald Sutherland) who is looking for the most famous terrorist in the world, and add Ben Kingsley, and you will receive the "Task". Sutherland is witnessing the most notorious terrorist activities of Carlos in the cafe on a beautiful day, when he is so deeply shocked by the evil of this man that the only reason for his life is to get this man while he breathes. <br /> <br /> Take a soldier on a pass in Israel who killed this man whom Kingsley beat and held until he realized that he had a plan. Accepting Carlos because he is, or the eternal responsibility for the fact that he never helped rid him of the world, leads to a very difficult task and a trip with a sense of guilt. Without helping his country, he, as a man, is obliged to choose his military duty wisely. So learning begins. Suppose Carlos trains right at the Academy of Arts and the Holocaust. When I say that this intense and wonderfully played, scripted and executed film is the best, I do not underestimate it. All three actors can save almost any script. In general, this film can be seen from the first frame to the credits. I'm not fond of terrorism or movies about it, but I was hooked! Bravo again to Aidan Quinn, who this time plays a heavyweight who can stand up to any actor, including Gary Oldman. That's a compliment. Rent it and get a lot of popcorn. Oh, did I mention the floor ?? It works better than “Last Tango!” And its educational.
