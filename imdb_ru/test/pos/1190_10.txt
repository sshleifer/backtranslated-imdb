Williams' pleasure reached fame with this film, and really squandered it. Do not be fooled by his poor selection of films since then. This film really stands out. “Hair” is a musical that actually relates to a relationship, and, perhaps more so, to the character of the famous peace movement of the 1960s. There is a lot of exciting music made in an exciting way. In contrast to the music videos of the late 70s, 80s and 90s, video flashes coincide with the subject of music. In other words, the video makes sense when it is juxtaposed with songs, so you know that it could never be done on MTV. The theme is about drugs and hippies, but mostly it is an anti-war film about the senseless tragedies of Vietnam. One of the main characters is a boy from Oklahoma who intends to change something, believing that he meets all the patriotic dribbling that he feeds with a spoon in New York where hooligans are more or less glorified; their characters are very unique, and probably wouldn’t make sense today, but this heap comes together to burn their draft cards. What happens in some exciting scenery and fascinating scenes, involving not only three heroes, but also three other gang members, as well as a newcomer with a small child, whose entry is easily among the ten most ambitious of all time in the movie, because she sings one of the greatest songs of this generation. Despite their shortcomings, you will love these people, cinematic triumph with a sense of heart and a grand finale.
