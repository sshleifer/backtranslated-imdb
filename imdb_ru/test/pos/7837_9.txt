I found the episodes exciting and well written. As a television show, it was fun, which I expect from fictional entertainment. I like the "relationship" between the Professor and his guard ... although sometimes her Scottish accent makes it difficult to understand what she is saying. I was hoping there would be more than just four episodes. I recognize that one commentator / reviewer in this series had comments regarding his opinion as a doctor. I understand the comments of this gentleman; nevertheless, it is a fictional television series intended for entertainment ... and not for presenting exact facts, such as a documentary. Patrick Stewart performs well and makes his character believable. If you want to watch a documentary, this is not a series for you. But if you want to see unique scientifically based theories in an entertainment environment, then you will enjoy four episodes.
