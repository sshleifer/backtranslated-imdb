I think Shane Black is one of the greatest screenwriters of all time! He gave us a terrific (at that time) Lethal Weapon that shot Mel Gibson. Then came the second best film in which Bruce Willis ever starred (“The Last Boy Scout”). He stumbled a bit with the “Last Battle Hero”, but bought himself out with this “Long Kiss of Good Night”. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of action movies, this is all ... action, comedy, thrills, and then even more action, comedy and thrills. Gina Davis is great, Samual L Jackson is even better. Do not miss! <br /> <br /> 9/10
