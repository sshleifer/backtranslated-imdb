I like this movie. The look of these mutants and the tone of the film is very good. Plus, David Cronenberg as Philip K. Decker was great! It makes me wonder if his personality is different in real life (except, of course, for murders). <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the creatures for this film, although this film probably had some low budget mutants / creatures / monsters that looked great, especially since 1990. This is definitely a unique film, not crap. It makes me want to go read the book on which it is based. This is an interesting film, because it shows how people can be monsters, and "monsters" are people with humanity.
