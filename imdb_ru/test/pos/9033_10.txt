I am not a fan of Faulkner (which is considered sacrilegious, especially since I grew up not far from the authorâ€™s hometown); However, I think this is a great movie. Along with the quality of the film "To kill a mocking bird." If you haven't seen it yet, buy it anyway. It is well worth having in your permanent collection. TCM recently played this movie in the Race on Film series. I would like them to play it more often. Very dramatic. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, residents of Oxford, Mississippi will also be happy to see footage of the city square in the 1940s. Courthouse, City Hall, etc .: They are all on the screen. I never knew that the film was made there until I noticed familiarity with the buildings. When I saw the arch in front of the city hall, I began to suspect. Look carefully at the pennants on Chick's wall: you will see two for Ole Miss!
