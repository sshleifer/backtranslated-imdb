My God, Ryan Gosling has done many deep characters in his career, this is one of his great acting work. For me, this is a very deep film that requires a lot of concentration, not because it's hard to watch, just because you understand him if you wear shoes, although he has everything and he has a famous father who is a writer, a deeper mind, you do not understand why he is killing this poor child, until you have really heard what he has to say, and you will not begin to think, at least to me, that many things he says are true. A simple child, cute, very gentle, is normal, like any teenager, but suffers inside him, because he starts to look at the world differently, then you understand why he did what he did. I recommend this film for those who love deep drama.
