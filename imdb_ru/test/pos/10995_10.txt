I really liked the story of Gabrielle Burton about the mysterious gift and how it affects recipients in the past and present. The talented Burton family, consisting of five filmmaker sisters, a mother author and a dancing father, offers a charming story, respectfully edited for clarity, unforgettably selected songs and a beautifully filmed piece that made me laugh and cry as the characters' vulnerability invited me to their prediction . This work was like a farce with touching shades of innocent surprise. Fanatastic
