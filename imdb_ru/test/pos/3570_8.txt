This film is one to spend a short time, entertainment, but which then could be removed in any country, it does not have anything identifying "Colombian". Anyone looking for topics about a supposed Colombian or socio-politically correct cinema and that it is called “under threat” is better than it is not going to watch this movie. Some of them relate to drug trafficking or fighting - this is not a reference to either the farmer, or the worker, or the winged partisan, or the political abduction. <br /> <br /> Corrupt police is a character who can be Mexican, Russian, Italian or Chinese, as well as the hero of a hero, an Argentine photographer, it can be a Venezuelan, Peruvian or Filipino and frequent “boldo” in his parliaments that could be replaced by another slang word from any other country without changing its character or history. It is important that this is a very decently calculated story with images and correct performances. In quality, it is almost television, but good. The fact that if one such film, if it deserves or does not deserve support from the public, is a classic discussion of "mamerta".
