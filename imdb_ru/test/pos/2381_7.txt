One of several Scooby-Doo and Loch Ness monsters shown in Scooby-Doo's cartoons turns out to be interesting, exciting, interesting, funny, and also gives an amazingly good interpretation of the Scottish Highlands. One of the annoying aspects of the film are the voices of many characters - Americans trying to appear Scottish in this film, unfortunately, do not succeed so well (although some people do Scottish accents better than others). <br /> <br /> Daphne came to the Highlands to see her cousin Shannon and the Highland Games at Castle Blake. Shannon seriously tells the gang that, in her opinion, she saw the Loch Ness monster. When there is even more chaos, Mystery Inc Gang has another mystery ... <br /> <br /> Good for Scooby Doo fans and for people who want to learn more about Scotland! Enjoy "Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster"! :-)
