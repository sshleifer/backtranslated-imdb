This is a “documentary drama” (mostly) of the late years of K. U.’s life, in which the actors play almost all the roles (but determine what role the quartermaster TV plays!). This was done for the BBC4 art channel, but I guess there will soon be syndication and DVD releases. KW skillfully plays the magnificent Michael Sheen, repeating his previous stage role with great success. Most of the supporting actors are also very good, and a nice touch is the re-creation of periodic television appearances with new actors. This, however, is not an easy look — anyone who is familiar with KW diaries and general disgruntled behavior will already know how perverted he may be in later life — so do not wait 80 minutes for Carry On in a buffoonade style, as the emphasis is clearly depressing everywhere, It is recommended, but it is really tragicolic.
