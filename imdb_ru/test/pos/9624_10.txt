It was the very first kung fu movie I've ever seen. Dubbing is not the best, but much better than the one I saw. The plot is much better than those made today. Sometimes it's terrible, but this is what gives it a special impetus. Academy Awards are not. But if you like to watch fights and a decent story, this is for you!
