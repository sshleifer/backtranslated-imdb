Joan Hickson is, as always, beautiful, like Jane M. Thin, insightful and knowledgeable. I do not want to dwell on her acting skills, as they praise enough on this site. I would like to criticize some of the smaller roles, since the rest of the cast seemed to have been manually chosen by director David Tucker. <br /> <br /> Liz Fraser played the role of Mrs. Bent (mother of the missing girl Nora) is a joy to watch. Thin and deeply moving, like an alcohol-dependent grieving mother who desperately loves and misses her daughter. A good long snapshot of her monologue (thanks to Tucker!) So that she can be enjoyed to the fullest. I was touched when I first saw her during the broadcast, and I was touched again, now I have it on DVD. Brava. <br /> <br /> Joanna Hole, Madge, guide, I find it very funny. She is on the verge of excessive action, but her role may be that. She is SO funny, like an overly organized guide who wants to do good with everyone on this bus, I find her fun. Her reaction after she got on everyone on the bus is great ... As always: to play a comedy you have to take it very seriously, and that’s what Miss Hole does. <br /> <br /> I hope these two girls have a good career (since I live in Holland, I don’t know if they have, not all theatrical productions can be Googleed) - their performances on the screen deserve it. <br /> <br /> Peter
