I really think this film deserves a few Oscars! I really don’t care what people say badly about this movie ... because it’s really well-played roles of Samuel L. Jackson, and mainly Christina Ricci !! I'm a big fan of her, since I saw her in the Addams family ... tried to watch everything she does, and this is absolutely one of her best roles !! I love her looks (although people say she is not beautiful ... I think she is ... and I love her eyes) !! A film about many things ... people say it is religious ... people say it is about racism ... people say it is about drugs ... people say it is about nymphomania ... well ... maybe a bit of it all !! But what I really feel is that this film has a high level of opening of eyes for what the blues is ... what it means ... and mainly where it comes from: life ... heart ... pain ... sadness ... and above all ... spontaneous feelings !! I hope that you will see this ... if you are a person who loves a film not only from pictures or from the story he tells ... this is a good film to watch ... if you don’t ... well .. look anyway ... not so painful, and you will see Christina Ricci play so excitedly !! She is a fox!
