I love military comedies (Sergeant Bilko, “The Stripes”, “In the Army Now,” Major Payne) and “Down Periscope” - it's fun, but he also has a heart. <br /> <br /> Stingray SS-161 (USS Pampanito was great Absolutely beautiful, the work of art comes to life. So it was a diesel sub, so what? I learned that the aircraft carrier USS Ranger (which replaced the "Enterprise" Star Trek IV), a huge ship, “had the usual power”, which could mean that the Ranger was also a diesel engine. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Backman, this bank was on the slope from Korea! It can expired in 1966! Buckman: (raises his finger and tastes) What's the matter, sir? It tastes like corn purse. <br /> <br /> Pascal: (yells) Except , then this is a DEVILED windscreen !! Buckman: That would be a problem. <br /> <br /> This story, perhaps a bit tense, seemed plausible. Winslow respected Dodge and seemed to care about him, so he wanted to give Dodge a chance. He gave him a battered, but still seaworthy Balao class subwoofer and instructed him to use a diesel subwoofer to dodge the nuclear fleet and "attack" the harbor of Charleston and Norfolk. The 2-star Admiral Graham (looking at his third star and anger at Dodge) assigned him a motley crew, hoping that they would screw it up so that Dodge would lose. Can Tom Dodge take the crew to speed and work in a team, and can he take an old, outdated submarine and defeat the best naval forces?
