Although I am not a big fan, I am a purist from Three Stooges. I believe that their best work, of course, was with Curley as Third Rough, and their earliest films are usually their best. This is because after a while they began to remake their films, and the jokes became obsolete. Here, in 1934, they were still quite fresh (in many ways than one) and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Here they, boys, play very incredible roles - dear doctors in the hospital! Three run around in a rage, behave foolishly, beat each other and scare pants from everyone who expects to get better. Continuous energy and freshness make this film a must for fans. <br /> <br /> By the way, although I liked this film, I STRONGLY recommend that you find a much lesser known short from tiny educational films. Photos NIFTY NURSES is very similar to MEN IN BLACK, but manages to be funnier about the best hospital comedy of the time - even better than Laurel & Hardy's COUNTY HOSPITAL.
