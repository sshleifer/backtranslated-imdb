25 sitcoms had great side effects. Most of them came in the 1970s. Here is a list of everything: You Serve, Blackadder, Bless this House, Downstairs, Daddy's Army, Father Dear Father, For the Love of Ada, George and Mildred, Gentlemen's League, Love Your Neighbor, Lovers, Do not pay attention to your home, nearest and dearest attention to quality, feel the width, on buses (3), please, sir, porridge, growing rash, stepson and son (2), this is your funeral, until death fulfills Part (2), Up Pomeii (3), Whack -o, Whatever happens to the apocalypse of probable guys and screams. <br /> <br /> So my favorite comedy series Dads Army got a big screen. What the film focused on was when the men were credited. It showed the difficulty of getting uniforms and getting weapons. It was a great result of the first series of Dads Army. At the end of the film, they catch German spies in the church. The guards came in disguised servers, they had bayonets and they defeated the Germans. The best part in the film was when they showed the HG lecture and the German language lecture at the same time: German: headquarters by telephone, you would get 10,000 bombs, (CUT TO HOME), GODFREY: Mrs. Manning by phone, you would get 1/2 a pound of brussels sprouts. <br /> <br /> This was probably the second best comedic video, defeated only “We are filmed before death” (1969). It would have been better if he had already been formed at the beginning of the film, he was halfway after the war. Although still a great movie, good for the family.
