Great story and cinematography. Burning, sharp social commentary. <br /> <br /> Excellent effects. Well shot and acting. <br /> <br /> However, the parallel action between real and traveling adventures (although very well executed) sometimes pulls too much (about 3 hours) and excessive interruptions to the flow of history. <br /> <br /> I first read a book as a child, and I liked the snippets about giants and tiny people - but the book lost me when it got to the floating island and the land "yahoos"! Well, although the plot of the adventure may sound like a children's story, in fact it is a very adult story, full of symbolism about the moral decay in England in the time of Jonathan Swift, the author of the novel on which the film is based.
