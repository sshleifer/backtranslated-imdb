This film is different in that it is shown not so much as it is. What is shown is incredible poverty in Sicily, when the 19th century gave way to the 20th, a way of life that made people dream of a “new” world of America. The Mancuso family lives in a place that is not even a village, but simply a stone cottage, located among the harsh, relentless stones of the country that cannot offer a single blade of green grass. In the opening sequence, the Mancuso males climb barefoot on the rocky side of a hill with stones in their mouth to offer a sanctuary on top in exchange for a “sign” that they should go to the New World or stay where they are. In addition, he shows life aboard the liner, really crowded masses, a thirst for free breathing and conditions on Ellis Island, where their journey is not over yet, they are interrogated and examined to prove their "suitability" for entering America. What is NOT shown is a ship in Longshot or ANY shot that would identify it as a large ocean liner; that which is also not shown is anything that would identify America, without clichés on New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty, so that Ellis Island can be anywhere in any country. Perhaps the most wonderful shot is a snapshot from a crane-camera that looks at hundreds of people gathered together; slowly, almost imperceptibly, two thirds of the people on the left of the screen begin to separate from the third on the screen on the right, and we understand that those on the left are actually aboard the ship, and those on the right are on the dock. fragmented. Everywhere there is a strong documentary impression that we are following a real ship full of immigrants, although it was carefully designed and clearly represents a mixture of typical families / conditions at the time. Almost nothing happens in a dramatic sense, this is not for the popcorn brigade at Multiplex, but for all of us this is a really very good movie.
