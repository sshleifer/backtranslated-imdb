I was one of the lucky ones who were invited to watch this movie in New York. This is a convincing story about how a group of extremely strong friends dealt with the tragedy of September 11. This film made me laugh and cry and showed me how the human spirit through love and friendship can endure and create beautiful things on one of our darkest days. It was amazing to see the same story being told by many different people. That day I left the theater, wanting to call all my friends to simply say hello. I would recommend everyone to watch this documentary. I would rate this movie with A ++++++++++. See if you have a chance.
