This film is about many things. The most obvious is the fact that a film can reach an audience, and how capturing life in a film can be a kind of magic. Tensions also exist between China and the West, as many Chinese (probably quite rightly) believe that the “barbarians” are trying to seize and pollute their lifestyle. Liu even seeks to preserve their lifestyle on tape, because he sees that one day he will disappear. This is also Liu's internal conflict between loyalty and the traditions of China and the philosophy of self-determination of the West. All these topics are quite skillfully woven by Hu into a coherent and pleasant whole. Very nice movie.
