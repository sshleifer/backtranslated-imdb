Why did I vote for 10/10 for this film, which is simply not in the spirit of *? Just because if you just allow yourself to find it funny, you can just laugh until you suffocate. Some people may find that it goes too far, it’s certainly not for everyone, but whenever I fall down and just need something really very stupid to laugh, throw Bottom or GHP and I can forget everything your problems and being transported to a magical dark and strange world. <br /> <br /> * “Absolutely reckless” is an Australian expression without literal translation.
