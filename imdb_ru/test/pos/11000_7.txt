General Trelaine is a super-creature who wants to play a little game with the Enterprise team. A lot of incredible and meaningless things seem to be happening, and Trelaine seems to be obsessed with human methods of warfare and murder. It seems he needs to experience what he imagines as excitement, and created a human environment (albeit several hundred years ago) in which he could embody his fantasies. The environment is a little untrue, and the team immediately begins to detect inconsistencies. Pretty soon it becomes clear that Trelaine is not just an immature god, but very mistaken. Regardless of what you feel about this, stay around for a finale like the Twilight Zone. It's worth it. <br /> <br /> As many have already noted, the character Trelaine inspired a more developed and funny continuing character Q - and you can see in the construction of this personality John Delancey more than just the shades of Campbell Trailin. It is interesting to compare how the four captains we encountered dealt with him so radically differently.
