In my never-ending quest to see as many quality films as possible in my entire life, I came across this movie through cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before, and never felt that this manâ€™s work justified the praise he received. I always felt that he was good, not great (from what I saw). It was the best of his films that I saw this way. Robert Walker is absolutely awesome, his performance shoots the film the way Hitchcock wanted. Even average performance here damages the entire product. My favorite scene was his obsession to get a lighter from the sewer (although how exactly did he reach out?) Bruno is a pretty convincing character, but I also liked the performance of Patricia Hitchcock as Barbara. The rest of the Morton family, as well as Guy, were a bit dry and boring, but she added some highlights to the film and also added some of the best lines in the script. <br /> <br /> Finally, in any film of the unknown, you will live and die with your end. This one holds water, unlike a couple of other Hitchcock films I've seen. I really wasn't sure how this would end, which kept me on the edge as I watched and waited.
