What I saw in the films of Wolfgang Petersen was pretty good. He knows how to manage actions, create expectations and interest you. Eastwood is usually excellent, sometimes excellent. This applies to both his play and direction. They both take a solid job here. The concept is not bad, and the game of cat and mouse works well. Malkovich performs quite well, and Eastwood and him play against each other, adds to the film. I believe that this will not present anything new, in fact ... but it never claims and does not need it. These are two great actors, each of whom plays a pivotal role, which they proved at other stages of their careers, that they can cope surprisingly well with a great director at the head. Indeed, it is interesting, well done, and it just delivers. Editing and cinematography are good. Acting and writing characters too. The film manages to be tense and tense, and if you allow yourself, you will probably be entertained and engaged, even if there are excellent films there. The pace is pretty accurate. I recommend this to any mainstream fan, director and / or this type of movie. 7/10
