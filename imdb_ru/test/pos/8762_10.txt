Traffik, beautifully constructed, tells the story of drug use and trafficking from different points of view. From the point of view of the policeman, from the point of view of the politician, from the point of view of the addict, from the point of view of the smuggler and from the point of view of the farmer. In a carefully thought-out plot, it seems that everything is interconnected. From beautiful shots on the ground in the poppy fields in Pakistan, to the center of Karachi, to the airports of Frankfurt and London and to the destroyed buildings where smuggling takes place, you can see a huge dimension of drug use.
