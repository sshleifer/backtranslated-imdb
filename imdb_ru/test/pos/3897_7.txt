As in Colombo, we see that deaths occur at the very beginning. This is followed by a growing network of lies, sex, blackmail and murder. Investigation officer Adam Arkin is not even in himself, but in contrast to Colombo. It is William H. Macy, as the film critic suspects, that bears the film. The plot is constantly spinning and turning, and Macy is sinking deeper and deeper into the quicksand of his "perfect crime." The fans of William H. Macy will love The Easy Killing Case, as well as those who love criminal capers with all sorts of tasty possibilities. Add a few well-prepared comedies, and this is very similar to the wonderful episode of Colombo. Highly recommended. - MERK
