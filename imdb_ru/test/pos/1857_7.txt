Last year marked the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin and 150th anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species, it is therefore fitting that the “Creation” by John Amiel was released. The film is dedicated to the period of life of Darwin (Paul Bettany), when he wrote his famous work, and the light stress that it had on his family life. <br /> <br /> I think the film beat Darwin’s tensions with his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly) and his blame for his late daughter Annie, but I still like the idea that Darwin’s theory works like karate in religious dogma. Thus, the USA was one of the last countries in which Creation found a distributor due to the creationism and evolution debates (yes, it is still going on). <br /> <br /> In general, this is not a masterpiece, but I recommend it as I recommend "Inherit the wind." I hope that one day the debate on creationism and evolution will not be a problem. If this film helps put an end to the debate, then more power to everyone in the film! Also starring Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch.
