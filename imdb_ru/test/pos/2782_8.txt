A rather charming image of the European Union, starting to act among the younger generation, when representatives of this group learn to live together in an apartment in Barcelona, ​​where they all study on international scholarships. Central to the story is Xavier (Romain Duris), who may have lived a rather ordinary life with his mother in France, but quickly became the leader in the group, helping them to cope with landowners and other problems. He quickly learns about life and love. Duris has good looks and excellent performance. The rest of the cast also plays well. Sometimes they all switch to English when they want to make sure that they communicate, unsure of the ability of all their housemates to understand French or Danish, or in any languages. Cinematography deserves attention, including a beautiful view of Barcelona and its famous Gaudi towers.
