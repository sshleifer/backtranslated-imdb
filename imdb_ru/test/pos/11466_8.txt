The 80s were filled with all these horrible HALLOWEEN films / Friday the 13th, so this is a bit of a relief. <br /> <br /> Ten incredibly annoying teens (would you like to hang out with these jerks!) decided to have a Halloween party at a local former funeral home called House Hull. During the "last life session," the demon is accidentally released, and each person becomes obsessed and kills others. <br /> <br /> It all sounds very EVIL DIED / DEMONS, but Tenney gives the director's style of listening, there are some good one-on-line players, the music is excellent, Steve Johnson's prosthetic makeup is scary, and Linnaeus Quigley is quite funny, like a crazy young girl that pokes out the eyeballs with your fingers and does an amazingly new thing with a tube of lipstick! <br /> <br /> Great fun at the simplest level! After checking the breakdown of the vote and other published reviews, I donâ€™t understand how it got only 4 out of 10 (?!) <br /> <br /> I give it, 8 out of 10.
