Despite the fact that this film is erroneous from the point of view of homosexuals, it will show the viewer myths and inaccuracies regarding AIDS. Despite the dismal theme, this film depicts a warm friendship between two boys and makes you laugh and cry. Everyone plays very well, especially Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. The language is a bit strong, although appropriate, and it is an interesting and intelligent film for the whole family. But do not forget to prepare Kleenex!
