It must be one of the most awfully titled films of all time. The type of title that destroys the film, because it does not cause either the plot or the characters. This title makes the film a failure, even the French title is not much better. It is a pity that Truffaut and Deneuve must have been enough to sell it. <br /> <br /> This is a long film, but pretty much worth it. Obviously, under the influence of Hitchcock, we have an intercontinental story about the personal advertising of the bride, her rich husband, theft, personality change and obsessed love. The plot here is actually very good, and it takes us on an unexpected journey. <br /> <br /> What is suitable for both the film and for him is a relationship orientation. This is an interesting study of how these plot events are played out in “real relationships” with these two people. Unfortunately, this is what breaks the film and makes it ultimately unsatisfying. We like it when films have a real sense of finality, but here it is missing. <br /> <br /> In many of her films, Deneuve became a director on whom directors could play their fantasies, and this time it will not work. The dirty point is that the director obviously wanted Deneuve to take off her top several times. Deneuve - an actress who always seems very thoughtful and thoughtful, so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous were not crowned with success. <br /> <br /> In essence, the script should be better worked before filming begins, in order to make this film more dense and short, and also to make it more accurate. But Truffaut did not break, did he? So - a little wandering, but remains interesting.
