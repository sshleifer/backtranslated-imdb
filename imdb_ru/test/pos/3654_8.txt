I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of movie lovers and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth for the first film. Direction for granted, especially with the locals who were recruited on the fly for additions and particles. While the plot and storyline are elementary for the nonexistent, the pleasure of watching performances and scenery compensates for the disadvantage. The soundtrack to the film is very attracted to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, every day elsewhere, contact Hari Om for inspiration. This was not revealed in Q & A, but I think Hollywood could learn a lesson from budget filmmaking by learning from this director.
