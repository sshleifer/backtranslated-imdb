What a great show! A very underrated drama show. It is remarkable that there are no main characters, and in each episode some other characters are the main characters. I think the best character on the show is Vern Schillinger. He is a tough, bad guy and an Aryan, in addition to what makes his real prisoner a bad guy, who, as you know, is a lot. There are a lot of murders in this series, I think this is a bit exaggerated because of the murder in the series, but I have to admit that this is one of the reasons why I think the series is so great. early, but some probably still left their mark. You can't compare things like Prison Break with this show, they are completely different. I think some of the actors in the show are also very good and underestimated, and what follows from them. Great show, my favorite. The show, which should be considered great for many years.
