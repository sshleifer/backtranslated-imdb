An interesting cartoon included in the Lost Cadaver Skeleton DVD. I especially like the way this color was used in background art - very artistic for Colombia, whose department of cartoons, as a rule, had a very low budget (and the results looked like that!) However, what a certain ... finger gesture ... or passed censorship. Of course, this gesture was seen much less frequently in 1937 than today. You might think that someone other than animators would have noticed, nevertheless - especially since they saw it three times in the scene in question! And, based on context, I suspect that its inclusion was deliberate, something that animators slipped through, just to see if the censors notice!
