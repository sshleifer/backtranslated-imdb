Without a doubt, the film is a powerful tool, especially now, more than ever, thanks to the availability of DVD / video, which gives the director additional confidence that millions of people will see his story or message. Therefore, the use of this tool gives the artist an innate responsibility, since the film can be both educational and entertaining, which requires that certain subjects be approached accordingly and with appropriate sensitivity and sensitivity. For example, a film such as Spielberg's Schindler's List is important in that it retains the memory of what should not be forgotten, and since the story tends to repeat itself, Spielberg’s film can be viewed as a valuable tool to prevent the recurrence of this tragedy. In the same vein, this Focus film, directed by Neil Slavin, highlights the problematic reality of anti-Semitism, which has affected millions of people for many years, is still unimaginably prevailing today and, like any manifestation of fanaticism, will continue if it is not stopped or ignore. Born by the xenophobic strain, it is a society that infects a disease that, without weakening, can be fatal; and with his insightful understanding of the condition, this film is an effective vaccine that can at least help stop its spread, and we hope can be a step towards its complete elimination. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macy) served his country in the Great War and has since lived a quiet, ordinary life in New York. He held the same post of HR director for about twenty years and owns a house located in the middle middle-class district in which he lives with his mother (Kay Hotree). Lawrence is a type of guy who does an excellent job with his affairs and refuses to deal with issues that are not (he feels) his concern. <br /> <br /> However, this can all change. As with the beginning of World War II, Lawrence, along with the owner of the angular market, Mr. Finkelstein (David Paymer), is inexplicably targeted by neighboring xenophobes who have joined the "Allied Crusaders". a national organization now aimed at channeling their fears and hatred towards Jews or anyone who even “looks” like a Jew. And suddenly Lawrence discovers that he can no longer just stand by and watch the game; because now he IS a game, whether she wants it or not. <br /> <br /> Slavin, based on Kendru Lassell’s intelligent, well-written script, which he adapted from Arthur Miller’s novel, is a frightening scenario that carefully examines the influence of fanaticism on those against whom it is leveled; and when someone takes into account the fact that this is not just a hypothetical situation, but an image of reality, it becomes even more disturbing, even unnerving. And what makes the film so effective is Slavin's obvious understanding of his subject and his studied presentation, which is thought-provoking in its subtleties. In the first scene, Slavin establishes Lawrence’s “character” and very soon confirms it in another scene, which gives the audience the opportunity to observe and absorb how Lawrence’s mind actually works; thought processes that guide his life. With this in mind, Slavin can take his audience along with Lawrence, as his problems gradually begin to unfold. Thus, he effectively illustrates the evolution of the problem, and not just expounds the problem and solves it, which strengthens the emotional involvement of the audience and ultimately enhances the influence of the film. <br /> <br /> Slavin makes an important statement in this film, which is not only an accusation of fanaticism, but also a warning message about apathy. And to his credit, he never hits you on the head with this or is not engaged in the subjective pointing of a finger in order to justify himself; instead, he acts cautiously, trying to be as objective as possible with everything he presents for your consideration. His approach is a cinematic diplomat; and this approach, which serves Slavin - and his film - is quite good. <br /> <br /> Lawrence, William H. Macy - one of the best characters in business - gives an amazing insight, establishing the credibility and plausibility of his character with the help of a sensitive, honest and introspective image. He never tries to circumvent the personal flaws of Lawrence’s character, but instead uses them to create a character that is definitely three-dimensional, which not only makes him convincing, but also serves to confirm the integrity of the image. What makes him so compelling is Macy’s ability to convey the process by which he tests his own conscience, which successfully allows the viewer to share his personal insight. Ultimately, it is Macy’s strength that distinguishes this film from others the most. <br /> <br /> Another strong point of the film is the performance of Laura Dern in the role of Gertrude Hart, an image that effectively complements the work of Macy, as well as Slavin. Sod attaches great importance to his character, capturing her physically as well as emotionally, and her colorful zeal creates a striking contrast with Laurence's stock, which works very well, both for her character and for the film itself. <br /> <br /> And just as recently, Sean Combs (in Monster's Ball) made a good argument not to take into account the acting efforts of a recognized “rock star,” Mitah Aday’s loaf gives powerful performance like Fred, the next Lawrence neighbor door. It also demonstrates that a true artist will produce, regardless of the type of canvas with which he is assigned to work. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Michael Koupman (Carlson), Kenneth Welsh (father Crichton), Joseph Ziegler (Gargan) and Arlene Meadows (Mrs. Dewitt). This type of film, which makes the director proud of his Focus, offers an unforgettable experience that we hope will be useful for those who do not know that such conditions existed and still exist - even in this, the land of the free. 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
