Thus, Dark The Night poses a difficult task: it is very difficult to write about it in any detail, without destroying it for those who have not yet seen it. Since it remains rather unclear, this includes almost everyone. The film will hit those who are familiar with the better-known names of director Joseph H. Lewis in the noir cycle ?? Gun Crazy, The Big Combo, even My name is Julia Ross, which in its brevity resembles ?? like a strange choice. <br /> <br /> First, the French countryside in the countryside serves as its place. Steven Gerais, a middle-aged detective from Surété in Paris, goes on holiday to the village of Ste. Margo (or maybe Margot). Quite unexpectedly, he falls in love with the daughter of the owners (Micheline Sheyrel), although she is engaged to a rough local farmer. But the song about the siren of life in Paris is hard to resist, so she agrees to marry him, despite the inequality in age, which inevitably becomes the talk of the town hall. <br /> <br /> But on the night of their engagement, she cannot return to the hotel. Soon the hunchback finds her body by the river. Her jealous, deceived lover is a logical suspect, but he is also found dead. Then anonymous records threaten even more fatalities. For the first time in his career, the grieving Gerai finds himself at an impasse .... <br /> <br /> A particularly weak script other than the film; it plays like a bad Cornell Woolrich, crossed with Roger Ackroyd's Murder. But Lewis is proud of this squeaky car. He is not in a hurry from the start, but then the story? and storytelling ?? gain momentum (alas, around the time the script breaks the axis). Burnett Goofy highlighted and photographed a film with an intriguing leitmotif: look out the window and look into it; There is also an effective account of Hugo Friedhofer who posed an aural threat to many noirs. On So Dark The Night a lot of talent was spent, but in the end it all comes down to nothing more than a trick ?? and not a very good trick to this. This is a pony in one movie. <br /> <br />
