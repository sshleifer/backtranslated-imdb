Another decent offer from the pen of Vince Gilligan. <br /> <br /> Preliminary “Malcolm in the Middle” Brian Cranston plays Patrick Crump, an abnormal guy who ultimately captures Mulder with a gun and makes him go west at high speeds ringing in the head (and, perhaps, fatal combustion - his wife had just experienced it), and the pressure seems to be relieved only when moving to the left bank. Only Mulder could relate to the plight of this guy and get involved with his captor before the night trip ended. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Scully seems to have solved the case with Mr. Crump's possible means of protection and will meet them in the ocean. Check it out to see if our Dynamic Duo can connect to the Pacific and somehow fix Mr. Crump's big problem.
