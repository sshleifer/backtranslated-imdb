Scrolling through the channels, I was lucky to stumble upon the beginning of this film. I have to admit that it caught my attention almost immediately. I love old movies, and this or should be considered a classic! One of the most remarkable rarities of this film is that the main character was not only a woman, but also a bad girl. I highly recommend this movie!
