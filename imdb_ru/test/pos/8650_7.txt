The whole film made me remember the first round of “Hell Dante”, where the souls get who “fool” themselves, believing that they are happy. They never realize that they are actually in hell, but nothing is fun, they just move without any emotion. In this sense, Dante thought they were in a worse position because they would never actively try to change their situation. No one can die in this place, but an attempt will surely hurt. I am not sure whether the author based his story on this medieval manuscript or not, but the resemblance is absolutely striking. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like the movie when I watched it, because I was expecting a climax that never came. However, it made me think later, and now I actually think that this is a good film - it certainly sticks together.
