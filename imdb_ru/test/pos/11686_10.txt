Currently, this is a kind of self-indulgence, when I was in high school, it required observation. This is really good coverage of the burgeoning punk scene in Los Angeles in 1980. As the bands play, Spheeris types the text in the subtitles, which of course is necessary if someone really wants to know what the guy is shouting into the microphone. But he also turns the POV camera into a tourist, passing through this alien world. Interview groups show an honest approach to music, which is no more. Again, it is not so easy to find in former church cabinets at $ 16 a month, like Black Flag Chavez. How do you know how many unspeakable bands don't try, like Dickens, to conclude a recording contract? These guys just did not care. And who can't love the commentary of a little French guy who was a “singer” for a Catholic discipline (of which Frank was a member). His rough voice gives one of the best monologues ever filmed: "I have great news for the whole world ... there is no such thing as" New Wave "." Phew! What a relief!
