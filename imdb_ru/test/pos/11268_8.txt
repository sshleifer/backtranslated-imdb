It must be one of the most beautiful painful films I have ever seen. Merhige has created a vibrant picture that unfolds with horrific violence, sex and minimalist retelling of the life of Jesus Christ. High contrast and a thick layer of grain make you wonder what you sometimes see, but using texture in combination with extreme contrast creates an incredible viewing experience. This film is not for everyone. I think that you should be impartial and not rush to condemn this film for its content, which, although extremely rude, makes quite an important statement about creation, God and humanity. Whether this film is a work of art or shocking valuable trash is open to discussion.
