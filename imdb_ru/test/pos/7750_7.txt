Haruhi Suzumiyaâ€™s melancholy is based on a formula that has already been written by Japanese school drama anime. The formula looks like this: <br /> <br /> 1. The main character comes from a world outside of normal society and has supernormal abilities. <br /> <br /> 2. In the background role is a very beautiful and sexy girl. <br /> <br /> 3. There is a normal character who plays a major role in the story. <br /> <br /> 4. Unusual things happen in ordinary social conditions. <br /> <br /> 5. Sometimes the story of the main protagonist and the normal character, which is associated with the existence or destruction of the world. <br /> <br /> 6. No one will make any effort to get all the magical powers. They just are. <br /> <br /> 7. Usually, people outside of this dense nits are not aware of their superpowers and continue their daily lives. <br /> <br /> So you have it. Suzumiya Haruhi's melancholy is done along these lines, which has become the formula for success for comics and anime in Japan. Even though it follows the putt formula, the series is superbly composed, and the episodes are always set in an interesting background in normal social conditions that always turn into unusual circumstances surrounding Haruhi Suzumiya. Each player in the story introduces an unusual understanding of everyday life, which we usually do not know about. The philosophical turn of their ideas is what makes this series even more fascinating. Visual effects are top-notch and beautifully executed. <br /> <br /> It seems that the crazy ideas that Haruhi always suggests, along with the complex settings of the story, can cause headaches from time to time. This is further complicated by the fact that the episodes are not reproduced in order, which further exacerbates the confusion. When I watched the episodes in chronological order, some of the plots finally made sense. I recommend you do the same. It is much more interesting to watch the show in this way. Google <br /> <br /> List_of_The_Melancholy_of_Haruhi_Suzumiya_episodes <br /> <br /> for the correct sequence of all episodes. And, oh, you might notice a headache while watching it, like me. Let me know if you had this too.
