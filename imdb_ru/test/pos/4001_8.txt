“Chi-hwa-seong” (“Scenic Fire”) tells about the life of Korean artist Chan Song Uba in the changing political landscape of Korea at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> However, the themes of this film are centered around the process of artistic creation through the fire of the artist’s desire and expectations and demands of its audience and society. <br /> <br /> Chan Song Ub is skillfully played out as a complex character who transforms from innocently arousing youth into a seasoned alcoholic to torture his soul. This characteristic reflects a young, energetic artist who finds it harder and harder to evoke the spirit of artistic creativity within himself, without releasing creative fire through drink, erection and desire. <br /> <br /> Although the development of this character continues In general, gradually in the film, the emotional complexity of Chang is still played in a constantly fluctuating manner, approaching the final of the film. Interestingly, the montage of the film parallels this constantly changing and seemingly wild emotion or artist’s fire, since the scenes smoothly move from one time and place to another without any usual “hints” for the audience that such a scene change will occur. For example, many scenes might change in the middle of a conversation, rising at a different point and place. <br /> <br /> Visual scenery of the film is beautifully presented and also ranges from sharp (and possibly dark) black and white decorations. to more colorful and vibrant environments, which are again parallel to Young's paintings either in simple black ink on white paper, or with added color. Colored rainbows appear in the film at times when the artist observes nature and especially women, who are then reflected in his paintings. <br /> <br /> The theme of the artist’s individual desire to create his ideas and society’s expectations emerges in the film from different points of view, including class differences, government domination over the artist, generally accepted norms of the artistic elite, and the basic desires of ordinary masses. Instead of creating his own original works, Jung basically recreates the masterpieces of other artists throughout East Asia. Thus, the question arises whether the rest deserves artistic merit. <br /> <br /> I would like me to be more familiar with the political events of that period, to firmly understand how they relate to history - but beyond any comparison with the current one. The role of the Korean government in artistic expression and / or censored I can not comment. <br /> <br /> In general, an extremely well-made film, and cinematography is often breathtaking. Great movie to watch and then ponder.
