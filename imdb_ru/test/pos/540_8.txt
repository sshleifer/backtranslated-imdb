I lay in bed, watching the channels ... and I have channels ... 500 of them. With more than 70 movie channels, I’m probably watching a movie on cable, once or twice a month ... the DVD unleashed me. <br /> <br /> In any case, I watch the film and come to this film, because I see Nehti Portman, I'm interested. 110 minutes later I'm still interested. How could this happen? When I first saw the preview of this film in the theater, I remember how I made fun of it. I never thought I'd see it ... no matter how it is. <br /> <br /> History is based on a book and you can tell. The film is very episodic, and it’s not that the film has a great plot, it just draws you in. Maybe these are the performances that do it. I'm pretty sure it must have been. <br /> <br /> This film was good for no reason ... <br /> <br /> Peter’s rating of the film (out of 10): 7
