Even a decade after "Frontline" aired on ABC, as far as I can tell, the "current affairs" programs still use the same tricks over and over again. From time to time, “Tonight” and “The Current Case” are apparently hiding behind the facade of journalistic professionalism, and yet they feed us only with weary stories about weight loss and tricky merchants, shameless promotions in the network and meaningless pulling of celebrities. - bites. Often exposed to this soulless entertainment void between the Simpsons at 6:00 pm and the Century Sale (or Temptation) at 7:00 pm, I was too aware of the little tricks these shows would use to attract ratings. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, four ascendant comedians ?? Rob Sitch, Jane Kennedy, Santo Silauro and Tom Glaisner were also too aware of all this, and they turned their frustrations into one of the most viciously funniest media you've ever seen on TV. Four artists have already met comedy success, their previous most memorable television work was in Late Show, a brilliant Saturday evening variety show, which took place over two seasons from 1992 to 1993, as well as other comedians Mick Molloy, Tony Martin . , Jason Stevens and Judith Lucy. <br /> <br /> Frontline boasts many colorful characters, each of which has its own special and bizarre personality. The show of current events is led by well-groomed Mike Moore (Rob Sitch), an ambitious, pretentious, blunt narcissist. Does Mike work in the misconception that the show serves a vital role for society ?? Is he always adamant that they "maintain their journalistic integrity" ?? and his executive producers managed to make him believe it. Mike is basically a puppet to bring news to people; occasionally it occurs to him that he is led by the nose, but usually this thought is discarded through appeals to his vanity or promises of improvement. <br /> <br /> Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) is the senior female reporter on the show. She constantly worries about her appearance and publicity, and, if you believe the rumors, she had a romantic relationship with almost all existing men. Another equally immoral reporter, Marty Di Stasio, is portrayed by Tiriel More, who unforgettably played the inept attorney Dennis Denuto in the Australian classic comedy “The Castle”. Emma Ward (Alison White) is the linear producer of the show and the only bright moral beacon on the set of "Frontline". Then there is a very funny meteorologist, Jeffrey Salter (Santo Silauro), Mike's best friend and his confidant. Jeff makes a living by always agreeing with Mike’s opinion and laughing loudly at his jokes before admitting that he doesn’t receive them. <br /> <br /> For each of the three seasons of the show, we are treated to a different EP, executive producer. Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence), who unfortunately passed away in 1995, runs the program during the first season. He has a decent set of moral principles, he is always polite with his staff and, nevertheless, more than ready to throw them aside. favor high ratings. Sam Murphy (Kevin J. Wilson) arrives on the set in season 2, a die-hard, smooth-talking producer who knows exactly how to tie Mike; The last episode of the second season, when Mike finally defeated him, is a classic moment. Graham "Prowsey" Prowse (Steve Bisley), the third season EP, is a tough, unpleasant and unscrupulous sexist. So it's great that you end up loving him. <br /> <br /> Front Line, which has distinctive, exaggerated characters, has a lot of amusing mocking programs about current events and their questionable methods of getting ratings. Many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply, often bringing many plot ideas from recent real life situations to life, but this never diminishes the actuality of the show ten years later. Celebrity cameos are presented in abundance, with some of the most memorable appearances, including Pauline Hanson, Don Burke and John English. Don't miss out on Harry Shearer's cheerful appearance in the episode of the second season “Changing the Face of Current Affairs” by playing Larry Hages, an American hired by the network to reform the series. <br /> <br /> Especially in the third season, I noticed that Front Line boasts an extremely sandy form of black humor, uncharacteristic for such a light-hearted comedy show. Truly funny moments are born out of the fact that Brooke secretly bribed himself to get an abortion, killing a crazy action movie and Mike betrayed the best hopes and dreams of his best friend, but he was told that he was a good friend. Series' Last minute ?? minus the added scene during the credits, which was probably added in case the fourth season is shot ?? was probably the biggest, blackest end of a comedy series I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Below is a very tentative list of my five best favorite episodes of "Frontline", but don’t be mistaken, every single half hour is a completely fun and tough satire. <br /> <br /> 1) “The siege” (1st season) <br /> <br /> 2) “Give them enough rope” (season 2) <br /> <br /> 3) “ Addiction to fame "(3rd season) <br /> <br /> 4)" Basic instincts "(2nd season) <br /> <br /> 5)" Add sex and move "(1st season)
