... and my reasons are simple - there are so many great films presented and discussed (most of which are their own directors and stars), so many clips of the notorious moments in the cinema history of the 70s, and in fact a number of films that I have yet to see that it would be unfair to evaluate this work. According to this logic, I should not have evaluated other documentary films, such as Martin Scorsese's Personal Journey on American Films and My Journey to Italy. But while these films were based on one person’s view of the movie, narrating most of the way, Richard La Gravanes and (deceased) Ted Demmes ’Decade Influenced by Ted Demmes allow films and creators to speak solely for themselves. <br /> <br /> What makes the “Decade” for at least one hour for movie lovers or just for those who like films from America in the late 60s-70s are the levels at which it goes that in uncut. The version (three hours, not the theatrical version, which I do not comment on) is covered in a multitude of questions. Interviews include Scorsese, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Julie Christie, John Voight, Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Schrader, Pam Greer, Bruce Dern, Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper, Robert Town, etc., D., and there is a constant stream of understanding from beginning to end. The way the clips come up and the directors / actors, edited together in a bright and fast style, is also amazing. <br /> <br /> I have one comment to the documentary film that most of the information presented was presented in various books, such as Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, and although I did not see the version the film is this book, but I’m sure it would cover many films, directors and incidents like here (in fact, the book of this is one of the best I've ever read. HOWEVER, this documentary is something special for the film, lovers and casual lovers of the cinema of the future - they can look at it and learn not only about such famous paintings as “Easy Rider”, “Last Picture Show”, “Annie Hall”, “Returning Home”, and such renowned landlords like “Scarecrow”, “Panic in Needle Park”, Landlord, Joe, they shoot horses, not them. They can also find out who influenced them (new waves of Europe and Asia), who they influenced, and how the subject that caused controversy after disputes still serves as an intriguing and good material for modern public. em!
