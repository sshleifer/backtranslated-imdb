This is the most complex film I've ever seen ... emotional content is terrible, but unforgettable. A woman who is accused of being a political activist is called in for questioning. The whole film revolves around her interrogation. Alan Rickman and Madeline Stowe have intense and strong roles for which they deserve an Oscar for their performances.
