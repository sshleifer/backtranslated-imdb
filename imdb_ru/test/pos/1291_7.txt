"You were on the way and tripped over a skirt!" Gilligan tells Jim Leonard. This sums up the story of how to cheer Leonard (YOUNG HUMFRY BOGART) when his dream is distracted by the hereditary bomb Carol played by Dorothy McCail. Leonard was working on a new and improved engine, but now his love life and motor company have their ups and downs in this 68-minute shorty. Bogart has not yet developed a quiet, thoughtful style. The good performances of most of the minor characters - her butler, his colleagues, her sister, intervene along the way. Some adult themes, since it was done shortly before they really enforced the filmâ€™s code, but they are still tame compared to what is on television today. Directed by Thornton Freeland, the year before Freeland shot the incredible Flight to Rio.
