This is another case where Hollywood arrogance overshadowed the French style. The original “Mon Pere ce heros” was one of the most charming films of 1991, so accountants in Hollywood naturally decided that they could hire Depardieu and call the others. However, they took precautions when hiring Francis Weber to write the English version, although they use almost every word of the original. Depardieu brings her Gallic charm, and Katherine Heigl shows all the promises that are now paying off. The fact is that when the French make a sort of Lolita-lite, they get away with it, because the thinking of the “dirty French postcard” works in their favor; here, the Hollywood idea of ​​easy refinement is that Depardieu (completely unaware that his daughter made it clear that he is actually her lover), won over the game and the song “something French”, launched an energetic version of Thank Heaven For Little Girls. See the original.
