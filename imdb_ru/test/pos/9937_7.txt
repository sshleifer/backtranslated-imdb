Opera (the name of the United States is terror in opera) is a kind of disappointment after some other Dario films such as The Phenomenon, Tenebre and Suspiria. (I still can’t find Inferno anywhere else.) This is one of those films that has a great first half, but halfway through it looks like someone started slowly releasing the broadcast from script and logic. <br /> <br /> The plot includes a beautiful opera singer who is pursued by an abnormal obsessive fan. This killer begins to kill people close to her in the most unique way. he ties her and gags her and attaches tiny sharp pins under her eyelids, so if she tries to close her eyes, she will knock out her eyes. it makes her watch as the murderer kills his acquaintances in the typically cruel and bloodthirsty way of Argento. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, about halfway through, the film becomes sluggish and illogical. (This is especially aimed at the motivation of the killer. I still do not fully understand why he is so crazy.) The end especially comes out of the left field in the worst sense. <br /> <br /> but for about the first hour or so this is one of Dario’s best films, and cinematography is breathtaking. It is a pity that I could not stand it to the end. <br /> <br /> rating: 7
