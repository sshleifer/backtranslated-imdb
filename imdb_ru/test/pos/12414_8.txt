This is the perfect movie to watch with your loved one on a cold and snowy night. If you like a little laugh with your horror, then this film is for you. Creations of the real cult classics. It has everything you would like to see in a horror movie. A beautiful girl, a hero, a jester, a monster truck and, of course, a family of satanic killer mutants. This one is full of blood, guts and blood. I highly recommend watching this in the early morning hours, and be careful with someone who sees the sounds of monster trucks, Bad {But Funny} One liners and our hero who eat eyeball stews entertain you. Not as good as the Evil Dead, but a close second. Just remember, WARNING ..... DO NOT HAVE BEFORE VIEWING THIS FILM ...
