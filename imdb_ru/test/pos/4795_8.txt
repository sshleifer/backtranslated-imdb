The career of the Spanish director Luis Bunuel lasted almost 50 years, from 1929 to 1977. Perhaps his best films were those that he made during his exile in Mexico - from the late 40s to the early 60s. There he had to deal with very cheap budgets and work in an industry that was mainly interested in producing commercial films for an inexperienced audience, but somehow he managed to make interesting, thought-provoking films that stood the test of time. This film is based on the novel by Spanish author Benito Perez Galdos - and the adaptation is rather true, even if the scene is currently taking place at the beginning of the 20th century in Mexico, and not at the beginning of the 20th century in Spain. The protagonist, Nazarin, is a priest who tries to lead a life that is as faithful as possible to the life prescribed by Christ. The question asked by many is whether such an effort is possible, without entailing hostility, misunderstanding and mockery of your brethren. As this happens, he suffers a lot of humiliation, as long as he remains stubborn (as long as the controversial last shot) for this purpose. I think that Bunuel wanted to show Nazarin as a somewhat ridiculous figure, but perhaps unintentionally, his stubbornness (at least for this viewer) looks like amazing. Anyway great movie.
