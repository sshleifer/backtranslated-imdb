This film is just great ... It starts very slowly and is boring, but as the film progresses ... well, the fun continues. The strength of the film is perhaps in its thin references to many (and I mean many) other films. For me, the best part was the Bruce Lee / Prowling Tiger scene, The Hidden Dragon. The way these two actors switch from French to Chinese or to any other Asian language was amazing. Then the jokes with the names, they are funny, but perhaps you will not understand them all when you are American (no offense). Overall a great movie
