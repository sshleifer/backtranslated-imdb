I would give this film a good rating of 7. Although it is definitely not the best film or even one of the best films of its kind (“Death Fields” is better), it at least tries to tell the necessary story. <Br /> <br /> I think the method of introducing Laura into Burma was a bit far-fetched. First of all, Burma is not the easiest country to visit, especially at the end of the 80s. Secondly, if you made it Burma, your passport would not be lost. A sensible person had to be sure that they always knew where their passport was. With this in mind, I am sure that the screenwriter knew that it was weak, but something was needed. The work of Patricia Arquette was understated, and I just did not buy that she was a doctor. However, at least, she did not play a role that often happens in such films. U Aung Ko was good, but also understated. The end is hard to follow, since most of the dialogue is in Burmese with people translating for Laura. It would be difficult for Laura, and it is difficult for the viewer. Another plus is the strong Asian landscapes in the film, which were nice to see.
