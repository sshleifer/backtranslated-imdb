Viva La Bam was one of those shows that I didn’t have high expectations of before I saw it, and I didn’t even know about it until I saw my friend watching it. I thought Jackass was pretty funny, but the tricks were just funny, and I never got to the show. When I first saw Viva La Bam, it was the exact opposite effect, I really liked it. It was more like a TV show, which is today in many "reality TV". I sat down and wanted to see what kind of new scheme they were going to come up with for each episode. Right up to the last episode, he was interested in me, and although some ideas seemed to be paraphrased at times, he always had a new and funny turn. Viva La Bam is one of those shows that hooked you, and I have yet to watch another show that will be quite enjoyable.
