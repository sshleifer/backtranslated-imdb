Four or five episodes of Johnny Soko and his Flying Robot are edited together. Funny giant robot fights with giant monster tales aimed directly at the children. Parents, of course, will go mad, because the action is fierce because of the battles of robots / monsters, reminiscent of professional wrestling and human violence against people, these kinds of things that you will find in the Valentine's Day School Al Capone and the Academy of Gangster Training. I liked it, but then I grew up on the show again. If there are any problems besides the variety of “people in costumes” effects, the film sounds like a series of stitched together episodes, and the climax comes every 20 minutes. Recommended for those who have run out of Ultraman or Godzilla
