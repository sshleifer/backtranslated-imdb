Slasher films may begin 30–35 years before this film, but believe me, this is one of those gems that will remain long after you turn off the TV. Especially if you are a person who is easy to scare, this is a film for you for which you would not have the sense to accept it completely. Even after so many years, the film has not lost its charm and thrills. <br /> <br /> No blood, no blood, but the thrill will surely cool your spine. The film begins with an explosion and remains at the same pace to the end. BGM is nervous, and I remember that it was something that was copied in many Indian films in those days. Favorite kings? No wonder why ... this is the only reason I wanted to see it, and this did not let me down. “Don't turn off the lights” ... because you won't find Enrique, but maybe a smiling doll is sitting right behind you! take care. not for the faint of heart ... <br /> <br /> Two strikes up, and I go with 8 out of 10, which is pretty low, but still I keep my marks for the dramas ...
