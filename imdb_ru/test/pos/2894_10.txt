I have been a “huge” fan of Rush ever since moving pictures, and this concert is just an example for everyone who is a fan of why Rush is so popular. They fully admitted that they played their biggest concert, and despite the rain on the football arena, they still manage to give an outstanding game from start to finish. A real example of this is that during “yyz,” the whole crowd begins to sing along with him in a genuine classical manner, in perfect execution. They really play all their favorite songs of all with real powerful “lust” that rarely happens more. You get the best spot in the house for one of your best gigs. The second DVD is a fascinating documentary about the group while they are in Brazil, and shows you a lot of events happening behind the scenes, and it allows you to see them not just musicians, but real people in their daily life. This DVD gift set is a must-have for any Rush lover, young and old, and certainly the keeper of your DVD collection. This is even a concert disc for those who just want to listen to music. This DVD is worth it!
