Imagine that “24” is completely uncensored, with a free license, to explain the situation in any necessary detail and show how and why both protagonists do what they do to kill / prevent, and you have an idea how good this show is. People in the US have long known that Showtime is the new HBO, they are doing much better, powerful shows, and this is no exception. The show propels the viewer through the creation of a sleeping cell to an attempted attack, taking into account important aspects such as faith, religion, financing, means and needs. For the uninitiated here, much can be learned about the Muslim faith. In contrast to the mainstream show like “24”, where the terrorists are just psychos in which the good guys shoot, their goals and reasoning are fully studied here. What gives the show more confidence is the newest technology that the cell / FBI uses, and authentic shots in Europe, the USA and the Middle East; It was not without cost to tell the story for sure. The actors are relatively unknown, but the action is superb with the help of a carefully written script that constantly keeps the viewer on the verge of unexpected turns. This show does not have the merit it deserves, and ironically, this in itself is a bit of a sleeping hit that everyone who is interested in this genre should see.
