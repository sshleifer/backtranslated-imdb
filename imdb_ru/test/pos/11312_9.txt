This film was a riot, he made fun of "Madonna - the truth or the challenge" in all the right places. I love Madonna and I love Julie Brown. How could I ask for more .. Julie's Vogue substitution called Vague was hysterical ... "Kelly Lebrock thinks she’s gorgeous, she’s just cold chatter on a paper plate" "Brooke Shields, Dober, Pam, Spam's personality" !! I could die! And just wait until you see what she can do with watermelon !!
