This thing works at all levels - it is intense as a thriller, full of praises of Lars von Trier, but also of her own film - and she does have a message: happiness comes from within, best personified in a wounded soldier who practically (and believe it or not, with humor) breaks into pieces throughout the film, all the while apologizing to others for imposing on them. You laugh at him, but you also envy him. The protagonist is a benevolent, but clumsy writer who is trying to help the whole film with those who are friends on the train from Stockholm to Berlin immediately after the Second World War. He links parallel stories together, and really confuses people in the process. To say that something went wrong is an understatement - and structurally, all the characters are in complete contrast with each other. As if each of them has an opposite — as tough as if it were an antimatter collision. You will not believe the sick things that you laugh at. To say that more will qualify as a spoiler - all I can say is that it is a shame that this film was not released in the USA, not even on DVD. Some idiot probably told them that Americans will not get it - what the hell, because we not only “get”, but also produce things like South Park ... If this film is sold in the US, it should be sold as black mainstream. comedy, because that's what it is. Supernatural, sick and perverted, but fuuuuunnnnyyy!
