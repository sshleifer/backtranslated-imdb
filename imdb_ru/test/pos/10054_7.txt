Nicole Finn (Madonna) has just been released from prison. Although she was ordered to go by bus to Philadelphia, she wants to inspect the place where she was arrested. This is because she claims that she has information that will clear her records. Louden (Griffin Dunn) is appointed to accompany her to the bus with his future father-in-law. In any case, Louden will ride around the city (with his future mother-in-law Rolls-Royce), collecting a wedding ring and a rare big, big cat for an eccentric collector. Nicky, however, begins a subsequent mess as she jumps into Rolls to take control. Between big cats, taxi drivers, hired killers, bridesmaids and a wedding cake with a gun, Lawyer Knows that he is no longer in Kansas. Is there a way out of madness? This film - a wild journey through the comedy prospect. Madonna and Dunnay are ideally suited to each other, making their connection loud, as they play their role as a former fraudster and a pushy button lawyer, respectively. The script is praised for its ability to send the viewer into bouts of hysteria when one implausible scene gives way to the next and next. Everything secondary, from auxiliary actors to sets and costumes, is also pretty sweet. If you know someone who needs a jolt of joy, rent this movie for them. Both of you will be very happy.
