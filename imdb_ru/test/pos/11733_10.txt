Because of the jazz soundtrack, it looks like a movie about Clint Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Actually, it all amazes me when Bert acts in Clint. The story is good, and there are a lot of liners in the movie that I carry with me to this day. (Reynolds to the bad guy: I'm going to pull a chain on you, because you are in my city. And you want to know the worst part? You're from another state!) <br /> <br /> Main characteristics: The Technics 1500B coil is a great decoration for audiophiles! <br /> <br /> Charles Durning gets unstuck by listening to the wiretapping of prostitutes engaged in (a kind of) telephone sex. (You have to see this, believe me, this is fun.) <br /> <br /> Brian Keith is playing against a typical tough guy. (And does it well!) <br /> <br /> Bernie Casi is concerned about Zen. <br /> <br /> Rachel Ward. BLIMEY! (Where did she go?) <br /> <br /> Doc Severinsen and the band Tonight Show play as usual. (Joe Williamâ€™s guests on vocals. Manhattan Transfer re-recorded Route 66.) The soundtrack gives a lesson to the whole business. <br /> <br /> Need I say more? Perhaps this is the best film of Reynold. <br /> <br /> (Yes, he plays himself, as usual, but it works!) <br /> <br /> Enjoy your viewing!
