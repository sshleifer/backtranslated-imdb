Bob Cummings is excellent at this, since this technically brilliant Hitchcock film really does not get fame, like some of his other films, but is very watchable even today. Priscilla Lane argues that she can deal with other blondes who later worked with Hitchcock. After that, she made several films, which makes her almost forgotten today. <br /> <br /> There are episodes in this that will remind the viewer about the productions in the director’s later films. The acting is so well done, and the story is so well done that this film is still very interesting today. Everyone in the cast plays well. There are some great backgrounds in black and white. <br /> <br /> This was the first film on Universal for Hitchcock. For a long time between the feature films he shot at Universal and the television series, Hitchcock would have earned as much box office money for studios as anyone who worked there. This fact is lost in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> In this film, Norman Lloyd is a real bad guy. The story moves very well, including Hitchcock’s only western film series. This film is very good with a lot of great work of all who participated in its creation.
