The philosophical, meditative tone of this film makes it one of a kind. I would give 10 stars just for that. However, what struck me with particular force was that, perhaps, I was wrong, I consider it an artistic guide. Many of the internal shots show a rich mixture of color blends, presumably based on the very understated progressions of the Munsell Color Model and additional comparisons. This makes the film probably unreal for modern eyes, but, in my opinion, very beautiful, like aesthetic work in itself. I think this film is truly unique in this quality and, if not for any other reason, deserves its complete, careful, digital restoration. Fox, are you listening?
