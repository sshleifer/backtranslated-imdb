People comparing this film to big blockbusters, such as “The Lord of the Rings” or “The Matrix”, will inevitably be disappointed with how this movie turned out. Although it does not have a large department of special effects and no battles with hundreds of add-ons, there is still a masterful union of two old folk tales. The acting talent, though not in the A-List, is still great, and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in the big movie with A-List. My favorite character from this film is Bridget Fonda, whose performance in the role of the Snow Queen herself was very touching, which was greatly helped by her stunning wardrobe and makeup. She brought humanity and pathos to the character of the fallen time, spoiled by the evil magic of the devil. In addition to playing Fonda, we didn’t expect from Hollywood that, in my opinion, it’s good, since Hollywood seems to have exhausted ideas on how to train acting talent to portray roles, and therefore they have become stale and dependent on CGI and other special effects us from actors who all use the same tricks. Instead, it shows new ideas, some real thoughts from the actors on how they can find new variations on old themes of love and danger.
