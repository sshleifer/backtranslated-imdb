This film is like a drige. Until then, until you reach the musical numbers that are like MIND F * CK, but softer, like caress of the mind. SMART FORPLAY. The depressing atmosphere caused by the speed and despair of the characters can be pretty damning until you get the musical numbers. This is a great movie. Optimistic. Weird. Manic-depressive (bipolar). This is it! THIS MOVIE IS BIPOLAR. anyway see this. THIS IS MUSICAL !!! With depth !!!! If you like an existential dross, such as "Stranger" or "Waiting for Godot," then you probably get a real blow from this. I should have received a DVD through Amazon.com for about $ 12. He & songs rock well, they are rock, but they are not rock, thereâ€™s kind of calypso, jazz, broadway, but Grace Chung, and I can't find a soundtrack anywhere <, but I want the songs to be great and the dances to be so fun
