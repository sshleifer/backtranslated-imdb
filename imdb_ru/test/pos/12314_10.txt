It does not often happen that the last film of a great director becomes such a thrilling, brilliantly executed and filmed masterpiece. The cast is excellent, as well as cameraman. What begins as a cheerful gathering of a group of well-educated citizens from the beginning of the 20th century - Dublin turns into a dark philosophical narration about all our fear of death and sometimes the dark shadows of the past. Thank you, Mr. Houston, for this last piece of a great movie!
