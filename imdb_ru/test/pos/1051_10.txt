“Christmas in Connecticut” is the jewel of the classic Christmas movie. Although less well known than some others, it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening on holidays. I watch it every year. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stenvik played well, as Elizabeth Lane, a lonely, careerist. Even before he became popular, Stanwick embodies alone on the rise. Her apartment in New York and her friendly restaurateur “uncle” around the corner symbolize the only girl in town. She still does not know how to cook, she writes an article about the household for the magazine! <br /> <br /> Dennis Morgan also played a great role as our wartime hero Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet up with amazing Elizabeth Lane. Being lost at sea, he wants to spend Christmas in a "real" house. It creates a delightful, insane story that develops. It's fun from start to finish. We all should have Uncle Felix too!
