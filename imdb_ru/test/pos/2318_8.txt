I really liked this movie. I probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it. Being an old Navy guy, I'm still excited about the defiant performance of Anchors Away! I also love the pirate atmosphere of "McHales Navy". I could do without a female officer, but I think I'm just old fashioned. It was still nice to look at her, lol, especially after the team finished with her washing. The cook, sonarman and electrician made a movie. I really liked the salty old engineer and his first-class software. And Grammer actually did a very meritorious job, being an improper position officer. I liked the “driving scene” when they drove through the golf course on their way to the port, laughing. Clean fleet! And I swear, I had an XO that looked like that little weasel ... I'm so glad it's on the DVD, about bloody time. : 0)
