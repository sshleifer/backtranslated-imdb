The film is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I liked the movie. Can someone tell me how can I get songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If this is not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs with their respective singers? I tried to find amazon.com, but it is not there. I tried the CD, baby, not there either. I looked over Google to get some details, but they weren't there. I would be grateful if someone could give me the answer to my question. I know that the songs belong to country music and are performed by a country artist. I just need the names of the names along with the singer. I would recommend this film or, more correctly, songs to any person loving the country.
