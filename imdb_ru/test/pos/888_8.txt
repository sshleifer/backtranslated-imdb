Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea, and, despite the mostly negative reviews I heard, and the suspiciously overdue DVD, I couldn't help but take it - any Xia Wu movie Better than most non-university films in my eyes: D Perhaps the low expectations were an advantage, because I was pleasantly surprised to find that the film was quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> The assassin kills a multitude of ministers who were involved in the revolution that usurped the throne, and the government’s main swordsman was assigned to identify the culprit. It does not take much time, but the answer is not the one that he wanted to hear. Through long memories, we learn why, and the story of the swordsman and the slayer, and the revolution. <br /> <br /> The film is usually melodramatic for a Korean film and is decidedly serious in tone - no comedy in the HK style moments can be found here. At first, the story may be a little difficult, but over time, everything becomes clear. In the end, the film becomes a bit shaky, but no worse than Chang Che's film, and for the most part I found it enjoyable. Production values ​​are high, with good cinematic shooting. The fight scenes do not correspond to the level of the best HK wu xia films, but perhaps they are not designed for this - the fights are more “realistic”, as they are less similar to choreographic dance procedures, but there are some Wire and random CGI that translate the film into "WU XIA". Unfortunately, there is no better cast in the film, and there are not enough charm in the main roles and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish it from each other. There is a young girl in the film, which I think I haven’t seen before, but she makes the best impression of any of the main actors - not only because you see her nekkida ... or maybe it’s like this: charm and elegance HK's best films wu xia and maybe beauty too, but I would only like HK to make them half so good - TWINS EFFECT 2 does not give me hope that this will happen soon, although Cui Hark is definitely still in him if he can get funding and quit. “SWORD IN THE MOON” will by no means be included in my list of favorite games, but it is much better than the ROMANTIC WARRIORS or the LEGEND of the EVIL LAKE - perhaps even better than the LIC, although I really liked this film. A little more on the second viewing. Obviously, this is not close to the beautiful MUSA, but in reality it is a completely different matter. SITM will probably get a second viewing in three years, which is probably the best indicator of how I liked it :) 7/10
