When is ART going to beat racism? I believe that Americans have grown since this film was made. Porgy consists of star composition and music. This film is a great adaptation of the great opera. that is, Miss Saigon is based on Madame Butterfly, Les Miz is based on a classic book. Recently, an opera based on the movie “The Fly” was presented in Los Angeles. OPERA !! So be it!! <br /> <br /> Disney does not dare to release the "Song of the South." The NAACP did not voice any racing competitions, and let's not forget that Amos N. Andy was a huge hit in the 50s as a television series. Ethnicity is our heritage in the United States, and we must embrace all forms of ethnic artistic diversity. <br /> <br /> PLEASE RELEASE PORGY ON DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> j hartz
