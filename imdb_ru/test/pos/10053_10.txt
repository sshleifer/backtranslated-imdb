I saw this movie in my childhood and loved it. I liked how Nikki was cheerful and full of energy, and how she basically ruins the beautiful life of yuppie Louden, corrupts him and turns him into her insane deeds. When I was a kid, in the 80s I saw New York exactly as it was portrayed in this film, featuring the Madonna character, with wild animals running unrestrained and disgusting bald men stalking people and causing chaos. Now, when I became an adult, I love the film for the same reasons, and even more so for the love story, woven into the crazy tricks of Miss Nikki Finn. Although I would still like to go somewhere and find an internal atrium, as in this film. Pure beauty and genius.
