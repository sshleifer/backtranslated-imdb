This film is one of the best memories from childhood. My mother, who loved the Tigers, always loved to see me. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely awesome. This is one of those films that leaves a lasting impression on you. The image of the Tiger running in the snow, and around it is still hanging out, still in my head, somewhere around 25 years old, not many films have succeeded, because other comments say the photo is amazing. Must see. I also searched the movie for some time without any luck. :-(. Checking Amazon from time to time does not show anything, not even on the list. If someone knows the source, please contact me or write here. Tim
