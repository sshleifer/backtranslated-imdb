Baby - At 39, Russell Durits has a life that most men can envy - he has an excellent job, he is respected (and feared), he has a beautiful house and he earns money. But everything is expensive, in this case there is no public life, there is no conscience and fear of spending the rest of your life alone. He just needs someone to show him the way. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I wondered all the time why Disney did not broadcast this movie to Miramax - not because it was particularly audacious or harsh, but because it was obviously an adult movie. This is exacerbated by a marketing campaign that is clearly aimed at children - it is mixed with the trailers for “Rugrats the Movie” and “Pokemon 2000” (have they not yet passed?). But I smarten up. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the delicate attitude to the subject, rather than the typical male middle age crisis, which includes some kind of pitiful juice, buying a Porsche cabriolet and acting like a jerk, the character of Willis undertakes some serious self-examination and sums up his life. His guide on this journey of self-discovery is himself at the age of 8 years (they never explain how Rusty comes, and, frankly, I didn’t care). Young Rusty’s innocence and confused optimism gives him a distinct advantage in predicting the truth - he thus summarizes the work of Russell as an image consultant: “You teach people how to lie and pretend to be who they are not.” However, for a good script to succeed, you need actors to make it happen. There are no problems here. <br /> <br /> Although Willis ignored W.C three times. Fields' warnings about starring roles with children or animals that were lucky again, mixed with Breslin as comically as Osment did. Willis manages to balance Russell’s merciless traits with vulnerability and confusion without becoming ridiculous. Meanwhile, Breslin depicts the dead, depicting a child from the childhood of each - one that was always stuck out and selected for some reason. We also get two bonus performances: Lily Tomlin is gorgeous as a skilful assistant to Russell, and Gene Smart is perfect as an insightful charming host (I loved her in Guinevere). <br /> <br /> The baby is charming, heavy, and real. And this will appeal to adults of all ages.
