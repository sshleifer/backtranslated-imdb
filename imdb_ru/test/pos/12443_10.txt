Since the golden period of British films, this is my vote for one of the funniest of all time. Yesterday I was delighted with the audience shown in my Film Society. In fact, it all depends on the skillful timing and inimitable play of the two best actors in Britain: Margaret Rutherford and Alastair Sim. Based on the play by John Dayton, this farce is animatedly directed by director Frank Launder. The plot is simple: the mistake of service turns the school for girls into a school for boys. I will always laugh when I think about this movie.
