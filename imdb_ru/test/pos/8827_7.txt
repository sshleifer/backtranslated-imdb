My main criticism is quite simple: it is not long enough or not detailed enough. I would really like to see the most: ship building, designing, training, first ascent to orbit, preparation for departure, orbital injection of Venus, everything. I would like to see more of the first stage, Venus on Earth, instead of rushing there like corporate bus No. 10. In fact, I would like to see a series on the Earth Story scale made from this, with an hour dedicated to each planet. and perhaps another cycle around the sun. As it was, I was left hungry. On the other hand, I understand the budgets and the attention of the audience. <br /> <br /> Concerning science: let's be honest with a delay in the speed of light: in the beginning they mentioned that there was a lag in conversations, but they allowed it to evaporate as soon as they reached the outer planets. Some conversation was supposed to be presented to the audience, and we must assume that the lag was edited for the sake of taste; so there are no complaints. But zero for noisy spaceships. The only film in which the spacecraft did not make noise was Kubrick's 2001 film, and even then he coped with the noise of the crew breathing in their helmets - which * was * quite effective. We would like the creators of Space Odyssey to understand how terrible the form of huge rocket engines exploding in absolute silence can be, but, alas, Pegasus makes almost the same roar as any other cardboard space ship in any other SciFi cardboard film. <Br /> <br /> But the rest of the science was excellent. There are no complaints, in fact, praise for the fact that they identified problems with radiation just like them. I just hope that this film does not discourage the BBC from creating a truly detailed version, but I believe that this is not next week or next year ...
