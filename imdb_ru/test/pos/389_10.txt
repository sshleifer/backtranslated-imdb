One would expect that Hitchcock’s return to the big film studios would lead to erroneous caution. Of course, few people expected his most violent, unrestrained film, the joyful confusion of evil black comedy, exciting expectations, mocking manipulations and amazing flights of fantasy. But this is exactly what they got: Strangers on the train. <br /> <br /> What's remarkable is that Bruno’s crime destroys the world of the film. Much has been made of the virtual end-to-end motive, but its immediate effect is to completely block the straight line of progress that Guy makes in his life, and therefore in the society he represents or seeks to join. The guy is an archetypal American, a successful boy from the working class, moving in powerful circles, athletic, successful, handsome. Bruno is his destructive adversary, gay, decadent, “European” (he lives from his father in the Big House and just dreams of murder). Bruno's life is a repetition, a whirlwind, while Guy is moving straight ahead. Bruno is an achievement to move Guy to his kingdom (represented by the merry-go-round) and make HIM sin (break the law, hope for murder (Bruno)). <br /> <br /> Bruno in the literal sense of the word fighting patriarchy. All authoritative figures in the film are criticized - Bruno's father, a man whose brutality we catch a glimpse of, but the true horror of which is constantly mentioned in the film (especially in Aunt Clara’s paintings) that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); Incredibly Machiavellian, Anna’s self-serving father; an unfeeling judge who thinks nothing about dinner after execution; tennis commentator, whose self-righteous author comments are always wrong. Far from hating the mother of legends, Hitch, as Robin Wood understood, is deeply hostile to the fathers and the patriarchy. <br /> <br /> Bruno’s crime turns the world upside down. This is the most surreal film Hitch. Whenever Guy is in his plot, he is shot straight, with traditional romantic music. But whenever Bruno intervenes, the atmosphere becomes carnival, whimsical, much more fun. This is the first truly American Hitch movie telling about the primitive detritus of Americana. Adult men pierce the little boys' balls or try to throw them off the carousel. Dear professors of mathematics sing about goats in trains. Older people in society are strangled at elegant evenings. Washington is filmed as a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky, like the haunting picture of Dali. In one of the cinemas there is one of the greatest and most ridiculous scenes when we see a motionless, smiling Bruno in a sea of ​​spinning heads at a tennis match, an image worthy of Magritte. Just look at any scene with Bruno in it, and see how she goes crazy. <br /> <br /> Phalluses abound with the most ridiculous permutations - check all these balloons (Hitch obviously just saw the THIRD MAN) - as well as in more peaceful surroundings: Washington will never look the same. STRANGERS also, despite VERTIGO, the most frankly sexy Hitch movie - along with the phallus - steady homo-erotism, a wonderful game with “riding” horses; awesome joking joke when hitch's daughter spills powder on a policeman. <br /> <br /> Yet Hitch does not stint on the good old wait. In the most correct desire to show how great the artist he was, critics tend to lose sight of what made him famous in the first place. Much was done from Bruno as a type of Norman Bates, and Hitch entertains the audience, preparing Bruno for the kill. There is an amusingly painful sequence when Bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to curb Guy. The blows of tension and sighs of relief from the audience, in which I participated in the support of the insane killer, are inherently ridiculous, slightly alarming and very frank about our true reactions to compliance and success. And Hitch milks it with soulless glee - listen to mocking music and irritated compositions and take yourself for taking everything so seriously. <br /> <br /> STRANGERS is one of the top five Hitch films, and therefore one of the greatest things in movies. The dialogue is so strange and brilliant, I can not believe that it was not written by Chandler. Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful little imp who stood up for her impudent father when she scoffs at Guy. The finale of the fairground is a wonderful, dizzying combination of exciting, intense scenery, black comedy and a symbolic site. If Bruno’s last words condemn him to hell (in accordance with the Catholic commandments, which Hitch must embody: compare with the similar ending in “Murderers”), we welcome his integrity, infinitely preferable to Guy’s humble self-esteem.
