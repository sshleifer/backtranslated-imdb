I am sorry to see that many rated it so low. The series started very well, and after the first season everything was not so good. <br /> <br /> People usually forget the beginning of something and look only at the end. This is not good, you need to look at the general, and not at the end result. Sadly, many “ordinary” characters died, but, hell, we had a lot of good NEW characters. <br /> <br /> Please do not become attached to several characters, but join the series, the plot. Please understand that I did not like it when Bun died, when Augur died, but well ... it needs to be done. Can you imagine that everyone continues to live in a whole series when they are in great danger all the time? Come on, face it, if they don't die, they will be invincible. So you will always keep the tension, will he survive, will he die? I understand that people tie themselves to characters, I do that too. My favorite character was Augur, the one who could enter any computer he wanted. He was mysterious, he could do things with a computer that no one else could do. <br /> <br /> I would like to make one statement to all the people who voted against, does the series that started so well deserve such a low rating? Should we look at the final season instead of the general? Shouldn't we see how good the show was when it started? Don't we see how much we enjoyed it?
