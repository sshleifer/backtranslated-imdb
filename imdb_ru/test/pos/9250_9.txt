I have always been a fan of the show, so I admit that I am biased. When the show ended, I felt that too many questions remained unanswered. This film seemed to me closing. It was very nice to see all the people I followed over the past few years together. I heard that this is probably the only murder film we can expect. If so, then this is the right way out. This film is sometimes sharp, sometimes frustrating, but always enjoyable. If you are or have ever been a fan of the show, watch this movie.
