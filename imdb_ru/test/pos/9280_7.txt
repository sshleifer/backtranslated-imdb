Um ... a serious film about troubled teens in Singapore, a country about which I know little, but I previously had the wrong impression that all the children there were very disciplined and controlled by their family and government. Well, I think I'm wrong, as in other cities / countries, they also have restless teenagers who also lead a not so surprising rebellious lifestyle, like drugs, fights, poor language and ... many other obvious signs being a bad guy The amazing part of this film is not really about how these children run around, causing themselves and others to get into trouble, but rather about the subtle gaiety hidden behind their so-called loyalty between them. The connection between these "brothers" may well be caused by the unconscious tendency of gays inside these boys. Although the guys from str8 often have very close friendships with each other, but watch this movie carefully, he should participate in all sorts of festivals of gay films, and I would not be surprised that he can get much more awards this direction!
