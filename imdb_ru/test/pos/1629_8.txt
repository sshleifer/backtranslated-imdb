Symbolologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is summoned to Rome to help unravel the mystery of the Illuminati, before a new scientific experiment explodes the city. <br /> <br /> The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006, but for the vast majority of Dan Brown's followers did not award him with an award-winning book, and although, having spent a good two and a half hours on it, it seemed, they tired many. <br /> <br /> After reading the book, I was perhaps one of the few who Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou enjoyed trying to solve the mystery of the murder in the Louvre, but for Angels and Demons the scales were raised again when the leading star returned and producer. <br /> <br /> When discussing, most people seem to prefer the Angels and Demons to the Da Vinci code for entertaining reading, and it seems that critics and fans, although not fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation for the 2006 release. <br /> <br /> This picture of Howard certainly has more clinical energy and exercise, like in contrast to Da Vinci and Robert Langdon Tom Hanks. as soon as one night to unravel the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and due to time constraints, action and despair raise the stakes and cause excitement, which certainly surpasses the Da Vinci code, but also generates a lot of turns and terrific murders. sequences. <br /> <br /> An interesting factor in this 2009 release is the permanent elements justified for murder. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in dramatic and powerful sequences to express a sense of the overall power of the situation. <br /> <br /> This really justifies the label of a thriller with a constant tension and a sharp drama with problems and beliefs will again go through a full study. <br /> <br /> Like 3 years ago, there are a lot of controversies and discoveries of characters that were once considered lost forever, and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in conflict with other pressing circumstances. <br /> <br /> It is fair to say that Dan Brown is a complex writer; He, of course, likes to cram problems and dramas into his actions and exciting episodes. In addition to trying to detect the Illuminati, there is also a scenario for electing a new pope, a relationship with a new scientific experiment, and the power of religion is again present. All this is interesting to discover and listen to, if from time to time debates and dialogues make you mad, but since there are so many things in the novel, it was always likely. <br /> <br /> Ron Howard, who frankly kept in mind. The usual type of direction for riding in Da Vinci may be returning the worst possible way. His bold, constantly moving style of the camera does not help hold the pressure, and we can never fully accept what is happening on the screen, thanks to this frankly horribly depicted style. He is certainly not Paul Greengrass, and this is by no means Bourne. <br /> <br /> Smooth and stylized, it is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci.
