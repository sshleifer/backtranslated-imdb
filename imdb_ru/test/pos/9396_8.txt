I'm not sure that I can add that has not yet been said in some of these other good and rather funny comments, but I will try. <br /> <br /> So, you know the plot: there is a bed possessed by a demon that “absorbs” and selectively breaks into the bodies of someone who (or something else) lies on it, with an orange body filled with soda. We have a person who in some scenes looks strangely like Robert Smith from The Cure, dangles inside the wall, comments on what is happening, and we have our various sacrifices who simply cannot resist the comfort of this mystical bed. <br /> <br /> This is no ordinary bed. No, sirry bob! He not only eats people, but also cleans up after himself, throws away covers and even makes himself. Who would not want such a bed? He may even use his sheets as an elementary “lasso” to drive the escaped victims back (especially if they are trying to run half the length of the film). <br /> <br /> Our “main” story (if you can call it that) about these three girls who go to this remote area to sit (??). I do not remember exactly, but in fact it does not matter, because there are many things that are not amenable to conditional agreement, which you just have to accept and accept. The dialogue in the film is not like the others; the characters talk to each other, apparently through telepathy, because their mouths never move, and echoes constantly sound in them. One of our girls thinks that she doesn’t like the rest of the “gang”, and surely tells us all her feelings on this issue through the voice-over, but we don’t care; Character development has been thrown out of the window for a long time in this film, so why start now? There are scenes when the bed laughs, snores, crunches and makes various other noises, which, as we assume, judging by the non-response of our cast to the indicated noises, are not audible. This and telepathy make the problem of the diegesia very difficult to find out ... but it is normal ... it is the Death Bed: the bed that eats, and it challenges all logic, so everything is in order. It makes the lush dreamy quality of this strangest film. If you buy (hehe, buy ... did I say “buy”?) This DVD, be sure to check out the director’s presentation. He explains that the filming of this “film” began in 1972, did not end until 1977, he did this for several years without luck, and then quickly moves to 26 years by 2003, when he goes to DVD. Perhaps someone somewhere printed it in another country and made a bootleg after the bootleg, and quite by chance, on the bulletin board, our director found evidence that people knew, and suffocated! cared about his obscure film. It was from there that he decided to give him a chance and release him. I'm glad he did. As soon as you hear the name of this movie, you MUST see it. For example, I am going to buy this, and I am going to preach his Gospel all over the world ... starting with this comment
