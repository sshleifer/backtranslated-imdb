I really loved this original script and the different places he occupied, emotionally, spiritually and just stupid things. I didn’t get carried away with the “credibility” of the script or the actors, and didn’t even think about it until I read the reviews about the film given here in IMDb. Listening to Michael Parness’s Q & A performance about his film idea, wanting to see how crazy people, or, as he put it, deceived people, falling in love with them is really interesting. I identified myself with the fact that I do not have a novel from the collection of stories, and I liked to see dysfunction at its best. I like to look at David Krumholz in everything he does and have followed his career for several years now. I think this is one of his best works, and I’ll tell someone, just watch this movie to see an amazing young actor. I agree that Guillermo Diaz really was a stage thief, and what he did with his character is really an excellent acting lesson. I laughed and cried in this film, and was disappointed that he had not received any awards at the festival. I ask why this did not happen. I gave Max and Grace ten, because these interesting, unique, creative indie films deserve the audience. Technically watching this movie, is it really beautifully made ?? the colors are awesome and finally this is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a movie.
