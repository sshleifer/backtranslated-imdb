Great movie about American G.I. who leaves the army to marry a German girl who saved his life in the last days of the war. She agrees, but does she do it because she really likes him or because he can support her with easier access to food and the like? Meanwhile, her brother and old friend form an anti-American terrorist group called "Werewolves", whose goal is to expel the invaders (you may remember that the same group plays the main role in the Lars von Trier film "Europe (Central)" . James Best, best known for his role as Roscoe P. Coltrane in the 1980s television show The Dukes of Hazzard, is strikingly good as an American. He was supposed to be a big movie star ?? at this age he reminds me very much of Warren Beatty. Other main actors are good too. Fuller's direction is quite good, many long takes are used again (although they are not as complex as in Park-Row; more often, long doubles do not consist of long scenes with a large number of dialogues). The only problems lie in the script, as it seems to be the case with all the Fuller films I have seen. This is not so bad, but it should be expanded to highlight the main characters and parts of the script. Helga, the wife, is undergoing major changes, but completely behind the scenes. Therefore, the emotional center lies right on Bestâ€™s shoulders. Fuller also had to kill the sick mother at the beginning of the film. Hope this doesn't sound too harsh! She just does nothing throughout the entire film, except to lie in bed. She has so few lines. But Fuller continues to educate her while the film continues. I would make her death strengthen the relationship between David and Helga. And the film ends too abruptly, and it lacks feedback. These are not the biggest flaws in the world (the way I described them makes them sound more than they are). 9/10.
