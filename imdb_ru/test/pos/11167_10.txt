ABC version of the life of the deceased dad: they are a little ahead of the version of CBS and may have suffered from this, but the program itself was excellent. It moved quickly, as he had only two hours (with advertising, also taking time) to cover the long life of this great man, but Thomas Kretschmann excellently accepted the challenge. He did a wonderful job of conveying the emotions and contention that John-Paul withstood. He, unlike the CBS biopic, played a role from youth to old age and managed to seem “realistic” at both ends of the scale. His trust never faltered. It has an amazing range and depth. It is a pity that the program could not be longer and more detailed, but it worked in the time they had, I think they did an excellent job with the work, moving it to a small screen.
