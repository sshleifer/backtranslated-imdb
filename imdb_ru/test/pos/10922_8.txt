Some films want us to think, some want to excite us, some want to cheer us up. But sometimes, the movie just wants to make us laugh, and In & Out certainly succeeds in this department. <br /> <br /> Indiana High School teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is going to marry another teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack) for three days, but the entire city is more excited about Oscar nomination former resident Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon). But when Cameron gets an Oscar for the role of a gay soldier, he thanks his gay teacher Howard for inspiration. It follows that Howard denies this in a fun set of failures in a truly extravagant way. <br /> <br /> Kevin Klein is great, exuding gay stereotypes. Joan Cusack really has the ability to prank in jest. Debbie Reynolds is very funny, like Howard's mother. And Bob Newhart also screams as a homophobic leader. <br /> <br /> Gay screenwriter Paul Mine is really reaching a fine balance here. He knows the stereotypes and uses them in such a way that he is mostly tolerant of conservative mid-western people and at the same time harmless for gays. This is not entirely progressive, but ridiculous and harmless, and definitely one step ahead of the Birdcage of the past year.
