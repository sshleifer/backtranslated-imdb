I was lucky to see The Last Stop here, where I live at the Moving Pictures film festival (for those of you who don't know, Moving Pictures film festival is a Canadian film tour in Canada). Before the film began, I was told that this was a world premiere, and that he was on the verge of an American distribution agreement, which added to my joy. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of horror movies, and yes, I also love the Creek trilogy. So when I found out that Rose McGowan was filming a movie like “10 Little Indians,” I realized that I was in for a treat. Rose McGowan was the greatest actor / actress in the whole festival. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe this without giving up too much of the plot is that it doesn’t look like Scream at all. And it is definitely worth seeing. It is set in the middle of a snowstorm (it was filmed in Vancouver, B.C., Canada) at a mountaintop motel, which adds to the wait. Rose McGowan plays a great role in the role of the girl next door (?!) Along with the rest of the cast. As for what happens at the end, well, the only thing I will say is that you never guess the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he probably will not get into the main North American theaters because the only worthy producer of money is Rosa McGowan. But if you have the opportunity to see this, I would recommend that you do it. And if worse gets worse, there is always a video. <br /> <br /> I gave him 9 out of 10.
