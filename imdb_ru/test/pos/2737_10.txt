I remembered this cartoon more than 50 years ago - what a power it has! It was fun and creative; I wish my children and grandchildren could see this. It takes place there with Winky Dink - another favorite. I was pleased to learn that one of the creators later worked on Rocky and Bullwinkle. These early shows had a lot of chances that modern cartoons for children don't have. Today's cartoons seem to be pushing the idea that something special is needed, some kind of magic formula or talent, to be able to defeat evil or dangerous circumstances. While the early cartoons did not pay much attention to evil — it was a much milder and safer time — they allowed us to develop our own talents and character.
