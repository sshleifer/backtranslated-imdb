John Landis really surpassed himself when he shot Michael Jackson's Thriller in a short film. Of course, this is trite, the dialogue is terrible, and it all looks too silly, but nevertheless, it is perfect. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date go to the movies to watch the latest horror movie. When things get too visual for the date, she leaves. Michael follows. On the way home, they decide to go through the local cemetery. There it all begins. <br /> <br /> The thriller dance is awesome. He is full of those signature moves of Jackson, as well as some memorable zombie movements. It does not seem urgent, nor for too long. It all looks like a movie, and it's really pretty scary. Of course, this is one of the most famous music videos of all time and is probably the best music video ever made. <br /> <br /> Overall: watch it seriously. These 13 minutes will be one of the best ever spent looking at the screen. (5/5)
