Goldie Hawn, in 1969, was best known for playing television comedy shows — in particular, in the TV series “Rowan and Martin”, where she was giggling, a young blonde. Prior to CACTUS FLOWER, she made films, the most famous of which was the Walt Disney function, ONE AND ONLY, ORIGINAL FAMILY. But CACTUS FLOWER picked up her character from LAUGH-IN, and (thanks to the good script of IAL Diamond - Billy Wilder's second partner - based on the play by Abe Burrows) she was able to develop a television character to achieve a real performance. Concretized As a result, Mrs. Hone won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1969, and began her career with future hits such as PRIVATE BENJAMIN and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. Although the other LAUGH-IN stars succeeded on television (Henry Gibson plays the permanent role of a judge on BOSTON LEGAL), only Goldie was able to make her career as a gallant movie star. <br /> <br /> On LAUGH- Goldie's personality would be naive, which would be embarrassing. From time to time she understood this and laughed out loud to hide, but sometimes she just did not see her mistake (example: Goldie is introduced to the 1950s lead variety shower Gary Moore, and she is told: "Goldie, this is Mr. Gary Moore." She shakes his hand and says (very much to his confusion): “I always wanted to meet Mr. John Gary Moore!”). But, like Tony Simmons, it's completely different. She is desperately in love with Dr. Julian Winston (Walter Mattau), a successful dentist who can never marry her. Julian told her that his wife (with whom he had two sons and a daughter) would never give him a divorce. Therefore, at the beginning of the film, Tony tries to commit suicide with the help of the gas of his furnace. But her neighbor saves her, Igor Sullivan (Rick Lenz), a struggling playwright, who bursts into her apartment and turns off the gas. <br /> <br /> Tony came to terms with life, but sent a suicide note to Julian. Igor tries to deliver a message to ignore the note, but Julian’s administrator / nurse / assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman) will not stop Julian’s work schedule, to give him the phone when Igor calls. Instead, Julian finds the letter and runs to Tony’s apartment to find her alive. When Igor supports her story about how she tried to commit suicide, Julian understands the depth of her love and decides to marry such a woman. Unfortunately, Tony swallowed the lie of Julian and believes in his wife and children. You see, Julian has no wife and children. Since Tony firmly believes that she cannot marry a man who will lie to her, Julian is stuck on a weakened branch of a tree. <br /> <br /> Julian comes to solve this problem, forcing Stephanie to pretend that she is Mrs. Winston. At first, Stephanie opposes this, but herself, on her first free Saturday, she meets with Tony at the record store where Tony is located. They talk, and Tony notices all the strengths of Stephanie’s character and personality (and since Stephanie has two nephews, Tony thinks they are Julian’s children). Tony tells Julian that they need to see who the man Stephanie is supposed to marry. Thus, the lie begins to escalate for Julian, Stephanie and Tony. Soon a lover is given to Stephanie in the form of Julian’s friend and the sick Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston). Greenfield is so messy (Stephanie hates him) that Tony feels that he is unworthy of Stephanie. <br /> <br /> And so, with one complication (in most cases caused by well-intentioned, misguided Tony), following another, while the conclusion. The script is full of first-class situations and one-liners (example: Julian, to reward Stephanie for lying about marriage, buys two albums with records in Tony’s store. He gave Tony a mink, but she decides to send it to Stephanie with a Julian card. she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she received - when she thanks Mattau profusely, he says she thinks she will like Horowitz, that is, Vladomir Horowitz. Stephanie thinks that Horowitz is the name of a furrier!) <br /> <br /> Bergman must have aslazhdalas shooting because several scenes show the Earth's brightness, which has been a trademark for it in later films of the 1940s. But there was also a resemblance to her 1958 comedy hit, INDISCREET. There, Cary Grant lied to make sure the couple focused on the romance of their work, not thinking about marriage. When Grant’s lie is revealed to Bergman, she decides on her own lie to convince Grant that she makes him a cuckold. Here, instead of being a passive lover who believes that Mattau is telling the truth, Bergman cautiously tries to pull Mattau out of his confusion with the help of a little white lie, only to find that one leads to another in order to make life difficult for everyone. Bergman is considered a good woman who becomes part of the problem, despite trying to be part of the solution. <br /> <br /> All the leaders work well, in particular Bergman, at first everything is in business, but gradually restores her sexuality. Matthau is amazing because a person who finds a useful lie is an obstacle that simply cannot be discarded. The supporting cast, especially Weston as the attractive and sexually slimy Harvey, and Vito Scotty as the US ambassador, who actually have hints of Bergman. It was a clever comedy, and a really good way to advance Goldie Hawn's career.
