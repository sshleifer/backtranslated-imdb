Chen Kaige gives us a great depth of atmosphere. Yes, this is a “historical work”, but Chen’s artistic use of images makes it something more. Actors often behave like players, using stylized diction, postures and facial expressions of the Beijing Opera. All the actors in the scene play on the back wall, even when they talk to each other. They are like the spirits of the past, with powerful clarity proclaiming a story with an urgent sense for those present in the present. “Jing ke ci qin wang”, combined with close attention to scale and masterful cinema inside and out, is a terrific tale told with great respect in its own idiom that enchants you completely.
