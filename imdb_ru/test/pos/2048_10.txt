When this film came out, I saw how Gina Davis played only soft, female roles ... This film was not at all soft and womanly. Great lines, great performances ... she and Samuel L really clicked. Too cruel for the kids, but if you and your close friend are trying to negotiate a movie, try this movie for size. Go Gina! Go Gina!
