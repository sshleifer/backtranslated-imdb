I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically. Anyone who calls this film trash or horrible, simply does not understand action movies or does not recognize good. Perhaps some incidents and results may seem contrived, but, in my opinion, screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon / Kiss, Kiss, Blast, Blast) created one of the most well-thought action films you've ever seen. From above or not, this film flows like clockwork, and the action only continues. The final sequence of actions is one of the best I've ever seen in any movie. The cast in this movie crunches. Jenna Davis played amazingly, and, unfortunately, there has never been a sequel to LKG. Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious because her girlfriend Mitch understates his personal look at luck, trying to help her discover her lost past and earn a few dollars. If confuses me, how no one could like this movie. It packs so many thrills and it is so fun. The miracles in this film still make me laugh as much as 10 years later. In my opinion, the first film “The Matrix” and “The Long Kiss for the Night” were easily the two best and most original action films of the 90s. By the way, Shane Black got rich when he sold this script. At that time, it was the best-selling script, and it was worth every penny. It's so sad that the audience never gave the film a chance, because they would have witnessed the best movie of Renny Harlins and Jenna Davis, as you have never seen before. Long live the "The Long Kiss Goodnight" !!
