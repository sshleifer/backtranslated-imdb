This is followed by minor spoilers, but you will not learn anything by reading the back of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Restrained by Rene Zellweger’s remarkable central performance, Nurse Betty is a dark but deceptively good-natured comedy. . <br /> <br /> Suffering from emotional and mental illness after witnessing the murder of her scruffy husband, already anxious and desperately unhappy waitress, Betty is convinced that the character of her favorite day soap is her long-lost fiancé and leaves from Kansas to Hollywood to find it. <br /> <br /> Instead of joking at the expense of Betty’s mental state, writer John S. Richards sympathizes, and Zellweger portrays her lost innocent, not entirely helpless, but tragically vulnerable nonetheless. It is extremely important that she never becomes a victim in spite of this, and although she undoubtedly suffers terribly, the motives of the heroes who treat her badly are understandable - even Greg Kinnear, as an object of her deceived feelings, can be selfish, stupid , arrogant pig, but he truly believes that she is just a dodgy actress-imitator with bags of talent, and not a crazy stalker. <br /> <br /> The end of farce, when all the main characters descend to the same place (in this case, the house of Betty) at the same time, so that he has the same age as the cinema itself, but it works quite well, even if the change in tone is unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> Kinnear and Morgan Freeman skilfully support Zellweger, who does a solid job, and it’s especially nice to see Chris Rock show restraint in his early scenes. <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty, although not at all rebellious with laughter, is not as cruel as you would expect, and not at all mean, solid entertainment has been elevated to something much more leading actress.
