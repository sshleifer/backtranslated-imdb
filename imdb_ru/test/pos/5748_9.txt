This movie was awesome. I was in tears by the end of the film. Well, I know that acting skills sucks, but this is not what was important. The message was loud and clear about God's love for us and the sacrifice of Jesus. The film was realistic and showed real human feelings, whether it was Pete’s anger at the blonde’s taunts or the guy who asked the questions. But it also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with Christ. The cars were awesome and the actors were very hot and this caught my attention. But what I liked most about this movie is the clear message of the Gospel. Mother and pastor supported Ben in his new walk with Christ and tried to be a righteous example for others. Niki Dee showed that regardless of whether you have the whole world, without Christ, it does not matter. Nina showed how misguided, but a good person can easily not hit the mark. I really liked this film, and I think it will lead many teens to Christ.
