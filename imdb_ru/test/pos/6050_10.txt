Semper Fi! I saw "D.I." in 1957. After two and a half years, I joined the Corps. <br /> <br /> The network and the company did their best in 57. Boot, in 1959, was more like a Boot Camp, shown in Full Metal Jacket - yes. The black recruit in my school platoon was called "Snowball". They called me "Stick" because I was skinny like a rail. Each recruit had a nickname, a rather vile one that stuck in his service in the Corps. Getting blows or banging on your ass when you screwed up was a SOP. “Come on, give me fifty”, must be ho-ham. Then it turned into “Drop it and give me two hundred!” <br /> <br /> The directors were a bunch of sadistic bastards, but it was controlled sadism with the main goal of preserving that we, stupid moths, are alive when we fight. 200 years of experience has taken root in this “sadism” and in everything that concerns D.I. had, or said, had a purpose intended for his mission. <br /> <br /> Bad D.I. gets grunts killed. Good DI, the seemingly biggest asshole in the world, keeps them alive. You cannot kill an enemy if you are dead. <br /> <br /> If you didn’t know, the marines have one primary mission: to kill the enemy. Pfd. <br /> <br /> Everything else is pure bravo-sierra. <br /> <br /> MstGySgt WHT, USMC (retired)
