I am definitely not a gamer, but there are a couple people in my family and my boyfriend. So, a little reluctantly, I decided to find out what was wrong with the “fantastic things”. I saw Dorkness Rising and thought it was fun! This is a farce, but disrespect for those who love role-playing. In addition, and most importantly, people who have never played before, can enjoy it and not feel deprived or lost, trying to understand the plot. The acting was great, and the field shots / set were believable. It makes me want to watch other films of this production company. I can't wait to see what this group is waiting for in the future! Three cheers - well done!
