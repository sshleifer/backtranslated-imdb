These prophetic words were uttered by William Holden (as a military reporter) to the beautiful Jennifer Jones (as a Eurasian doctor), explaining his unsuccessful marriage on the beach. They start a novel, despite the huge chances of adultery and racial problems. In the Hollywood of the 1950s, interracial romance was resolved, but in the end they had only grave consequences. Beautiful Hong Kong landscapes (although some beach scenes look like studio scenes), a famous title melody, a poetic script, beautiful background music (by Alfred Newman), great costumes, outstanding performances, especially Jones (directed by Henry King, who also did â€œBernadette-Oscar Song Jones' (1943) still turns this novel into a world-class cry.
