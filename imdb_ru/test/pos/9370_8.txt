"Crossfire" resembles an underdeveloped masterpiece - it is well played and beautifully shot, but finely written and too short. It's just a decent police process with hints of film noir (at the zenith in 1947) and social commentary (also fashionable at the time), added for good measure. Today, he is remembered as one of the first two Hollywood films on anti-Semitism, and much better than the “Gentleman's Agreement” with a similar theme (no small feat). But his real topic is the difficulties that World War II soldiers faced as trained killers when they switched to civilian life. (For a more noble look on this topic, try “The Best Years of Our Lives.”) In the first few frames of the film, a person is beaten to death. We do not see his attacker. The film tells about the investigation of this murder, which is actually quite simple, but it requires some unnecessary workarounds, for example, when the main suspect, a depressed soldier, finds himself in the apartment of Gloria Graham, a prostitute in the dance hall with a really strange pimp performed by Paul Kelly . In the middle of the film there is also a civil lecture, which slows down the process to a crawl, and the ending is neat enough for a police show. But otherwise it is a pretty decent mystery. However, what a great noir it could be. Directed by Edward Dmitrik several times hints at the theme of the original novel - homosexuality, not anti-Semitism - as when the sadistic creep Monty is seething in the form of his friend Mitch talking to a strange man in a bar. And the cast is great. Robert Ryan makes for a highly probable idiot, and even becomes a bit sympathetic in his final scenes, not much different from Peter Lorre as the murderer of children in “M.” He deserved an Oscar, but lost to Edmund Gwenn this year (you can't beat Santa Claus). Robert Mitchum is a friend of the accused killer soldier. Was Mitchum a great actor or a great star? Some may understand this, but his sleepy eyes and a bemused half-smile work very well here, because they imply that his character knows something that everyone else does not know. (And he does.) And Robert Young, as a murder detective, is surprisingly rude, discarding his usual courtesy, even when he needs to preach a civil rights sermon halfway through the picture. There is no doubt that Bogart or Tracy would be great in this role, but none of them was in RKO in 1947, so you just have to deal with Dr. Welby. Nevertheless, Young is good enough to make you want someone to play him in a detective drama instead of “Father knows better”, which he hated and which led him to attempts at alcoholism and suicide. A man deserves better than Smarm and Sanka.
