I was a little surprised at the PG rating on the back of the dvd case. I certainly would not want my children to watch this. I think it would scare the crap for a 10 year old. <br /> <br /> Plot: A girl trying to fit into a clique is exhausted and tortured “in a crowd”. They persuade her to spend the night in this creepy mausoleum (which reminded me of the Ghost ...), and they continue to torment her at night. Little do they know, the recently deceased clairvoyant comes back to life and raises the dead around them! It sounds terribly stupid, but given the age and budget, which, no doubt, was rather small, this film is interesting on many levels. <br /> <br /> Watch for the early release of the EG Daily as one of the most popular people. I liked it and it scared my girlfriend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 children.
