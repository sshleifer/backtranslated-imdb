Ali G Indahouse must have been one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, and Cohen's image of British gangsters is funny. This film has a cult classic written everywhere, and it has some really great lines. Ali G Indahouse is a good evening film that will make the viewer laugh literally from beginning to end. Definitely vote for Ali Ji and keep it real.
