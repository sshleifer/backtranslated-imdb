A year after Love Thy Neighbor made his I.T.V. making his debut, he followed the route "By bus" and "Stepto and son", going to the big screen in a picture shot by Hammer Films. It begins with a fiery patriotic speech, praising the dignity of a green and pleasant English land, and then - a shot of Eddie and Bill walking down the street, arguing furiously. It develops into a strange series of white and black neighbors, destroying each other's houses. At least, the original thematic melody is preserved (even if it is sung by someone other than Stuart Gillis). <br /> <br /> The local newspaper “The Gazette” holds a competition to find the best neighbors, the winners of landing on a Mediterranean cruise. Barbie invites Joan to come in. The fact is, can Bill and Eddie remain friends long enough to win it? This is the main part of the plot. The film is by and large episodic. One piece is taken straight from the first season, namely: Bill and Eddie go to the Club, pretending to be engaged in “union business.” In fact, they are going to see a stripper (without meeting with two girls). In another part of the film, Bill, along with other black factory workers (in the series, he was the only one) broke the blow that Eddie helped with various tricks (including smuggling through the gates in beer barrels). While the other (seemingly inspired by “For Ada's Love” by Powell and the Driver) sees Eddie's talkative mother (the great Patricia Hayes), who has befriended Bill's father (Charles Hyatt). <br /> <br /> The climax of Episode 1 Season 1 reappears expanded. Bill puts on paint and a towel again to scare Eddie, but his friends join him and they dance around the drum containing the naked booth so they can pretend to cook and eat it. Then Eddie must return home naked (surprisingly, there is less nudity here than in episode 2, season 2). <br /> <br /> The film ends with Reynolds and Booths who won Love. Competition of your neighbor and a joint cruise, but there is an unexpected turn with the participation of the insane brother Joan Cyril (James Beck - "Private" from the "Army of the Pope"), who works as a steward. <br /> This is your typical 70s comedy film with all the flaws commonly found in such films. Laughter dissipated everywhere, and interest in half an hour decreases. The cast is complemented by familiar faces such as Melvin Hayes (starring Terry, character from the first episode of season 2, played on this occasion by Leslie Meadows), Bill Fraser (as factory manager), Anna Dawson, Andria Lawrence (who it seems to have been in every British 70s comedy film, mostly filmed as a nymphomaniac), and Arthur Inglish. Director John Robins was also responsible for the film "Man About the House." <br /> <br /> The funniest moment is that while Eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, Bill paints his face with black. The first thing he knows about this is when the manager’s secretary cries out in horror. The tables were turned upside down!
