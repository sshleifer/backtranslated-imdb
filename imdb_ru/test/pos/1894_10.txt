I find this film a joyless, insecure, lethargic and skillfully unsuccessful choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw away the script, turn on the camera and act like a fool. I find unfavorable performances, lighting, cinematography, sound, and any other laws of the d'Urville Martin film school violated. Speaking from the point of view of the directors, there are times when I just want to quit and have fun on the set. This movie looks fun. When other aspiring directors ask me, I just advise them to watch any Rudy Ray Moore film. They always return a puzzled look, asking me why not look at the masters Woody Allen, Scorsese, Lucas, Capra? I laugh and say you always want to know what not to do in cinematic stories.
