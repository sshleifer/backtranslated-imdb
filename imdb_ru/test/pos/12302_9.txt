John Houston, actor and director, better known for tougher tariffs, such as Inconsistencies and The Queen of Africa, directs his daughter Angelica Houston in what will be his last film. Indeed, the film was released after the death of Houston. Based on the story of the same name by James Joyce, “The Dead” tells the quiet story of New Year's celebration in Dublin in 1904. Houston, his actors and his screenwriters, including his son Tony, created the film's gem. Novella - one of the best works of Joyce (as well as the only one that is removed). The film is a tribute to the genius of Houston. He made a little beautiful story and made a little beautiful film. Donal McCann and Angelica Houston are shining (although “shine” is too impressive, too catchy a word to describe their quiet, understated views). "Dead" reflects the love of the family of Houston to Ireland and, in its own way, is a suitable final film for the legend.
