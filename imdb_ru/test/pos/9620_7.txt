The epic martial arts film Chang Chang Ho of 1972, The Five Fingers of Death, is widely viewed by many filmmakers and kung fu fans as a martial arts movie that started it all. <br /> <br / Being released in 1972, it was the second stage of a three-stage process that led to an explosion of martial arts films in the West - the movie "Billy Jack" (1971) was released, with its famous disassembly of Hapkido in the park. a year earlier, and two years later, Bruce Lee starred in the movie "Enter the Dragon" (1973), thereby strengthening the place of martial arts films in Western cinema. <br /> <br /> But what is the hype around the Five? Fingers of death "? The film, with its terrible dubbing, explosive (if not quite incredible) action films, technical flaws and everything else, has a plot, albeit very thin. Chih-Hao (late Luo Li) - who has chosen to represent his school in the upcoming martial arts tournament. His teacher invites him to independently train in the style of the Iron Fist, so deadly that he can very easily kill a man with one blow. <br /> <br /> In addition, Chi-Hao arrival to the school gives a violent conflict with a rival school, its students, and a trio of assassins with heavy hitters from Japan. Before you realize this, serious failure threatens to train Chih-Hao and his ability to represent his favorite school in the upcoming tournament. <br /> <br / > Let me just say that “Five Fingers of Death” is actually the film that started it all. As another viewer noted, “Five Fingers of Death” helped set many standards in martial arts films over the next three decades - Asian, European martial arts films in North America and North America. Such standards include a devoted student, learning patience and endurance, conflicts between competing schools, intense ethnic enmity between the Chinese and the Japanese, and studying the struggle for this good old-fashioned militant motive: revenge. “Five Fingers of Death” will also play an important role in American films directed by Quentin Tarantino “Kill Bill” (Tarantino borrows quite freely from this project, among many others, as you know). <br /> <br /> The acting is quite good, given the fact that this is a film about the martial arts of the early 1970s, the best of which is Lo Lia. As an atypical student of martial arts, his performance is quite innovative, although at first glance at this film you will not know about it because of how this particular arc of the character was killed so many times over the years. He is quite modest in his game, doing his best to persistently pursue his enemies and not fight them in anger or sink to the level of stupidity or arrogance. In addition, when he suffers a serious setback, it makes your heart fall a little bit, because it is so cruel, and you ask yourself if he is going to recover enough to realize his ambitions for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> “Five fingers of death” is a classic in every sense. It’s by no means perfect, and crazy audiences expect something like the Godfather of martial arts films. what it offers is the best example of Eastern hand-to-hand combat from times before Eastern cinema became a major adaptation in the West. <br /> 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS: “Enter the dragon Bolo Jung also appears as a Mongolian street fighter at the beginning of the film.
