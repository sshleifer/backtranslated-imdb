This movie is about entertainment. Imagine that your friends with whom you love to spend time, those you know inside out, become a little stupid and may acquire one or two characters. That's what this movie is about. Inventive script and brilliantly executed. This is not about making the masses happy, but about having fun with a group of brilliantly talented people. That, I am sure, was what they all thought when they signed up for it. <br /> <br /> The above review sounds completely unfair, and I think the one who wrote this was not in the right mood when watching a movie. In the blink of an eye, there is a great merit in this if you want to look. <br /> <br /> Well done work, I thought it was a great movie. I would have looked at this before the North American norm. <br /> <br /> In short, this is not the best movie youâ€™ll ever see, but it has some damn moments. I did not laugh so long in age.
