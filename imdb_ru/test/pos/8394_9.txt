I'm a big fan of Gone with the Wind, but I was disappointed that both Gone with the Wind and the Scarlett mini-series are so different from books. "Gone With the Wind" left so much in the film that was in the book, and they did the same with Scarlett. Both were good movies, but I really liked both books more. There were so many characters left outside Scarlett, and the age of some characters seemed to be different from the book. Dates also do not match. Scarlett realizes that she is pregnant on a ship to Ireland in a book, but she understands this when she is sick, when in Sawahann. In addition, Sally is depicted in the book as an ugly monkey, as a woman, and in the film Jean Smart played it, which is obviously not an ugly woman. In the end, Scarlett is a good movie, and he helps everyone who was disappointed with how Gone with the Wind ended up to see what could happen if Margaret Mitchell lived to write a sequel.
