I watched this series after “Tipping velvet”, for which I gave a rating of 10/10. I read user comments about this and expected a similar good series, or, if possible, even better. At the moment I have to emphasize that this series is good, and it definitely captured me in all this and is therefore worth seeing. However, I didn’t like Tipping the Velvet for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Less passion, love, and sexual attendant content. These elements had surprisingly little attention, which I considered an integral part of a love story. Fingersmith felt like a diluted version of Tipping the Velvet. <br /> <br /> 2. In the same way as in the Tipping of Velvet, the story consisted of three parts: the beginning, the shocking second part and the end. The second part was supposed to be the culmination of the story (as in velvet tipping), but instead it was almost completely missed, perhaps because of the inability to make the shocking, but believable content of the shelter. The series was supposed to consist of three parts, including two cliffhanger, with much more attention to the second part. <br /> <br /> 3. Almost no emphasis was placed on what Fingersmiths are and how it affected their personality. I was rather annoyed that such a central theme was not properly addressed in the series. <br /> <br /> 4. The ending was much more hasty than at Tipping the Velvet. Fingersmith left some interesting storylines open. <br /> <br /> Despite these shortcomings, Fingersmith is a good series and costs 7/10. However, it is not a classic, like a tipping velvet.
