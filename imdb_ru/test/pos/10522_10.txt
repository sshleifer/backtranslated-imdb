I managed to record "Dion Brothers", outside of television broadcasting (with advertising) in the early 80s. I lent it to many friends, and they all agree that this is one of the best gangster films ever made. One day, when I went to my apartment in New York, I saw Stacy Keach filming the scene for her Mickey Spilane TV series. We had a moment to chat, and I told him how I liked THE DION BROS, and found it pure classics. He thanked me and said that it was one of the best and most memorable films of his entire career. He was very friendly and sincere, and I was grateful for the few minutes he spent talking to a fan. This is one classic that should be on DVD.
