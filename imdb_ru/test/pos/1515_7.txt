Well, this is new ... Famous Italian horror director Lucio Fulci is shooting a film about a famous Italian horror director called ... Lucio Fulci. After many years of witnessing horrible horror episodes, Lucio becomes difficult to separate reality from fiction, and he often hallucinates the commission of violent murders. He quickly descends further, like an endless spiral of madness and unverifiable poison. Even a dedicated psychiatrist does not seem to be able to keep Fulci on the right track ... Now, when it comes to pure fun and entertainment, Cat in the Brain is certainly one of the most enjoyable Fulci movies. The mountain is all-consuming and abundant, if not more. It’s impossible to describe the number of dirty kills, especially when you manage to get a completely uncut version (also referred to as “Nightmare Concert”). Everywhere, beheading, the victim's intestines spread to all sides of the screen, and chainsaws work overtime! The film also becomes unintentionally funny pretty soon (since it is so exaggerated) and is an ideal experience to watch with a group of friends when there is a beer in the fridge. Of course, from a more professional point of view, this work cannot be called a masterpiece! There is not the slightest tension or atmosphere to detect, and the characters are completely empty. To make room for blood, characters are entered for 5 seconds and subsequently die a horrible death. Especially compared to the main points of Fulci - such as "Beyond the Boundary" or "Do not Try the Duck" - this film looks like a quickly heated snack. The best way to interpret the “Cat in the brain” is as Fulci’s personal statement and direct attack on censorship. Perhaps having seen so many of his films? especially the last ?? being cut off by censorship committees and beaten by pseudo-art critics, he wanted to avenge himself by creating a bloody mess that is simply impossible to cut off! If you remove all the obvious violence and really sick effects of makeup, you will only have about 10 minutes of footage! Especially since the insane killings occur again later in the film, as Fulci again hallucinates about them. You can almost hear how our director thinks something like: “Let's see how you are going to censor it now!” Even the whole development of the murder investigation takes place in the background. Do victims miss friends or relatives? Are there any policemen who are looking for evidence that will lead them to the killer? You do not know, and Lucio does not bother to inform you about it, because it will lead to a sequence that does not require cutting. Oh, and this is damn pretentious! The name “Mr. Fulci” or even “Lucio” is mentioned every 3 minutes (to be exact, 34 times throughout the film), and our director clearly likes to be in the spotlight for a change. Hey, I certainly don’t blame him ... After more than 30 years of making funny movies; he deserves a little extra fun. You are God, Mr. Fulci!
