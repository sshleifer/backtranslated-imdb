For me, this is another one of those films that I saw on the Z channel in Los Angeles when he worked. And it was another one of those films that I saw in my youth ... and found out that there was a world ... one that I did not want to accept. <br /> <br /> Moving to Los Angeles and the fact that I watched an international cinema became my hobby for pleasure, and to date none of the premiere programs corresponded to the “Z” channel in international films. The three international films that were stuck in my head were Spetters, Beau Pere and, of course, this Pixote. <br /> <br /> It was the most shocking and saddest film I've ever seen in my movie. a life. It was also one of the first films that made me realize that there was a difference in cinema: to entertain and inform. Let me be honest ... grew up in a small town on the east coast, I had no idea that something like that — to such an extent — existed. All I knew from South America was brochures about an incredible vacation in Brazil and that there was a lot of drug business in Colombia. <br /> <br /> Then comes a movie like Pixote. Sad. Anxious. Intrepid. Fearfully. You are watching: Children. Those who need shelter, love, understanding and all that they get is a way to survive day after day with drugs, sex, robbery, theft, sleeping in the streets, in sadistic homes for groups, etc. D. For their survival is difficult to observe other street children. , prostitutes, etc., and you start to think about HOW you can allow such things to happen in this world. <br /> <br /> Pixote is not an entertaining film, but an informational film. It shows shocking and disturbing images - but it shows life for these daily street children.
