I watched this movie with high expectations, but was somewhat disappointed. Although I like this film and was absorbed in history, I did not find it moving and I think that the end did not work. <br /> <br /> The story consists of the friendship between the man who runs the photo shop and his best client. who is a policeman in transport. The place is a strange Korean village. <br /> <br /> This film is somewhat realistic because it contains an element of tragedy, but it is not melodramatic. However, in the end, I was not touched by the film, which depicts a man whom a woman loves so much, but does not even give her the choice to enter his life. In my opinion, he is a cute, noble loser. <br /> <br /> Good moments are a great game of two main reasons, a nice snapshot of rural life <br /> <br /> Minuses are a flat ending <br /> <br /> Overall is good, but I prefer movies "Before dawn" and "After dusk" (or before "Before dusk" and "After dawn")
