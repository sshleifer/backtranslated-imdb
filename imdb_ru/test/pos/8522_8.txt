You do not watch films about James Bond, you evaluate them, evaluate them according to how they meet expectations. There are certain things that can be expected, even the demand for a Bond film, and each individual effort either brings or not. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond movie a Bond movie. And although NEVER SAYING NEVER AGAIN is technically part of the official Bond filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery, returning in 007, makes him something more than just an honorary member of the series. In any case, here’s how it is rated on a scale from 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Headline: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: a clever headline has no clear connection to the real storyline, but instead is a link in the joke on Sean Connery's Promise never to play OO7 again after he was once again lured into the DIAMOND game FOREVER. In any case, this is a catchy name. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Predkreditny teaser: Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels with the official series of films about Bond EON, there is no teaser; introductory scenes are only shown for captions. And even this is disappointing: another fake "oh no, Bond was killed." 4 points. <br /> <br /> Opening Credits: aside from the screen filled with tiny 007, they didn’t even bother trying to cheer up loans with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 point <br /> <br /> Theme song: written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall “Never Say Never”, is made for the pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, this is just fine. 6 points. <br /> <br /> “Bond, James Bond”: accordingly, since in this film Connery returns to service as Bond after a ten-year break, the story begins with 007, when the question arises whether Bond / Connery is still at work. Fortunately, Connery more than proves that he is ready for Bondage again. Despite the fact that he is a little gray, has a little more girth and wears a slightly more noticeable wig, he seems to return to the battle without any problems. All in all, this is one of Connery's best and most relaxed turns as a character. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Babes: Even in the best Bond films, female characters do not have a large dimension; they exist mainly as necessary details for using Bond. The future Oscar winner Kim Basinger is given a great deal of freedom in creating her character Domino Petachi, and the film benefits from this. She is doing a good job — and looking at her is good, too. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Villain: Reports of his death are clearly exaggerated, Blofeld is back - at least for now - showing that he has more lives than his beloved cat. Max von Sydow, who once became the stereotypical villain depicting Jesus, does little in this role, but, nevertheless, he is just silky. But he is overshadowed by the wonderful performance of Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a whole series of banal villains from Bond, Brandauer is so refreshing that it gives an idea that is both subtle but colorfully evil. Funny, not being polite, ruthless, not seemingly cartoonish; his Largo stands there with Aurik Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? Playing with all the bold style of especially bright transvestites, Barbara Carrera pierces the film, showing a mixture of funny evil and not just pure psychotic madness. Bond crossed the path with various femme fatales, most of whom got rid of them so easily that they existed rather like a fun candy for the eyes than like characters. But few dared to show such a flash for dramatic or such cruel determination. Even her untimely death is impressive, even by the standards of Bond. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Ominous plot: as a remake of a kind of THUNDERBALL, the film really looks a bit done already: nuclear missiles are stolen, and large real estate will go to Kabum if all countries of the world do not pay a ransom for a few thousand dollars. But at least the producer Kevin McClory was lucky, and he was forced to remake one of Bond’s weakest adventures. For comparison, this effort takes the "Thunderball" out of the water. And, despite the absence of many Bondian brands, the film was a success in itself. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Production values: the film begins with an uneasy style, like a television film trying to be more than it can. But as the story progresses, the film is gaining momentum and dedication, which makes it an excellent adventure. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bonus points: there are several strange changes that distinguish this Bond film from the official series. Miss Manipenny is hardly recognized; Edward Fox’s “M” is a moody old grumbler who doesn’t respect the Twin Wasps, foreshadowing how Judy Dench would play a role later; and "Q" suddenly has a Cockney accent and is friends with Bond. And the film has a curious feeling of nostalgia, for example, the replacement of Astin-Martin Bond with an old Packard and a tango dance, which is cleverly inserted into the story. A big rescue near the end - on horseback, a tribute to "Runners of the Lost Ark", which itself was a tribute to Bond films. 5 points. <br /> <br /> Summary: NEVER TALK NEVER - this is a mixed bag. In really important areas, this is more than there is, thanks to hero Connery, the villain Brandauer, the assassin Carrera and the unfortunate girl Basinger. But the devil is in the details; no matter how important the opening credits are, the thematic song and the like, the film is lacking because of their absence. All this looks like an artificial Bond film; very good replacement, but, nevertheless, replacement. <br /> <br /> Bond-o-meter Rating: 78 points out of 100.
