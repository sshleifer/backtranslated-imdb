This film reminds “Boys in the Hood”, “Threat to society”, “The Central Part of the South” and other similar ones, and is even shared by actors with some of them. The mentality of the film "we are against the law" is emphasized by the black neighborhood against the almost white police forces. Here the police are so bad that they seem to be caricatures, and in one scene they even ambush the boys when they drive in a car that they just “freed” from its owner. It looks like a goat from an old western, but the modern setting makes it look too real. <br /> <br /> The story tells about young Jason Petty and his buddies, for whom the school is just an inconvenience, taking time away from their “real occupation” by raising cars. This happens to be Newark, New Jersey, a rusty-belt town with a low number of jobs, but a notoriously high crime rate. In fact, the problem is so serious that all the policemen have a “carjacking” on their backs to show that the whole unit should be devoted to this particular crime. <br /> <br /> Boys use “slim Jim” to “joyfully burst into cars and ride for joy, as if it’s not scary. They face real trouble only when they are satisfied with the police. A vicious Nazi-like lieutenant has vendetta against boys, seeing in them not people who can be worthy of redemption, but people. In fact, he reminds a little of that sadistic Nazi officer from the Warsaw ghetto who shot down Jews for pleasure in the film “Schindler's List.” car in retaliation for the ambush, everything, as expected, quickly goes downhill. They are brutally beaten by the police, and Jason finally finds himself in prison. Obviously, these are the “bad guys” who would have stolen your car in a minute, but the film wants us to see antiheroes in them, showing Jason protecting his sister and his friend caring for his own grandmother.The film made us think about which side to stand on and who is sadder: boys whose lives are crumbling, honest citizens, whose cars are stolen left and right and that can get under the crossfire of the exchange of fire at any moment or the city of Newark itself, the spirit of the law of which is betrayed by cruel, soulless policemen. <br /> <br /> Despite the excessive image of the latter, the film offers a realistic view of the ghetto, the main characters and their families, as well as the culture of car theft in the city, where it appears that there are only 2 career paths - law enforcement agencies and crime. Strange, but the drug theme is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers (including producer Spike Lee) are clearly biased against the Newark Police, which we hope is not as bad as it is portrayed here. However, they gave us another strong, moving story about the inner city and that black youth went awry, and Sharron Corley is fine, like Jason.
