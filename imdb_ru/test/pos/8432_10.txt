A highly politically charged drama that, despite prejudice, is extremely good, and is one of the smartest films ever made. He almost does not preach, but rather follows a naive television reporter who is gradually aware of the threat posed by nuclear power plants, not because of his inherent danger, but because suppliers are more interested in the end result than in the safety of those <br /> <br /> Many hated the film because they viewed it as a political treatise created by ultra-liberals such as Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas, but if you look at it simply as a drama, it is exciting, exciting, full with well-developed, impressive characters and, ultimately, a really tense modern thriller that ends up next to the house. <br /> <br /> Historical background: for some, especially for the power engineers and residents of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the metro area, he struck, perhaps too close to the house, because less than a week after the release of this film there was a devastating explosion at Three Mile Island nuclear facility. <br /> <br /> Update, 04/08/2007: For almost a decade since I first wrote this criticism, I have heard many comments on the film. One thing that I think really needs to be noted is that this film is not an "ultra-liberal" anti-nuclear tirade, which it often labels as. <br /> <br /> Although the creators and stars (or were) of the famous liberals of the Hollywood Establishment, what this film attacks is not the very idea of ​​nuclear energy, but rather the idea of ​​human greed, corruption and fallacy putting doubt the potential dangers that nature has already made dangerous. <br /> <br /> No one who accepts reality can argue that human exposure to nuclear radiation, at least, can be fatal. My close friends who had worked at a nuclear power plant for several years even told me about their employer's official policy regarding the “safest” levels of exposure that its employees can handle. <br /> <br /> You do not need to believe that corporations are evil in nature to recognize that people in the pursuit of wealth and power are greedy and often corrupt. And even if you refute this statement, you cannot dispute the fact that all people are prone to make mistakes. When it comes to the exposure of innocent people, we cannot make any mistakes, and this is, above all, the argument that this film seeks to make. <br /> <br /> Condemn it if necessary, but try to have a little perspective. We are currently participating in a war, the results of which are very different from those originally predicted, in an incredibly costly war without end. And regardless of whether you think that war was necessary to fight global terrorism, you cannot dispute the reality that the duration, financial costs and, most importantly, the death of people far exceeded the levels that “experts” assured. We returned to 2003 So, even if no one is involved in the process, he is greedy or corrupt, “mistakes have been made” and mistakes of a rather serious magnitude. The same serious mistakes, if made in the nuclear industry, can make a large part of the earth’s surface uninhabitable.
