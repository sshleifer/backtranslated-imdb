Western through and through. As the protagonist of Glenn Ford says, "No, I do not want to fight, but I will if it is imposed on me." This film is about being smart, strong and fighting for your beliefs. With courage, never stop striving for what you think is right. Great action and mostly fast paced. It's nice to see Brian Keith in this role and Edward J. Robinson as an elderly Westerner. Glenn Ford justifies his western image. A very nice movie includes strategic non-military wars. Of course, he is cruel, as in the headlines, but not too visual, as in the films of the era, created on the computer. This is mainly about strong personality clashes.
