I first saw The Signs of Life on PBS as a presentation of the American Playhouse. This is a beautifully written, ensemble piece with amazing performances by Michael Lewis in the role of Joey and Vincent D'Onofrio in the role of his brother Daryl. Arthur Kennedy, in one of his last roles, is also excellent as an aging shipbuilder, whose family business is nearing completion. The rest of the cast, which includes Beau Bridges, Kathy Bates and Mary Louise Parker, gives your characters a great clarity and content. <br /> <br /> Direction is subtle and effective. I watched this movie several times over the years and highly recommend it. A wonderful piece of filmmaking.
