I did not know anything about this movie before I watched it. It seems that this lesser-known teen horror of the 80s. What struck me was how different it was from many other films of that era. <br /> <br /> The first thing I noticed was how slowly this film is being created. This does not make a typical installation showing the killed characters one by one. It takes time to build a story, leaving a little mystery about what can happen. I was almost starting to think that in this film no one would even suffer. But everything leads to a climatic sequence in the last 15 minutes, and then it becomes quite graphic (it was a bad time to have a snack - I almost could not finish my pizza as soon as it started). <br /> Characters also seem a bit more three-dimensional than dozens of cheap films for teens. There, the conversations were mostly balanced, as opposed to the excessive stereotypes that you expect. For example, the popular snob, the queen bee at the clique, does not constantly insult everyone, but is able to have doubts and show respect for others. <br /> <br /> So, summing up, I felt that this film was somewhat original compared to what I expected, and a little better done. It attracted me, interested, and then gave me that. As I said, it's pretty awful in the finals, but most of the time it's almost a friendly family. I don't need to own it, but I'm glad I discovered it.
