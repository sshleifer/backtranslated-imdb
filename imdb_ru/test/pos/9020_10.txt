I saw this film a week ago, and I had to persuade my friend to go with me, because this film seems to receive such bad reviews. Of course, this is not “human trafficking” or “blocking, stock ...”, but by no means a failure. I think that the fact that there are so many big budget films at the moment means that it was ignored, but should not be. I believe that he is going to do what he wants - to entertain us for one and a half hours and leave us happy and contented. I would prefer to go see “Mom”, which looks boring. And no, I'm not a teenager. Do not listen to critics, Star Wars fans - no. This film is worth seeing, if only to see the gorgeous Luc de Lacey and Rupert Penry-Jones. Go look!
