In this insane thriller from Colombia, which is a combination of "Panic in the Streets" and "Naked City", Evelyn Case, unknowingly, is the killer who chased New York. Evelyn, who imported some stolen jewels from Cuba, also smuggled smallpox. Dr. William Bishop incorrectly diagnoses him, and when they find out what she is hunting. <br /> <br /> Most of the film, the Treasury also hunts for Keese, but smuggled jewels. Almost until the end of the film, the health department and law enforcement agencies understand that they are looking for the same woman. <br /> <br /> Evelyn is also on a mission. Her husband, Charles Corwin, left her apartment, and this was the strangest case of him fooling around with her sister while she was in Cuba, collecting precious stones and catching smallpox. When Lola Albright, as her sister, commits suicide because of this whole affair, Evelyn is on a mission to get Corvina or die trying. And this is not an empty threat, given the current situation. <br /> <br /> The film was mainly shot in New York, for example, in the “Naked City”, and its actors are richly studded with familiar names and faces. Watch out for the good performances of Connie Gilchrist as the inglorious mistress of Evelyn, Jim Backus as the fleeting owner of the club, and Art Smith as the fence of Corwin. <br /> <br /> A real sleeper in the noir category, do not miss it if broadcast.
