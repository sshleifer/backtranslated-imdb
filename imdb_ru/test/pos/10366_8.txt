Consider me happy to see Hastings in this episode. Dr. Watson does nothing for the poor for me, as he simply drags every scene he is in. Jupp is often needed for history as a bureaucratic representative, and little Miss Lemon is good for seasoning, but Hastings sways dimly to manners in different episodes. If I have to sit through another empty "Oh, I say there!" I'll take the gas pipe. <br /> <br /> As a rule, the more Poirot in the Poirot story, the better. Each line for Hastings is taken from Poirot. And I have never read a book, so I really care about loyalty to Christieâ€™s characters. Many viewers / reviewers seem to have a problem with the separation of films from books. If you want a book to be written, read it. I see no reason to watch the television version, if you know what will happen next at each stage. Theater is not prose - do not expect transcription.
