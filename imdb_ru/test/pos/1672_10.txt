If the caper genre owes much to Walter Houston, he must also thank Jules Dassin, a man who was ahead of his time and badly hurt because of his blacklist, when Edward Dmitrik accused him of being a communist. The end of his American career would mean the end of Mr. Dassin, but moving to Europe proved that he was more than the same people who contributed to his death in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> “Rififi” is an elegant film in which all the necessary elements are combined thanks to the vision of Mr. Dassin. He decided to adapt the novel by Auguste Le Breton, because he saw the possibility of turning it into a caper film, which has become a real classic. Jules Dassin was penniless in Paris when he discovered the city that was going to serve as the background for his film. Bad weather paid off for Mr. Dassin, as the streets were always wet, and there was no need to do anything to show them that way. <br /> <br /> When we first meet Tony, he plays cards. Tony has poor health; he coughs all the time and sweats profusely. Having lost all his money, he goes to visit Joe, a Swede, who tells him about the possibility of robbery at Maupin & Webb, a fashion jewelry store in a thin part of Paris. They convey this idea through Mario, who offers Cesar, a Milanese expert to a safe burglar. <br /> <br /> Tony, recently released from prison, finds out that Mado, his former lover, now with Grutter, is creeping, owning a nightclub. When meeting with Mado instead of love, all he feels is contempt, and the meeting ends badly, and he throws her out of his seat. Grootter does not like Tony, who is his natural enemy because of his connection with Mado. <br /> <br /> When the day comes, the gang can get to the apartment building on the second floor, directly above. In the jewelry store, the owner lives, but he is not. Everything is going well, and the gang is leaving the jewels. Cesar, a Milanese, a typical ladies' man, takes the ring as a souvenir, which, in turn, he gives chanterelles in the nightclub Grutter. This tactical error is a spark that destroys a well thought out plan. <br /> <br /> Jean Servays made a superb Tony. He showed a weary man who may have committed his last robbery. Karl Mohner, Robert Manuel and director Jules Dassin are Joe, Mario and Cesar, the thieves of jewelery thieves. Marie Sabure plays Mado. Marcel Lupovici plays Grutter with subdued intensity. Robert Hussein, who will later be filmed in films, makes an impression on his Remy, one of Grutter's people. <br /> <br /> The best in the film is Philip Agostini’s magnificent cinematography that captures the atmosphere of Paris and the places where all these criminals work. The music of Georges Aurika goes well with the action in the film. Jules Dassin was special in choosing the films he made, and, unfortunately, this is our loss, because this man was a genius, as evidenced mainly by “Naked City”, “Night in the Big City” and “Rifi”.
