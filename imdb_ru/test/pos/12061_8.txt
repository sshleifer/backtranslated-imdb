I love this series, its funny and unique off-wall style, sometimes controversial comedy, is a new take on the genre. Although this is a comedy series, it stands out due to the fact that it may be an awkward subject. <br /> <br /> Every aspect has a comedic twist, and the show is really very good. My favorite part of the program is the rather strange comments of the father, Dave. his pompousness breaks the program and gives a really good flow. not perfect, because sometimes the comedy does not laugh out loud funny, and the actors sometimes seem to wait for an answer from the audience, but otherwise the program is good. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this program. I am very sad that it was canceled. please make another series and finish it correctly
