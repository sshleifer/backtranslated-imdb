Forget about Easy Rider - “Head” is a film about the 1960s. <br /> <br /> I almost laugh: when monkeys fold their entire careers into a one-minute ad for dandruff! See: 50-foot Victor Mature is trying to figure out what the hell he is doing in this movie! Listen: Frank Zappa (with his favorite cow on a leash) says to Davey Jones: “Your music is terribly white!” Experience: the only live performance of the Monkees, like a real rock band, performs a real real punk rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: how Davy Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song that he has a transgender father! Be embarrassed: be very embarrassed, like Terry Garr, when Mickey Dolenc makes sexy hints at her in his movie debut! Witness: useless protests against the Vietnam War jump out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear! Hours: Mike Nesmith spat on Christmas, wearing a Victorian velvet jacket, in a spider gothic horror movie sound stage! Allow yourself to plunge into karmic bliss inspired by a comic version of Indian mysticism created by a white-black character-black actor, while Peter Tork pretends to know how to play the guitar! Discover: The first feature film directed by Bob Rafelson for an Oscar. The author of the film - Oscar winner Jack Nicholson! Pretend this doesn't happen: when monkeys commit group suicide by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge! Take drugs - take a lot of drugs: take as many drugs as, obviously, the actors and the crew filmed in this film! <br /> <br /> With Monkeys, monkeys have shown themselves to be the most evil, most disgusting actors in the history of Hollywood, without exception. It is surprising that they blamed the failure of this film for bad advertising. Certainly, the promotion practically did not exist; but didn’t they realize how evil, depressing and believable this film really is ?! I mean, this film - a trip on a bad acid - to the suicide unit of a mental hospital. The only film that I know is so depressing is the film “Brazil” by Terry Gilliam; and, like Brazil, this film shows why life at the end of the 20th century was almost unbearable - if you were lucky. The point is not only that Western culture suffered from a serious information overload, but the information itself was simply bad, bad, more bad and gloomy. In fact, it was the very effect of overload that made people move, as it allowed people to be distracted from one crisis or another — if the news from Vietnam got too strong, they could turn the channel and watch a documentary about the rising Unemployment rate. <br /> <br /> The “positive” response to the reality found in Head was Woodstock - three days of peace, love, nudity, mud, beetles, bad food, dirty drink, poop, urine, and bad acid. and Peter Townsend almost killed Abby Hoffman. All this happened behind the steel fence, under the lovingly vigilant eyes of a real army of New York soldiers. This meant that the “freedom” of the Woodstock nation was just as illusory as the song that John Sebasion thought he sang while he was so excited that he could hardly speak. “500,000 idiots are too stupid to get out of the rain,” was the opinion of one critic of Woodstock (I think it was Andy Warhol). <br /> <br /> The only good thing that happened there was the Jimi Hendrix Star-shiny banner. Two years earlier, the Jimi Hendrix Experience went on their first national tour of America as a rehearsal band for the Monkees. <br /> <br /> You see, all this is somehow connected. <br /> <br /> You are in debt to yourself - no, you are in debt to your unborn children - to see the real 1960s, which can only be found on the film in this strange, wonderful and completely absurd tribute to one of the most interesting capitalist speculators of the late 20th century.
