I lost count of how many times I watched this movie. I have never been tired of this, as this is a film that can be listened to and interpreted on many levels. they just don't make such films anymore. <br /> <br /> After recently, finally, we watched an exciting documentary about the creation of this film (“Hearts of Darkness: A Journey of Cinematographers in Madness”), I am even more amazed that this film is even finished, but it turns out alone so great. <br /> <br /> The fact that they shot this film in the jungles of the Philippines is the greatest advantage of the film. You really feel like in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> all the actors are fantastic, my favorites are Robert Duval (“I like the smell of napalm in the morning!”), Martin Sheen, and the great Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> Many people complain that the film is getting too dark, weird and mental. well, remember that Coppolla said about this film: “This film is not about Vietnam, this is Vietnam!” he means that this film is about madness, not about war. <br /> <br /> This film is based on the Heart of Darkness story by Joseph Conrad and is directed against the Vietnam War, not a civil war like in a book. I think it was a brilliant combination, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, complex film that is dark, brutal, at times humorous and well done in all possible ways. <br /> <br /> a real classic <br /> <br /> rating: 10
