Ray is interesting in details, and technically he is very well made, but Ray is often slow and forgets some important details about Ray’s life. All that the film shows is the parts where it is in the prime of life, and the most successful, and that is good, I just wanted to see something about his older life. Jamie Foxx emulates Ray Charles, sometimes it is absolutely strange. I have to say, Jamie is the reason I went through this movie. The first half is much better than the second. It's more interesting, he has more Oomph, and it's not nearly as slow as the 2nd one. Honestly, I was not a big fan of Ray Charles, so I really had no expectations from the film like never before. Ray’s biggest problem should have been an excessive length. This could be cut very easily, with more relevant scenes, except those they used. I found an early part of Ray’s life when he was just beginning to become successful, most interesting. Then he was a modest and somewhat gentleman. And although the film may have too exaggerated his actions, he was too overwhelmed by himself for me to care. <br /> <br /> Performance. Jamie Fox gives an idea for ages in the role of Ray. He looks like Ray, speaks like Ray, behaves like Ray. He even sings like Ray! This is much more than an impression, I really believed that he was, Ray Charles. He was the heart of the film, and without his presence this film would have been a complete and hopeless occupation. <br /> <br /> The result. Ray is sometimes interesting, terribly boring with others. When everything was said and done, I was disappointed with how sometimes it seemed a chore. The fact that this is a bibliographic film does not mean that it automatically deserves an Oscar. Jamie Fox deserves his Oscar, but the film is above average at best. Worth a look, but if I were you, I would keep my expectations at a rather comfortable level. <br /> <br /> 7/10
