I just can not understand why people are surprised that this film does not make sense. It should never have made sense. (Spirit! At that time, the writers were completely wasted on Frodis.) He had to just entertain and mock, and that was fine, both. <br /> <br /> Monkeys are good actors. They would not be hired if they were not good actors. Mike has something for calmness and darkness, Mickey is the best psychotherapeutic comedy, Davy is a veteran on Broadway, and Peter really had people who thought he was so stupid in real life. Do not tell me that they cannot act, because they certainly can. <br /> <br /> They can also write. Of course, Jack and Bob receive the only credits, but in fact they received a big helping hand under this scenario from the Monkeys, who were also in this smoky room. <br /> <br /> (it’s absolutely impossible to spoil this movie) The head is very symbolic. Among the most memorable elements is the black box, which in fact was based on two things: the image of Monkee, with which the boys were connected, and the real black box on the Screen Gems lot, where the band was stored between takes. There are so many symbols in the film that I just let you watch it and figure it out. <br /> <br /> The music is awesome. "Circle Sky" is one of the best Papa Nez tunes ever, and "Porpoise Song" and "As We Go Along" will delight you. If you prefer to pervert, then "Ditty Diego", "Can You Dig '?" And "Long Title" should be good, great songs. And there's the “Daddy's Song,” no doubt, a tribute to the Broadway Davy days, and the editing / color scheme for this sequence is excellent. (At least for '68.) <br /> <br /> Oh, for those of you who don’t watch the PG movie, you miss. Moreover, Hadu was initially assigned a rating of R in 1968. The rating was lowered about twenty years later! <br /> <br /> Now where have I been? Oh yeah: “We talked about beliefs. Beliefs and conditionality ... "
