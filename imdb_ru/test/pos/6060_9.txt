Jack Webb as a Marine Drilling Instructor in D.I .. Webb is played by Sergeant Jim Moore, a tough but honest Marine, whose job is to prepare young teens for a possible fight. No one could play this role better than Jack Webb. As a former marine, I can assure you that this is the most accurate film about basic training at the Corporation. Very interesting!
