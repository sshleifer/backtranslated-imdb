"Games? Nicotine? Fistfights? We are moving along a downward spiral of lawlessness!" So says the head of St. Sweeten when examining the general affairs of the master at Nutbourne. Teachers and students of St. Swieten were ordered to share comforts in Nutbourne to avoid German bombs during World War II. Then there is a library of masters. "Samuel Pepys Diary?" Abbreviated ... well, this is something to be grateful for. What is there? Memoirs of Casanova? Isn't that the book that we found Jessica James reading in the closet? Decameron Nights! Well, really! Whatever else this place may or may not be, is not a place for the education of thoroughly educated girls! "<br /> <br /> Yes, the Department of Education made a terrible mistake. Nutbourne is a school for boys. St. Switchen is a school for girls. And what makes this one of the best British comedies after World War II, the main master of Nutbourne is the Weatherby Pond ... played by Alastair Sim, while St. Stiphen's main mistress is Muriel Whitchurch ... played by Margaret Rutherford. <br /> <br /> "St. Sweethen? ”Says the pond.“ You don't want to say your school for boys and girls? ”He asks one of the early girls.“ Only girls, ”she says cheerfully.“ Does that mean sir, ”one of the teachers asks Netbourne - what should we expect 100 young girls? "" This means that the ministry in general not only made a mistake by sending a school here, but also guilty of a terrible sexual aberration! "<br /> <br />" Miss Whitchurch "Margaret Rutherford, positive and motionless as a battleship, intends to extract from this everything possible, quickly capturing Nutburn , if possible. Alastera Sim's pond is happy with his big bald head and is determined to save his school. At the same time, it is necessary to feed 100 young girls and 170 boys and find places to sleep (along with all their teachers). Cooks and rangers who are fully dressed Miss Whitchurch and her girls, however, are cooking. "Come on, Angela," she says to a girl who is trying to stir something in a big pot, "have you not cooked porridge before?" "Yes, but no one ever shouldn't have eaten it. " “This is a startling attitude, my dear. Stir well and don't be embarrassed. ” <br /> <br /> The situation is hardly going well when Pond finds four governors from the school he hopes to head, arrives at any moment to see how well Natbourn is in charge. And Miss Whicherch finds out that four rich and powerful parents have just come to see how their daughters are doing in new buildings, which, they were told, are free. Only decision? Miss Whitchurch and Pond, their teachers and students, compose lessons in a split second to give a hint that there are no girls in Nutbourne, and no boys in Saint-Stifen. After the parents inspect the hostel and go to the lesson, the girls in the beds hide under their feet, and the boys, who were hidden under the leaps in the beds, just when the governors enter. The boys watch rugby and, as soon as the governors turn their backs, the gates climb, the nets for lacrosse are set, and at this time the parents approach the girls. One of the parents notices her daughter in a science class, and after a few moments sees her in choral practice, and then in a few minutes ... “Angela again,” she says to Miss Whitchurch. “Why this is so,” she replies, pushing her parents to avoid the approaching governors. "The child is quite omnipresent." <br /> <br /> When we leave Nutbourne, everything was open. Students wander around. The teachers are stunned (except for two who kiss). The Ministry of Education has just sent a few more student buses. The parents were speechless, and the governors were not. “We are waiting for an explanation,” says one sharply. The pond holds its head and shudders. "Can't you see that I'm trying to think about one thing." <br /> <br /> The film moves from one difficult and ridiculous situation after another in a very ridiculous scenario and two incredibly comedic productions of Rutherford and Sim. Sim's annoyance and Rutherford's irreconcilable determination are so well chosen that it is a shame that this is the only film they have ever shot together. Joyce Grenfell, as a State, tall, awkward, sports art teacher of sv. If you keep your eyes open, you will also find some amusing links that director Frank Launder works for, including the gong in Natbourne, similar to the miniature version of J. Arthur Ranka, a faint echo of the third-person zither theme. and a shot stolen from Oliver Twist by David Lin, except that this time a little boy comes up to his bowl of porridge and says, “Please, sir. I do not want any more". <br /> <br /> Frank Launder and his partner Sidney Gilliat were responsible for some of the best films shot in the UK in the thirties, forties and fifties. They wrote, produced and directed, sometimes doing one, sometimes another. Anyway, they were responsible for such first-class films as “Green for danger” (with the virtuoso performance of “Sima”), “I see a dark stranger”, “The Lady disappears”, “Night Train to Munich”, “Wee Georgie”, “Belles of St. Triniana, Progress Rake and many others. “With the happiest days of your life,” Launder wrote and managed while both produced. This is one of their best.
