This is a classic case when the American public looks at a great film simply because there was no Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzennegger in his role - Adrian Quinn played better in a double performance. performance in this film than anyone who has ever done in his career! Well, anyway, now to the review ... <br /> <br /> The assignment is largely based on the story of Carlos Shakal, the radical of the 1970s, who terrorized Europe for many years before finally arrested by French agents. In this adaptation, an American naval officer (Adrian Quinn) is on leave in Israel when he is detained by the Mossad (Israel's intelligence and anti-terrorism agency) and interrogated because of the fact that he looks EXACTLY like a jackal (this is a very the raw part of the film, but believe me, this does not detract from the value of this film). When it turns out that Mr. Ramirez is not a Jackal, he was recruited by a seasoned CIA agent named Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, who performs his usual routine mysterious figure in government power, but in an amazing manner), which He devoted his whole life to hunting for The Jackal and subsequent events will captivate everyone who watches this film - it’s full of great acting, without the usual clichés of action films and one-line players, and a great story that will surprise anyone, the Three Leading People - Quinn, Sutherland and Kingsley - carry this film m much further than his modest budget would allow when someone else fills their shoes. Also, thank the director and his staff, angles and cinematography at the highest level, especially in action movies. The assignment is better than anyone shooting it, ever expecting, it’s a pity that this film was pretty unsuccessful at the box office, otherwise we could see the continuation of this grand spy thriller. <br /> <br /> 9/10 stars, this reviewer STRONGLY recommends it to all potential viewers!
