This production was pretty well made for the television original, providing a very appropriate original look at the work of Swift. To make the story work well, the film begins with Gulliver’s return home. Everyone who has read the book knows that this will happen anyway. The framework history of the book has Gulliver’s crazy confusion in sections. For example, he is horrified that he will crush the little people in England, because he has just returned from the land of giants. But the film has all the sections of the book for one long journey. When Gulliver talks about his travels, mounting cuts from England to traveling are very effective. I admit, I first found them intrusive and annoying, then they became natural. Moreover, by the end they became a nice addition to the story. When he talks about his adventures to a larger and larger audience, more and more people listen to his irresistible fantasy, although they doubt its truth. For example, his hatred of dirty Yahoos and the admiration for pure logic from the fourth section are well manifested when he defends his own sanity. The gaps between events in England and similar events or scenes in a fairy tale are very effective. For example, tearing the fabric from the table to suggest a movement of towing a group of ships is an inspirational shot. Adding the Gulliver family, threatened by the lecherous doctor, works well. Swift hints at this only by the fact that the long-suffering wife protests against further journeys. This becomes a natural part of this story. Casting and acting were competent in everything. Some roles were exemplary. Mad magician Omar Sharif great. The little emperor O'Tool delights in his old age. Many specific complaints filed by other authors seem to me simple personal preferences, which, in the end, is what we are doing here. I read the abbreviated version several times a year, starting in fourth grade. I may have avoided the full version before the lesson in college, but since then I have read it several times. And I had to start it again when I started reading about this movie. Although the Danson version is superior to any previous film, it does not replace the book. However, I think this will attract a lot of readers to the book. If you have not read the book, enjoy this movie, and then go to the source. If you value satire in it, find Swift and his Letters of the Drapier. Both are satyrs attacking the miserable treatment of Ireland and the Irish during Swift's time. Draper protests against cheap, bloated copper coins being poured into Ireland. These were Wood’s lightweight coinage, not suitable at face value for taxes and official debts. Perturbation of Swift's satire led to the fact that the coins were sent to another poorly processed British territory, to the American colonies. The universal satire in Swift's book and in this film is just teasing; they cannot change human nature. Give Danson's agonizing experience a chance. I think you will find their thoughts provoking and entertaining.
