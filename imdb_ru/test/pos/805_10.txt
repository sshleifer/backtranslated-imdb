This is absolutely true and sure adaptation of “The Hollow”. It can be argued that the real secret here is not one of Christie’s best, but what makes The Hollow special is a characteristic, and I found that the actors here, more or less without exception, were perfect in their roles. With such a uniformly good cast, it’s hard to choose outstanding performances, but I have to say that Sarah Miles is just as beautiful as Lucy Angkatel. What is unusual is that she not only conveys the stupidity, tactlessness of Lucy and her more attractive qualities, BUT she also manages to uncover the basic truth that in fact Lucy is not so good! Megan Dodds is also very good, as Henrietta and Claire Price are very effective, like Gerda. John Cristow is a really incredible character, but Jonathan Cake still manages to make us see what his women see in him. <br /> <br /> As I said, the script follows the story fairly well. The only unpleasant thing I discovered was that the Midge-Edward relationship really came from nowhere, and I believe that some of them must have ended up on the floor cutting! However, this is a secondary story, and the main story is very well done. It all looks great too, truly capturing a beautiful English autumn. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film in all respects and is worth seeing.
