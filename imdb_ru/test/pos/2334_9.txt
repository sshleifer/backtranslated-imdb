I'm glad they finally released it on DVD. I bought a videotape a few years ago and watch it at least once or twice a year. <br /> <br /> Grammer is incredulous of what really makes this film a success. His formula, of course, is not original, but, nevertheless, very funny. I am very surprised that he did not get higher marks. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite comedies. It's just a funny little click that makes you feel good. And sometimes this is all that should be in the film.
