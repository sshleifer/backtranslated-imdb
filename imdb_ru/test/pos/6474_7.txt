I recently traveled to Norway from Bergen, Norway, and stayed in the small town of Voss, Norway, and there was a monument in honor of Knut Rockne, who was born in Voss many years ago. All people know about Knut to this day, and the guides proudly stop at his monument. This film is the great story of this great man and his great love for Notre Dame. I never realized that Knut had such great talents in the field of chemistry and laboratory sciences, and also taught chemistry for years and at the same time coached the football team. Ronald Reagan played the role of George Gipp (Hipper), an outstanding football player; Reagan had a short role, but he played a great secondary role in this film. Donald Crisp (father John Callahan) was an eminent priest who always believed in Cnut all his life in Notre Dame. This is a great classic movie and will be watched by many generations. Enjoy.
