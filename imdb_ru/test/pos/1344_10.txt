It's hard for me to explain this show to my adult friends. I have a bunch of Shasta Daisy in my backyard, which I lovingly call my “Patched Laughter”. My friends laugh at me and look at me as if I had 2 heads. It would be great to see this episode on DVD for us, people who remember it with love about our childhood memories, or to show our friends that it was actually a funny patch! Where children's TV today is made up of cruel cartoons, characters who make magic, or a talking sponge that lives in a pineapple under the sea, the Magic Garden was real in that it taught us good values. <br /> <br /> I will have pleasant memories of Carol and Paula, as well as a patch of laughter.
