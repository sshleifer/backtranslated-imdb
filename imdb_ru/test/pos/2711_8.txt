In Karen Carpenter's Story, there is a small, tricky scene in which both Carpenter are in a recording studio, and Richard makes an impromptu decision that Karen should sing for the studio owner. <br /> <br /> Richard is mistaken about the key for Karen singing, so Karen sings above her natural range. You can see the expression of embarrassment on the face of the owner; he thinks she really can't sing. Richard quickly realizes his mistake and tries again in a different way. The next thing you hear is Karen's amazing, beautiful voice, and the owner makes a priceless double take. Beautifully done! For some reason I never forgot this scene. <br /> <br /> The story of Karen Carpenter tells about the rapid rise of the Carpenters and the struggle of Karen to overcome anorexia. A lot of things are shaded. This is not a documentary, and the film left me a lot of questions. Karen's solo venture is mentioned very little (the disc was released just a few years ago. If you buy it, you wonder why they waited. This is one of Karenâ€™s best works. The songs are not as eternal as her work with her brother Richard I thought it was a great recording. <br /> <br /> I heard that it says that you can listen to a cheap, worn out time small radio in the middle of the third world. It would seem that it produces more static than anything. But when the song Carpenter appears on the radio, you might think that you were listening to a Hi-Fidelity device $ 1,000. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie!
