After his earlier film Videodrome, which definitely shows a similarity with this film, director David Cronenberg again goes to the world of virtual reality, in which truth and fiction are mixed. This is a virtual reality, transferred to a completely different level. <br /> <br /> “eXistenZ” is a very original film that is well directed and played, but above all is very well written. The film has a fascinating and well-thought-out concept, which is largely executed by director David Cronenberg. <br /> <br /> “eXistenZ” is a film that knows that you are constantly being fooled. As soon as you thought that everyone understood, another surprise awaits you around the corner. Things are never as you think, especially when the line between truth and fiction is explored. You just never know what reality is and what the game world is, until the very end. This makes the characters and events very unpredictable, and also gives the film a great ending that makes you think. <br /> <br /> The movie has a perfect game plot, mostly with your character. appearances and its amazing events. They need to perform a certain step or task before they can continue to exist in the world, and find out what their goal in the game is. <br /> <br /> The film knows how to create the perfect balance between realism and surrealism, never overdoing any of them. The narration makes the film as simple as possible, although, of course, the film is not always so easy to view due to its events, dialogues and unusual setting. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not only strange. I was really surprised to see that Videodrome has a higher rating here, thinking that this is a much more inaccessible and “strange” film. The film is also still entertaining and has a good fast pace. It never lets the film get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. It also makes this movie ideal for people who don’t usually watch this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> The film looks good, with subtle effective special effects and a great visual effect, which also provides the film with a certain obligatory playable feeling. <br /> <br /> In the film, it is well played with Jude Law in a role in which you do not often see him, as a shy, insecure person. This shows once again how versatile Lo is as an actor, and that he is much more than just another pretty face from Hollywood. Jennifer Jason Lee was also a great woman. In fact, she has never played so many big roles in major productions, but with this film she shows why, however, she was always considered a big movie star. The film also has other famous actors in much smaller roles, such as Jan Holm and Willem Defoe. <br /> <br /> A very original film that is worth seeing, especially if you have already seen “Videodrome” before. <br /> <br /> 8/10
