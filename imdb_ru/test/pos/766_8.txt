I really watched this film only because Rupert Grint was in it (whom I knew as Ron from the Harry Potter films). I have never appreciated Rupert as an actor before this film. I loved the whole movie. Rupert does a wonderful job in this fun, fancy movie. I think the movie could be good without sex, but it worked somehow. I can't wait to see more Rupert films in the future. Julie Walters also did an amazing job. She has a very small role in the Harry Potter films, so I didnâ€™t know what to expect from her either. But she was beautiful as Dame Evie. The part where she swallows the key was absolutely ridiculous. Overall a terrific movie.
