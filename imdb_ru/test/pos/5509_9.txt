I do not understand where these bad comments come from. In the film, you were on the edge of your seat and were somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night. <br /> <br /> The fact that all this can happen, makes you think. Not to the extent that it is perceived in the film, but the whole idea is reality. This film took this reality and turned it into Di Snyder's nightmare. <br /> <br /> Three thumbs up (the third is from a dead body in my freezer).
