John Cassawett, like his first film, obviously, like one shot on a small stage in New York, didn’t even have a dialogue script, and put the full-length equivalent of “Curbing Your Enthusiasm” Larry David in 1959 - all the actors know what to do and speak and even have the right look in their eyes when they speak. In other words, this is one of the most realistic views on the beat generation, sweetly shocked by its score and telling the story of racial tension. The group of black brothers and sisters is the center point, with one trying to get better concerts than the average strip club, and who has a sister much lighter than him, which is intertwined with a white person in a relationship that destroys both sides. The film, however, is not only about this; Cassavettes loves his characters wandering around New York (which not many films were made in 1959/1960), and his style of narration is similar to the style of improvisational jazz artists of the time. Yes, of course, but it's worth a look at movie lovers; Martin Scorsese called it one of the most powerful influences.
