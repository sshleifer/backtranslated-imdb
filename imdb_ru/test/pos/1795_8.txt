Allegedly, isolation and despair of Hans are caused by stereotypically frigid bourgeois mother, whining wife and refusal of her lover. And, despite the complex image - Hans himself does not exactly make these statements - the above should be an essential part of Fassbinder's thinking (his use of Freud and Marx). But the viewer can not look further than the sex and sexism of Hans to find the true cause of his contrite spirit. <br /> <br /> Firstly, it is unlikely that the absence of his mother’s love prompted him to join the Foreign Legion. Most likely, and partly indicated that it was a search for adventure, the male camaraderie (escape from the female world of mother and sister) and the most masculine identity - which was offered by both the Legion and the war. <Br /> <br /> Secondly, Hans loses his successful job as a policeman due to his own sexism. Having fallen into the trap of a prostitute at work, he not only beats up prostitution as a despotic institution, but also shows that he cannot even control his sexuality in the professional arena — and is even ready to jeopardize his desired career. <br /> <Third, he commits serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his sheep friends, making no distinction between her absence or — when she appears in search of him — presence. In fact, he is tougher in her presence. <br /> <br /> A few hours later, in a cruel and drunken state, he beats his wife in front of their daughter, who intervenes on behalf of her mother. The horror that he inspires in her and his daughter is palpable. But he and the audience go further, not whimpering with conscience or protest. What for? Since his wife is brutally described as grumpy and sexually promiscuous (yes, Fassbinder probably thinks so about what capitalism does to women — property, insecurity, and goods), but this hardly removes Hans’s cruelty and Fassbinder’s exploitation of her scene with batteries). <br /> <br /> And then this is the male pressure on the role that Hans could reject and protest, but instead accepted. He is too small for a man and too non-heroic to achieve worldly success, which recommends the male role. But how can this be the cause of despair, when he not only gains lost love as a mistress, but also marries a tall woman who is much more attractive than himself. Finally, Hans allows Harry, his military comrade, to remain above the convincing conviction of his wife. request for the opposite, in their home. With this decision, he not only makes it clear that he is more attached to Harry than to his wife, but that the male bond replaces his love for women. And, in the end, replaces his own life, because it is precisely the excellent competence and spirit of Harry around the house that cause the fall of Hans star. Hans, a merchant, may be to some extent a victim of capitalism, but, moreover, he is a victim of his own loyalty to his own male identity. His inability to let go is the main reason for his isolation and despair. <br /> <br /> I think that this is lost not only on Fassbinder, but also on Han's sister, Anna - although only to some extent lost. To support Anna (and Fassbinder) her brother - by her mother, only goes so far. She insists that only he can save himself - that her support and love alone cannot put an end to his self-loathing. Unfortunately, she does not offer the same support and love for his wife, who should be much more embittered than Hans, but in the end, able to collect pieces, save herself and her daughter and present a marked contrast to the fall of Khan.
