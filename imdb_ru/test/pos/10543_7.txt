Perhaps the best film ever made by director Kevin Tenney (well, his Witchboard isnâ€™t on my horror list for the whole story), this film is a strange, exciting mix between Pin and Child's Play, both better than this one, but not so much better Of course, the plot is far-fetched and perhaps too predictable, but the actors are good, Rosalind Allen is very pleasing to the eye (as is Kendans McKenzie - God bless her behind the scenes in the shower!) Pinocchio is scary enough to give you some about tryh sensations along the spine. For a B-movie, it's not bad at all.
