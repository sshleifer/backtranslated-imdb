Finally! The third time was lucky. This film has always been on my mind, but when I first watched it, I forgot about it and caught only the second half of the film. And only a couple of months later I had a second chance to watch it, so I decided to record it. Only to find that my timer turned off late and I missed the first half of the movie again. I was not going to allow this to happen again. So, when he reappeared on television, I thought that I would wait until he turned on, and I recorded it. And it was a good choice. I’d just watch a movie, but they always made weekdays around midnight. <br /> <br /> After finding a hole in his overcrowded cell, nine prisoners escape from their imprisonment in order to trace the key of the universe, which, as one of the prisoners said, known as the Fake King, hid. They think that this key can be a discovery for hidden mining of counterfeit bills. In this journey, they naturally see this as an opportunity to take their lives before they are credited. Although things are not going the way they wanted, most of the criminals' plans went astray. <br /> <br /> “9 souls” is a fun spiritual journey of the Japanese director Toshiaki Toady, which threw the audience into the film from two completely different halves. The first half of the story is more like a psychic comedy with criminals and situations in which they end up being sold, but all this is inferior to a moral and investigative dramatic second half, where the real troubles begin with some rather unpleasant and bloody moments that replace the stupid tone from which it started. While the first half is pretty funny with her on the road, chattering chatter and unusual banter. But in reality, this is really a haunting second half with its particular turn of events, which so struck you with some unexpected touches that make you really sympathize with these very human characters. Despite the fact that they are not completely innocent of their crimes, you just become entrenched with these first characters in the first half, when you see how they fall into their wreck, you know that this is an effective drama when you are stunned by the dramatic change. Nine characters get enough screen time to truly understand their personal history and what ultimately leads to their weakness. The point of the plot is that Michiru and Torakichi are the main characters, and we basically see it from their point of view. The Tale of Escape is undoubtedly an interesting exploration of character, which clearly pursues a goal and poses many questions about society and the way you choose to get out of life and free yourself from these restrictions. <br /> <br /> Although, the symbolic story is full of clarity and brightness of the story. The visual element does not go unnoticed, because there is just a dreamy and trance atmosphere that guides itself in a unique atmosphere. What VERY contributed to this factor and gave the film a boost was a quick, moody instrumental rock soundtrack. The soft, atmospheric gel that he was able to create in many scenes made me suffocate from the eternal emotions that he could provoke. Just beautiful and completely powerful control on this front. It seems that the pace for such a long film (2 hours) quickly passes, and editing is done quickly, because we are so passionate about it. Hypnotic picture is clear in details. While the actors in the role of a strange group of criminals are high quality actors, each of whom has sufficient personality and characteristics to separate themselves. <br /> <br /> “9 souls” I consider a pleasant and rather surprising surrealistic film that stirs up emotions and then hits you with an almighty noise when it changes direction. Highly recommended.
