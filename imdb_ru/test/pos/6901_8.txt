When people say that “they do not make them as they are used to,” they simply point out this fantastically interesting and strange looking comedic horror from screenwriter / director Glenn McQuide. <br /> <br /> This is a story about grave diggers (played by Dominic Monagan and Larry Fessenden) who end up digging up more than just silent, motionless corpses. After the initial shock of this, they soon realize that they can really turn the situation in their favor. And this is exactly what they are trying to do. Keep in mind, it seems that things could not have turned out as planned, since poor young Arthur (Monaghan) actually tells his story to a priest (Ron Perlman) before being delivered to the gallows. <br /> <br /> Looking at the details of his filmography, McQuaid seems to have taken the core of his first short film and expanded it to this function, which is not so bad. Fessenden returns and succeeds, Monaghan is one of those guys who can actually make you love him while he does the heinous theft from the dead and with other favorites of the genre, such as Perlman and Angus Scrimm, on the stage of this movie For fans of the genre very funny. <br /> <br /> It also benefits from a unique and attractive design and appearance, sometimes moving from EC-style comic panels to live action (in Creepshow style) and always somehow feeling quite authentic in that feeling. horror hammer. Maybe everything is just covered with so much dry ice, but this is beside the point. Whatever is done to capture everything on film, it works. It works well. <br /> <br /> He may not have any real fright, but this film does have an excellent touch of black humor and definitely permeates every minute of his work in eerie material that everyone who has the patience to horror should like a little more balanced and the feeling that it could definitely be returned to the days of Hammer. <br /> <br /> Look if you like: Flesh and Fiends, Doctor and Creepshow Devils.
