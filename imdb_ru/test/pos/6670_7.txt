Who is this man that I hear? Kevin's loud cry? Well, if you hadn’t shouting at the “regular suspect”, I would recommend changing the recipe. In any case, this is not a first-class film, it's just a very well thought out story, it's almost believable. Considering it about an alien, you are probably wondering what? All acting skills - the main thing, as well as the first thing I saw a balanced sarcastic newcomer. Just nice - that's all I can say, and almost for the whole family (if not for the stage later in the film). SEVEN STARS
