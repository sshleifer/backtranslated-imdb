Now that I saw it, it was NOT what I expected, at least until the very end. I read some other reviews before picking up a used copy from Amazon, and was glad I did. When I first got acquainted with Pak's work through Oldboy, I was curious how he would relate to the genre, and he was very pleased with the skillful way of performing it. I think Park is mature from the point of view of the performance, because, although Oldboy and some of his other works have very good and intentional camera work, he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I have not seen in other vamp movies. For example, the scene in which Hyun's father understands that there is a “beast” growing inside him, when he gives his shoes to barefoot te-joo, and he is able to SEE blood that pumps Te-ju's skin, and his eye expands from the need for blood . It was a good effect. I was also happy that Puck did not make CG from the film, but in fact it is quite a bit of CG. I walked away from Bakjwi, who was completely set up to think that something was going to happen, and I got a ride in a real park fashion. In addition, I liked the fact that Park played with a little symbolism and spread, while we usually do not understand that this is an Asian movie. At the beginning of the film we see how the plot develops slowly, we get acquainted with the characters, and you feel like an invisible observer of what is happening. The park perceives you as the ghost of Christmas, which will show you, albeit a little boring, what life outside of your world is like. Ah, but then we begin to feel a little kinship with the fallen Father and his burgeoning thirst for Te-ju and conflict with duty as a priest. We are almost starting to root for them even until Park is so nice to bring us back to reality, and we really will not see that in the end Bajivi is a film about a moral dilemma, right and wrong. It will not spoil if I tell you to observe Bakjvi from the position of a priest, and I think that you will get away from this with what Park wants you to leave. Do not wait for Oldboy and styling, because this is not what you get here. Indeed a very interesting look at the genre. Those who missed a LOT of literary elements and religious allusions watched some other film, not Bakjvi. After Bakjwi, see Let The Right One IN, this is also not what you expect.
