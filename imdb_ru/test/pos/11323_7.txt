The BBC and HBO teamed up to create a 90-minute television movie, “Dirty War,” about a terrorist bombing attack in London. The film quickly gets down to business, as it unites the efforts of terrorists and the government in the fight against terrorism, leaving little room for human interests. From the side of terrorists, we are following the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to assembly, to deployment and to detonation. On the government side, we see PR and exercises, intelligence gathering and analysis, a ban, post-detonation response, and follow-up. The film also provides insight into how al-Qaida-type terrorist cells, the radical Islamic terrorist mentality, and terrorist strategies are organized. A sort of anatomy of the dirty bomb incident, the Dirty War, will answer many questions lurking in the minds of the public that are increasingly aware of this insidious threat. (AT)
