“All people are to blame,” says the police chief. "They are born innocent, but it does not last long." Add this bit of nihilism to Jean-Pierre Melville’s passion for the fraudster’s code of honor, and you’ll get Le Cercle Rouge. This code of honor among scammers, however, is not just a cliché; it is a figment of the imagination, even when filmmakers — realistic moralists from their point of view, romantic moralists by most others — began making films on the subject. Their theme is that this is not what you do, but how you do it. We most often come across stories about experienced people with their own sense of honor, stories where fate, fatalism, and code govern things. <br /> <br /> For most people, besides the writers and directors, it would seriously interfere with living, raising children and being a good friend. This mannered fatalism is a sort of self-indulgence. Le Cercle Rouge, in my opinion, is a classic film for people who can secretly enjoy the adventure when they miss the last bus home. But where the Melville Le Samourai - Criterion Collection, in my opinion, is the story that dominates the style, Le Cercle Rouge manages a great trick of combining style with a strong history and convincing actors. The essence of the film, in my opinion, is nonsense ... but the film itself is a first-class experience. <br /> <br /> Melville’s hopeless story about three rogues - Corey (Alain Delon), Vogel (Gian-Maria Volonte) and Jansen (Yves Montand) - is based on some wisdom that may be attributed to Buddha: That all people who are destined to meet, will ... along with their fate can not change. Perhaps because some believe that Melville himself came up with a formulation, if not a thought. In any case, we know from the very beginning that this film will not end happily, will depend on fate and coincidence, in order to create things for us, and make us remember the nihilistic philosophies that we discovered and fell in love with when we were in high school. As soon as Corey and Vogel meet and then gather in the unique talents of Jansen, we will go on a one-way trip to rob the exclusive, well-protected history of jewelry in the Place Vendome. The tension arises because we not only know that the French police are pursuing Vogel, but also understand that some determined fraudsters are hunting for Corey. <br /> <br /> I was greatly pleased by the cinema from the admiration for the work that Delon, Volonte and Montand brought to their characters, and the mental ruthlessness that Andre Bouvril presented to his character, police captain Matthew. Melville hooked me when he designed these characters and their own situations; he created me emotionally, and then released me when he made me evaluate their possible fate and let me see how this happens. Melville sets his scenery — escape from the train, escape from the forest, a later firefight in the forest, meetings with Matthew and a man who refuses to report — with intriguing possibilities. In all these cases, it creates tension without haste; rare feature in making films and even more rare feature now. And Melville is not in a hurry to create Matthew as a person. Matthew is a sad, experienced person. He is a loner. When he returns to his apartment, he has the usual routine - he tenderly welcomes his three cats, wipes the bath and, while the bath is full, spreads their food. I do not know with whom Matthew is destined to meet, but I hope that he is the one who loves cats. <br /> <br /> Nihilism is always in fashion among creative people and some critics. In most cases, I think it is much more difficult to put aside nihilism and just live your life without harming too many people. (And this is even harder to show convincingly in the film.) Le Cercle Rouge is a film that says little to me, but, in my opinion, it is in its own way a beautiful film.
