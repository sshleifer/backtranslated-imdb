The plot begins to be interesting, but by the end too many die in too short a time, turning the mysterious aspect of a thriller into a slaughterhouse. <br /> <br /> The only real moments were Adam Beach and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who were their superb me again. A good attempt with an inappropriate last third, albeit with a good ending.
