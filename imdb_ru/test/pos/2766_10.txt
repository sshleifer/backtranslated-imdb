Suzy K is a great romantic prom movie. Amy Joe Johnson (Susie Q) is a great actress. I think she did a great performance. I hope that someday Disney will release this movie on DVD. I think it's cool and a little funny. At first, sad when Suzy K dies in a car accident at first, and I want to cry or cry. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q, it becomes funny and amazing. There are some puzzles in this movie, but not many. But still, I would recommend this film to the whole family if they like comedy, mystical or romantic films. It's great! I think Amy Joe Johnson as Suzy K. is cute.
