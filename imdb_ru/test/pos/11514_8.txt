As far as I know, this was my first experience with Icelandic films. What a relief to see something other than your usual Hollywood movie. It is a pity that films like this have little chance of success in the big world. I can only hope that people watch it by chance, on recommendation or in some other way ... <br /> <br /> Because it's really worth it. I left the movie feeling very sad. I could not dismiss the tragic fate of the characters. And it made me even more impressed when I thought about the complexity of the film. It was not only a tragic story, but also great comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack. <br /> <br /> If you have such an opportunity, look at her! It really made me think and made me think. <br /> <br />
