This film is still alive and cool today, thanks to the presence of Alan Ladd. This is good on the one hand, because the film has several interesting things, but badly on the other, because everyone who watches it, expecting the tough guy Ladd to go through his usual steps, will be greatly disappointed. Without fanfare or introduction, Ladd is suddenly represented in the third reel. True, his role is key, but it is small and can be lost in random order. There are many key roles in the ambivalent scenario of the former newspapermaker Martin Mooney, who infects all political alliances and quite mercilessly slanders reforming candidates. This is a cute and extremely talented Joan Woodbury, who binds together the different sides of an extensive history. Unlike the usual Hollywood production, the plot actually unfolds in a series of jumps, very similar to the films that later appeared in the French “New Wave”, although it’s easier to follow, especially if you know that the original name of the film was “Paper Bullets”, However, some of the narrative and characteristic movie switchings are a bit confusing, especially in the role played by Jack LaRue, who wisely decided to play the role in a strange way without commitment. One of the best works of Jack in the history, but, alas, no one will notice!
