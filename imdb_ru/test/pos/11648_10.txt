After reading most of the comments, I feel that I also have something to say. <br /> <br /> I’m most worried about the fact that most people here think that this film is either for or against the theme of death is fine and did it work with them. I remember reading the article in 1995 when the film was published (yes, it has interested me so much since I heard it would be so that I did not forget about the articles I read then) in which Tim said Robbins didn’t want to make a film to convince viewers of either. <br /> <br /> And I think that is perfectly correct. I have to admit that I believe that in the way he made this film, he leaned a little towards the side against the death penalty, but nevertheless people are still allowed to make their own choices. And it is very rare in American films. <br /> <br /> I have shown this film to many people since it came out, and I have seen a variety of reactions. Supporters of the death penalty have become opponents or have become even stronger in their faith. And many opponents of the death penalty (including myself) have been strengthened in their belief that the death penalty should be abolished everywhere in the world. But I even saw how opponents turned into supporters. This and the fact that people here seem to argue about it, show me that there are really many ways to look at it. Therefore, no matter what effect it has on you, it is important that it makes you think. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that really gives you a choice that does not shy away from a simple way of making a convict either bad or innocent. This can be difficult for people who like to have fun or take lessons. There is no lesson here, you need to find it yourself. <br /> <br /> Everyone praises acting, directing and music, but since it has been said many times, I will not repeat it all again. <Br /> <br /> So, if you haven't seen it yet, do it - if you dare to challenge!
