Imagine that you will spend the summer without your family or friends from school and meet new people. Or, nevertheless, you are the first time when you are nobody, and the only person you can count on is someone from the camp. "Meatballs" pack a lot of comedy in this film. There is an eccentric consultant (Bill Murray) in the camp who knows how boys and girls can have a good time. Enter a child named Rudy (Chris Makepeace) who has no one to look at. He doesn't fit in with anyone, only Tripper can make him have fun. The rest of the banks are as crazy as Tripper. Camp Northstar - middle camp with a team above average. On the other hand, the Mogawk Camp is an elite camp in which they run for their money. In the basketball game, the Iroquois were suffocating! And at the Olympics teal Northstar got the revenge they needed when one of the participants knocked out a saboteur. And Morty (Harvey Atkin), this poor soul can never get dressed if she tries. Very, VERY funny comedy, and I will say that it is a big keeper. This film shows that the camp can be fun if you want it! 5 stars!
