In KPAX, Softley draws the subtleties of Eastern religious mores from small archetypes embedded throughout the film, to the true purpose of Prot. Spacey (Prot) plays a predominantly didactic role throughout the entire film — as if the statements he makes embody common truths about the culture of the world that is widespread in Buddhism and Hinduism. It can be said that Prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in turmoil and "bright", and the false curtain of reality is what everyone else sees, but Prot sees the truth - he sees a minute - and appreciates it and at some moments fear it when he transcends his social construction of reality and becomes more human. <br /> <br /> The film is particularly detailed, so I would advise you to watch it at least twice to see how Softly puts in the nuances. Listen carefully to the stories at the beginning and at the end, as they really relate to concepts that are not usually represented in Western philosophy. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 ratings - “Excellent” - with nominal opportunities for improvement.
