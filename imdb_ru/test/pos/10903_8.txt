IN & OUT, in my opinion, is a very funny movie. I thought that Cameron (Matt Dillon) incorrectly said that Howard (Kevin Kline) was gay. Most of all I liked Howard's bachelor party. It was because they were joking about a lot of things, including the films of Barbra Streisand. I also thought that Emily (Joan Cusack) looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that Howard looked good in her tuxedo. My favorite quote from IN & OUT: “Are all gay? Is it the Twilight Zone? ”It was absolutely fun! The only character I could not bear was Sonya (Shalom Harlow). This was because she was VERY conceited and snobby. In conclusion, I recommend this film to all Kevin Kline fans who have not seen it yet. Be prepared to laugh hard and have a good time when you see it.
