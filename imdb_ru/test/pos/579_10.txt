This wonderful film captures many elements of what makes a family comedy fun, interesting, sweet and memorable, it's hard to decide where to start. <br /> <br /> From the first number of Paul Williams' Rainbow Connection, there is an excellent musical score, performed with pleasure by Kermit D. Frog, which gives us a prologue about what the whole adventure is all through history, this is one funny movie. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is a film about a trip where Kermit travels over rough terrain with the dream of concluding a “rich and famous contract” for entertainment. Along the way, our green hero encounters a number of other novice actors, comedians, singers and musicians who, by coincidence, are puppets, like Kermit himself. Here's how the dolls actually started? “About the way it happened,” Kermit tells us. <br /> <br /> Since "This is a crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy world," the cameo formula has been used so widely and successfully. Aspiring stars face many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; some just blink on the screen, while others have very catchy cameos. Funny piece of Steve Martin as a rude waiter, probably the best. Puppeteer Jim Henson nodded at his inspiration, Edgar Bergen, especially touching. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has ever watched the Muppets series will see all of their favorite characters, they are all here. The doll work is great; pay special attention to how Kermit rides his bike (how are you?). Jokes and links to old films are everywhere, but the best of them are for Kermit himself. Example: when fraudsters terrorize Kermit and Piggy, she tenderly says to her short, green and handsome gentleman: “I would never give up this evening together, would you?” “Uhh, make me an offer ...”. I also like the shooting on the stage OK Corral: incredibly absurd stupidity. <br /> <br /> Now I want to “move forward”, but to summarize: a good-natured film that anyone can enjoy, regardless of age and genre of cinema. Highly recommended.
