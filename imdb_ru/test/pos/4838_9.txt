It was a very strong look at prejudice and group mentality. The cast is made up of excellent actors doing a wonderful job. The sets are beautiful and a bit stylized. The artistic direction at the highest level, along with excellent cinema. The story is tight and shows how prejudice and bigotry can easily flourish. This is disturbing because of its realistic violence and proletarianism in relation to a typical community. I was very impressed.
