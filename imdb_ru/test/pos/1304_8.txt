I just found the entire set of 3 DVDs at Wal-Mart in the shopping basket for $ 5.50, so I decided to look again. Only 13 hours to watch it all (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on television in the sixties. Many independent stations have been repeating them for many years. <br /> <br /> Better than I expected, time showed kindness to the obvious sincerity of its creators, as well as to the obvious gratitude and respect they give to all allied soldiers. and women. More abstract and artistic than a direct documentary, but very truthful in describing the causes and final results of the Second World War. This war largely depended on shipping, and the final victory depended on who achieved final possession of the world's oceans. Allies were the ones who could do it. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see how they are trying to find a balance between major events and the individual soldiers and sailors who made them possible. The rating is impressive, although too much by today's standards. I read somewhere that Robert Russell Bennett, like Richard Rogers, contributed the final result. I assume that Rogers provided all the main themes, and it was up to Bennett to adapt them to the images. Great job! <br /> <br /> Every ruler or potential ruler should see this. A warning to tyrants that wars are ultimately won by ideals, determination, and supplies to support them. Logistics: their quality and delivery will determine the possible winners. The Allies surpassed and surpassed the material qualities of the Axis, attacked their source and insured their possible defeat. <br /> <br /> I regret that producer Henry Salomon lived a very short life. The IMDb facts were pretty scanty, I need to learn more about it. He made several other outstanding documentaries before his early death. Maybe I will say something else in the future <br /> <br /> General information: I had all 3 records made from background music, on the whole, quite well. Unfortunately, the producers decided to add sound effects to the latter, immediately giving in to the status of the novelty, and not serious listening to music. Too bad because it contained some interesting, but more minor topics in the series. Stupid things like shooting 16-inch weapons, torpedoes, bulldozers, airplanes ... mostly just for kids. <br /> <br /> RSGRE
