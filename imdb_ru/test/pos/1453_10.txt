This is easily one of the best films of the 1950s. Otto Preminger made only four or five really good films, and this is one of them. Frank Sinatra gives his best performance, and Elmer Bernsteinâ€™s score shows dynamite. From the initial titles (from Saul Bass) to hysteria addict Frank, who became a turkey, this is an exciting movie! With Kim Novak (very good performance), Eleonora Parker (very bad performance), as well as Darren McGavin as a reptile pusher and Arnold Stang as a friend of Frank. Beware of bad prints: this film is publicly available, so some copies are pretty rough.
