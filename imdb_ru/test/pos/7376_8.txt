I originally posted the user’s first commentary on this movie and said it was crap and it didn’t make sense. I do not make sense. "Tales by the fire" is a film with great pleasure (now he is 2 years older and watched it last night). The actors were famous, but TOO famous. The game itself was more than acceptable, it was pretty good. I will rate the movie by movie segment. <br /> <br /> 1) Black and white scene (AKA- “The Hook”). It makes no sense, it looked good, but did not hold much power, the only disappointing, I do not think it was even included as a segment. Here is a scary meter. <br /> <br /> --- --- (Bad) <br /> <br /> 2) RV Story (newlyweds stuck in the forest) Perhaps it was the most entertaining of all fairy tales, in this game it was good, disappointing about typical caravan sex scenes. Yet it was intriguing, you think, "Who knocked on this door." He was anxious, and not too terrible. I liked this <br /> <br /> -------------- ------------ (Very Good) <br /> <br /> 3) Internet chat (Little Girl Meets Psycho) It was a clever addition, the blood is kept to a minimum, the fright is EXTREMELY. Although it is sad from time to time, the last few minutes were the most interesting, don't get me wrong, it was still fun to watch. Really scary, and could happen to anyone, so look who you are talking to. <br /> <br /> --------------------------- (very good) <br /> <4) Ghost Tale (Man kissing ghost) ?? Not the best, it was not too atmospheric for a ghost story. It was strange, the aspects were pretty good, the music played and screamed, but everything was too real to be terrible, although it was good, it was quiet, bloody, and it could be better with this idea. <br /> <br /> ------------- (Acceptable) <br /> <br /> 5) Ending (4 lost teens) These are two attractive girls and guys telling stories on throughout the film. The best thing about the film is a definite ending, it made a big impression, the ending was completely unexpected. See how well it is done. Realism was impressive. <br /> <br /> ----------------------------------- (TOP) <br / > <br /> 6) GENERAL FILM. Campfire tales are more than I ever perceived. I really like it now, when I buy it on video, because it is a really exciting horror movie. the garbage that you see these days, like many, I am disappointed that it really has not gone anywhere, it was right on the video, for me it was better than all the rror hype "you see these days. In In general, for fairy tales around a campfire <br /> <br /> ----------------------------- (very good) <br / > <8 out of 10
