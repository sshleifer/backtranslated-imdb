I just watched this movie on the weekend, and I must say, I really enjoyed it. The 2 American actors Italo, as usual, are excellent (Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia). Obviously, the director was influenced by 2 great movies of the past, made by the Italians. First of all, Dino Risi and his film “IL SORPASSO” influenced him. This is the story of two young people who happen to meet and become friends. One is extroverted and the other is introverted. They enjoy the whole day together, and by the end of the day, the shy person learns that there is more to life than his usual routine monotony. The same thing happens with Albert de Santi. Unfortunately, IL SORPASSO has a very similar ending, and this obviously influenced the director ON THE RUN, because he uses the same technique, but with a twist. I was expecting something, but was surprised to see that everything turned out the opposite. If you watch both films, you will understand. Another film that influenced the director is “AFTER CLOCK”, filmed by the great Italian American Scorsese. I highly recommend all 3 movies!
