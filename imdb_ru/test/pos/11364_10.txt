In 1961, this series was shown on local television here in southern California. Since then, I and many others have been writing the BBC for tapes or DVDs with great enthusiasm. Now all of a sudden, here it is on Amazon. I made a reservation in January and it arrived on March 30th. It was a long wait (48 years). Was it worth it? So far, I just watched Richard II (I only had a DVD from 2 o'clock), and I can really say YES !!! Itâ€™s worth the wait. The play, direction and staging are great and even better than I remember. Production of black and white, but somehow suitable. The video is clear and very good, the sound is impeccable. Another proof of how eternal Shakespeare is. <br /> <br /> I gave these 10 stars, although I only saw 1 of 8 plays. I am sure that after seeing them all, I will change my rating to at least 12. <br /> <br /> Currently it is available on Amazon (US region 1) at a reasonable price. <br /> <I'd rather stop now so that I can go back to watching. Next comes Henry IV, the first part of which is my favorite Shakespeare play.
