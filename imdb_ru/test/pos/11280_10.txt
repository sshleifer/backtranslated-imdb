Sui generis. People, I'm not going to lie to you; Merhige is one or two amazing miracles, but what kind of film (it almost justifies a NEED FOR A HINT). I'm also not going to pretend to understand this completely; half of what makes it so that it tries to understand what the hell they do on the screen because of the kyarokuro. <br /> <br /> Richard Corliss says: “It’s as if the Druid cult actually took three biblical stories - creation, Christmas and the torture and death of Jesus on Calvary.” This is not a bad description, but there seems to be something more than seemingly unambiguous religious conformity. <br /> <br /> The surface itself has an ecological theme - note that by the end (after the sterility of the landscape) there are large pipes that do not look like those on the construction site. Oh no, he will say, look at how people are raping his natural mother It's rare to see a dead metaphor in action and with such a big hyperbole, but to see how it plays out is much worse than language implies. <br /> <br /> And yes, if you just want something to sync With a death metal soundtrack, it has the atrocities it needs. But as for me and others, like me, this is an important feature film that the Criterion collection deserves. It captures right there with FAUST Murnau. <br /> <br /> Ray
