This show was incredible !!! I have seen all three, and this is the best. In this film there is an unknown, a little romance, tricks that will amaze you (GO BOBBIE), great characters and amazing locations. Where was it taken? Will there be more? I really liked the storyline with her brother. Looking forward to Chameleon 4 and see again how the world is saved.
