I'm not sure if I like this movie or not. I think it is creepy and totally weird. Crispin Glover as always gave excellent performance, like Lane. I think his performance was really good and one of the best, but I donâ€™t like this character at all. Keanu Reeves' performance was really good, and I really felt his character. In general, I think that the whole cast gave excellent performances, as if the characters were real. I did not like some, but sincerely regretted others (Keanu Reeves). I would like to know if this was the original ending that the film should have had as it did not end as I expected it. I was disappointed in the final and I do not feel that the rest of the film was fair. If you like creepy, weird and really great movies, choose this one. If you like normal things, please stay away.
