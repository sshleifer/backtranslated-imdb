(r # 88) A brilliant, very interesting show with spectacular effects. Any fan of these prehistoric reptiles should see this. CGI fits very well with the environment, and itâ€™s just fun to watch these giants wander their daily activities as casually as they did on Discovery Channel. This show was a stroke of genius, and his followers "Walk with the Beasts" and "Future is Insane" came out of the water. <br /> <br /> The greatest episode was definitely the last where we could see the last days of a tyrannosaur and a meteorite that became their death. This material is almost too good for television. What about theatrical release? I would pay everything to see these dinosaurs in the cinema. <br /> <br /> If you have a mood for a show that can be exciting, exciting and educational at the same time, this is for you. Dinosaurs have never been cooler.
