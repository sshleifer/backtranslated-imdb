Even if I had never seen or heard of Georgetown, Colorado, it would be a cute little movie. But my father was born and raised there, and these are my uncle's horses, which, as you can see, are pulling a sled! So this film is very special for me. Many interiors are shot in buildings and houses that I recognize, and they are very realistic. The story is a bit deceiving, but Georgetown is a magical place where such things can happen. John Denver was a better actor than many consider him worthy. Mary Wicks plays the role of "lady of common sense with a lot of audacity", which she played so well in many other films, especially White Christmas. In winter, I usually do not go there, so I like to watch this movie for Christmas to "cover me" before my next trip!
