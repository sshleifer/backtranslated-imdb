So far, Miguel Bardem’s career has been one of the worst in recent Spanish cinema. He did only rubbish ... still. "Inkaout" was a real surprise: it is a serious, rhythmic film with a great cast and very interesting. <br /> <br /> The art of robbery is what Inkautos is. The film is very similar to the "House of the Game" by David Mamet, and the like. A thousand turns in the script and a story in which everything is not as it seems. <br /> <br /> Weaknesses in Bardem’s latest film can be so American, which makes some characters look unnatural, especially Victoria Abril. She's a damn actress, but she looks a bit forced in the "knockouts"). Ernesto Alterio is not so bad, but he is not twice as bad as an actor than his father ... And what about Luppi ?? Well, he is a MAN. <br /> <br /> In short, a good movie. The best that Miguel Bardem ever did. I hope that this is the beginning of a new stage in his career. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
