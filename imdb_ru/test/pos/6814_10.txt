I stumbled upon this movie while surfing on the channel and was shocked. It was broadcast on the less well-known program of short films here in Australia. <br /> <br /> A lot of time has passed since the movie impressed me, especially so short. <br /> <br /> The power of history, the quality of acting and stunning cinematography ... wow. If it were available, it would be a very worthy addition to my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> I am certainly impressed and looking forward to the next Joshua Leonards film. <br /> <br /> Exceptional experience 10/10
