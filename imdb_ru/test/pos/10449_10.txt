What looks like the plagiarism of the bully Porky turns out to be a rather touching film about youth and love. <br /> <br /> The story tells about three friends, Gary, Ricky and David, who spend their school hours after looking for sex. When a new girl arrives in town, Gary falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> The film is transformed from the fact that it is from a dirty sex film to a study of teenage insecurity. It's funny and sad at the same time. It never fully corresponds to the formula of a love story that seems outstanding in every film made. You know, the guy meets the girl, the guy loses the girl, the guy returns the girl in the final frame formula. This formula is discarded after the guy meets a girl. Maybe that's why I liked the movie so much. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is especially good, and the ending is definitely a tear. It can also be one of the most realistic endings I've ever seen in a love story. <br /> <br />
