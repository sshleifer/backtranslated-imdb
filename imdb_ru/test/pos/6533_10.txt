Well, I have to say that this film was probably the funniest film I have seen all year. And I don't really mean it. This is probably the most miserable film I've ever seen, and yet it makes it so fun. You can say that these people are really trying to act, unfortunately for them, they do not do such a good job, so even the lines that sound in what should be a serious tone, sound very funny. Aaron Carter essentially plays a character very similar to himself in real life, and yet he manages to make the character seem trivial and not at all realistic. This film is one of those films where everything that should sound serious is really funny, and everything that should be funny is just so stupid and banal that you have to laugh, because you know how hard they are trying. This film is so bad, it is really good. I would definitely recommend it if you are in the mood for a laugh.
