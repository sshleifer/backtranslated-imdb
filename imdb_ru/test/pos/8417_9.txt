After a very long time, a good film appeared in the Marathi cinema. This film is one of the best Marathi films ever made. This shows how an old grandfather tries to save his grandson's eye. He tries his best in his hands to save the childâ€™s eye. The doctor and his relative are trying to help him in his attempt. <br /> <br /> The actions of grandfather, boy and doctor are simply excellent. They showed a true picture of the typical life of Marathi. Every action has a meaning. I would recommend to watch this film, since initially I thought that this film would be of documentary type, but it was above my expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie really touches your heart. I would expect more Marathi films to come up with such performances.
