This film was made with a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?), And advertisers hardly advertised it. I only knew about this because Iâ€™m a longtime fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, and I always check out his latest films in the hope that they will at least be watchable, and, apart from some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command), There is a fairly simple plot in this film, and Van Damme demonstrates a good humorous performance, but the film owes its dignity to the fight scenes in which Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the last one are involved. Editing and working with the camera for most of the movie is pretty awful, but Isaac Florentin can definitely shoot a good fight scene. I am also happy that recently Van Damme has been behaving better (in hell, after death, to death), but with a good game there is less martial arts. In The Shepherd, Van Damme proves that he still has it.
