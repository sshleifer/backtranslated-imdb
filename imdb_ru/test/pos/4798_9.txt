This film is a fascinating example of the talents of Louis Bunuel. This is a comedy that is not a comedy, but a social drama, which is not a social drama. Although I do not think it was particularly funny, it made me laugh. In addition, despite the fact that Bunuel cannot be taken too seriously, the film made some people think about religion and its significance in the lives of others. Bunuel tells the story of a Catholic priest who is faithful to his faith like no other, and viewers see what happens when the priest's immortal obligation to serve others is being tested. As usual, Bunuel’s goal is Catholicism, but I don’t think he tried to mock the church, as he often does. At least, I did not perceive the film as a mockery of the institution. I think he is trying to make an interesting thought about how religion can be a nuisance in modern modern society. Not because belief in oneself is harmful, but because people always manage to kill this concept. Leaving aside, I think this is one of Buñuel’s smartest works. Francisco Rabal is great as a priest. Definitely one of the best director films.
