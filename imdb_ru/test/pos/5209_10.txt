This film is one of the historically most accurate war films ever made in that it displays the reality of soldiers in a combat situation, as well as the specific circumstances of the Battle of Stalingrad, which is obvious when you compare this film with works such as the book by Anthony Beevor Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> Unlike the better-known Enemy at the Gates, where the plot turns into a story about a sniper and a hunt, this film shows what war can do to people. “Stalingrad” was shot by the Germans, but this is nothing but a nationalist apologetic film. This shows that films about war can be more than waving flags, an evasive distortion of the grim truth of war, as perhaps many Hollywood “military” products might be. Technique of the film in "Stlingrad" - the highest level <br /> <br /> This is a film that must be watched by all who are going to join the army and follow orders of any type of "Fuhrer".
