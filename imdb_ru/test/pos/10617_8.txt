"Piano Teacher" is all about the character of Huppert; an instructor in a classical middle-aged piano with a stoic façade behind which lies a highly irresistible anomalous person. Dissatisfied as a story, but intriguing as a character exploration, the film follows Huppert’s character through a period of her tormenting relationship with a student delivering excellent actions in the process. Not for everyone "The Piano Teacher" is best played with those who star in foreign films and dramas with characters on dark issues. (BUT-)
