This is not a BIG film, since the actors (especially children) are excellent in helping to lead this very sad, but contrived storyline, it is full of cliches for cliches. A poor family in the mid-50s in America, a dying mother, an alcoholic father, 10 children (1 of whom has epilepsy) and a terrible decision to be made. It is very easy to watch, and some of the children's performances are moving without being painful or shaggy. And little Frank and Warnen steal the show for me with the last scene, leaving me crying no matter how many times I see him. Great rainy movie that I recommend to everyone. Only those with the hardest hearts cannot be touched by it. Not on par with Sophies Choice, but a good equivalent of a television movie !!!
