I thought this movie was awesome. I was a bit skeptical, as I really didn’t know what was going on, but it was a beautiful story. I cried a lot and laughed loudly. <br /> <br /> I think it’s very important that films are made about the Holocaust and how it affects people (it happened only 60 years ago!) I was in Germany and Eastern Europe, and I studied the Holocaust, so this film meant a lot to me. I think this film has done an amazing job capturing this story (I will not go into details, I don’t want to spoil it) Your thinking about things.
