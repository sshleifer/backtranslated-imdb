I think Kruce did his evil role very well, she had to win the award. Everything Dunn is in can be saved, because Dunn is a great actress and can handle anything, even a weak script. Therefore, I would recommend it for this reason only. This film may have been a little ahead of its time, the plot may be more acceptable these days. <br /> <br /> In the golden age of Hollywood films were meant for entertainment or training, mostly so that we feel good at managing time. This plot seems to deviate from this profile. However, again, I must say that what Irene Dunn ever was was at least “good” because she made things so believable! The only other actress I can say made me think so, maybe Deborah Kerr. Watch the Silver Cord if you have a chance to play, if nothing else.
