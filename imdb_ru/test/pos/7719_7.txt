My commentary is basically a commentary to the first commentator (additional to the film) and his unfortunate assessment of the film. I think his point of view shows why the extra is optional, and the director is the director. The film was enjoyable, the acting skill was sufficient, the experience of watching it pleasantly distracted from the busy work week. It was not "Watch" (acting), "The Matrix" (Special Effects) or even "Violet" (Direction). Most movies will not. But it was not that crappy holiday that “Winnie ...” would make you believe. Sorry, man, only my 2 cents. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, in the end it was very funny (+ # 1). He showed a world full of diverse and not ideal people - you know, like ours (+ # 2)! This opened the door to one culture, not excluding other cultures (+ # 3). And I liked the music (+ # 4).
