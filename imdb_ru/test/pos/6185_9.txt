Ernst Lubich has given us wonderful films, such as Design for Life, Ninochka, Shop Around the Corner, To Be or Not to Be, and other great films. But people usually think Bluebeard’s eighth wife is one of Lubich’s weakest films. <br /> <br /> But I consider this film an important film. This film began the collaboration of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billie Wilder and Walter Reisch wrote the screenplay for Ernst Lubich’s film “Ninochka”. Of course, Lyubich worked with the authors in the process of writing scripts. After that, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. Together they wrote the script for such famous films as "The Lost Weekend" and "Sunset Boulevard." <br /> <br /> There are a lot of funny moments in the film. I thought "The Taming of the Shrew" was very funny. There is a famous expression called "Movies are pieces of life." And here is a wonderful example of Bluebeard's eighth wife (1938). <br /> <br /> At the first scriptwriting exercise, Lubich asked a question: how do boys and girls get together? Billy Wilder quickly suggested that the opening scene was a men's department store. “The boy is trying to buy pajamas,” he murmured darkly. “But he sleeps only in the tops. He is economical, so he insists on buying only tops. The clerk says he should buy his pants too. It looks like a disaster. Then the girl comes to the store and buys pants, because she only sleeps in pants. "Ernst Lubich and Charles Brackett were fascinated. It was only months later that they found out that Billy Wilder himself sleeps only on tops and that he had been feeding the idea for months opportunities to use it. <br /> <br /> I received this information from the book. I think that this film can be viewed as Ernst Lubich’s return. Immediately after this film, he made great films such as “Ninochka”, “Shop for angle "and" To be or not to be. "<br /> <br /> I thought that Gary uper good performance. I think Lubicz played Gary Cooper, probably because Gary Cooper played The Long Mate, who inherited fortune in Frank Capra’s Mr. Dells is sent to the city. But that’s just my opinion. < br /> <br /> I really liked the movie, I rate this movie 9 out of 10. Lyubich's films are different because his films are pieces of life.
