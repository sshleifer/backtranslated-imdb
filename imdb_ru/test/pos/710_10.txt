I love to watch the mile of Jericho. I mean, looking at Peter Strauss for a mile is like watching Usain run 100 meters. I think Peter Strauss is a great actor and should make another film. he is lightning fast and has a lot of energy and can run a mile in less than 4 minutes, and this friend of mine is simply amazing. no living person can chase the rain, Murphy, I mean, a man runs 80 miles a week, nobody does it except him. I watched the mile of Jericho 100 times and look another 100 times. great movies are watched more than movies that are not. I thank the creators of this film for having spent years living on it. They are wonderful people, and I bless them all. Thank you for letting me say my word again, thanks everyone.
