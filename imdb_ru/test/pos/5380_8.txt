From time to time, you notice a movie that exceeds your highest expectations. Given the IMDb rating of 4.0, I did not expect much from the Brotherhood of Satan. I was hoping that at the very least it could be funny, like “Devil Rain” or any other satanic horror film of the early 70s with the same plot. I could not be more wrong. Instead, I got an ambitious and intelligent film with the cast that I really liked. Speaking in general terms, to avoid giving away anything, the style and structure of the film is much more experimental than the straightforward narrative, so noticeable in the early 1970s. The brotherhood of Satan does not hit you in the head with plot points and explanations. Much remains for the viewer to fill in the gaps. As a viewer, you know that something is wrong, but for the longest period you are simply not sure what it is. Unknown helps to create a much more eerie atmosphere than most similar films. The final is spectacular in surrealistic images. I sat in amazement when the last credits began to roll. Those who want a big final will be disappointed by the simplicity of the final. A smaller film would try to pull out all the stops and most likely would fail miserably. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the film when it is easy to forget that director Bernard Makiviti worked mainly on television in front of the Brotherhood of Satan. There are several scenes that are so well prepared, lit and filmed, that even the most experienced directors can learn one or two things. For example, I have seen enough films over the years to understand that it can sometimes be difficult for directors to shoot widescreen shots indoors. Not here. The scene where men discuss their action plan in the sheriff’s office is amazing. Do we see all five men at the same time? Everyone does his own thing, as in real life. In a smaller film, we could see all the men at the same time, but each would be motionless, quietly waiting in line to convey their dialogue. This is a small scene, but it looks so natural and so beautifully filmed that it is one of my favorite moments of the Brotherhood of Satan. <br /> <br /> Finally, I mentioned acting in my debut, so without going into a long speech, I just say that Stroter Martin and LQ Jones are in The Brotherhood of Satan. Any film with these two guys is almost an automatic winner for me.
