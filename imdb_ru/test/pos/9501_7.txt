No more corned beef and cabbage for her! <br /> <br /> This little romantic comedy with a few exotic twists (partly imaginary scenes and a costume party) breaks away from scene to scene. All this is centered around the husbandâ€™s wife (s), who hopes to break out of the depression played by Gloria Swanson (she is twenty years old here!). Both leading people have natural air that is persuasive, and, of course, Swanson is beautiful in all kinds of moods, from giddy to worried and hopeful. <br /> <br /> Behind all the games and seeming frivolity is an old serious problem - to stay in love and not to go in love. There is a little trick there, but the director DeMille makes everything possible so that everything is fast and believable. As in many films of this period, subtitles do not just tell what they say (or think), but often give a kind of philosophical understanding, as if to justify tragedy (or racism). And there is a higher goal, perhaps better without an educational text, but this is part of the narrative style, and it is a bit strange. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for visual or formal surprise, you will not find it here. But as a story, well played and filmed with precision and economy, this is truly a great example. Perhaps the events will not be a complete surprise, but this is such a modern love story, unfolding almost a hundred years ago, this is gas. And did I see that Swanson is perfect?
