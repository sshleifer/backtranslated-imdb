The main criticism of this film by others, namely that Macy suddenly looks Jewish after putting on her glasses, is inappropriate. Points are only minor changes necessary to convince others that he is Jewish. The scene in which he tells his boss (paraphrasing) “but you KNOW what my background is,” along with another discussion with his mother, suggests that he had to contend with the same assumption in the past. The glasses now make him look like a Jew enough to “confirm” the existing suspicions of neighbors and colleagues. Then there is the big nose of his new wife and the taste for hands-free clothes, which of course means that she is Jewish. The whole point of the film is how these little stereotypical things become the basis for judging others. <br /> <br /> If he has a joke, then he is gay. If he has long hair, he smokes dope. If he is Hispanic, he has a knife ... and if he has round black glasses and he is thin, he must be a Jew. All these statements sound the same (me) believable to me. If the conclusion to which people turned in the Focus was reasonable, the whole point of the story would be lost.
