I remember how excited I was on Saturday evenings when I was a child, and I was waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then I grew up, Doctor Who disconnected from the air, and none of my friends have ever heard about it. Then I learned that there will be a new series. I was a little nervous about this. Will this meet the expectations that I have carried since childhood? Will they screw it up? Is the doctor sucking? Will his mate suck? Will they create a closer relationship with the doctor and his assistant? YES, NO, NO, NO, NO !!! This show is beautiful! I love the new doctor, I love his assistant. I love the show. And I am now excited on Friday night, waiting for the “new” episode. I am only now seeing the 2005 episodes since I live in the States, so I am a bit behind you. I hope the next doctor is as good as this one!
