Nazarin is some kind of saint, he wants to live like Christ taught him. But it is already too late: now the Catholic Church is in the hands of the rich bourgeoisie, the bishops live in luxury and do not give a damn about the poor and the sick. That is why our hero cannot follow the way his hierarchy asks him to follow. Therefore, he gets rid of everything, and on the way to purity some Mary Magdalene and a woman who sexually attracts him join him (tells the scene between this girl and her fiance). In Spain (it was the end of the fifties), they thought that Nazarin was a Christian film! To compare Nazarin and his "holy women" with Jesus is nonsense. On the way of Nazaryan, only blackberries and a grass couch grow. His attempt to help working men on the road is a failure, he is pursued as a striker. All his words mean nothing. At the end of the trip, he was arrested and offered pi to Naples from a woman (Bunuel sex symbol). Thanks to "Nazarin", Bunuel was allowed to return to Spain (where the censors did not have a clue) and send "Viridian".
