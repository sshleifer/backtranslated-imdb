The demon from the tree is removed in the form of a man in order to make love with a young beautiful maiden only so that she dies. The eyes of the demon freeze, two drops of blood fall on the bed, which he specially created for his object of desire. The bed consumes blood and hunger remains ... everything that comes into contact with the bed is destroyed! This is explained to us by one of the victims of the bed, an artist whose soul is locked "inside" one of his latest works, an artistic depiction of his last resting place (.. he died from consumption, coughed up blood, deciding to die on his deathbed). You see an artist whom we can see as if he was trapped in a small room looking through his picture, unfortunately, the viewer is eating in bed. The bed has a dark sense of humor, and we see this through the fact that it allows the artist to live, even giving him decorations and other things that once belonged to the eaten victims. The skull of one victim grows bright red flowers near the basement with a bed. The film tells about three young women who face the mansion, in the basement of which is the bed of death. The artist (Dave Marsh) may simply have a way to destroy the bed of death, but he will include a human sacrifice to resurrect the body of the one whose death provoked his hunger in the first place. Patrick Spence-Thomas provides a soft, depressing voice to a trapped artist, tells the story of the film, mourns his current position, tells us about past victims and often scolds the bed of a predatory character. <br /> <br /> A final, real cult film ... I expect his status to take off now, when DEATH BED: THE BED THAT GOES, has found its way to an audience (... like me), which appreciates the strange and the grotesque. The bed itself contains liquid acid with a hint of apple cider, in which we see how objects and people are consumed (fighting for nothing). Many can recognize young William Russ (BOY MEETS WORLD, THE UNHOLY) in curls, looking for his escaped sister, finding her in the basement, like a zombie and injured (of course, Julie Ritter was just such a film, in a trance, barely pronouncing the word) with both of them trapped. In one of the craziest scenes in the film, Russ is trying to strike at the bed only so that his hands are squeezed, the flesh is acidified, only skeletal bones remain, the cartilage has collapsed. There is one attempt to escape the victim, whose legs were stuck in bed, almost from the basement, when the sheets clung to her stomach, where she was. The film seems almost completely surreal, as if we are watching a terrible nightmare unfold. Directed by George Barry often shows jokes about the victims, who are in the most unfavorable position, choosing the bed of death as his refuge. The artist gives us memories of all the different people who have been eaten. There is nothing like this film, it is definitely one of a kind.
