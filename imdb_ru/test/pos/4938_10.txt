This is a great movie to watch with a good friend, boyfriend / girlfriend or family. In fact, one of those films in which you feel good, you want to share with your loved ones ... without any crap that you will find in many American films that feel good. This film is carefree, but makes you think and laugh. <br /> <br /> Just a very simple but universal plot. It would seem that most people can somehow relate to this film. The characters in the movie are amazing, and the actors do an excellent job of drawing you into the movie. And the film is completed throughout the journey with cheerful, believable Jewish humor. I first watched the movie last night, and now I want to have it. :)
