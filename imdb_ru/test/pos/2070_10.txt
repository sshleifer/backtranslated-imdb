1. I saw Hamlet Brana: Brana is too old, often speaks with a high voice (it is unwittingly funny!) - not a convincing Hamlet, and his directing qualities are bad! (see also a lot of ado about Brana - the funny parts of the dialogues are mostly cut out, not to mention the directors' mistakes in the abbreviations of the dialogs!) 2. I saw Hamlet 2000: I think the script is an interesting idea - but such bad actors - they are all 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is fine - but this BBC Hamlet is the best! Derek Jacobi is persuasive - it seems a little crazy - very suitable! and Patrick Stewart is wonderful, and Claire Bloom is a very attractive queen. You believe those actors that they say - I think this is the best compliment.
