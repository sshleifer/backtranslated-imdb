This film is very good, in fact it looks like a good wine, and the better you look, the better. For such a high-octane theme, the pace is rather slow, but the cinematography is beautiful and surreal. There is a cool blue tint that “rides” the entire movie. There is also one great performance by Gabriel Casse of the character “Kid”. He is awesome. Why this guy doesn't work anymore. If the film had received better support, he probably would have.
