I recently saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival of 2007, where he turned out to be one of the favorites of the audience. This is a parody of the French industry of cottages from OSS films 117 of the 50s and 60s. The first OSS 117 film, based on the novel by Jean Bruce, was presented on screen in 1956, long before the release of the first James Bond film, in which Ivan Desny starred as Hubert Bonisser De La Bass, and six subsequent action films were shot before 1970 of the year. Luke Merenda, Frederick Stafford, Kervin Matthews and John Gavén take turns playing Oss 117. Jean Dujardin plays the main role in this comedy series. When the film begins in 1945, it has a French mustache and it resembles Desny, but when the film begins in 1955, it really looks like Sean Connery. Jean-Francois Halim wrote this funny script of a spy sent to Egypt to investigate a friend’s murder. He borrowed the stupidities of Naked Gun, Get Smart and Pink Panther and uses fresh humor on current events in a delightful combination that will appeal to an international audience, and I am sure that this will be the first of the first to appear after the revived OSS 117 converted into comedy adventures. Michel Hazanavičius directs. I would give it a 7.5 and recommend it.
