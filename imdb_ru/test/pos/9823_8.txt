Like many others, I was attracted by the combination of Pollack, Ford and Scott-Thomas. I enjoyed the work of Pollack and Ford on Sabrina, a well-made film and a thorough correspondence of old material. Hearing that this film was in production, I ordered and read a book. Immediately it seemed that it would be a more difficult story for the film. Characters are not always cute, almost no humor, and the author makes a lot of plot shortcuts to focus on his main theme: so, because everyone will see the other as the only one sharing a unique combination of loss and betrayal caused by a plane crash, completely surprised spouses of adulterers will look for each other. Moreover, he believes that the solution may come to a bitter study of the hidden life of adulterers, and to the fact that this experience of “fat and thin” can give a deeper love than each of them before. Although most of the book is devoted to their bitterness and hatred for their former partners, in the end they find recognition and forgiveness. The film script saves only the plane crash and the overall situation of the spouses. Where a woman is a researcher in a book, this is a man in a film, and a woman is never a voluntary co-researcher. The film has a completely new dramatic plot for Harrison Ford, which seems even more contrived than the double coincidence of the plane crash. The "re-election congresswoman sub-plot" for the woman is also new, but it works better. The audience cannot live up to the expectations of a pure novel or a romantic comedy, because this story focuses on a very bitter pill. Where resolution and forgiveness is achieved in the book, however, removing the burden of bitterness from the reader and allowing frivolity, there is no corresponding moment in the film. Although forgiveness is never hinted at, it remains for us to assume that the treatment after the shooting performs a double duty. The character of Ford should not be such a funny person of a few words, and the change of Scott-Thomas’s accent at first is a little embarrassing. This film is not a dead loss offered by others. However, this is a difficult film to evaluate, because rewriting and adaptation to the screen is lower than the standard previously achieved by the actors.
