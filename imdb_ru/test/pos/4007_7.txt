I strictly watch “Attack of the show” for about 6 months (perhaps longer, but not very). I was very passionate about Olivia and found Kevin very witty, and the repertoire between them was very good. Although lately it is starting to dwindle due to many factors for me. My first favorite segment is the first 15 minutes, which are called “Around the Net” and show 5 video clips that you can find on sites like Youtube, which are usually funny, or about people who have accidentally suffered (some intentionally). Hmm, when I watch 4 to 5 times a week again and again the same things, I really haven't seen anything so good, and I can only laugh at people who probably broke their necks and were paralyzed so many times . The show is like the "Later Show" in which I want to be / Colbert Report, I also want to be aware of his policies, if you do not live in the blue state and are not an automatic liberal, this humor also gets old, McCain is old, yes, yes, anything. Liberals do not have the courage to make fun of themselves, because they are not so smart to understand that this can make them have a sense of humor, that they can laugh at themselves, so this is almost every show, frightened by McCain or Palin, shish. Thus, we get the same old videos of people who are hurt, over whom we must continue to laugh, and then some kind of left-wing political humor that never laughs at itself because of its own weakness. I will continue to look, as I look at work, and that is all there is, in the hope that I will be entertained, but it becomes somewhat old. I really liked the filling of the hosts Chris and Alison, although, in fact, they were a good change of pace; maybe this show could do a rotating host thing. Olivia, whom I initially thought was rather amusing, resorted to this constant blow, and it grows old, laughs. 7 out of 10; it will keep you young thinking, and it’s good if you are a younger baby boomer like me (mid 40s). Perhaps the cartoon of the day would be another segment that they have to do, there is a ton of material that they could use.
