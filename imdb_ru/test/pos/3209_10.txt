Hands down, the best drama / comedy show on television. A cleverly written show about a young mother and her 16-year-old daughter who explore life and learn not only about the world, but also about themselves. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to stay in close touch with her daughter, but to direct her to the right path, which throughout the show is becoming more and more difficult. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), who has entered the world of books and learning, is just starting to discover boys and his own sense of rebellion, which surprises them both. With the help of Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) and Suki St. James (Melissa McCarthy) and a huge variety of other funny characters, this show easily remains one of my favorites. What really puts the show first is a complex, unbelievable and witty letter, often using pop culture references to the mink dynasty.
