If we compare the film industry with the ocean, we have a tendency to observe only the surface. Under the leadership of a strong Hollywood marketing company, we all saw war films, such as Salvation of Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now, or Full Metal Jacket. But under the splashing waves, there are growing in silence, from time to time, lesser-known pearls. When you choose one and carefully look at it, you wonder why this pearl is almost unknown and why it is not on the crown. <br /> <br /> Stalingrad is such a pearl. Why does he have a bunch of actors valued at several million dollars? Not. Got a thousand extras? Does it have exciting, exciting, brilliant computer visual effects? It's my pleasure. So what's so special about it? Well, in a word, this is a pure past reality, recreated and transferred to celluloid fifty years later. The tragedy of the bloodiest battle in history is already here. Dirty, wounded soldiers, Russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion, burned villages, collapsed buildings, rotted suburbs, shooting, explosions, tanks in flames, soldiers fired, burned alive, burned tanks in their pits or ripped apart - you got it all. But the real horror elsewhere. People turn into simple pawns, without the ability to change anything. The soldiers we follow in the film try to leave the war zone and fail. Civilians remain in prostration in the middle of nowhere, only crying about their dead children. The ruthless, huge grinding machine of war fuses people, equipment, villages, cities - and asks for new victims and destruction again and again. <br /> <br /> In all this collective insanity, a group of German soldiers is fighting to survive and maintain at least a minimum level of normality. They do their duty and fight bravely. But, as everyone knows, the battle is almost lost when people begin to lose confidence and faith. We see how all these people are abandoned, how they plan to desert, how they are trying to catch the latest plane to Berlin (full of wounded), how some very seriously wounded soldiers were seen as imitators and shot, as they were forced to execute a small group of Russian civilians , including a young boy, as they later found a place, literally full to the ceiling of food and drinks - intended, of course, only for some "senior" officers, of course. One by one they fall dead. The end of the film is one of the most bitter, depressing and touching endings I've ever seen, all on the magnificent score of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. The war destroyed everything in its path. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie. A true movie lover should have it in his collection. A strong anti-war signal should be a warning for all of us. Unfortunately, humanity never learns, nor politics. Self-destruction is in our DNA, and human pain seems to last forever. Can we be sensible enough to stop the WAR?
