I saw this movie with my friends and we all enjoyed it! It is so sweet and soulful, a real jerk! I was still thinking about the plot a few days after watching the movie. This is such a beautiful story about the difficulties that all families go through; this is something everyone can relate to. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a rental on Saturday night. With your friends, your family, your boyfriend, everyone will really like it! : D This is a true story about a real family that will draw on someoneâ€™s sincere feelings. Not to mention beautiful landscape shots and a fantastic game. See, I'm sure you will like it just as much as I do!
