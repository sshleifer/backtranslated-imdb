Recently, I was given this film on DVD as a gift, and at first I was not sure whether I would like it (although one of my favorite actors plays a leading role). In fact, he is on his way to becoming a favorite. <br /> <br /> First of all: fortunately, this is not the same thing as a book, the ending of which I consider overly melodramatic. Secondly: this is one of the best films that I have seen about the First World War. "What kind?" You can ask. "This is not a movie about war!" True: we see no battles, no bombing, no trenches, no gas. But it shows the cost of war, the damage done to the lives of those who fought in it, and the impact it had on those close to them. <br /> <br /> First we see Helen (Sarah Miles), the widow of a baronet, awaiting her release from a mental hospital. All the women in the film seem widows: some from the war, but much older than Helen's husband, Sir Thomas (we see him later in the photo) fell ill and died when she was at a party, hence her fault. stricken breakdown. She is lost and alone. The wire around the hospital grounds resembles prisoner camps and trenches: like many men in the outside world, Helen suffers from some kind of shock. <br /> <br /> Outside the hospital, she must find her legs again in the outside world: a world that we feel with her eyes as dull, devastated and unfriendly. Her mother can not give her any real support. The widow herself, she defended her emotional protection, behind which she hides, in order to avoid the suffering of her daughter. (Like many people, especially at that time, she seems to be embarrassed by mental illness.) <br /> <br /> Ledbetter, a hired driver, becomes an assistant and helps Helen begin to adapt to life again, but she does not understand that he becomes dangerously obsessed with her. This is an excellent presentation by Robert Shaw. Ledbetter is a former military man, a former sergeant major who runs a boxing club and founded his own car rental business. Outwardly, he seems strong and strong, reliable, but there are cracks under the surface: he did not quite adapt to civilian life. He invents (for reasons that he later explains) family and family life, which he does not have; he has violent outbursts with colleagues and sex without affection. How to get close to Elena ?? a woman whom, even with greater post-war social freedom, he could not really hope to marry ?? reveals psychological errors that tear it apart. Nowadays, PTSD can be diagnosed. <br /> <br /> The same can be said about the other person in Helen’s life, aspiring politician captain Hugh Countrype (Peter Egan). He is ambitious, handsome, but also very young. Tellingly, his girlfriend, Connie (Caroline Mortimer), looks after him, combs his hair and checks that he has a clean handkerchief before he comes out. He is known to both Ledbetter and Elena: the first served under his command during the war, and Elena met with him in political circles and considered him “pop senjay”. However, now he and Helen are starting a relationship, and Helen intends to support his political career financially and emotionally. Peter Egan, who has just received stage success in the role of Stanhope in R. Sheriff’s “The End of the Journey”, makes Hugh not just an immature hero. In the back of the car between Helen and Hugh, there is a frank, understated scene in which they quote Brooke "Old Vicar at Grantchester." She asks about his military experience: "Was that very bad?" He can not answer. She says, "Well, you are back now." But his quiet answer is ?? "I? Sometimes I wonder ??" ?? This is the key to his character. As the light and shadow flicker on his face, we know that there are some horrors that cannot be expressed in words. The disproportionate losses suffered by junior officers of a kind ?? straight from school or university and expected to lead from the front? well known. In a nervous speech (during which Elena calms him down) to the local political people at dinner, he shows that he will be independent, not liberal (the party that led the country to war). His emotional life is as damaged as that of Ledbetter. He cannot easily pull himself out of Connie, who is emotionally and materially dependent on him: reading between the lines, she is probably a military widow (perhaps a former comrade?) With a child, whose drawings we see on the wall of her house. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> The crisis between the trio develops slowly, with a frightening scene between Helen and Ledbetter in the car, and Ledbetter listens to Hugh and Connie as he drives them when Hugh tries to convince Connie that even when his relationship with Helen develops, they can continue theirs; that he, at least, will continue to support her. Jealousy, obsession and his belief that he must protect Helen from the two-faced gold digger, the lead Ledbetter, to brutally confront her and Hugh in her house. <br /> <br /> The ending is completely different from that in the novel, and better for this: it is dramatic, but less melodramatic, and maintains an unsentimental tone. We started with one character recovering from a mental disorder; we end up with another suffering. It is felt that Helen is now wiser and stronger than both men who could not fully adapt to the so-called "land suitable for heroes", to which they returned from the nightmare of total war. The new finale is open: it is felt that she, at least, will cope with what lies ahead, without illusions. In this, he well reflects the reality of the time when women (Helen, Connie and many others) were forced to collect pieces of the world in which too many men died or returned home with varying degrees of mental and physical damage. <br /> <br /> "Well, you're back." ?? "I? Sometimes I wonder ??"
