Love Jones skillfully portrays young African-American men and women in a clear, positive and realistic sense. I feel that all the actors and actresses were great and really did an excellent job of preserving the mood. Nia Long and Larents Tate did a good job together, and I hope to see more work from the two of them. In fact, all the actors / actresses have done such a wonderful job, it would be great to see another romantic comedy from them. This film can be compared to the majority of any well-written romantic comedy. If you have not seen this film, I strongly recommend that you do it, it can definitely give you a different perspective on life and love.
