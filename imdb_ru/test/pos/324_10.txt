Mani, sir, as usual, tells another amazing story with Kannatil Muthamtal. Such an amazing relationship between parents and child manifests beautifully. Mani Sir, as usual, without any special effects and special outdoor shooting. (In fact, it was the only film in which he had ever traveled outside India ... it’s too easy for Sri Lanka). I’ll add ARR music to it ... which is just awesome ... Vellai Pookal is one of my favorite songs in all of history ... Maddie, who she is in the film industry, was also very impressed. Starting from alaypeyti, cannatil, ayutha ezuta and gurus. Mani Ratnam showed the world what the universal actor Maddy is. Simran was really good too. She showed that she, too, can play unglamorous and character roles. In all a terrific movie. It is sad that the Tamil public cannot appreciate this gr8 film, and it is bombed at the box office ....
