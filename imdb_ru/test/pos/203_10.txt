It does not surprise me that this short (91 minute) black and white film, made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during a short period called “Thaw” or “Thaw”, won so much love and admiration among movie lovers around the world. It is sublime and beautifully shot. In some scenes it is felt that they are ahead of their time. The camera work and the creative discoveries of Sergei Urusevsky were included in textbooks and widely imitated. The film tells a touching and eternal love story, destroyed by a merciless war, but eternally living in the memory of a young woman. It is also a film about loyalty, memories, the ability to live, when it seems that there is nothing to live for; it is about forgiveness and hope. The film received (absolutely deserved) the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, and Tatiana Samoilova was selected as the winner of a special award in Cannes for the role of Veronica, a young girl who is happily in love with the best man in the world at the beginning of the movie. After separation from her beloved, who went to the front, losing her family on a bomb ride and marriage to a man she never loved and only wanted him to never exist, she turned to the shadow of herself, she became dead inside. Her long journey to redemption, to the final acceptance of the death of her beloved and exploring how to live with it, is fascinating and heartbreaking, and it simply will not leave a single spectator indifferent. <br /> <br /> For me, the film is very personal and expensive, because I was born and raised in the city where his characters lived, and were very happy in the beginning. I walked along the same streets, squares and bridges across the Moscow River. Each family in the former Soviet Union lost at least one, but often more than one family member, in battle, or in a concentration camp, or in a ghetto, or from hunger, cold, and disease during World War II, and my family did not is an exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never cured the pain of loss not only from films and books. “Cranes are flying” speaks to me clearly and honestly and very deeply touches me. This is a masterpiece of filmmaking, but it is part of my life - my past, my memory and my past.
