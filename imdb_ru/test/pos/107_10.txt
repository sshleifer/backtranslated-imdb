Easily one of the best Indian movies ever. Of course, this does not say much (I made such a conclusion after a whopping 15 minutes of viewing). But I can really say that “Fire” is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films I've seen. <br /> <br /> Beautiful because of his looks. The best example I can give is parallelism between two women (Radha and Sita) and characters with the same name in Hindu mythology. Sita, for example, is the wife of the worshiped Lord Rama. As legend has it, Ram subordinates his wife, forcing her to go through the Fire to prove her "cleanliness." In response, Sita cries and leaves him, reuniting with her mother (Earth). This story has crazy connections with the stories of two Indian women (Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi). The word “Fire” suddenly has many meanings — marriage, traditions, religion, motherhood, and perhaps some others that I did not catch. <br /> <br /> Brilliant because of its social hues. Many who were offended by the promise for this film should actually be the first to see Fire (for example, my mother, who really loved it). What for? Because, although fire is an attack on a tradition, it is also an attack on a tradition. In other words, it is his strength, not weakness. Traditional conservative social mores (be it Indian, Canadian, American or anyone else) are useless if they enslave you. Gender roles and self-denial can do that. <br /> <br /> This is what I took with me when I saw the Fire. Hats off to Deepa Mehta ??
