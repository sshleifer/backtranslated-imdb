This piece of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is certainly the best I've ever seen. Although he may not have the production value of some of the latest adaptations, he has the most important element: Sir Derek Jacobi in the role of Hamlet. <br /> <br /> The image of Jacobi the troubled prince is multi-layered and exciting, His expressions of emotion fluctuate from hatred of sadness, love of vengefulness and everywhere on the map, but do not seem excessive or excessive. In fact, some of the stronger sequences occur when he emphasizes them, with stillness, soft speech and thoughtful expression. As for whether he interprets Hamlet as crazy or sane ... well, you have to decide for yourself; I changed my mind more than once. At some point it seems that he considered himself sane and just played madness, but he suspects that he is really mad in the end ... a revelation for himself captured beautifully. Having performed the Hamlet part on stage more than any other actor in history, Jacobi’s proximity to the role is not surprising. <br /> <br /> As for the performance itself, it is presented as “The“ shot copy ”of the performance, with some special effects or unusual camera work, a minimum set and no musical accompaniment. This production is based on the acting skills of the actors and the words of Shakespeare to evoke emotions and interest of the audience. And it works. Other players are also top-notch, in particular, Claudius Patrick Stewart and Gertrude Claire Bloom. Together, the cast of actors is an integral ensemble. <br /> <br /> The last (but far from the least) element that highlights this performance is the game itself. Here it is presented in full, a rarity on the film. But, oddly enough, I never noticed the time. I was too busy to dive into the story. I suspect you too.
