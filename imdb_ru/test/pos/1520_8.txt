Holt is not in a happy movie. It is also not related to any social realism. This is probably his strength. The distance from a certain time and nation strengthens the message, makes it more powerful and disrupts the burden of nationalism and propaganda, which you often feel in films created to criticize nations, unlike your own commercial film). <br /> <br /> Bit-time is much more than just a message. It is a film of pure, surreal beauty, filled with the same pure, clinical form that you will find in a work such as 1984, and it is equal. <br /> <br /> I'm an old big fan of Alan Rickman, a man with golden sarcasm (and, I might add, incomparable sex appeal ;-)). The game between him and Madeleine Stowe is brilliant. Every time I see him, he seems to be playing a character, even more nasty than the previous one ... <br /> <br /> But enough sweet talk. The film is not enough in action. I do not want any emergency machines, but I want something to happen, except for a pure conversation. After an hour, I was very tired of the interrogation room, predictable actions and, more than anything, I wanted a more complex look at all of this, the world, the past lives of the characters, and everything else that was missing. For some people, a nice touch. For me, something less positive. <br /> <br /> In any case, Closet Land is a film that is worth it if you are ready to travel to the abyss of human nature. <br /> <br /> And of course for us, who really loves Always Angry Alan Rickman.
