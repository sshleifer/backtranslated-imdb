This is just one of those films you either love him or hate, my girlfriend and I loved him, told my brother to rent him, and he hated, said it was too flashy and conversational, and then he usually just goes. big gunmen, so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed. Was there some great new talent (I had never heard of leading roles before)? Des Brady (director's brother?) Was especially good. Playing in the right penis at the beginning, I thought that he would never redeem himself, but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he created, and by the end I was really for him. Very amazing film with a big heart, if you can live without calculations and explosions, then this film is very original. Yashimo Brixton in the UK.
