I did not expect much when I decided to watch this film, so I was surprised to find that I fully enjoy it. A couple of scenes made me laugh almost uncontrollably. Characters were attractive (no pun intended); However, the story is predictable. The most interesting thing is that I am watching Crow (Shore's character), a frivolous but wise Californian guy who came home for Thanksgiving from a college from the countryside, trying to adapt to their image of life. I was also surprised that there was a message in all of this. If you have a chance, watch this movie!
