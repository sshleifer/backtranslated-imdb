If you are looking for an original horror movie, this may be for you. This is strange and sometimes lingers on nonsense, but it is such a beautiful, well-sounding and original film, it never fails, except, perhaps, during too long a climax. “Nightbreed” is what horror lovers or makeup monsters need to see. <br /> <br /> Boone (Craig Schaeffer) dreams of a city called Midian, full of mutant creatures. In psychotherapy, his psychiatrist Dr. Decker (horror director David Cronenberg) came to the conclusion that Boone is the killer, gives him hallucinogenic pills and tells him to give up. After he was nearly killed, Boone goes to the hospital where he is confronted with a mentally ill person, who also knows about a Midian woman and tells Boone where to go. The Midianite, located in a cemetery, is populated by vile mutant creatures that keep Buna out. After escaping with only a hideous bite, Boone was shot dead by the police, which Dr. Decker led to his whereabouts. But Boone is not dead. A bite makes him live, and he goes to Midian. Meanwhile, Buna's girlfriend Laurie (Ann Bobby) is trying to find Buna and figure it out. When Dr. Decker also finds out about this place, chaos arises. <br /> <br /> The plot seems long and complicated, but it’s really easy to understand. The plot, among other things, makes this film really interesting. The effect of cosmetics is striking. Creatures look unique and amazing, and make this film very attractive. To add more feelings, we have the musical accompaniment of Danny Elfman, which is both lush and cheerful, and fits the film like a glove. Frames in the film are also beautifully tuned. Cinematography is beautiful, and the film creates an atmosphere that is never broken. Even acting is good, and the biggest surprise was that director David Cronenberg showed an excellent, formidable role, like a man who for one reason or another wants to see Boone dead. It is strange that a horror movie is so good. <br /> <br /> Problems with the film ... well, there are a few, but the positive ones outweigh the negative ones. The script contains occasional comic jokes to try to add a little bit of humor, but almost every one of them fails. Mutant creatures look great and for the most part work well, but sometimes it seems that they are simply presenting their stunning makeup for the camera. The worst part of the movie was supposed to be the climax. It takes so much time, and it's just constant chaos. This is part of the film, which moves from individual characters and nice knitted frames to fiery explosions from all sides and violence that occurs with characters we do not know or care about. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is amazing to look at. This is a well-made horror movie, but even though he said, it has a random failure in character lines, and a dirty climax. However, this is one to check. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** of ****. 101 minute R for strong violence and language.
