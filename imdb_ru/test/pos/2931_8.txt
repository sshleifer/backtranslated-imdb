America's next top model is a good show, it helps people in their careers, but lately I have been sick of it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 1: Yes, I am happy that I won Adrienne, I wanted her to win the beginning. <br /> <br /> Cycle 2: this is too bad, I think Mercedes deserved it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 3: I didn’t like Eve, but I didn’t like most of the girls in this cycle. <br /> <br /> cycle 4: Kalen was supposed to win. I do not know what they saw in Hire, but I know exactly what they saw in Kalena. <br /> <br /> Cycle 5: Like Cycle 3, it was not a big cycle either. but of all the girls, Nicole as a winner? eww! <br /> <br /> Cycle 6: I liked Sarah and Joanie, but Daniel is fine too. <br /> <br /> Cycle 7: Karidi definitely deserved it. <br /> <br /> Cycle 8: No, I didn’t want Zhaslin to win. I did not like her. I saw other girls in this cycle with definitely more potential than she, although I didn’t see much of this cycle. <br /> <br /> Good show, I just saw him too many times to love him more: D
