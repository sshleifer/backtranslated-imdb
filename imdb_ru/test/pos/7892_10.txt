22. Joe (drama, 1970) Joe (Peter Boyle) is a racist factory worker who is known to hate "hippies and no one." He meets Bill, a businessman who has just killed the lover of his young drug addict, Jill (Susan Sarandon). Jill runs away and joins the hippie commune on the outskirts of the city. Bill turns to Joe for help. Their searches lead them through the most sinister areas of the city, where they even more check the internal hatred and the hatred of men. <br /> <br /> Criticism: It was the first hit of director John G. Avildsen who fell asleep (an amazing run that included: Rocky, Kid Karate, Split Image, Weekend at Bernie). The film is quite interesting in that it served as the embodiment of the themes and ideas of the turbulent 60s (the Vietnam War, the power of blacks, women's liberation, etc.). He also has a good performance by Peter Boyle as Joe, one of the first anti-heroes of the movie. He always played well in creepy, domineering heavyweights, whose abstract ideas were reinforced by his frightening presence (he would have played the Frankenstein monster in Mel Brook's “Young Frankenstein” parody). He reminds me of a small child, trapped in a big, dull, clumsy body. The film has a weak script (for example, the meeting between Joe and Bill is a bit random), but it has a particularly awful end after “Taxi Driver”. <br /> <br /> Quote: Title song: “I saw a guy selling junk to children. He is nervous every time I pass, because he knows that if I catch him, I hit him on the head and kick his fat dollar. ”
