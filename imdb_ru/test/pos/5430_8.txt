Robin Williams is a national treasure, especially when he is released and postpones his dirty approach to drama. He manages to revive Barry Levinson's usual low-key career, and in this film there are moments when he really shines. <br /> <br /> How funnily elected American president in "Man of the Year" Williams beats off the fun and outrageous things that used to be associated with him. What makes him so attractive is his humanity and sympathy. Here is a man who can pounce on his audience, but truly loves them. His humor is like barbed wire, and yet he is cathartic. This is what makes it very attractive to people in the film and in real life. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney again portrays an intelligent woman in distress. She is a terrific and very talented performer, but I think she entered into the stereotype, and, unfortunately, it would be more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case. Walken largely walks by his ungrateful role, and the climate scene in the SNL parody barely floats above the water. <br /> <br /> Enjoy a few fun moments, and this is priceless. Enjoy Williams and forget some deep moments that slow down this otherwise interesting movie.
