Scary in some places, although the effects leave much to be desired, if only you have poor eyesight or you are not afraid of the dark. However, most of the actions were convincing, and most of the effects were well done. I thought the creature looked too much like a man wearing a gorilla in my opinion. It reminded me of the original pink panther film.
