This film was beautiful and touching. It touched a place deep inside of me, and I don't know why. I am a happily married woman, and I have never had lesbian tendencies, but my film almost made it what I longed for. Choreography, storyline, dialogue ... the film was a work of art. <br /> <br /> Overview without spoilers: a woman gymnast is dissatisfied with her life and is looking for ... something, something. She is with a man who does not want a child, but she wants. He has no relation to her, but he does not treat her as much as a woman. It seems to me that he does not really appreciate her. All these years, she remained in shape and decides to return to the gym. She meets another woman during her acrobatic workouts, and an intimate and beautiful relationship unfolds. Throughout the film, she has another friend with whom she trained in her youth, and they remained close friends. <br /> <br /> Relations that are revealed are ... I don't know which word, but very understanding, comfortable, intimate, but sexy ... something that could exist only between two women. Relationships that can truly bring meaning back to your life. Someone who makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, even confused. <br /> <br /> Relations with her close friend are just as different. They have a close and close relationship. Her friend showed me what a real friend is. Someone who is understanding, calm, REAL, having fun with him, someone who is with you, no matter what. Someone who supports, and you can get together and tell your deepest secrets. Someone who shares your past, but does not share your secrets. <br /> <br /> The story is simple in that it has not been exaggerated, but not underestimated. It leaves a lot of sensual images to capture his moments. Dancing and choreography were awesome. I could watch it again and again. The way the artist perceived the feelings and emotions of the protagonist. Dances and images were very dazzling and fascinating to view. What a cozy wonderful story! I fell in love with this movie. If you have a chance, rent it and take a look!
