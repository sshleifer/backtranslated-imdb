At school I was taught how some shots are called, and two directors were constantly mentioned: Orson Welles and Sergey M. Eisenstein. Then I didn’t care (I was a child!), But now I know why Eisenstein is a genius, and I’m ashamed to see what was possible in 1938, when for almost more than half a century we stuck countless empty films! Some people say that this film is not worth Eisenstein's genius (then they have to watch it again and again until they can say something bad) or, even worse, it is just a propaganda film for the Russians. Let's say it as it is, this is really pure propaganda of patriotism, but isn't it “Saving Private Ryan” or “The Longest Day”? I could sum up the number of films in which America rises to the top, so why not Russia, and, moreover, every war is fought for Irish patriotism, and why else did they raise flags? Alexander Nevsky is necessary for everyone who cares about cinematography, since almost every shot is a sublime image. Perhaps all this can be traced, but I wonder why it is not included in the Top 250 IMDB, because there is also a lot of overvalued Oscarprap in it.
