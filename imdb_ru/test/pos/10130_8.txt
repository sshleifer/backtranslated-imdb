Radio is a beautiful film based on the true story of the mentally retarded James Robert Kennedy, nicknamed Radio and the football coach from T.L. Hannah High School, Harold Jones. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. works great on the radio! I would never have thought to see him in a serious performance, especially because most of the films that I watch with him are comedies. Ed Harris is great, like Harold Jones, but this actor is great, so this is nothing new. <br /> <br /> A mentally retarded young man named James Robert Kennedy always walks around T.L. Hannah High School, not touching anyone and hardly noticing. One day, when a soccer ball rushes next to him, he decides to stay with the ball because of the impatience of Johnny Cash, one of the best players of the football team, as well as one of the nastiest guys you've ever met. One day, Cash decides to punish James, mock him with other players, and even go so far as to tie him up. <br /> <br /> When Coach Jones discovers this terrible act, he becomes angry and punishes the whole team by deciding to help James, who received the nickname Radio, because of his passion for radio in general. <br /> <br /> The film shows how Radio becomes an assistant, helping the team to train despite difficulties. from the players, and even get respect mainly from all the people who live in a small town. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a real and beautiful story. He has a life lesson specifically showing us how a person can make a difference without even being what we call “normal.” Radio has a big heart and is unable to hate anyone, and this is something that we all have to apply in our daily life.
