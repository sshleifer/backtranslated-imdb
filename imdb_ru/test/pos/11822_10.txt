Incredibly close to the real feelings and emotions captured by Joseph Mazsello as a hemophilia-sick child suffering from AIDS, and his new young neighbor eager to be a tough redneck that Brad Renfro brought to perfection. Although this story may seem a bit far-fetched (two boys try to swim a few hundred miles along the river to find a doctor who claims to have cured AIDS), the emotions, actions, and interactions of all the characters involved are tragically close to real life. Being a “big brother” for a boy in a similar situation, who died a few years after the release of this film, I strongly recommend this picture to anyone who has ever thought about what really happens in a child’s life with AIDS. Superb direction Peter Horton creates great mood and settings for each scene and involves the viewer in various emotions affected by friendship, illness, prejudice and the final separation of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity.
