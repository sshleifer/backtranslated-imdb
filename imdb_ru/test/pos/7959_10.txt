CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST - the perfect movie. Impeccable film about all the vices of mankind. From the outside, it may look like a film about death, but in reality it is a film about life. I just can't recommend this movie enough. And do not be afraid, dear readers, this is not a depressing film. As already mentioned, this is a film about the brightness of life, coached under the guise of death. You will laugh. You will cry You will understand that life is fragile and short. And you will leave viewing to better understand how precious life is. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (a more detailed review of this film and reviews of other foreign films)
