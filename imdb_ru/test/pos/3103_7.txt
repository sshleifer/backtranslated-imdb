The film begins with a capricious old Broadway producer (exceptionally well-played by veteran actor Richard Karl), led by a man hoping to sell him a story for the upcoming play. However, a strong storm and their car stuck in the mud, and therefore they are forced to look for a place to sleep. Fortunately, there is a mansion nearby, although it seems strange that the people inside know the writer, and he says that he did not understand that this was the home of the person he knew (and despised). However, although this seems to be a bad and contrived composition, this is not so ... since all this is part of the author's skillful trick for a group of actors in the house to play out his plot. However, halfway through the trick, the producer and his assistant, intimidated, find out that the mystery of the murder that takes place in the house is fake, and they think that all this is quite funny. However, no one understands that the runaway maniac is free, and he is going to enter into this contrived little plot - making amazing turns. Therefore, when it seems that a real murder has happened, the actors are really scared, and Karl and his assistant are convinced that this is a hoax. While I have explained some of the plots, there are still many aspects of the film that you just have to figure out for yourself - and this will certainly entertain and guess. <br /> <br /> Considering that this is a B-movie in open access, I, of course, did not place great hopes on this small film. Nevertheless, I was delighted when the film turned out to be much better than the average film - with a very interesting and new twist on the old clich√©d plot about a dark and stormy night spent in the mansion. Plus, although the plot of the film was very good, the dialogue was even better - with a lot of sparkling wit and a pleasant carefree pace. Full of pleasant surprises and worth your while.
