As often happens when you try to take a book with over 400 pages and squeeze it into a two-hour film, a lot is lost. Here, director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost copes with it. What we get is a charming and emotionally attractive film that seems somehow incomplete. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of wonderful and fantastic film in this film. John Toll's cinematography (Braveheart and Autumn Legends, which won an Oscar for both films) is great. Working with Madden, the choice of places on the Greek island of Kefalonia is magnificent, and the visual images obtained by photographing these magnificent places in a different light are magnificent and beautiful. Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as city dwellers, giving the city an authentic look. The soundtrack is also terrific, and the passage and mandolin vocals by the Italian soldiers are amazing. <br /> <br /> Madden copes with the Italian occupation and the novels, which occupy most of the film. There are a lot of pleasant and funny moments in this segment. However, by the time serious combat drama was ready to turn around, there were not so many films left on the reel, and this component was extremely in a hurry and shrunk. While the battle scenes are done well, after the battle it is obvious that more and more compromises are being made so that the film does not work for too long. By the time we reach the post-war scenes, the treatment is just a skeleton. Another disadvantage is that the DVD is particularly poor in its capabilities. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is charming in the romantic role of the leader of a sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing, not fight. When he has to fight, Cage smoothly shifts gears to a person with a cruel principle and decisiveness and somehow remains believable in both characters. <br /> <br /> Penelope Cruz, who loves the camera, gives Pelagia the indisputable role. In part, this is because Cage dominates the screen so much, but Cruz seems too calm about the part that needs to be emotionally vibrant and dynamic. It allows you to objectify a character as Corelli's love interest, rather than turning her into a powerful character in her own right. <br /> <br /> John Hurt superbly plays the role of an old wise doctor, who knows as much about man as nature as medicine. However, Christian Bale seems a bit overwhelmed and tough, like Pelagia's fianc√©. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie as 8/10. Despite some shortcomings, this is a touching film that is worth seeing. A photo alone is worth the price of admission.
