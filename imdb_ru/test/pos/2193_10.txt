I watched my video last night, for the first time in ten years. I found the work itself and the performances as exciting as they were in my memory. George Hearn, of course, was the master of Sweeney; in his desire to take revenge on those whom he considers the cause of the death of his wife and the disappearance of his daughter, there will never be gentleness; at least until the end, when he discovers that his thirst for revenge has led him to kill his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex picture, like Mrs. Lovett. She understood that Sondheim wanted this role to be something like Sweeney’s “comic” counterpart; and even brings some tenderness to her courting Sweeney and her raising a boy Tobias. For those who have long memories, this performance brings us back to her debut performances in the film by Dorian Gray and Gaslight; long before the murder she wrote. Only a year ago I saw the musical in Chicago's Lyric Opera. with the current superstar opera Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. Others commented on the opera quality of the score. My conclusion is that Sweeney works better with actors who can at least cope with vocal parts than opera artists who have limited acting skills. In conclusion, I recommend the artist who portrayed Tobias. with his mixed loyalty and confusion about what is going on around him. It seemed appropriate that he had practically the last word.
