Tim Robbins did a masterwork by directing this film. I say this because he avoided conventions and cliches. He also watched the magnificent performances of Susan Sarandon (who won an Oscar for her role) and Sean Penn. Even more surprising, Robbins does not patronize. He just tells the story and lets the events play to the mind of the viewer. It is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinion about the death penalty, one of the most controversial topics of our time, without unfair manipulations in any direction. I can't recommend this movie enough, 9/10.
