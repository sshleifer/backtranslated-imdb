In this interesting lost film (written by Terence Malik), stars Stacy Keach and Frederick Forrest are two wacky southern brothers in an effort to open a seafood restaurant. Margo Kidder was never more beautiful, and Forrest should have been nominated. Originally dubbed The Brothers Dion, this carefree film with a cruel finale is pure joy! <br /> <br /> Where is this movie? I have been looking for this for 30 years. Keech was still great then, and I am surprised that he no longer has followers of the cult (perhaps he is). These guys are crazy with big ambitions than brains, but absolutely nice guys! A 7 out of 10. If you can dig it somewhere, you will have fun.
