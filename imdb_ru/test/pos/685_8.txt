I swear, if I ever tried cocaine, I would be able to relate perfectly to this film. His pace, as well as dialogue, is produced at a rate that some viewers may need to stop and relax their heads. <br /> <br /> Wonderful little elements pop up in the film, for example, like Rob Lowe, the character always seems to lose his shoes, or how some characters continue to spin along his zigzag path. The story was very well composed, and the direction seems flawless. <br /> <br /> The film smells awkward and attractive. This is the one that I think would most like. A few moments of laughter, loud, even if you are alone, guarantee that I will definitely watch it again.
