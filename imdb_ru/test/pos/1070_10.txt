This Christmas gift arrived thanks to the courtesy of TCM. We have never seen the film, although we have seen most of the films of Barbara Stenwick. This comedy made us laugh so hard that sometimes we had to restrain ourselves in order to hear the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film should be watched by people suffering from stressful situations, especially around. Christmas. It will certainly lift your spirits, just letting go. The film will be a great gift in the form of a DVD or VHS tape. <br /> <br /> “Christmas in Connecticut” was written by Peter Godfrey with a large margin in explanation of the story of Eileen Hamilton. <br /> <br /> The best thing in the film is the successful combination of the two most popular stars of that era: Barbara Stanwyk and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwick always played strong willed women, obviously, this was for her a change of pace. In this film, as well as in the film “Lady Eve,” Miss Stanvik demonstrates the skill of comedy. She and Mr. Morgan, who played in many musical comedies, make up the winning combination. <br /> <br /> There are no weak speeches in the film. Sydney Greenstreet, an actor who is notorious for playing "heavyweights", enjoys watching the rich and fat Alexander Yardley, the man who owned the media empire and knew well when he saw it. Reginald Gardiner, an experienced English actor, adds brilliance to the star cast of the two main characters. <br /> <br /> S. Z. Sakall, is another source of continuous fun; He plays a Hungarian chef, Felix, who finds it difficult to find his version of the English language. In addition, Una O'Connor makes an ideal Nora, a housewife on an ideal farm in Connecticut Sloane. <br /> <br /> Reading the other comments on this forum, it’s sad to find out that great black-and-white cinematography is not appreciated by some people. In the end, the color was not widely used in the 40s, and most classic films need to be watched in the original format, because what could be achieved by painting them? <br /> <br /> This film should be a requirement for those who want to spend almost two hours of continuous fun at Christmas, because full fun is guaranteed. Watch it with an open heart and a heart, maybe you would like to see "Christmas in Connecticut" every year.
