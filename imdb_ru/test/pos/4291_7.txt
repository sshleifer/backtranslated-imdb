Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a pleasure! Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett round off supporting roles to four lie and intrigue. Yet the basis of all this is the character of decency - moral conscience, despite the obvious contradictions. "Contradictions are the source of all movement and all life." How true are these words. Ann Manning from Watson lies at the heart of this intrigue — she is the central conscience upon which the other three held. She is not afraid of decency. <br /> <br /> The circumstances of a lie belong to everyone: to defend their professional name; one to hold back due to family / partner pressure; just do not want to face the consequences; Ironically, a person cannot believe the truth and lies in order to save friendship. These are all dangerous situations. Therein lies the intrigue - it is interesting to watch how everyone fights with truth and lies. Contradictions, indeed. Despite seeming dishonor, decency and heart remain strong. <br /> <br /> Handling the subject and how each character behaves is masterfully simple and straightforward. It is not sensational and not complicated, like the other film “Where the truth lies” of 2005. Credits thanks to the writings of Fellows and the nuances of the performances of Watson and Wilkinson. Somehow there is heat that penetrates through seemingly bold or covertly false lies. By all this, human weakness is not excluded, they meant well. And after the story, the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how these two Manning seemed to have grown and matured in their relationship. <br /> <br /> You can say that there are no obvious fighters or exciting scenes in “Separate Lie”, but there is intrigue, and it will attract your attention.
