At first glance, the idea of ​​this show seemed like a joke and a gag, just for the entertainment of Stan Lee. I didn’t expect anything but an elegant, animated version of Barb Wire with low performance, very similar to those short pieces of shit that you see on Adult Swim for short-term entertainment, but never take it too seriously. Man, I was wrong! <br /> <br /> Stripperella has even better production than Marvel Toons. The animation is very good, and it seems that they took this series very seriously and did their best to make it as professional as possible. <br /> <br /> Humor is also good for sexuality, an impressive and sloppy side. This is very similar, if not quite like the Simpsons style. You may encounter clichés and more predictable humor, but, nevertheless, it is still fun. If this happened today, I would surely see it regularly. This is surprisingly one of the best cartoons ever made.
