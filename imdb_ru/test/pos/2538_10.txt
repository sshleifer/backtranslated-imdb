“Pixote: A Lei do Mais Fraco” is dedicated, perhaps, to the biggest of all Brazilian themes: poverty. And along with poverty, it causes other unnatural feelings and actions; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder. <br /> <br /> Brazil is a country of paradoxes, and its social problems are everywhere. The difference between rich and poor; beautiful and ugly; happiness and the deepest human decay. <br /> <br /> Pixot is one of the films that dares to touch and open these painful wounds, and does so without a glimmer of hope, honestly portraying a country that, like Pixot itself, is already lost.
