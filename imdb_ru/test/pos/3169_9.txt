For me, the Storm and its characters (by which I mean wonderful) are like old friends. Since I first began to experience the game through acting lessons (I played Ferdinand), I immediately found myself in a fantasy world created by Shakespeare. I clearly remember how one student finally decided not to play Ferdinand, and therefore I went on stage and had the honor of playing with a great Miranda. <br /> <br /> One of the merits of a great friend is that you can never fully know them - there is always something that you can learn about their character. Thus, the film production “Storm of Quality” reminds a visit to an old friend, dear to heart: each visit opens up a new look at the memory of our work. The books of Prospero emphasized the ritual and elegance of the play, the stormy celebration of art in art. Here we see a vision of esoteric mysticism, with lovingly created interiors, full of candles and chalky floor charts, more Aleister Crowley than a Neapolitan nobleman. It also made me reconsider - why was Prospero expelled from Naples? His magical power is so tangible in this performance that the question arises whether it was just politics, Prospero's doomed exile, but rather the fact of his difference from his peers. So in the real world he suffered. Was expelled, powerless to change the wrong to the right. All the villains in this play, regardless of whether they realize it or not, act in accordance with the creation of a more painful, hellish world - in the interests of the oppressor, to make life on Earth closer to hell. But Prospero manages to transfer these earthly villains to his island, to the region where he has (absolute) dominance. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare brings his audience to the theater, an area where Shakespeare dictates events, words, outcomes. Shakespeare, of course, Prospero - but what makes this film adaptation of the film, which really honors the text, is to make Prospero such a sympathetic figure of such a mind, despite the fact that he is surrounded by what society calls irrational (astrological texts , alchemical symbols, magic diagrams, etc.). Is it wiser to be a man of clothing and murder, or to be a heretic and work on correcting mistakes? Prospero is a heretic because he refuses his magic not because the books lose their value in Naples, but because they are no longer needed — the world itself has become the magic of books. <br /> <br /> In Hamlet, Hamlet presents the play to his peers. The performance blames its fellows for conspiring against others for their own advancement. The reaction of the audience is different: while Ophelia is puzzled, Claudius reacts with a dazed shock. This happens in the play, and then Shakespeare performs this play for the people of his time. Shakespeare watched them react? In the storm, Prospero lives by the play he is building, and we live with her. How do we react? Do you respond with a simple delight at a happy ending? Are you upset and shocked by the strangeness of this production, which is fully consistent with the source material? Are you sad that this little life, the game, is filled with a dream just as transient as eternal? The tragedy is that Shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for the life of mankind on Earth, but man is weak and does not want to realize this in favor of a petty power struggle. We have Claudia. <br /> <br /> Like a good friend, this film is not without flaws. I do not agree with the choice to paint some scenes in blue. The sailors' dance is quite tangential. But deep down it really is a Storm and one of its many faces.
