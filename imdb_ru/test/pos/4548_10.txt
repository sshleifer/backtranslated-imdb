This film literally made me roll on the floor (well, at least on the couch), laughing. I did not think that I would like it, but one day he came on cable television, and I watched it all and enjoyed it completely. From then on, I also saw Black Sheep, which was pretty good, but not as fun as Tommy Boy.
