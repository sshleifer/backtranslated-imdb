Superman cartoon. <br /> <br /> When America represents its new colossal bomber, JAPOTEURS strikes, the elite power of Japanese spies and saboteurs. Kidnapping the monster with the fearless reporter girl Lois Lane on board and destination, either Tokyo or destruction, itâ€™s time for Superman to take part ... <br /> <br /> This was another one of a series of excellent cartoons originally created by Max Fleisher for Paramount Studio. They show excellent animation and tight, fast moving plots. Intended for display in cinemas, they are far ahead of their colleagues on Saturday mornings. Bud Collyer is the voice of Superman; Joan Alexander does honors for Lois Lane.
