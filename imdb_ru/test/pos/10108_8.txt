Perhaps I am one of the avid horror fans who think that the recent overload of Asian shockers is so exaggerated! Movies like "Ringu" or "Eyes" ?? who praise all over the world ?? just did not convince me, and they looked more boring than scary. Well, this stupid opinion does not apply to the South Korean pearl "The Tale of Two Sisters." This is a stylish and very complex psychological terror that REALLY gets under your skin! The plot, based on a local folk tale, may seem too confusing to include this film in the list of the greatest genre achievements of all time, but the atmosphere and the creation of tension, of course, evoke a feeling of great respect. This is one of those few films that cannot be named: the events in The Two Sisters qualify as a heartbreaking horror, as well as an intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait. In addition to the fascinating story, The Tale of Two Sisters also has all the wonderful elements that I think are usually missing from Asian horror films, such as compelling music, good acting, and innovative camera work. The mansion where family events take place is brilliantly illustrated as a truly eerie place where secrets and danger lurk behind every door. Several episodes (for example, a dinner with relatives or nightly performances in the room for girls) are largely uncanny. They really made me feel uncomfortable, and I really like to believe that I saw my share of terrible horror. “The Tale of Two Sisters” is a terrific movie adventure that must be seen by Asian movie fans. A little warning for people with a small amount of attention, however: this film makes you always focus your eyes and ears. This is also a film that requires multiple viewing, although no one will ever get it at 100%.
