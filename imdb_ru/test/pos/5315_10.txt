I enjoyed, appreciated, watch this movie again, because I am sure that there are subtleties that I missed. Wonderful cast, without excessive acting, cliché or plot. Uses a tragic event to reflect multiple Relationships, how those who are involved in each relationship are connected (or disconnected) and perception of life, what position everyone occupies in relationships, in life, and how they deal with Confusion, joy, resentment and frustration to discover that things are not what they perceived to be. At first I thought that there are “Observers” and “observables”, but this is not so, we are all somehow connected, and our perceived separation is only in small degrees. I recommend this film to anyone, especially teachers, social workers, religious counselors, and anyone who breathes.
