The theme of religion in the films of Bunuel is a question that needs to be analyzed, as a movie lover, as an art lover or as a person. The satirical Bunuel can be seen in “La Voie Lactée”, “Un Chien Andalou” or in “L'Age d'Or”. Very cruel and effective in his criticism, but when you saw it and then saw a movie like "Nazarin", after you saw this work, you started asking about its author. And many wondered about what seems to be a contradiction, according to Bunuel, but it’s better not to call him that, I think there’s no contradiction in his work, only that Buñuel’s religious point of view is very diverse and unique in films. <br /> <br /> This beautiful film is based on the novel by Benito Perez Galdos, who told us the story of Father Nazario, who lived a modest, simple life dedicated to God and helping everyone. He lived in a simple and poor region. There also lived Beatrice, who is insulted and abandoned wife. She does not find the meaning of her life without her cruel, courageous man. She kind of pushes him away. On the other hand Andara, one of the urban prostitutes. Nazario's father was stolen again; he accuses Andara's cousin. Andara hears this and tries unsuccessfully to fight a priest who does not believe in violence. That night, Andara discovered that her cousin was actually a thief, she stole her bells. Andara fights her cousin with terrible consequences. With this, Andara seeks mercy from the priest. Nazario decides to help her, knowing well that this may be against his church, it is obvious that this thing will have some consequences. Since Nazario is about to become a pilgrim. Without anything, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatrice want to be with him and be like him to serve God. <br /> <br /> If this is the sweetest film from the film “Bunuel” that I have seen so far, it is also the most spiritual one. Here it is clear that most people are confused by the contradiction, because here we don’t see Bunuel against the power of the church, we see Bunuel, whose film is about the church, but not in a typical - and magnificent - satirical sense, Whatever I do not think that the correct word is a contradiction, in fact I find it pleasant and well done, and despite the fact that it contains such religious questions (as well as its “Voie Lactée”), I found it rather spiritual film, but do not try to touch the diversity of the Catholic religion, as maybe he gala, and laugh at this in other films. "Nazarin" has the father of Nazario and his promising front of God and the same religion, but at the end all this is analyzed in the spiritual life of this man. <br /> <br /> Two other women, not a contrast, but also very good, two more perspectives of faith. First we have Beatrice, a mistreated woman who loses all faith in life, first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family. This little girl was very sick. Next to her was Andara, a prostitute administering justice. In the family of a child, just religious women, a great pain arises, but faith comes to Father Nazario when he does not come to this city with anything. He will bless the child, say later, she is fine. The priest wants to go further, but Beatrice and Andara have restored faith in life and want to devote their lives to God with Father Nazario. After some complaints, Nazario's father decides to be with them, finding out to the end how he relates to faith, God, religion and the person in need, people who have to beg for alms in order to survive. This last issue should be noted as one possible explanation for the end of the pineapple. In this ending, we listen to the drums (similar to “L'Age d'Or”) and father Nazario, going over, asking about it when he refuses the fruit for the first time and at the end decides to get it as a symbol of necessity or, maybe, in response to his spiritual path, which begins to be a priest. Meanwhile, two women have to pick up her father, Andara for his crime (Beautiful scene where she thanks the man who helps Nazari's father in prison, and then she damn it, the man who hit the priest in prison) and Beatrice because she prefers to be with her macho, despite the fact that he treats her badly, simply because she does not admit that she has fallen in love with a priest. Here, perhaps, is the only place in the film where the church is criticized — they go against the church, the religion it serves. <br /> <br /> Nazario's father is that (softly for many, but not for me) a critic for something in religion (Nazario’s father helps a woman who is guilty of committing a crime, sin), but most of all This is a Bunuel analysis of faith and life, and he really got it, with a beautiful, gentle, sweet and unforgettable film, which, without a doubt, is one of his best. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the errors ... well, if there is.
