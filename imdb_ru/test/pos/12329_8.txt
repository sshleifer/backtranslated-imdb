I have wonderful memories of this film ... <br /> <br /> I was only 12 years old when it was released, and it scared me to death. I really miss my Bezhesu ... <br /> <br /> Zombies, cemeteries, mausoleums, how can you be wrong? It is like a Phantasm retarded cousin. <br /> <br /> This film was released 1 year before the introduction of the PG-13 rating. <br /> <br /> I claim that One Dark Night is a GORIEST PG movie (not the worst thing, notice) that has ever been released. <br /> <br /> Can anyone come up with a more suitable choice? <br /> <br /> (For your information: I do not think Poltergeist is more dangerous ... Scarier, yes. But no more ...)
