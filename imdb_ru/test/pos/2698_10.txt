Here in Germany, the “King of Queens” has a great cult status! Almost every teenager (and adults) watch this comedy series. This is really cool! Better than other horrible American sitcoms, such as "Full House" or "Set by Step" (the only series that is still in order is "Al Bundy"). In Europe, there was not a single American comedy comedy series that was as effective as this really funny show !! Kevin James and Leah Remini as Doug and Carrie Haffernan are the craziest couple I know, Jerry Stiller as Arthur is the funniest grandfather I know, and Victor Williams and (especially) Patton Oswalt very different, but funny guys, I know. I watch it as often as I can, and I still lack a good mood!
