A great Trainspotting movie ... Being announced as Welsh Trainspotting, it’s also a twin city, although it’s in front of the street. <br /> <br /> Shoots a weekend in the life of Cardiff Clubbers, a good debut film with Kerrigan and some great plays in the cast. <br /> <br /> Go look! then go to the club
