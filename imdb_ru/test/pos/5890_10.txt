Veterans of the Great Patriotic War are returning home and it is difficult for them to adapt to civilian life. This superb drama is skillfully filmed by Wyler and perfectly filmed by the famous cinematographer Toland. Despite his nearly three-hour duration, he does not pull for a minute. In Sherwood's script, there are very human characters and excellent dialogue. Andrews is probably the best person to fight for to make ends meet. Wright is also good as a young woman sick of love, Mayo as Andrews' roving wife and real veteran Russell as a man who lost both hands. However, the main honors are Mart and Loy as a couple facing difficulties in re-acquaintance with each other.
