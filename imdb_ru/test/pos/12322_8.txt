Exquisite film. They just don't make them like that! We overhear a higher middle class family in Dublin at the beginning of the 20th century. After the Christmas dinner, they arrange for their friends and relatives. Their conversations at the table are just idle chatter, but they are so well written that everyone is absorbed. Away from the dining table, a beautiful piano playing helps to create an intimate atmosphere, as if you were one of the guests. Perhaps itâ€™s too perfect for an amateur, a strange mistake here and there would add the magic of this film. No real story, but real entertainment and visual lesson for novice directors.
