This fun diamond is rough. The acting and plot are not so impressive, but the lines continue to appear. It causes a lot of noise, because at first glance it seems like a bad movie, but itâ€™s so weird that you can't help wondering. Spastic lightning-fast dialog box and bizarre characters continue to develop it ... I especially liked Sharon, Kanak on Shwems, eh? However, the one who really stole the show was Richard Andrew's younger brother (Ira Hayden), his piercing nagging was somehow cute. The whole movie rocked.
