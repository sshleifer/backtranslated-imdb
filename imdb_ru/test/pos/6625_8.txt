Oh, this is a great job to be sure. In fact, in this film you can find some of the best scenes in the movie, or at least in the movie Bergman. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow are as good as one would expect. Do these two give bad performances? Sven Nykvist demonstrates the workshop, albeit unconventional, cinematography. The script is pretty good, especially in certain scenes. Sometimes the film lags behind, and the pace is uneven, although probably deliberately. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem? Well, the film is too dull for its own good. Bergman's other films are just as bleak, but not nearly as harsh. In the end, I just gave up and started to get a little annoyed. During the film, I was often strongly influenced, but in the end, I didnâ€™t feel involved. This is a great movie, but I doubt that I will ever see it again and will not offer my friends. Or, if I had proposed this, I would have been very sure to warn them of what was ahead. 8/10.
