I do not understand how people did not like this movie. You have Gossit Jr., the guy who played the main character in Stand By Me, Sean Astin and many other great actors. Lots of action and fun that you no longer see in today's movies. This is really a shame. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated film that is among other great films such as Let's Get Harry. In the 80s and early 90s, such wonderful films were created that would never surpass today's standards. <br /> <br /> They tried to somehow recreate this film in Masterminds, but they lacked a really bad game. The only thing that was filmed in the film is Patrick Stewart, but that was clearly not enough.
