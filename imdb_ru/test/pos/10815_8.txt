A terrific, fast-paced comic / drama / farce like chatter, against the backdrop of the 1939 French explosion. Played with wide-open eyes and an energetic face with the help of a talented actor and chobblock with action, satire, social commentary and authentic details of the period, from smooth shiny hairstyles and Marseille hairstyles to Citroen "Tractions", noisy soundtrack and a short but believable imitation Charl√© de Gaul and Marshal Peten. <br /> <br /> This is simply one of the best entertainment recently shown on the screen, devoid of presumption and "messages." If the films were trains (and in a locomotive that works, despite the absence of a locomotive - no doubt an expensive prop), then this would be a TGV.
