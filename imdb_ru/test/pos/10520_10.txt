These immortal lines begin with Jack D'Aret Brothers masterpiece Jack D'Art. The plot is centered around two blue-collar from West Virginia (Stacy Keach and Frederick Forrest) who are looting in hopes of using money to open a seafood restaurant !! What follows is a true adventure, followed by many comedic events. All action scenes are top notch and consist of well-implemented skirmishes. The latter of which is absolutely amazing and takes place in an abandoned building, destroyed by a destructive ball! The film was written by the now famous director Terrence Malick, and his early appearance is Margot Kidder. In general, an excellent hidden gem of the 70s and easily one of the best hybrids of comedy action films. I hope he gets a decent widescreen dvd soon.
