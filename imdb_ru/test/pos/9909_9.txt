I really liked this movie. For one, it had no banal special effects that have big budget films. The game was decent in this, only you can immediately say that it is duplicated, but as soon as you overcome this fact, and that you cannot switch languages ​​on the DVD version, it is cool. The storyline was very unique, you perceive the situation as a heat wave, very common throughout the world, especially in Frankfurt, where I have been many times, and you strike, which happens quite often in this country, and you have a road to disaster . I liked how the hordes of rats just walked everywhere, and as the idea that if you picked up litter, this is the last thing you want to do, you pick it up, the rats don't get what they want, they essentially follow the garbage collection, so that you well ask if the scavengers are on strike, who take out the garbage, private contractors, in any case, the military want to isolate from the city oh, what to do wrong, then you would have forced all the rats to seize the city fill her pockets, you will have a realistic film, and the female role is also a pleasure to look at on the screen, a very decent film, which, it seemed to me, wanted more were done in this way, another little niggle - the description of Frankfurt could be a little better, but for an ordinary viewer who has never been to Frankfurt. .. I was born in Germany and have been to Frankfurt many times ... he won "It doesn’t matter, but overall the thumb is up.
