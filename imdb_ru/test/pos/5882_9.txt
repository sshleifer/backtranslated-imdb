Although there is no wonderful drink counter at the local pharmacy, <br /> <br /> no longer exists, and clothing is definitely immediate. <br /> <br /> Postwar vintage, and good and evil are easy to understand, and <br /> <br /> those old airplanes are really dated, this film will never be dated. <br /> <br /> Human devices and problems of the post-war period, wonderful love stories, wonderful play of actors (especially Harold Russell and <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews) moving today in 2002, as in 1946. <br /> <br /> I was one of the young women who welcomed our wonderful house veterans since the Second World War. Like many, my memories of the <br /> <br /> war years and returning home today are as fresh as if they happened yesterday - this film is very relevant for our time.
