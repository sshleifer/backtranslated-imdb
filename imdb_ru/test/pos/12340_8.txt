ONE DARK NIGHT is a film with a big omission and a little-known film of the early 80s, which deserves the audience, which, I am afraid, it will never get, and it is a damn shame. I have seen this film compared to others, which have received a wider name over the years, especially PHANTASM, HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM. This film is very different from those, and I see no other comparisons besides a mausoleum, which is a bit like the one in PHANTASM, but not sufficient for real comparisons. I am not sure how this one slipped through without wider acceptance. Maybe it's all in marketing, I don't know. Perhaps the remake would have breathed new life into it if Raymar had not exhausted his whole life from this, that is. I'm not too good at all the remakes that are abundant in our days, but I think they work well with lesser-known films (except for the horrible remake of the GHOST SHIP, which, apart from the opening scene and the Mudwein's roar “Not Falling,” shit). Therefore, if the ONE DARK NIGHT remake falls into the right hands, I think it will make many people go see the original. I know what I do if there is a remake of the film that I have not seen before. I'm afraid anything other than a remake will not bring this film back to life. Unless, of course, Reimar sees this. <br /> <br /> In any case, ONE DARK NIGHT is what horror fans need to see, especially 80s horror fans (because we all know that then the best horror films were made). A terrible situation. Pretty good acting game. Very good story. Camp. What more could you want from the horror movie of the early 80s? What is it ... nudity and blood? It's a pity. There is no nude or dried blood in this film, but, nevertheless, it is still gorgeous! Solid 8 out of 10. Enjoy.
