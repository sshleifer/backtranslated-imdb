I saw fame when she first came out. This applies to the high school class of 1980, which coincided with my year of graduation. I saw the film in the summer between school and college, and, being the performer himself, he holds a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The greatest criticism of fame is usually related to continuity, and there are Definitely some plot lines that are either incomplete or have no meaning. Nevertheless, these problems are more than filled with the passion and emotions of the characters and the incredible music. <br /> <br /> I recently saw it again and was surprised that I still love it just like the first time. Glory is often compared to Flashdance, which I do not consider fair. Although there is great music in Flashdance, and Jennifer Beals is great, I think that Fame is far superior to its characters in the development and complexity of stories. For those who really love art, this film is a must see.
