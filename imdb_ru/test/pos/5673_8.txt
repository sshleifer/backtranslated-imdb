The film begins with three people playing on the weekend, who decide to first visit the crocodile farm, and then move on to an easier lesson - “fishing”. <br /> <br /> You pick up some interesting information about the crocodiles during their farm visits, and this information is enough to increase the waiting time during the film, as you remember what was said earlier. <br /> <br /> The action in the film is well calculated and not finished. The suspension is based on the principles of "what if", "unknown" and sometimes painful decisions that the characters make in the film. <br /> <br /> I wondered what I would do if I were in the same spirit. Boat, without pun intended. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film was really good, and the effects are realistic, believable and not overloaded, or the cartoons look and inappropriate, as you sometimes get with CGI. /> <br /> As a horror movie lover, I watch almost all the horror movies I can get in almost every genre, and this is one of the best crocodile horror films, if not the best one I have seen. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you will not be disappointed.
