I saw "In Pitch Black" on TV. and so I had to see it. I must say, I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> Not only did David Tuishyâ€™s style improve since he wrote Critters 2, this film caught my attention on Vin Diesel. Of course, he was there at Into Pitch Black, but here he was fierce, scary and intense. I have not seen such charisma since the time of Schwarzenegger in the 80s. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple, but the characters make this movie interesting. Then there was what happens to the female leader. Unexpected. Dark humor helps the film to move forward, the effects are not great, but when Riddick fights with the alien, he dropped all my complaints. <br /> <br /> Since then, Diesel has not done anything about this film, which I care about, but I look forward to continuing.
