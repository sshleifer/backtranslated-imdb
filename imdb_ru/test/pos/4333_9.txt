I could not agree more than with the comment left by “coldshitaction” and how this film is a masterpiece. I have never seen a movie in which my adrenaline flows like this movie, and it basically happened when Bronson runs out of the fire escape like M-60 and plows like 20 dudes from a gang, this is a genius. Quite possibly the best fighter ever made (without exaggeration), it really can be the best fighter ever shot. From the very beginning, you need to know that you want something sweet when the police let Bronson go and tell him to tell him to clear the slums. Once again, genius. And again Bronson is a bad ass. Paul Kersey is just as cool, maybe even better than John McClain or Terminator, he's just a bad ass. And what is more, the fact that he is a good guy buys some ice cream for the child and helps the old couple before he kills the bag of filth. genius. Highly recommended, if you hate this movie, you are crazy.
