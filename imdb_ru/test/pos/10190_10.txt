This program was included for a short period when I was a child, I remember watching it when I was eating fish and chips. <br /> <br /> At the end of the series about thrones telling about thrones, this series was in the style of streethock, male and the like, except for more computer ones. There was one disgusting child whose computer somehow created this guy - a machine gun. He will deal with crimes and everything else. <br /> <br /> All I really remember is his fashionable car and the little screaming cursor that used to draw the car and help him in general. <br /> When I mention this to anyone, they too can remember very little. Was it real or maybe a dream?
