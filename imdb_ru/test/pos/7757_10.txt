An online survey conducted by TV Asahi, an online survey of Japanâ€™s top 100 most popular animated series in 2006, put this series in fourth place. This tells you everything you need to know. So go and see;) I will not comment on the story, simply because I do not want to destroy anything. I only urge you to keep watching after you saw the first episode. The animation is really good and above average on TV. The best thing about this series is that something new has finally appeared. I mean, he is not innovative, but still he offers a fresh new idea and cute characters. You will not regret entering the world of Suzumiya Haruhi. <br /> <br /> and the best that will soon be in the movies
