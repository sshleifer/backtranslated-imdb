I am very impressed with the reviews I read about this film - usually well-read, thoughtful and informed - obviously, by people who love and think about movies. I couldn’t add anything to the excellent review work that IMDb members have already done. If I may, I would like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many reviews: Mr. Baseball was American and behaved ugly, but he was NOT an ugly American. The first ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the 1958 novel of the same name, Burdick and Lederer, and the complete opposite of Mr. Baseball. Homer was an American archetype and an archetype engineer — he traveled to Vietnam to work with people, he respected the people he met and loved them, he used suitable, sustainable technologies in collaboration with his masters, and they definitely loved and respected him because he was an example of democratic values ​​and American virtues. His deformity was purely facial, just skin; his personality and his humanity were deep and sincere. <br /> <br /> Mr. Baseball illustrates all the rude, ignorant, insecure rudeness that we Europeans and Americans so often inflict on other cultures; Homer Atkins, the ugly American, was the other side of our medal, representing our humanity and decency. I believe that the ugly Americans are still far superior to the Mister Baseballs; they are still our last, best hope.
