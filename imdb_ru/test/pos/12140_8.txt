This is a black and white film from France, <br /> <br /> A simple plot, a gangster on the run, looking for help, etc. We have seen this type of film many times over the years. Distinctive features of this film are his style and style. All the actors play quietly, Nobody screams, and hardly anyone loses his temper. There are quite a few deaths, some amazing. There are beautiful women, but no sex scenes. Also, do not need to chase cars. <br /> <br /> SIMPLY TALKING / It is so pleasant to listen to people's conversations, and here we also have to read subtitles. <br /> <br /> The game is almost perfect for everyone, especially the main role played by <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura and in the lesser BUT of the vital role of Jean Paul Belmondo. These 2 actors were among the best. <br /> <br /> I said above that the film has flaws, in several places there are several flaws in the script, they are minor, in this film the main thing is the acting. Production also comes first. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
