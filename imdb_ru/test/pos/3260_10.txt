Many years ago I watched this movie (maybe on TV?) And loved it. So I decided to rent it on a DVD the other day to see how much it still remains in my assessment. Did it. <br /> <br /> Located in the infamous Kings Cross district of Sydney (where prostitution, drug addiction and sex shops thrive), he tells the story of “Jimmy” (played by Heath Ledger). Jimmy is a young man ... maybe a late teenager or so, who did not have a stable family past. He is on the edge of society and works as a “sex shop” in a sex club (encouraging people to enter the store). He is aware of the essence of the underworld called Pando, which is a local giant on the Cross. He hopes that Jimmy will find himself on the Pando radar and fight him ... the shortest path to social mobility, he hopes. <br /> <br /> One night, Jimmy meets a beautiful young woman Alex (played by charming Rose Byrne). You just know that a love story is played out between them. That same night, Pando first contacted Jimmy (played by Brian Brown). Pando has a “job” for Jimmy. This is the “foot in the door” that Jimmy was waiting for! <br /> <br /> Revealing too many things would spoil the many surprises this film has prepared for the viewer. Stylistically, if you like the films of Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie, you should be tuned in on what to expect ... turns and a black comedy. <br /> <br /> What's so great about this film is his “Australian” -ness. This is not just a fake Tarantino or Richie, but a true Australian contribution to the genre. <br /> <br /> An interesting aspect of this film is how it all fits together. Sometimes you are introduced to characters you wonder why the hell they do there. In the end, all these "free ends" beautifully connected. This is something like a mobius celluloid tape. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is the character of Pando Brian Brown. Pando loves puzzles, and it's interesting to see him play games with his friends. These are the small details revealed about him that are so pleasant ... his musical taste, for a start! <br /> <br /> From the Heath Ledger films I've seen (The Dark Knight, 10 Things I Hate in You) This is probably his best role. Was not taken from the "10 things." If you're a Heath Ledger fan (Ledger recently died tragically, by chance), this is a chance to see him in his greatest Australian role, I think. There is a lot of chemistry in this film between Ledger and Byrne, so that, on one level, it functions as a pleasant love story. <br /> <br /> There are no horror films about the underworld Tarantino and Richie in this film, but it has some adult themes ... scenes that surprise you with its coldness and beauty. In this sense, this is not an ideal film for very young viewers, but this is not a film that will please both hounds. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to say that it’s great that Australia can make such great films. Usually the films that make my home country may be uninteresting. This film has strengths, where many Australian films have weaknesses ... i.e. He has a great story, great acting and a great script. We need more popular and high-quality films like this to make here in Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. Other Australian films I loved include: <br /> <br /> Breaker Morant (10/10) Mad Max 2 (10/10) My brilliant career (not yet reviewed by me) Proof (nr) The Devil's Playground (nr) A year broke my voice (nr) Bad Boy Bubby (nr. Gorgeous dark comedy) The Dish (nr. Gorgeous charming comedy)
