“Frogs who wanted a king or a frog” is the most instructive story of Ladislav Starevich about people who want the government to solve their problems I have ever seen. The irony is that they pray to god Jupiter for their answers. In response, Jupiter sends a stump, and then a stork. None of them work, and the stork is especially dangerous for amphibians! Frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashion of the day, and we see some taking pictures or using a movie camera when a stork arrives! As I said, this short text is a political allegory, more suitable for adults than for children. In fact, I first saw it on Vhs Rhino, on which was the Bambi Meets Godzilla. This alone should tell you what to expect here!
