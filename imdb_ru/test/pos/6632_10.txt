Shame is the pinnacle of a master's career. Ingmar Bergman penetrates, an existential study of a couple on the island of Gotland, surviving a long war. Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow give painfully detailed ideas in this spare, harsh drama. The intensity of the films is based on the fact that Bergman focused our attention on the smallest, intimate relationships of his two characters - both experienced musicians - in the trap of a landscape that they no longer understand. We see how the external pressure of war complicates and destroys their relationship. Both characters are compelled by the material circumstances of the war to betray their own sense of ethics. In one of the strongest episodes, Bergman makes us think about the manipulative power of the cinematographic environment, showing us a film interview with the character Ullman, which was edited and distorted for the political effect of one of the parties to the conflict and used by the other side as evidence of war crimes interrogations. <br /> <br />
