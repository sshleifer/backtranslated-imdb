“Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what else?” Kermit poses this relatively simple double question at the beginning of Cinema Muppet, performing his own song “The Rainbow Connection”. Over time, the question and the film only gain depth. <br /> <br /> I'm going to refuse to review this film as a children's comedy, but instead look at it as a classic for each generation, to love with serious ideals and a benevolent message, which is getting warmer every year. <br /> <br /> As the milestones in my life pile up on me, I hear more and more evocative of this elementary handful and realize that he can fit the soundtrack into someone’s life because we all dreaming. And this is what this film is about. This is not just a group of puppets - it is a group of puppets who have the power to fulfill their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> And although the humor and fun of the movie always feel good, they are not an honest judge of the film. Only "Rainbow Communication" and powerful emotions she can realize. And it all fits: “Rainbow Connection” * is a Muppets film, and vice versa. This existentialism meets children's entertainment - there is no easier way to describe it.
