Some time ago we read about the results of a survey conducted by some newspaper journalists. There were only two questions asked, and they were brief and appropriate. <br /> <br /> Question 1 asked the respondent to say who his favorite football team was in college. Question number 2 asked the fan to name his most hated college football team. The answer to both questions was simple, Notre Dame! ND - tops in both lists! Yes, love them or hate them, but you definitely do not ignore them. <br /> <br /> The roots of this unique position of this independent college football center are in the life and career of one of them. an adult, little Norwegian immigrant from Chicago named Knut Rokn. <br /> <br /> As a biopic, the production of the film KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-American (1940), came out relatively close to the death of trainer Rockn. in a 1930 plane crash. It took about 10 years after the film was released. This would mean that the preliminary work on the project began approximately 8 years after our country lost Mr. Rockn. <br /> <br /> His likeness and voice were well known from newspapers, radio and movies. Both Knut's Widow, and Bonnie Skills Rockn, and the University of Notre Dame had the right to endorse the choice of actor for the lead role and to approve the script. We think they could not do a better job. Pat O'Brien really looks like he was a college football player. Ronald Reagan starring George Gipp **, a free-spirited student heading to Notre Dame for a baseball scholarship! He was a football lover. <br /> <br /> The cast is full of talented players. We have a veteran Griffith, Donald Crisp in the role of Fr. Callaghan, C.S.C., President of Notre Dame. Albert Basserman - about. Newland, professor of chemistry and mentor Rockney. Gail Page appears as Mrs. Bonnie Skills Rockn. Owen Davis, Jr. is Rockney Cohort, Gus Dorays (passer-by in this historic ND vs. ARMY game at West Point). <br /> <br /> Starring Kane Richmond, Nick Lukatz, William Marshall and William Byrne in the top four. Riders. Real Big Time college coaches Howard Jones, Pop Warner, Bill Spalding and Amos Alonzo Stagg perform in Congress Sports Probe scenes at College Sports and add an authentic touch. <br /> <br /> With regard to the biopic “KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-American!”, all that can be said is that it works from scratch and does not slow down from start to finish. There is also no lost time. All time screen is used to promote the story. <br /> <br /> Using the Choir of Notre Dame, the Campus itself and all this music in the spirit of a brass band - all this creates the feeling that you are really there. *** <br /> <br /> * On this day, despite the fact that their basketball team and other sports teams compete at the Big East conference, Notre Dame remains independent at NCAA Football. What this means is that in essence the “Fighting Irish” play according to the national schedule. <br /> <br /> ** There was no such agreement with the family of George Gipp. Several years ago there was a lawsuit in which the young Mr. Hipp portrayed the famous “Win ​​Onr For The Gipper Speech”. Television reproductions of this film “KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMEICAN” were a minus of a performance on the stage of the bed of death. <br /> <br /> *** Other thematic films of Notre Dame have been made over the years. In the "Spirit of Notre Dame" ("Universal", 1931) J. Farrell MacDonald was the coach of Rockney. It was also attended by Lew Ayers, Andy Devine and Nate Pendleton, as well as members of the real Notre Dame Championship teams with the participation of the Real Four Horsemen. Then, of course, we have RUDY (Tri-Star 1993) with Sean Astin, John Favreau, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton, among others, in an excellent line-up. There was also talk of an unauthorized film criticizing Notre Dame called GOLDEN GLORY, but nothing happened, was it? (Let me know, dear reader, THANK YOU !!) <br /> <br /> **** Warner The brothers always had great music, both in the initial themes and in random music. In this movie of Rockne, they included the song NOTRE DAME FIGHT SONG into the score. Along with this were STEP NOTRE DAME and NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, which premiered at the Roque funeral in 1930 in the Basilica of Notre Dame.
