This film is so wonderful that it captures the gaming life. I laughed so much watching it. The film tells about the game group, which is experiencing difficulties with the campaign, which was invented by their dungeon master. The film switches from the real world and the game world, when they play the campaign, it shows them in the game world as their character, and then switches back to the real world when they are not playing. The campaign is the basis for the module that the Underground Master writes, Lodge. The problem is that the Lodge cannot complete its module, because the characters cannot complete the campaign. They are more for murder and robbery, but not for role-playing games. Lodge wants them to play in a role-playing campaign something they have never done before. They decide to bring some extra help to bring, wait, a girl to play. Lodge also makes an NPC, non-player character, a paladin who cannot testify or do wrong to play. The film is about how they all do it, and I don’t want to ruin the film anymore, so I’ll not say more This film may not be a budget film, acting may not be worthy of an Oscar, but if you are fond of games or playing in dungeons and dragons, then be sure to watch it. They had a lot of fun doing this movie, and it shows that I’m not going to shoot it because of a movie problem, such as continuity, or because it was a low-budget movie, it’s just fun. There is some kind of comedy with a stick that I like, and, in my opinion, a damn good job. So if you want a funny movie, try it.
