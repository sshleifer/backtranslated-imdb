The film is a wonderful, very thoughtful watch. I think this is a film about how you would be if you lived in a world created from catalogs. All scenes are the perfect reproduction of the Ikea catalog, they even watch furniture on TV. When they burst into the kitchen, they bump into another beautiful picture of how the kitchen will look in the catalog. When he is reborn or whatever you want to call it, he returns to the harsh reality of life. I love a little when he says his new love, he left his partner. It makes fun of commercial bliss, saying that you can have it all, and at the same time it's nice to have the same things, but some things you donâ€™t want to share. A film without children also, according to Say, makes for a perfect dozen.
