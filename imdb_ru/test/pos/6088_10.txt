Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) had just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. He is terribly burned out of ambush. His nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) takes care of him, of body and mind, because she is absolutely rightly afraid that he can be a very worried soul. In the course of his care, the count begins to tell Hana about his recent past. He seems to have worked in a government capacity in Africa, where he met a beautiful married woman named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Catherine called him quitting, leaving the count empty. However, these two will meet again in heartbreaking circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana herself falls in love with this woman in the British bomber team. And yet the war rages tirelessly. Can love exist when the world is in turmoil? This is a terrific movie based on an equally beautiful, but complex novel. The plot has many plot lines, which are perfectly woven, each of them is sharp beyond any description. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is gorgeous as a burn victim and as a person who thought love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also pretty good as a woman who fights her passions. As for Binoche, she deservedly deserved Oscar, who was introduced to her, as her nurse is a vivid example of hope in a hopeless situation. The landscape is absolutely magnificent, as are the costumes, the direction and the production. If you missed watching this movie, fix it very soon. The English Patient will remain one of the greatest achievements in the cinema for centuries.
