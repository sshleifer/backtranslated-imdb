I am a big fan of the legendary director Elia Kazanskaya. His films often concern people trying to overcome their weaknesses. Whether it is obsessive love in “Splendor in the Grass”, poverty in “The Tree Growing in Brooklyn” or racism in the “Gentlemen's Agreement”. In search of other films made by Kazan, I came across a film based on the novel by Arthur Miller. In a film called Focus, William H. Macy (one of my favorite actors) and Laura Dern were filmed. It deals with anti-Semitism in a very realistic way. <br /> <br /> Macy's character seems to agree with the fanatics in his area and at work, until it affects him personally. This is the key ... the reason why he acted was not that he knew that it was wrong, and he wanted to take a position, he acted because now he was considered an outsider, and he began to experience the same views the same remarks and as cruel as Mr. Finklestein (David Paymers). <br /> <br /> The film is very well written and well played. Meatloaf plays a great dirty bag! Both Macy and Sod are great! In life, it is easier to go together than go against. Sometimes in order for people to take their position, things must influence their lives or the lives of their loved ones ... Only then will some find their moral compass.
