Just borrowing the DVD Series 1 collection from my somewhat obsessed brother, I expected to go through the first couple of episodes and transfer them back. I just discovered that I was screaming on the screen about the end of the first season on the coat hanger — just a week later, and I was watching the whole season. Where I found time for this, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> This is a great show. He does not take himself too seriously, he has nice characters that work well, and the special effects (ignoring the strange and tasteless doll here and there) are “special” enough to give it a sophisticated look. At first I did not realize that it was filmed mainly here, and it was strange to hear so many Australian accents on a science fiction show - for the main character (John) it was very funny to return to Sydney halfway through season one. <br /> <br /> I believe that the strongest side of this show is the vision that the creators of the show obviously had. They gradually introduce new aspects of the characters that explain the previous actions, and continue to mix John’s conversations with slang in a fun and unconstrained way. On top of that, after watching the entire Voyager and Next Gen series, I see a little plot robbery - so he managed to keep his sense of originality throughout the first season. Hope everything else is just as good. <br /> <br /> Farscape is not like any other fantastic film that I used in the past. I heard that the fourth season was not as good as the first three, and now I am very unhappy that they canceled it before the 5th. I hope that they will revive this show - with the same actors in a movie or another TV series. It would be a shame to leave so many storylines unfinished, as I imagine that with the show, in which so many thoughts were invested, that removing it without proper warning will leave me alone. <br /> <br /> go ... go back to my brother to break season 2. <br /> <br /> V.
