I borrowed three Sarah films from my friend and watched them while I was sick in bed for the weekend. I thoroughly enjoyed each of them. I liked how the last movie gave an idea of ​​what Caleb and his sister were when they grew up. In addition, I liked the transfer of the song “Billy Boy”, which was first performed during the credits of the first film called “Sarah, Plain and High”. However, one thing in the End of Winter that I didn’t like was the youngest daughter. She was a very cute little girl, but she had too much spirit, and she looked like a brat compared to other children, even compared to the talkative, but still good-natured Caleb when he was younger.
