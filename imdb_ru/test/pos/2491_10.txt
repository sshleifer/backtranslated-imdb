To think that this film was made the year when I was born. To think that people are still deprived of their constitutional rights, now in the name of "national security." To think that this film was intentionally banned by the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK closes the political gap in the United States better than any film I've ever seen. If it were more widely noticed, would it change anything? Such a film is so polarized that it can cause turmoil. It shakes you up and makes you take sides. This puts you before the question: are you up for the national right to dissent during the war or for violating the constitution in the name of “national security”? The government forces the main characters to race to the American flag in a game that undermines the very ideals behind which this flag stands. The game is completely convincing. So much so that I do not see any game here at all. If this is a documentary screenplay, it is more convincing than any reality show on television today. PUNISHMENT PARK, arguably the most important film ever made. It really makes you think.
