The anti-war musical "Hair" is my cult film number one. I don’t know how many times I saw this movie in cinemas and on VHS, or how many times I listened to a CD with an amazing soundtrack, and now this masterpiece has finally been released on DVD in Brazil. br /> <br /> A Pacifist and moving story is still amazing: the anthem of freedom, friendship and freedom of choice, as well as the image of resistance to a generation against the stupidity of war. I do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of counterculture of the 70s and their dreams, because the current world is probably worse than in the 70s. I don’t remember who won the Oscar in 1979, but Street Williams and John Savage deserved at least a nomination for their amazing performances. Beverly D'Angelo is extremely gorgeous in the role of a hypocrite-spoiled teenage upper class. I’ve seen Hair, probably more than twelve times, and my eyes always get wet when Berger walks up to the plane with the song “It's me, it's me, it's me,” and I start crying with his headstone at the cemetery. I think this is one of the most beautiful, sad and touching conclusions in the history of cinema. My wife, my daughter and my son also love this film; therefore, I can guarantee that “Hair” is timeless and recommended for any audience. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Hair"
