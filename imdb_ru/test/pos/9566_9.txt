This film is not a comedy, it is a revelation. I always hated dog shows, given the ridiculous outfits in which people put their dogs, and the idiotic names they give them. Hence the reason for my uncontrollable giggles while watching this movie. I enjoy the fact that something is taken so seriously, even though the gain is small and insignificant. It's like miniature golf, a championship in jumping rope or the need to set some kind of incomprehensible world record. The acting in this film was much more subtle than “Waiting for Guffman,” and this is mainly due to the greater mobility of the characters, who seem more pleased with their particular partners in this film than the previous one. Eugene Levy was great, like Michael Mackin and Fred Willard. However, it was the dogs that eventually stole the show. But again, who wants to see a group of people in a movie about dogs anyway.
