This is one of the best TV movies I have ever seen! The name makes it so obvious and predictable, but come on, all television movies are like that! <br /> <br /> The story is fantastic. This may seem ridiculous, but at the core lies an incredibly true story. Gary Cole plays a military man named Dave, who feels trapped in his marriage. He abandons his wife and children and then fakes his death! Everything so that he could be with Alison (Karen Syllas). How far will Dave go to keep his secret? <br /> <br /> Top level acting for television films. Gary Cole especially holds the film together as a charming, calm sociopath who has the answer to all questions when his wife becomes suspicious. Karen Sillas is trying her best as a wife, who discovers that her husband is a Liar and does not know what to do with it. Teddy Siddall, whom I consider to be Gary Cole's wife in real life, plays her part well, especially when she cries for her husband's "death". Wendy McKenna adds a nice touch like Sister Alison. Linda Goranson is gorgeous in her little role as Dave's mother. <br /> <br /> Predictable, but the game and the story take this film up a few steps.
