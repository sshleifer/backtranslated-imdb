I never remember me reading Sarah, Plain and Tall at school, but when my son told me about it and said that they were watching a movie in class, I also wanted to watch it. I borrowed a video from the library and watched it with my whole family. It was a great story. However, a few months ago I did not know that there were more. I finished watching these this week. I found one little oops: in the second film, The Lark, Jacob recalls when he was a boy, and he says to Sarah: "My brothers and sisters, and I will dream ...". In The End of Winter, these “brothers and sisters” do not exist in conversations between Jacob and his father. But this is a very small oops, and I caught him only during the trilogy for the second time. Great movie that you definitely need to watch for a good, healthy family viewing.
