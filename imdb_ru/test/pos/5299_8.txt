I recently watched this movie and decided to comment on it. <br /> <br /> The best way to watch this movie is to not expect what you saw in the past Miyazaki. Miyazaki is well known for his work on Spirited Away and the moving castle of Howl. good for western viewers anyway. Both films were similar to each other, but at the same time completely different. However, Ponyo is a completely different type of story and animation. <br /> <br /> The story pursues the "Ponyo", a fish with the face of a girl. After Ponyo runs away from her home at the bottom of the sea, she discovers a whole new world that she never suspected, as well as new troubles, when she was almost caught by a fishing boat, she was saved by a five-year-old boy, known as Sousuke. <br /> <br /> The story follows both of them and the pure friendship between the boy and the fish. Can Pono really stay with Sosuke forever? <br /> <br /> I feel that the film was inspired by The Little Mermaid and at the same time is similar to Tonari no Totoro. <br /> <br /> The film is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this film. But the characters are fish and a little boy, so how much do you expect to learn about them? The film is about 3 days, so I think the film is so short. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I hope you all enjoy this movie.
