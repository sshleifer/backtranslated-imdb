I have to say that when it comes to adapting a book to a film, the BBC rarely lets me down. Now about this mini-series. I love the Starling novel, it is by far the best murder / riddle I've ever read. Mini-series, he pointedly made my day when I saw him. The primary story has been kept almost unchanged. The characters very well coincide with the heroes of the novel, the personalities and manners were for Red and Jez. I thought Duncan was very good, like Kate, Eric seemed too simplistic, he had a little more depth in the book, but they also changed his subtext, so he might have to deal with it. Of course, there are changes, but most of them are cosmetic, but something I disappointed, the subtext with the Eric murder charge was changed, and it changed the whole dynamic between Rad and Eric for the film, and they turned off Triathalon Jez's training session. Some other events in the book are modified for ease of viewing. In general, if you like the book, you will like it, if you like a mini-series, then you will like the book. I must say that this is the most accurate adaptation of the book to the film that I have ever seen.
