I promised that if someday I leave a comment that will be less than complimentary, then I will feel differently later, I will return and report my opinion change. While this is the first time this has happened. <br /> <br /> I'm really starting to enjoy the hack. Something has clearly changed. The plot lines seem much stronger. The plot may still be a bit surreal, but the characters have developed so much depth that the surreal plot can be forgiven. I attribute this to a wonderful game. <br /> <br /> Not every show can come out of the starting gates as a winner. Some need time to pick up speed. I am glad that I continued to watch this program, and I very much hope that it lasts.
