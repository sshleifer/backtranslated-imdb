My first review in IMDB, after several years of continuous use of this site ... <br /> <br /> In any case, I saw it in the pipe last night, I really liked it. It is in the mind of a Dangerous Mind or Substitute, but much better. For a moment, I was sure that Rex was Speed ​​Levich in “The Awakening of Life”, but after checking it is not so. <br /> <br /> I understand why many people have problems with this plot and its poetry, but I also think that these people are not far. Admittedly, the ending was not exactly what I had hoped for, but overall it was so unique and good that I could not complain. I would not call it stupid, as one reviewer did, he came out better than most 80s films. And they refrained from performing any really relevant music of the 80s. <br /> <br /> I can't remember everything that made me smile when I saw it, but basically it really showed very creative people surrounded by mediocrity, and whether I share rex beliefs or not, I love the original attempts to describe meaning of life. And his theory of Mutants, as far as I know, is original. He also wandered a lot, but they showed how confused he was and why he might have psychological problems. And then, in moments of clarity, he was an outstanding philosopher, a man who noticed small details in life and tried to express them. <br /> <br /> I was also very impressed with John Savage as a teacher. Usually the actors do not cope with this role. He coped brilliantly with this. <br /> <br /> If you liked “Awakening Life,” I say, watch this movie if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> pk
