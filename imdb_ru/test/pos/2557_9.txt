Alejandro Polanco, abbreviated to Ale, works in a car body repair shop in the so-called Iron Triangle, worn out twenty blocks from car parks and dirty car repair dealers near the Shea Stadium in Queens, New York. Here, customers are not wondering whether parts come from stolen cars or why they can get such big discounts, they just save their money and hope that everything will grow and grow. Mucous outskirts like these are not covered in guidebooks, but Iranian-American filmmaker Ramin Bakhrani puts them on display at Chop Shop, a powerful indie film that last year was very fond of in Cannes, Berlin and Toronto. In continuation of his famous “Pushing People Cart,” Bakhrani spent a year and a half in a place that F. Scott Fitzgerald called the Great Gatsby “the valley of ashes.” <br /> <br /> In spite of all its gloom, Chop Shop is not the work of social criticism, but, like the Pixote of Hector Babenko, a piercing study of a character in which the survival of a young boy is bought at the cost of his innocence. Filmed on the spot at Villets Point in Queens, Bakhrani makes you feel as if you were there, sweating in the hot and humid New York summer with all its noise and chaos. The film focuses on the charming street 12-year-old Ale, who lives on the edge without any support or supervision from adults other than his boss (Rob Sovulsky), the real owner of the Iron Triangle garage. The performance of Polanco is rough and slightly ragged, but he fully deserves a standing ovation, which he received at the premiere of the film in Cannes, along with the embrace of the great Iranian director Abbas Kiarost. <br /> <br /> Closely in the cramped room above the garage with her 16-year-old sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales), who distributes food from the station wagon for lunch, El resembles one of the interchangeable spare parts with which he deals. Although he dreams of having his own catering van, in a city that never sleeps, he knows that the only thing that the “top of the heap” can do is another battered wing. In this environment, El and Isi use any means necessary to keep their heads above the water, while their love for each other remains constant, and they still laugh and play the childhood that never was them. As Barack Obama says in his book “Dreams from my father,” a change can happen later when their eyes stop laughing and they turn something off inside. Meanwhile, Ale complements his earnings by selling candy in the crowded New York subway along with his friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata) and selling DVD bootlegs on the streets, while Isi does tricks for truckers to save enough money to buy rusty $ 4,500 van in which they hope to start their own business. <br /> <br /> Ale is a “good boy,” he is not shy about stealing wallets and caps in the parking lot of the Shi stadium - events that Bakhrani’s camera is watching. without judgment. At Chop Shop, Bakhrani provided a compelling antidote to the success stories of losers created by a Hollywood dream factory, and gave us a film of stunning naturalism and respect for their characters, in many ways similar to the great Italian films of neorealists. and recent Iranian work by Kiarostami, Panahi and others. Although the outcome of the characters is far from indisputable, Bakhrani ensures that at Shea Stadium we see a giant billboard that says “Make dreams come true”, leaving us a hint that, according to Rumi, “the drum of realization of this promise beats”
