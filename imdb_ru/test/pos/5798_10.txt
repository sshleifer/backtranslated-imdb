One of the main aspects of “Little Faith” (in English, “Little Faith”) is that it was the first film from the Soviet Union that showed the sex scene, though short. The name is important: “Faith” is the Russian word “faith”, meaning that punk Faith (Natalya Negoda) believes little in the Soviet system. And, as the film shows, there is no particular faith in this. The opening scene shows the gloomy industrial city of Zhdanov, almost hellish on earth. When the lover of Faith Sergey (Andrei Sokolov) moves with his family, this leads to unexpected events. <br /> <br /> As in many Russian films, the names of people describe their characters. For example, there is Victor (remember that “winner” means winner). Overall, this is a good look at the Soviet Union when it collapsed, and we can see why it collapsed. Really good.
