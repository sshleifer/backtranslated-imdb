From any category it is a crazy movie, even in modern standards. This film, shot entirely in a shitty frame, will amaze you (and something else!). <br /> <br /> Magnificent bad taste and carelessness. The dialogue is incredibly quick and polite. You will either love or hate this film, but do not give up. I saw it 4 times and really love it. The divine wants to be the dirtiest man of all, but her rivals are also in this obscene and disgusting (but ridiculous) and stylish little film. <br /> <br /> The divine was phenomenal, and “she” will always be sorely missed. Edith Massey performs an unforgettable performance in the role of "egg-laying" and do not forget, the energetic Mink stole! <br /> <br /> Über crazy s ** t! <br /> <br /> It is also recommended for sick little puppies; <br /> <br /> Women's problems <br /> <br /> Desperate life <br /> <br /> Polyester
