Wines and redemption are the two main emotions and plot elements of heavy, powerful dramas that Oscars love so much (which is quite funny, because “Running Serpent” was nominated only for “Best Original Score”), perhaps the lack of nominations is unfair). While most book adaptations (or any other means) tend to be inferior to their literary counterparts (and “The Running Snake” is NOT an exception), the adaptation of the Mark Forster film is good. <br /> <br /> Most people are familiar with the story, the book has been read by millions, so I will not go into the plot, except to say that the book remains faithful enough to its source. However, if you do not know the plot, watch a movie or, even better, read a book. <br /> <br /> The best that “Running Serpent” has (besides his story)) is directed by Mark Forster. Forster is a director with a grand scale and a unique vision that is beautifully used to bring Khaled Hosseini’s book to the screen. A small part of me was worried that he would use the same dreamy images that were included in one of Forster’s early search for Neverland. Don't get me wrong, “In Search of the Neverland” is a wonderful movie, actually one of my favorites, but there is no place for visual deception. Fortunately, Forster understands this, and the brilliance of its direction shows its versatility. Although the absence in the nomination “Best Director” for his work here is not quite a parody, I see that in the future there will be many statuettes waiting for him. <br /> <br /> Also worth noting is the adaptation of the script. He remains loyal to the source, but leaves room for Forster to interpret the material. The dialogue has not stalled, and this. together with the direction of Forster, moves at a solid pace. Like Forster, the lack of recognition during the awards for the script was not an insult, but I would not complain if he were at least nominated. <br /> <br /> The dividing line between this film and the outstanding lie with acting skills. Most of the performances are solid, but there are those that do not quite fit, and this harms the film. The most noticeable weak performance is Zekeria Ebrahimi, who plays the young Amir. It’s not that bad, it’s just not as effective as it could be. He simply cannot express the guilt that absorbs Amir, the audience. In fact, I think I might be a little lost at this point in the film if I had not read the book because of this. He looks grim and sometimes offended, but we cannot feel his emotions. This is the difficult part to portray, and for the most part the young Ebrahimi holds his own, which is especially surprising since this is his first movie role. <br /> <br /> The best performances come from Khalid Abdullah, who plays an adult Amir and Sean Toub, who plays the wise Rahim Kahn. Abdullah may not be a well-known name (although he was in Paul Greengrass's United 93), but his work here is amazing. He is a quiet, modest person, and he is very good when it’s needed. An actor with a lesser ability could turn Rahim Khan's character into a cliché, but Sean Taub uses enough subtlety and caution in his game to create what the cliches are trying to portray. <br /> <br /> Forgive me if I speak here, but this is what I have to decide, and this is a PG-13 movie rating. The fact that this film has received such a low rating is outrageous. There is no excuse for this. Some may argue that the rating was bent due to the fact that it had to be seen by everyone, such as, for example, in the movie “Salvation of Private Ryan”, which, according to some, should have given the film NC-17 rating. But this exception cannot be applied here. The only purpose the scene serves is to tell a story. Forster (probably ordered by the producers) struggled to tame the most painful and disturbing scene of the film so that the film slipped with a PG-13 rating, but the subject matter is too disturbing to be portrayed in any way and get less than R rating , no matter how "tasteful" you can portray. Worse, this editing takes away most of its power from the scene, and trying to make it less disturbing to get a lower rating is offensive. In addition, some scenes of violence are also incredibly disturbed. From the point of view of how much time these scenes take in the film, this does not add much, but the fact that there is completely worthy of the R rating, at least. The MPAA, whose rating movie system has always been corrupt, dropped to a new low, giving this film a low rating. <br /> <br /> But you don’t have to blame the film. The film is a solid film that is worth seeing, especially if they are fans of the book.
