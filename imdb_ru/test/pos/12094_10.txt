Turkish culture is full of many different cultures. different cultures have different styles of music. Istanbul is like a turkey mix. he has basically the same language, but different dialects. This documentary shows us different kinds of music with different dialects and different instruments. You can watch reports with singers and groups, their performances, their daily lives and learn their thoughts about music. The film tells not only about the music of Istanbul, but also about life in Istanbul, about how people communicate, what they eat and drink. The most amazing thing is that although I live in Istanbul, I learned a lot from this film.
