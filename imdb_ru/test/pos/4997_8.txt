There were some harsh criticisms about the Comanch Moon on IMDb. I think this is for three reasons. First, the purists are disappointed that the mini-series is not at all like a book. Secondly, it’s not as good as the original Loneome Dove. Finally, people like to complain about IMDb, and the greatest films in the world will have bad comments. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that no film will be as good as a book. The way it is. The lonely pigeon was not as good as the novel on which it was based. In addition, in the film "The Lonely Pigeon" something is not mentioned and not switched. It's just like in the movie. So this is a useless argument when I look at the Comanche moon. <br /> <br /> I agree that she is not as good as the original dove. But hey, nothing. I know people who are guided by their lessons, which they learned from Dove. If I were going to compare every book I read, the film I watched and the TV I watched Lone Pigeon; I would be forever miserable. <br /> <br /> This is a mini-series work based on the prequel to “Lonely Dave” (novel) and the continuation of “The Dead Man’s Walk”, and this is what you get. This is the best TV I have seen in recent years. This is a fun game for Lonely Pigeon. We learn about the history of the Rangers, whom we learned and loved in Golub. Zahn does an amazing job of recreating Gus McCray. Elizabeth Banks and Linda Fornelli (sp?) Also do an excellent job with the creation of characters that will help fill the past of rangers and newts. <br /> <br /> If / when it happens again, I promise you will like it more than some awkward reality show.
