It’s a pity that they showed palm trees that couldn’t be more inaccurate for Connecticut in October ... it was filmed in New Zealand ... This Martha Moxley affair was “cold” for 20-25 years ... her family worked hard , to save him, and when Mark Furman decided that he did not want to be remembered only for his involvement in the Nicole Simpson affair ... which could damage his reputation (if it were not already) ... In any case, he followed as the police tried to get enough information to write a book. ... with the help of memories, we can see the relationships that Martha has formed .... The unattended boys who came of age without the help of their mother, and the father who has always been fixated ... <br /> <br /> Plus the fact that they portray the real Martha, as if she was a movie star ... she was a sweet, pretty girl next door. In addition, the other characters were really great, especially John Foster and Toby Moore, who played Michael Skakel and Tommy Skakel, respectively. They were also good, customers had to keep it all in the style of the 70s and go back to the 90th .... <br /> <br /> This continued to interest me, even when I found out about the guy Skakel .. ..
