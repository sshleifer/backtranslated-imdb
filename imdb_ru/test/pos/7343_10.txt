Somehow, somewhere, somewhere .. You MUST see this movie. Breathtaking antennas and incredible outstanding performances from highly talented actors. You think that Cirque du Soleil is amazing, wait until you see what these two women are doing - most importantly, the emotional journey and struggle of Jane (Dray Weber) are universal to many women. A superbly filmed movie about the complexities of relationships and how to hold on until you are ready to let go. This masterpiece will affect both women and men. Ned Far (director / writer) and ridiculously talented Dreyya Weber (star / producer) just dared to say it, honestly and sincerely. This film will be a great success - watch it HOWEVER you can - or you will not be “in the know” when it becomes one of the most discussed films.
