GOLDEN DOOR (NUOVOMONDO) for this viewer is the best film of the year to date. This is a masterpiece of concept, writing, directing, acting and cinematography. More importantly, this radiantly beautiful film is a very necessary reflective mirror for us to see the story of the immigration of “foreigners” to America at a time when the very mention of the word “frontier” is a political fuse. Writer / director Emanuele Crialese gave us not only a deeply touching story, he also provided the audience with a touchstone to revisit the history of each of our origins: with the exception of Native Americans, we all entered America as “foreigners" "At some point in our stories, and it's humiliating to watch this movie with this fact in mind. <br /> <br /> The film opens at the turn of the century in Sicily, as a poor widower, Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his brother Angelo (Francesco Casis) climbs a rocky hill to cross their tokens to ask for a sign that they should whether they continue to fight for existence on the island or go to America, the country of dreams. The deaf-and-dumb son Mankuso Pietro (Filippo Puchillo) runs to the top of a hill with postcards that he found with images of America (money grows on trees, fruits and vegetables bigger than people, etc.), and Salvatore takes this as a sign that he should move your family to America. Having convinced his reluctant mother Fortunatou (Aurora Quattrocki) and his sisters Rita (Federica De Cola) and Rosa (Isabella Ragonese) to make the trip, he sells his only things (two donkeys, goats and rabbits) and a man with a boat. arranges their trip, providing the family with shoes, appropriate clothing and instructions for boarding an ocean liner as third-class passengers. When the Mancuso family prepares for boarding, they are asked to take a picture, and when they pose for the colored scenery, the Englishwoman Lucy / Luce (Charlotte Heinsburg) enters the photo as if she were part of this peasant family. Lucy can't get into a boat to America without being accompanied by men. <br /> <br /> The journey begins, and Lucy gently identifies herself with the Mancuso family, finally strengthening her safe passage, offering Salvatore to marry her "for convenience." not for love ”when they arrive in America. Through a violent storm and terrible living conditions, many third-class passengers survive, communicate, and ultimately arrive on Ellis Island, believing that their dream of America has come true. But everyone must go through severe physical tests, remove them from work, and even test their intellect to determine if they can enter America: officials make it clear that America does not want genetically inferior people to enter the new world! Each woman must be selected as a man for marriage on Ellis Island before they are allowed entry. The way the Mancuso family remains cohesive to an unexpected ending is the end of the story. <br /> <br /> Few of us understand the strict rules and cruel treatment of immigrants (or at least face it at the turn of the century) on Ellis Island, and if we do, we decided to sink this information. The GOLDEN DOOR represents the case of the struggle of immigrants in such a way that not only touches our hearts, but also questions our agreement with the immigration laws in force. But if we leave aside all political issues, “GOLDEN DOOR” is, first of all, a film of incredible beauty, exquisite photography, deeply tangible representations of a huge composition and very sensitively written and directorial history. This is a film that deserves wide distribution, a film that everyone should see. Highly recommended. Grady harp
