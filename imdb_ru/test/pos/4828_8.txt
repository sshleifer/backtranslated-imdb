This work is quite atmospheric, with a couple of surprises and a few really creepy elements. I found this job more useful than I expected, given the rotten reviews she gets here on IMDb. The dialogue seems natural and fair (in the light of circumstances), although the general course of the film goes from predictable to cliche, when the heroines fall, when they should run, and explore strange sounds, when they should lock their doors. Typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> Local characters are one of the worst clichés, portraying the Abalachian Aborigines as educated freaks who have developmental difficulties. The characters of children and managers are GREAT! This development is adequate, and Scout Taylor-Compton seems to be developing his talents quite well. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not going to say that this is completely original or best because sliced ​​bread (which is not so great), but it’s interesting and I don’t miss my 107 minutes ago. I would not say that this is a great movie, but there are some really good horror elements in it. But there are some very slow moments when the development of the plot / character seems superfluous for the whim of the director (or film editor). <br /> <br /> In general, this is good for a rainy night, but not so good for viewing on Friday / Saturday. <br /> <br /> He estimates 7.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
