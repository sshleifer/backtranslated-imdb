"Gypsy", perhaps the greatest musical ever written, so it is a pity that his film version was such a disappointment. To make up for it, we have this remake, which, if not flawless, is a pleasant and well-made adaptation of the musical. The script is completely accurate, all songs are included, and the production remains close to the original production by Jerome Robbins. Bette Midler is a great choice for Rose, her singing and Merman-Esquire's personality, and her great acting. Peter Reigert is a wonderful Herbie, if not a great singer, and Cynthia Gibb is a straightforward, natural Louise. To tell the truth, a live recording of the revival of 1989 with Secret Daily would probably be a better idea, if only because “Gypsy” is just more exciting on stage, but this film is an excellent translation of a great musical.
