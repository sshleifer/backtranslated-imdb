I work at a nuclear power plant, so I enjoy these answers. <br /> <br /> Seriously. Go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palisades_Nuclear_Generating_Station and you will see where I work. <br /> <br /> I could not come up with a safer industry to work with. We are required to process reporting events as minor as paper cuts. Any problem identified as a potential problem with regard to nuclear, radiological or industrial safety is immediately reported during the corrective action process. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that nuclear power plants in the US work with safety in the foreground. their mind.
