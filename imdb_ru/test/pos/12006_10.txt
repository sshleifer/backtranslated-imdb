Probably greatly undervalued by all who have never experienced hellish life under the communist regime. Although it seems hard to believe, it all happened, in fact, the reality was even worse than in the movies. This is reminiscent of the Orwellian fiction, only it is not fiction. John Hurt is great, as always. Yes, the script is not full of action, but life is not full. The plot is breathtaking. Yes, people were shot, but thousands of them. Their “crime” was that they wanted to leave the communist “paradise” without government permission. Sometimes a movie causes tears in the eyes. We need more such films to truly appreciate what America gives us. Great movie, highly recommended! God bless our country, USA!
