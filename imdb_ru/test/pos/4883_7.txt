OK, why complain about this movie? This is fiction. Deal with it. If you want to see a biography, look at it. This is the original, fictional version of what happened in Wisconsin. People who are obsessed will complain about this, as well as any other deviation of facts. Sad but true. I think making Kane Hodder a person after whom the film was named was a great idea. At first I thought it was not so good, I will be honest. But it only made it even more frightening. If you like Kane Hodder, Ed Gein or movies based on real events, I think this is a good movie. But if you're obsessed (like some other people), stay away from this movie and all the rest.
