Zachary Scott does what he can best, that is, plays a worm in the movie "Danger Signal", a 1945 B film, which also starred Fei Emerson, Mona Freeman and Rosemary DeCamp. Scott plays a writer who kills women after he gets their money. After the last murder, he rents a room in a house belonging to the Fenchurch family, Hilde (Emerson) and her mother (Mary Servoss). Scott rushes at Emerson, and she is blinded. In the middle of the novel, her younger sister Ann (Freeman) returns home after treatment. When she mentions that she was Uncle Wade's favorite, and he left her $ 25,000 (big money by the standards of 1945), Scott loses interest in poor Hilde and arranges a play for Anna. Ann looks like Rebecca from the Sunnybrook farm until she starts sneaking with Scott - overnight, she is 10 years old and she becomes completely nasty to her sister. Finally, after receiving a message that her tenant is useless, Hilda calls a psychiatrist (Rosemary DeCamp) to give him insight and advice. <br /> <br /> Psychological dramas were in vogue during and after World War II, and Scott does an excellent job with his work as a smooth sociopath. This was his strong point - he was a weak-willed sheriff on Flamingo Road and did not show a real presence. As for the two terms, we saw how he did this in Mildred Pierce, where he performed especially well in this. Emerson is a book stenographer, her hair is knocked off her face and her big glasses, but after a few hours she is beautiful and gives excellent results. DeCamp has always been an underestimated actress - here she demonstrates a soft German accent and is amazing. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting film, albeit a very routine one. Acting really exalts it.
