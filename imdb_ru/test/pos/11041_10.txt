I watched this GREAT Classic film about Greta Garbo and thought that her performance was excellent. However, the German version of the film, which had inscriptions in English, was her greatest performance. Greta Garbo even mentioned to the press that the German film was her favorite, where she had to move from quiet films to sound. Greta had a high voice and had to take lessons to lower her voice for future roles in films. The story was very sad because Greta Garbo (Anna Christie), Ninochka, 39, was offended on the farm by young boys, and her father left her many years ago as a sailor and then as a barge captain. There were many scenes of Old New York, the Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island and the Manhattan skyline. Charles Bickford (Matt Burke), "Days of Wine and Roses", 62 years old, a classic veteran actor played an excellent secondary role.
