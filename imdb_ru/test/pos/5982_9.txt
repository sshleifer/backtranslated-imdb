A stunningly heartbreaking story about the plight of two soldiers in World War II. This film, against the background of a chilling struggle not only against Nazis and traitors in Belarus, but also with harsh natural elements, tells the story of two soldiers with polarized morality, one of whom survived, but found that with his own circumstances and the one who dies making all that can be done in the face of intimidation and all that is possible to break the spirit is in fact a “rising” title. The film, which everyone should see, especially for the phenomenal views of the main characters, and quivering scenery (in particular, scenes of imprisonment and hanging). Absolutely must see.
