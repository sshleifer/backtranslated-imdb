To my eternal shame, I have never seen a silent film — not even the mother of all Nosferatu films about vampires. However, if they demonstrate half of the creativity and joy of these efforts of Buster Keaton, I will probably try to see a few more. It's really fun, and also a stunning acquaintance with the world of silent comedies. The assumption, as it is, is centered around the unfortunate case of an erroneous identity, since Keaton is mistaken for Dead Shot Dan (co-director of Malcolm St Clair). This leads to numerous persecutions and escapes when the authorities are getting closer to the increasingly desperate Keaton. <br /> <br /> You are amazed and entertained in equal proportions. Keaton is a natural comedian, but also an experienced stuntman, judging by the way he jumps and jumps, like Jackie Chan, at speed. And comedy also has an exceptionally high standard - my Best Half had to interrupt the phone call to their parents, because she laughed too much! If you have never seen such a silent film, it is nothing more than a revelation that can be seen - it certainly destroyed all my ideas about silent films. Naturally, this is not as good as modern films - acting is pretty awful, to be honest, but it doesn’t matter, because you like the movie anyway. Anyone who is interested in films in general should make an effort to watch this, because they will not be disappointed. Brilliant!
