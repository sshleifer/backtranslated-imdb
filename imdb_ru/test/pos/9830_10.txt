Random Hearts is a very well-managed, well-written script and well-played star actors. I discovered that it is so intense that you have to stop and be surprised in almost every scene where Harrison and Christine are together, how their characters cope with this terrible situation in which they find themselves. Very talented game of both. I believe that many people who did not appreciate the film for what it was, did not understand the meaning of the film or could not even understand a situation like them. <br /> <br /> (please skip this next part if you havenâ€™t seen the movie yet) <br /> <br /> I liked the finale, which was a big surprise that linked the entire movie. It was a joy to see how these two good people might end up happier. <br /> <br />
