I am not kidding. Yes, "Who's That Girl" is different from being one of the many Madonna films that were bombed, but I actually liked this film more than "Desperately Seeking Susan." In Susan, Madonna’s character is assigned to the secondary role of Rosanna Arquette, and there’s not too much to work with. No disrespect for Rosanna, but in WTG Madonna plays this crazy, outrageous character, only in the style of the 80s. Although today it may seem "stupid", in fact it is one of the best films of Madonna and one of her most underrated films. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a former prisoner who is sent to a criminal for a crime. she did not commit. She is released from prison after four years of good behavior. Griffin Dunn, who is also a very underrated actor, plays Loudin Trotte, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of taking her from prison and taking her to the bus station. Of course, when these two come together, then madness happens. Sir John Mills plays the small role of a wealthy businessman who has a huge mansion in the center of Manhattan with a rainforest (???) on its roof. <br /> <br /> This film parodies everything. Rich people, slovenly characters who live in Harlem and completely destroy Rolls Royce Luden, the gay cops who follow Madonna and Dunn around the city, and Dunn Wendy Worthington, the intoxicated fiance York played by Haviland Morris, who was Jake Caroline's girlfriend in Sixteen Candles. Fun! In addition, Dunn is also responsible for the rare breed of leopard, reminiscent of "Raising a child." In addition, in those days, Madonna watched a gorgeous 80s platinum blonde, and the film has an excellent soundtrack. Throw it all into the mix and you’ll have a WTG craziness. <br /> <br /> Madonna is the queen of imperturbable action. There are moments in the film when she speaks a completely straight line, and surprisingly it turns out to be funny! This is how the best comedy should sound - right. Madonna had to do more comedy, and it was a pity that she did not decide to do it. Later, she became much more controversial and gained more dark, sexually charged roles in the notorious films Body Proof and Dangerous Game. <br /> <br /> Some people say that Madonna cannot act, and this is normal, people are entitled to their opinion, but I believe that the real problem is that people do not see the difference between Madonna playing the character in the film, instead, they still see only Madonna, and this is the main reason why she is paid more attention to her music than her films. It's still a funny 80s comedy. Not everyone, I'm sure some of you won't like it, so I would recommend it mostly for Madonna fans, but you never know, you might be surprised and you will like it! <br /> <br /> An interesting note: one of Madonna’s girlfriends from her New York club days in the early 80s, Coati Mundi, who plays Raoul, was a member of the Kid Creole and The Coconuts and Savannah Band groups.
