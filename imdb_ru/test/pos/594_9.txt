A bunch of full-length films with puppets created by Jim Henson & Co. were made, but “Puppet Film” was the first one and the first in the original trilogy, which also has “The Great”. Muppet Kaper and Manhattan Dolls. He was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn’t see him at the time (and I didn’t see his two successors when they were first released). However, I saw a lot of dolls in my childhood, mostly after Henson’s untimely death in 1990. I finally found the time to watch this movie in the mid-nineties, when I heard the soundtrack. It is not surprising that at that time I liked it, and revising it in recent years has not been very disappointing. <br /> <br /> One day while Kermit the Frog is sitting in a swamp with his banjo after singing “Rainbow Communication” a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes on a boat and encourages him to pursue a career in Tinseltown. Kermit takes his advice and goes west. Soon he meets Fozzy Bear, an unlucky comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come. The frog is also spotted by Doc Hopper, the owner of the frog legs restaurant chain, who wants Kermit to be his talisman. Like Kermit the Frog, this is nasty, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzy. While traveling around the country, Kermit and Fozzy meet other dolls that join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, since they are all trying to get to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, who is helped by Max, is ready to do everything to make Kermit the talisman of his restaurant chain, so Kermit is in increasing danger! <br /> <br /> Many people praise this film for the songs, and I understand why. At the beginning, of course, nominated for an Oscar-nominated Rainbow, and followed by better tunes such as Kermit and Fozzy’s catchy road song, Movin 'Right Along and “I'm going to go back there” Someday, ”sharp Gonzo's ballad “Never Before, Never Again”, the song that Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit is the only one that I think is rather weak, and their romance seems terribly sudden. The dolls in this film are usually cute as on TV and some of them give a lot of humor, in including Fozzy, who first appears in the film, hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his standing and, well, if you are familiar with these famous dolls, you should know what to expect from each of them. Some of the live actors who appear briefly in The film can also be funny, for example, House DeLuis as Bernie Agent and Steve Martin in the role of “Brazen Waiter.” Moreover, this is not a 100% comedy. There are serious parts of the film that they also played well. <br /> <br /> Reconsidering this original Muppet film this year was my first viewing of any of them since I watched The Space Dolls (one of the Muppet films). done after Henson’s death, released in 1999) for the first time last year. I was very disappointed when I saw this film, which I never had before, when I watched a movie or TV series with popular puppet characters! Not only is this film not very funny, I also think that it is too dark and cruel for dolls, as I said in my review! However, I can not say that I think about the same thing as any of the predecessors of this film, including this one, released twenty years earlier. “The Muppet film” seems to be the most popular of the whole group, and since there is so much that you like in it, not only for children, this is understandable. I doubt very much that much more can be said about the “Muppets film”, which has not been said over the past thirty years, but today it remains good fun for the whole family.
