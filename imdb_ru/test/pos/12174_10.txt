These two main characters Erkan and Stefan - Munich Comedy Act. I was wondering if this is one of these typical films about farces where history is either not important or simply does not exist. But when I watched this film, I was very glad that it has a cool story and the main characters really fit into it. <br /> <br /> All in all, very funny, not just a regular German movie.
