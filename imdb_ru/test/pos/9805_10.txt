I rented a movie, and I liked it so much that I bought it. Elijah Wood (Mikey) and Joseph Mazello (Bobby) are outstanding guys. Their new stepfather physically insults Bobby. Abuse is implied, for the most part, not seen and causes in me a great passion to help abused children. The film has a magical quality, since the boys' imagination helps them find a way to cope with abuse. You should try to understand the story from the point of view of the child. I'm still thinking about the ending. I watched a movie 3 or 4 times, and every time I think about possible new values. I'm not sure that Richard Donner wanted me to think, but this is a great movie! Joseph Mazello and Elijah Wood will make you hug your children.
