Leno speaks through his raisins. It spoils the joke for those of you who have not yet understood. His show is held in a small studio for a reason or for two reasons - a little laugh will increase, and few want to see it. Letterman's set is the opposite of polarity - Ed Sullivan would be proud, and the balcony was always full. <br /> <br /> NBC, tasteless NBC, will never get it. The founder David Sarnoffâ€™s crazy venture is still focused on money. At least CBS has something marital. <br /> <br /> Leno collects cars or brands, and Letterman rides cars. The difference is informative. <br /> <br /> When I was chatting, I asked other participants to correspond by e-mail if Leno _ever_ said something funny. I have never received a single letter. Letterman has an excellent time. He can also reuse the most unfunny joke so that it becomes one of the funniest things on the show that night. <br /> <br /> Letterman built other careers. Paul is now well known and respected in his music law. Even other members of the group of Paul receive recognition and career growth. Biff Henderson became the name that America knows. Even businesses in the same quarter as the Ed Sullivan Theater receive support. What did Leno ever do for someone else? Personally, I'm glad Dave moved, and Leno got a Carson concert. I have never watched the NBC show before, and I had no reason after that. <br /> <br /> The Ten list is an American icon. Like Letterman. Leno - a cartoonist's dream, nothing more.
