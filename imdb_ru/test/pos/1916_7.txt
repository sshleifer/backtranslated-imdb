This is definitely one of the classic cult classic games that all psychotronic fans need to see. What for? It has everything that should be in a film about the exploitation of the 70s. Supernatural dialogue, bad play, enthusiasm, sex, sloppiness, political incorrectness, violence and many other elements of good cult classics are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must-see. <br /> <br /> As in many other films, the plot makes little sense. What I understand from this is that the hooligan Dolemite was accused of stealing fur and drugs for half a million dollars. While he was busy with time, his sworn enemy, Willie Green (the same man who had set him up) occupied his nightclub. However, a sympathetic overseer (the only white character in the entire film who is not completely evil or incompetent) decides to release him in order to stop the evil Willie Green and his drug trafficking. Fortunately, he knows Kung Fu, as well as from 50 to 75% of the characters in this film. And even more successfully, when he was locked up, Ms. Queen Bee sent all of her "hoes" to the kung fu school. With this army of Kung Fu fighting the "hoes" (his words, not mine) on his side, he plans to pick up a nightclub from Willy Green. However, two racist white police officers are again trying to expose him and send him back to prison. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, do not try to follow the plot. I have seen this film about five times, and there are many elements that seem to have nothing to do with anything else. Auxiliary characters roam and leave the film. I'm still trying to figure out what happened to Rev. Gibbs, the mayor and pimp of Hamburger. Who cares? Scenes with these characters are priceless. As for the dialogue, it is terrible with even worse delivery. Since Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I begin to think about whether this film was a fake or a serious fighter. It seems he could not decide which one. Strings like “Yes, I'm so bad, I kick my ass twice a day” require further investigation. In any case, the film is funny, and there are more holes in the plot than in the Swiss cheese factory. Another fun element is one of the most inertial use of sex and naked bodies in movies. Actors you never want to see naked become naked (including the mayor and queen bee). Not to mention that the boom microphone seems to appear in any other scene. <br /> <br /> Most of all, Moore demonstrates incredible enthusiasm. He seems to be having a good time and, of course, charismatic. His comedian raps had a tremendous impact on the gangsta rap of the last day, including Dr. Dre, who tried it on his revolutionary 1992 album "The Chronic". However technically inappropriate this film is, it is culturally influential. More importantly, it is a good pastime. The biggest crime a film about exploitation can commit is boring, and with all its flaws it quickly turns around and entertains. In other words, if you dig this kind of movie, you will love Dolemite. If you do not dig it, you are "not business, born uncertain, crazy, like a freak, motha-f *** a!" (7/10)
