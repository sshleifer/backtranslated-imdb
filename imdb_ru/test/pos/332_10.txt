I think this is one of the best Tamil films I've seen lately. I like the fact that it does not revolve around a boyfriend and girlfriend in love, and they made the film brilliantly. The actors did a great job, and I especially congratulate the little girl. She was gorgeous and really caused the feeling of a foster child looking for her real mother. Best of all songs, beautiful music and touching lyrics. There are some great songs this turn! especially Kannatil Mutamittal and Velay Pokal. Great songs, both of them. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and a great game (and great songs!). Hurray simran.
