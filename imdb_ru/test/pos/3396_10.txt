Perhaps one of the best movies ever made. The friendship of Orry and Gurge is deeply rooted, and the War strains their strong friendship. As a southerner, I can honestly say that this epic is as accurate as possible. Brothers are fighting brothers. Can you imagine that life had to live in those times? The best part of the film, for me, was when the South gave up; General Grant urges President Lincoln to really stick to him in the South, he says: “Mr. President, many people want the South to shed blood because of what they have done ...” President Lincoln turns to him and in a very tired voice says: "The South has shed enough blood ... and so do we ..." I began to cry and took a deep breath. What a president! It seems that the father says that his son was punished enough, and, despite his anger, he realizes that his point of view has been made. This war was a very dark time for our young country, and it was necessary to fight it. President Lincoln knew this. I encourage everyone who reads this to watch this movie and add it to their DVD collection. Then, thank God, that our country has been preserved. As Jesus said, "A house divided against itself cannot stand."
