For the very reason that I love films such as Central do Brasil (Central Station, 1998), I really love Chop Shop. No sugar coating, no attempt to make the lives of these people more attractive or beautiful. What you see is what you get, and it is often sandy and sometimes heartbreaking. But this is exactly what makes a movie like “Chop Shop” so wonderful, along with the fact that the storyline unfolds so elegantly and subtly. For a younger brother and sister who are as close to homelessness as they would like, working (and living) in a car body repair shop in Queens, New York is also good. Is it good or bad? This is the question that this film, in fact, poses to the viewer. This film is really a fantastic piece of life, which at times resembles a documentary, not a drama, which is great because it looks and feels so real. In the midst of this, so many modern films based on essentially surrealistic and often implausible scenes, stumbling on Chop Shop is like finding a small gem.
