This unusual pseudo-documentary film, shot in 1971, perfectly captures the spirit of American time today ... which makes it even more frightening and relevant. “Subversive organizations” (college students, hippies, black activists, scientists) gather in the government and receive long prison sentences for what is considered a crime for thought and social protest. As an alternative to living in prison, these convicted "criminals" are offered three days in the "Park of Punishments". Their goal in the park is to get to the American flag, where freedom awaits them. It is not surprising that the “Park of Punishments” option is a dirty lie. This brilliant film by Peter Watkins even precedes the "Battle of the Kingdom" and "7th series", although his angle of attack is more clearly political. Filmed in year 71, it looks and feels just as fresh as everything that has been done today. The performances are exemplary, and the direction is sharp. The narrative intersects between various groups trying to survive in the harsh conditions of the park and the McCarthy-like lawsuits that have convicted them. Today this film still retains its strength. In 71, there was nothing but nothing of the kind. This is a masterpiece that succeeds on a dozen levels. He has balls that most people have lost today.
