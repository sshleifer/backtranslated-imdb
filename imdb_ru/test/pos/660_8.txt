Just saw Baby Blue Marine again after 30 years. I still find it a pleasant and romantic film that captures time that has been lost forever. The innocence and purity of a time past is truly captured in this little film. The action is above average, and the brief appearance of Richard Gere as the shocked war hero of the Raider Marine, is of great interest to any film fan or Gere fan. Jan-Michel Vincent, in his prime, looks and behaves like an "All-American" boy. The late Bruno Kirby (who was announced as B. Kirby Jr.) has the meaty role of Pop, a peace-loving, rejected Marine Corps, wishing to return home to his wife. If you are looking for sex, drugs or rock and roll, this film is not for you. If you are looking for action and adventure, the same is true. However, if you want to regain time for innocence, honor, romance and love in America, then Baby Blue Marine is the movie for you.
