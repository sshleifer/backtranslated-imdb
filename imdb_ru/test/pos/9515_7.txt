Another film “The End of the World”, which requires comparison with the terrible “Day After Tomorrow”. Following the same structure as the DAT, but with a distinctly Japanese style. How is it doing? It depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the touch of a little man is what makes this film irresistible for most of its 2+ hours. Also frequent title cards explaining some of the sciences. The effects are probably the best I've ever seen in a Japanese film, and they compare very well with anything from Hollywood. Many scenes of catastrophe are really terrible, although human slaughter is usually behind the scenes. And this is one of the drawbacks. Although the horror of thousands of deaths on the screen, such as in the recent “War of the Worlds”, may be too overwhelming, we also do not have the sensation of chaos of an entire nation collapsing in the ocean. Several scenes relate to chaos, but for the most part this part of the story is almost unaffected. Despite this, this film works on many levels and is more realistic than DAT, that is, to the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is based on one shaded plot device and another plot device that would be at home in the Japanese Earth of the 1960s in the danger film Gorat. After a good enough science and basically a realistic look at a catastrophe, this causes some disappointment. Sudden stopping of a movie for a pop love song doesn't help either (if you don’t like the song). This made the “exciting” ending a bit slower for me. <br /> <br /> In general, the Direction is good, the artistic design is excellent. Acting is also good. Recommended.
