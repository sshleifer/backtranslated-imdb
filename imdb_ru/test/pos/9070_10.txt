I usually take care of films that range around 6/10 on IMDb. I would like to think that people know what they are talking about and know what they like. I guess the trick is to use the approach “Hey, if I liked films like these, I would give him a higher score than now because I don’t like these types of films.” On the other hand On the other hand, people judge differently, basing more value on action, or perhaps on history or direction. In any case, having landed the plane here, I shot this film earlier and did not have time to watch it, I did it this morning. <br /> <br /> Wow! Watch this movie. I am personally interested in paranormal phenomena / I read a little about death experiences, so I was hooked automatically. I'm not sure that some comments here suggest that the quality cast here was wasted - I disagree - the cast was excellent here - I think this is the only time I didn’t mind Julia Roberts, it was nice to see 24 Kiefer Sutherland (currently serving this prison sentence for DUI) and Kevin Bacon in an interesting hairstyle. <br /> <br /> In general - I liked the direction, the atmosphere, the game and the storyline most of all - especially the idea of ​​karma, and, to quote Nelson Wright, “Everything we do matters”, so true. <br /> <br /> 10/10!
