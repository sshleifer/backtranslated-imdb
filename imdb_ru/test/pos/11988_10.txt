The only possible disadvantage of this film is the title! Please stop comparing this to the first! I did in my previous review just to separate it from the first. If you have not seen the movie yet and you are curious, FULLY forget the first one and think up a different name for it. There is nothing like the mood and all his own. This is an excellent example of a comic comedy of the mid-80s. I seriously doubt that such big names in this film were shot in the film because they were broken or even wanted to remake the first film. Anyone who has ever wanted to give a blow to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. I argue, the only reason this is at the bottom of 100 IMDB is because of its name. I usually hate films like these (that is, Adam Sandler, Will Farrell, bro Farrell ....), but this film just makes me laugh hysterically go out, or just a funny guilt pleasure. In any case, this is the most underrated 80s film for The Stunt Man. <br /> <br /> Robert Stack - WE LOVE YOU !!! (1919-2003)
