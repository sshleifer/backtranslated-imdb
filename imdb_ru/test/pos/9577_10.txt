In the era of the Farrelli Brothers and the Jakass TV series, a film created and performed by Americans, with a good pace, full of charm and fun, is almost a miracle. This ensemble was behind some other efforts, most recently “The Mighty Wind”, which was so thin that it seemed like a real documentary without overlaying entertainment, but “Best In Show” hits on all cylinders. It is superbly played with some of the best actors in the US, Parker Posey, who exudes energy, even when she stands still, Eugene Levy, as a tolerant person who is not a rug, even when he seems (or perhaps “indomitable rug "). The brilliant styles of Fred Willard, the understated actions of so many others, which is a feature not usually associated with Americans or American actors. One of the few humorous films that I can watch again and again.
