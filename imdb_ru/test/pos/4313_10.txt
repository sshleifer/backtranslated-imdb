NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic example of Japanese noir. We are talking about three salaries that bother your head when their innocent, drunken cheap jesters kill three OTHER guys one night in a bar. When these three mysterious strangers, whose evil virtue is much better than even a movie, let us know, beat out the living daylight of one of our "heroes", the trio decides to return the service in kind - only they accidentally kill one of the other guys! The remaining two villains begin the systematic destruction of all that dear to these poor things, including their quickly dwindling sanity. On the cover of the Phaedra Video DVD, there is a quote from the movie “Paranoid Street Crime!” Or some such, and the term is more than applicable here. Pensive, tense, very cruel and restrained (but still quite clever), shot mostly at night with many deliberately vague moments and motifs of character that make the audience guess with the besieged protagonists (who to some extent deserve everything to get!) . I give it 10.
