Dead Gentlemen Productions have put together a film with a tremendous production value, considering their budget. Anyone who has ever played any role-playing game, especially any fantasy RPG (they play Dungeons and Dragons in the film), LOVES this movie. Brilliant performances are everywhere - especially regarding the dual nature of the principles, the games of their players and their characters. Anyone who has ever starred or starred in a student film will appreciate the amount of work and the love they have invested in this project. This film (and its prequel) is intended for fantasy films and role-playing games that Blazing Saddles for Westerns is a parody of a higher order. I have only a couple of minor complaints about the film itself, none of which will prevent me from buying a DVD as soon as it is available (only 6 weeks - I count the days): <br /> <br /> 1. When Lodge speaks with Joanna is joining a game group, he hands her a copy of the “Guide for dungeon and dragon players” and says: “This will tell you everything you need to know.” The camera hangs on the book for too long, and this moment really seemed like a commercial. <br /> <br /> 2. The jokes are funny, but they seem uneven throughout the film. The last third of the film, after an almost uninterrupted flow of visual and verbal humor, precedes it, slows down a bit, as if the story is catching up with jokes. Strange, but Blazing Saddles always amazed me and so. and i love this movie too. <br /> <br /> One of the strengths of the narrative is the unresolved romantic plot. Will Joanna become a grandmaster's girlfriend? Will she return to Cass? Or will these three maintain a platonic friendship, deepened in the spirit of camaraderie? (Yes, it sounds sad, but there are a couple of saccharine moments, especially when Cass and Lodge are "washed out" at the end.) But the film covers one week: from the point of view of human relations, these questions could not be answered in a week. The fact that the relationship of the characters remains uncertain strikes me as a better choice than in most films that you see in most films, for example, when a girl gets her prince and they move to a castle, or the prince plunges into the North Atlantic after three is commonplace tedious and predictable hours. Writers really seem to understand the psychology of the characters, and you can see how the characters (both players and player characters) change over the course of the film, but not suddenly and unbelievably. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear more wisdom from Brother Silence.
