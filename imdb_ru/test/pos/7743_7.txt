For many years I thought that I was the only person on the planet who saw TEMPEST, and I am so glad to know that I am not the only person who discovered this sleeper somewhere in their adventures in the cinema. Freely based on Shakespeareâ€™s play, TEMPEST follows the architect (the late John Cassavet in one of his best performances), who are tired of his work and his crumbling marriage (with the real spouse Gene Rowlads), who decides to give it all up, let's say hell with rats run and live on the island with her daughter (Molly Ringwald, in her film debut) and new friend Aretha (glowing Susan Sarandon). Although Paul Mazursky is credited with the role of director, Cassavet's hand is everywhere in this film ... long scenes shot without trimming, an improvisational sense of dialogue ..., a self-satisfied style of narration, this is definitely his show from the very beginning to the end, and if you are not a fan of his work, the film will seem laboriously long and boring, but if you are a fan, there are awards that you need to have. Cassawett is surrounded by first-class actors ... his scenes with Rowlands crunch intensely, and his amazing chemistry with Sarandon contrasts sharply with his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in his film debut, and the late Raul Julia as Kalibanos, who serves Cassavet on the island, performs the scene theft. Julia stops the show in one scene, dancing with a herd of sheep, accompanied by Liza Minnelli, singing "New York, New York." This film is sad and tragic, fun and intense. Yes, he is a little long and incoherent, and he works too hard to be different from others (there is even a curtain at the end of the film), but he never ceases to attract the attention of those who like something a little different in their film-making.
