After seeing the film many years ago and disappointed with its wasteful potential, when I heard that it was becoming a TV series, I flatly refused to watch it. My best friend immediately became a fanatical fan and, knowing my love for horror films, could not believe that I would not watch a single episode. I told him that the film scared me to the end of my life, because it was all about BAFFI, and he told me to forget that the film exists at all. He insisted that I shoot two episodes: “Once again with a feeling” and this one. <br /> <br /> Both of them, so today I am a fan of BUFFY. He was right - I was hooked right away. I have never seen the show with courage to dare to try an episode in which there is almost no dialogue, and nothing else could cope with this recklessness and pure work of BAFFI. I think that X FILES could get away with it if they thought about it at first, but I'm glad that the Buffy did it instead. <br /> <br /> It is the merit of all the participants that you are chained to yourself for the whole hour, sometimes hanging on the edge of your chair. And when it was all over, I was eager to learn more about each character. So I went out and bought a boxed set of Season One. And the rest is history ... <br /> <br /> I guarantee you that if you have never seen this, you will want to see more if you make this episode your first. <br /> <br /> The only reason I don’t put 10 out of 10 is because I’ll reserve this account for “Once more ...”
