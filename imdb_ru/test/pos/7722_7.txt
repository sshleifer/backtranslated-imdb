A typical Spanish production is slow, but with great sensuality and sexuality oozes from leading actress Paz Vega. (See her in "Spanglish"). Magnificent scenery, a lot of color - you will see Cordoba, Seville, Spanish mountains and countryside. The plot tends to squirm here and there, but if you follow closely (I managed, although the film is in Spanish), you will understand the essence. <br /> <br /> This is about how a very very sensual young Gypsy, Carmen, uses her feminine tricks to seduce men to fulfill her order. Carmen goes to prison after attacking a cigarette in a cigar factory where she works. She convinces José, the soldier responsible for taking her to prison, to let her escape. Jose is inferior to her charms because she speaks Basque (he is Navarre and speaks the same language). Jose is punished with 1 month in prison and demoted to a soldier. He later meets Carmen at a party, and they become lovers. But Carmen refuses him and continues his lustful and flirtatious lifestyle. In jealous rage, Jose kills the same soldier who was with Carmen. Then they must leave the city. Life on the run makes Jose a gangster. In the meantime, Carmen remains the same, wildly lecherous woman. In the end, José goes mad and ends up killing Carmen. <br /> <br /> The story is told by Jose in prison awaiting execution. The man he tells the story to is Prospero Merrim, a French writer and anthropologist whose fancy clock (imitating Beethoven’s Fur Eliza) was stolen either by Carmen or José. <br /> <br /> Worth watching and Delightful Paz Vega for shooting.
