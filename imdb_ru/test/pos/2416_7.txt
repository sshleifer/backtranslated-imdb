This film was very different from previous films, and I had to think: “Where is Ralph Makkio?” a bit more! In this movie, Julie might be interested in Macchio! Nevermind! <br /> <br /> On a serious level, I liked this film because it included the training of a teenage girl karate, and her feelings are very different from the feelings of Daniel. Julie is much wilder than Daniel and needs to be tamed, which Miagie considers very difficult; she is a pretty troubled girl and a rude, nasty brat! <br /> <br /> It was very nice to watch Julia transform when she warms Mayagi and learns more about karate and her life in general. We can all learn one or two things from Miyagi's wit!
