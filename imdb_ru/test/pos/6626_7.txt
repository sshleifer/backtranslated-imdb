It did not surprise me that it was a very depressing and exhausting film. In the end, it's all about the impact of war on civilians. And this is the "king of depression," Ingmar Bergman. In other words, many of the works of Bergman have deeply penetrated into human suffering and longing, and therefore this film seems not so unusual because of this director. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it is more difficult to watch, the last half of the film offers, perhaps, a deeper understanding of the depths of humanity. This is because, at first, the main characters (Liv Ulman and Max Von Sidow) try to overcome difficulties and are mostly decent (albeit slightly stupid) people. However, since deprivation occurs after deprivation, they (especially von Sidow) become less and less humane and more animalistic - doing ANYTHING in order to survive. <br /> <br /> Funny to watch, there is no insane path! But an interesting understanding of human nature. <br /> <br /> PS - 1 thing I loved in this movie is that he avoided a stupid movie. When the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine, they finished the wine completely! In most films, they barely touch their drinks or leave them intact. It drives me crazy, because I NEVER leave a $ 4 alcoholic drink without drinking it, unless it tasted horrible or there was no beetle in it! BRAVO!
