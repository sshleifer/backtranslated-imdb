I had high hopes for Teletoon Retro to broadcast it, but instead of showing such shows, those that do not receive the treatment they deserve, they broadcast things that I may have seen dozens of times before. <br /> Centurions were the highlight of my preschool years. I know this may seem a little strange, but it's true. After the Duke of GI Joe, Jake Rockwell is another one of those cartoon characters I really fell in love with. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Teletoon Retro does not see it as people of my generation. Otherwise Teletoon Retro would be much better than it is.
