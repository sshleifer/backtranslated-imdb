Anyone who likes the mystery of Twin Peaks Lynchian, or any HP Lovecraft fan who knows that the worst things are familiar things, will really enjoy this movie. Do not watch it like a horror film in the "traditional" western sense, but rather like Grimm's fairy tale. This is terrible and definitely for 16+, but as soon as you start watching it, you too will find yourself embroiled in a whirlpool. Definitely one of those films that hangs with you for a few days after watching (I will never look at my snails again!)
