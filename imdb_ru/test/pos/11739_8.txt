On the second preview, this is still a wonderful novel, which, in my opinion, is much better than the film he made together with my two-DVD set, Leo McCary’s classic "An Affair To Remember". Nevertheless, it seems that he lost a little bit of popularity (only 6.6 points for IMDb, and many critics call it “sticky slush”). How sad, because this is a smart romantic drama with very good work of the two main characters, Jennifer Jones and William Holden. In any case, the film should be well remembered for its excellent color cinematography and an unforgettable musical score. I don’t really like Valentine's Day, but it gave me a reason to watch this movie again, and I am glad about it. Although I still believe that the death of the character of Holden too much portends that it does not give the opportunity to escape from the final scenes, this film is very touching, and I like it very much.
