Boogie Night uses its hero, Dirk Diggler, as a metaphor for America’s accumulated celebrities from a decade in America’s disgraceful past, which included an unexpected rise in pornography, therefore leading to an abundance of spoiled youth. His main character borrows traits from a variety of genuine actors, participating in many of the illegal affairs that celebrities in Hollywood were doing and too often exploited by the press. It seems that this is the same fairy tale that can appear on E! True Hollywood story is special. Drugs, sex and violence - the American dream. But what goes up must fall, and the more it is, the harder it falls. <br /> <br /> Dirk Diggler’s dreams are huge, as is another valuable asset of his body. Dirk's real name is Eddie Adams, a Californian who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives one great talent to every person on the planet, and his gift is rather unusual. After parting with his mother, Eddie leaves the house and meets the sloppy Jack Horner (Bert Reynolds), an adult director who offers him work. Eddie eventually becomes a major porn star, representing the lead "actor" in most Horner films. With regained success, Eddie said that he needed to come up with a new alias for himself, and so Dirk Diggler was born. <br /> <br /> Eddie / Dirk himself is primarily based on the notorious porn star John Holmes, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with Wonderland, in which Val Kilmer appeared. “Boogie Nights” is undoubtedly the best of the two, proving that pornography films can be made without disgusting their target audience: Regular moviegoers <br /> <br /> The film was set in 1977, in the era of artistic pornography - the filmmakers really believed that they could compensate for the low points of X-rating features by adding deep stories and a bewitching atmosphere. In a sense, the film's director, Paul Thomas Anderson, implements a very artistic approach to the project, resulting in a free and feature film about a period in American history when the thug was truly gratuitous and artistic. Anderson's style is so deep, and so different, that we soon feel as if we are experiencing an era itself. Not a minute goes by when we are not convinced of what time range is covered in the film. <br /> <br /> Not everyone was happy with the Boogie Nights filming. Before the shooting, Anderson repeatedly appealed to Reynolds, asking him to play the role of Horner many times. In the end, Reynolds agreed, but argued that the film was a terrible and worst role in his career, publicly rejecting it before being nominated for Best Supporting Actor Award and suddenly closed. A year ago, Anderson had a title dispute over Sydney / Hard Eight. He preferred the latter title for his film, and New Line Cinema considered the former to be more in demand. In fact, he lost the battle, and this time Anderson wisely avoided controversy over the title by inserting the words "boogie nights" into his film through the character's mouth. <br /> <br /> The casting of the film is one of its best aspects. Regular players of Paul Thomas Anderson are here, as well as a whole first-class cast of novices. To name some of the most famous stars: John S. Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Louis Guzman, William H. Macy, Heather Graham, and Julianne Moore. But the entire film is essentially limited to Mark Wahlberg, like Eddie, who is surprisingly convincing in his role. Wahlberg, previously known for his singing career and disappointing Hollywood activities, has all the necessary traits to portray such a character. This is his best role to date. <br /> <br /> Anderson knows how to captivate his audience and gain complete control over each scene. When Jack Horner first meets Eddie, Anderson slyly uses the stars in the background, a sign of upcoming events and hidden symbolism, as thin as possible. The initial scene lasts three minutes. This is a long track that follows Jack and Amber to a nightclub where most of the characters are first introduced. This reminds me of the Robert Altman Player Tracking discussions — this works great in Boogie Nights and is the first indication that Anderson knows what he is doing behind the camera. His style is developing rapidly in the spirit of Martin Scorsese, where shots spread rather quickly, but never seem hasty. By the way, Anderson refers to two classic snapshots of Scorsese - the final speech mirror of De Niro from Mad Bull and the scene of the night club GoodFellas. Anderson is a young, growing director, surprisingly mature in plot and direction, despite his age. While his first feature film, Difficult Eight, was noticeably wise and shrill, Boogie Nights was even more so. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights began as a love attempt by Paul Thomas Anderson. Removing the extraordinary Hard Eight series in 1996, Anderson’s film is so pragmatic that it seems almost authentic. Boogie nights invigorate us with its gratuitous content, sometimes bordering on the verge of pornography, only much more complicated than such garbage. This is a sparkling, wonderful modern masterpiece that is as stunning as it is wild and stylish. Perhaps the best Anderson film and one of the greatest and most important projects of the last decade.
