Another portable horror is another controversial film that fans still have to find and form their own opinions. <br /> <br /> Imagine something in between the The Blair Witch Project and The Grudge, and you are close to the overall result. the content of this film. This is another horror shot on video, but this time most of it was edited together in readiness for a video document that was never completed by a supernatural investigator who disappeared. <br /> <br /> I, of course, had a feeling of fear when watching this film (does anyone make it worse than our Asian friends?), but the creepy moments, the really creepy moments, unfortunately, were a bit smaller and farther away than i had hoped for. I also felt that I was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when obvious “revelations” appeared everywhere, so I certainly cannot recommend it as highly as [* Rec]. <br /> <br /> Having said this, it would be an omission on the part of me not to recommend any film that goes on for a long time about ectoplasmic worms, contains at least two slightly frightening ghostly moments and made sure that I had to turn on the light some time when the sun was setting. <br /> Check it out if you have enjoyed some of the other portable genre releases lately. And the finale is awesome. <br /> <br /> Look if you want: Last broadcast, Pulse, Angel Heart.
