For those who loved Asterix books and movies, you will love this movie! Yes, I admit that it does mix up some books and movies, but the characters are brilliant, and these are not just people showing their CGIs on the left, right, and center. I have already seen him several times and laughed at him. <br /> <br /> Of course, it has the main characters Asterix (Asterix), Obelix (Obelix) and Dogmatiks (Idifix), but this time they Ask someone new ... to deal with. <br /> <br /> With such a sense of humor, the Gauls will go on and on and on. Bless them.
