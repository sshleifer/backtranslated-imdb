I watched "Reader in Sugar", which is not the best place to watch anything, and the film was certainly the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well woven, and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers chose his designers and team well. But it was the story and its delivery, which really made this short shine. The heavy script of Duncan Rogers was just what the shorts needed that evening. He does not wander, as several offerings did, and he does not preach to us. The reader was a simple narrative of the story in its best form, cast by Rogers well and well-functioning. Duncan Rogers is obviously a director who can put all the pieces together, and I look forward to his next finished project. K.
