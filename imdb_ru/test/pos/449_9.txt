There were a lot of great comments about this movie, and I want to add my voice to the praise. Yul Brynner has never been so attractive. His major Surov riveted. Your eyes just can't leave the screen when it's on it. This is his film. This does not mean that the rest of the cast was also exemplary, especially Deborah Kerr and Ann Jackson. Since they were mostly theater actors, they brought many nuances to their performances. For example, I saw this film at least 4 times, but for the first time I noticed the reaction of a German girl when she came face to face with a Russian soldier. Although he did not threaten, her completely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must have been in Germany after World War II and, most likely, was raped by the Red Army. Being able to discover the deeper layers of the story, which may lie right below the surface, makes me want to see this exciting movie over and over again. Please put it on a DVD.
