This film is surprisingly good. The sequence of ninja fights was incredible. I have not seen all the films of Sho Kosugi, but this is probably the best one I've ever seen. Probably the most impressive sequence of fights was at the beginning, when the ninja killed about 20 people, it was one of the most impressive series of ninja fights I've ever seen. Another good combat sequence was at the funeral of the police, where the ninja provides more people for burial. The last fight was also very impressive. I also liked the soundtrack of this movie. The story was good enough for a ninja movie, in fact it was a bit different from other ninja movies. So, if you're a fan of ninja movies, you'll probably like this one.
