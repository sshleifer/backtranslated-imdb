If you like movies such as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you'll love Two Hands. He has the same type of black humor, and he will entertain you the whole movie. As in “Pulp Fiction,” there are stupid scenarios in it, in which characters get and how they cope with them. Along with Gallipoli and Picnic at Hanging Rock, this should be one of the best Australian films I've seen. He also starred in the role of young Heath Ledger, before he achieved great success in the states. <br /> <br /> This is a terribly underrated film that I think is as good as Pulp Fiction and these great people. You should see this!
