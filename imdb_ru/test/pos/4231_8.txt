The First Children's Game was an original and effective little horror movie. As expected, the two terrible sequels seemed to signify the end of this franchise. <br /> <br /> Well, when I heard that they were making the fourth film called “Bride of Chucky,” I just rolled my eyes and muttered: “... when they ever learn.” <br /> <br /> but when I heard that they have a great director, Ronnie Yu, and a solid cast, including awe-inspiring Jennifer Tilly, my interest in this has increased. <br /> <br /> This film is very well made. He has a great sense of humor, highly stylized graphic violence, great cinematography and stunningly sexy Jennifer Tilly showing off her most impressive things in the first half. (I have to add that she is also a fantastic actress.) <br /> <br /> She firmly holds her tongue in her cheek, without turning over to the camp territory. The effects of the doll are great and the verbal interaction between them is priceless. it's more horror / comedy than straight horror, but humor is welcome and well integrated. <br /> <br /> I already heard that they are planning Son of Chucky. if they can match the quality of this film, then maybe this franchise will come back. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.5
