I went to the movies to see Claudine and loved every minute of this actor and soundtrack. Diahann Carroll has never been better than in this role. We saw how Miss Carroll downplayed her eyes, barely saw her naked, smoked a cigarette, drank beer and oh, she cursed. Whenever this film was shown on TV and, finally, on cable, I called my friends to watch it. The soundtrack from the very beginning of the film is simply amazing thanks to Gladys Knight and The Pips. We have seen a black woman who is struggling to raise her children, is having a teenage pregnancy, and in everyday life meets a man whom she finds out later, he has problems. Finally this movie got on a DVD and is well deserved.
