This is an excellent movie. A touching experience filled with real emotions. Here you can learn about love, sex, work, religion and American culture, regardless of sexual preferences. <br /> <br /> Although this film is also a condemning charge of Mormon faith (Latter-day Saint Church) System, any conservative faith can easily take its place. But a little ironic, that now Mormons condemn homosexuality unequivocally. This is the faith that owes to generations that believers practice polygamy! And these true believers refused this practice only because they were forced to do so by the federal government in order for Utah to join the Union. Talk about a unique form of hypocrisy! <br /> <br /> The sex scenes depicted in the unrated version are tasteful and surprisingly short. There is nothing here that could offend anyone impartially. <br /> <br /> This film is so obvious that homosexuality is completely natural for gays, as heterosexuality is for naturals! Although love and sex are completely different needs, they are absolutely beautiful, not to mention the words, when they both occur simultaneously between two adults! Deep erotic love is one of the most valuable gifts of life! My congratulations to the directors for a job well done!
