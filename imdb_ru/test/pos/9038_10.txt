This film was filmed, filmed and first shown in Oxford, Miss., The hometown of William Faulkner, where the book was written in 1948. Most of the extras were locals. I was at Oxford, and this has changed a lot. In this film, Will Gere appears in the role of sheriff, later he was blacklisted. It was the script writers and actors of social dramas, such as this film and Grapes Of Wrath, that were HUAC objects a few years later. I donâ€™t remember whether the actor playing the young boy Mullison (Claude Jarman Jr.) did anything after the TV series Centennial (1978), but he was awesome in this early film. And don't miss Elizabeth Patterson, who later played in Little Women.
