I saw "I smell the dead" - sorry, "I sell the dead" - at the press show. Glenn McQuide, the writer-director-editor of the film, is an Irish guy who presented the film, declaring that, as he goes, he will “go for a pint.” I do not envy him a drink, but, telling us about it, he seemed to feel that he needed to confirm his femininity or Irishness, or both. When the credits began, as usual at press shows, there was loud applause for the names of all the actors or crew members who made friends in the audience, and silence for those who did not. McQuaid is back for witty questions and answers. <br /> <br /> This horror movie doesn’t take itself seriously, which is good, because its humor is much stronger than its horror. Only one scene is even remotely frightening, and most of the “horror” is just rough, but I laughed for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be happening in Ireland around 1850 (the time of the robbery was mostly non-existent). The story is told in the memoirs: we get the memories inside the memories, and the material of the memories of the character telling which he could not know, because sometimes he wasn’t or (in one case) because the action took place behind him. <br /> The story begins with the fact that a prisoner is taken to the guillotine. The guillotines were not used in 19th-century Ireland, but - this time - we do see a believable guillotine sequence. The prisoner fights on the way to the execution, precise rope clips, and the prisoner manages to raise his head to see the blade above his head. (And later the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself will be justified.) <br /> <br /> The characters are supposedly Irish, but one of the main characters speaks Cockney slang: they use phrases like “playing a mug” and “take a butcher” ( for "look"). This time, the cast of the 19th century shows 19th century dental hygiene, but almost all clothes and hairstyles (and women's makeup) are strongly related to the 21st century. I'm not complaining about the case of Heather Bullock, who wears a very attractive black mini-skirt that looks like PVC. Phworr! <br /> <br /> The main actors (except Ron Perlman) are excellent, but most of the actors have no sense of the Victorian period. The worst offender is Joel Garland as a tax collector, whose characteristic is firmly rooted in the twenty-first century. Just when I thought that Garland’s performance could not be less Victorian, he used his fingers to make “ironic” aerial quotes. <br /> <br /> The kits (especially the laboratory of Angus Scrimma) are detailed and impressive, but still could not convince me that people really lived and worked in these places. Almost every interior is lit with candles, but I have never seen what would have been there if they were real Victorian houses or workplaces: the remaining drops from previous candles. <br /> <br /> In one scene there is an alien: I was annoyed that McQuade was full of the stereotypical “gray” alien Stitches, and not something original. <br /> <br /> There are great editing sequences, but McQuaid chooses effects — split screens, pictures from above — that don't serve history. I was impressed by a repeating device with a blue screen that imposes the heads of the main characters on other backgrounds. Less effective was the repetitive motif in the style of “Kripshaw”: pictures from the cameras turn the faces of the actors into drawings that look like pictures from the horrors of 1950s EU comics. I'm a fan of EU comics, but they don't belong to 19th century Ireland. The money that McQuaid spent on a bright F / X photograph — demonstrating his editing skills without telling the story — should have been spent on exact costumes. <br /> <br /> GREAT SPOILERS NOW. Ron Perlman gives Oirish play, full of acting school ticks. Ostensibly playing the Irish priest of the 19th century, he writes with his left hand. (In Victorian Ireland, lefties were punished for using the "devil's hand" and forcibly retrained to become righteous.) But the character Perlman, as it turned out, has a reason for hiding his right hand. Elsewhere, the character is bitten by a zombie, but does not suffer from side effects, so I knew that there would be a payout later. A few scenes that would more logically happen at night are filmed in daylight, apparently only because it was easier and cheaper. (Since McQueid is an experienced director and editor, he could easily shoot day after night ... but using the effect of photographing a process that helps tell a story seems to interest him much less than demonstrating his catchy editing techniques.) <Br / > <br /> McQuade seems to pay homage to these great old horror films of Hummer. But these Hammers were so great because the actors and producers did a great job to convince us that we actually witnessed the events in Whitechapel in 1888 or elsewhere. "I sell the dead" is almost unable to remember the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Glenn McQuade shows talent as a director, screenwriter and editor, but in all three of his aspects, he makes weird choices ... then to a large extent cannot justify these choices. But I liked "I sell the dead." I rate it 7 out of 10, and I look forward to his next movie.
