I was a projectionist in the USA. and remember this movie very well. we just created Stereo Sound !! oh-oh-oh-oh !! Well, it was a big deal in 1959. Instructions came with drums. the overture was played when the image of the projected curtain was closed, and I followed the example of a theater curtain, also closed. for the intermission, the theater curtain was closed, and after five minutes I restarted the film with the projection curtain closed, and the music was used as a call for the second part. Being the first stereo film I've ever seen, and being such a huge piece of music, I certainly enjoyed watching it every time I showed it on the go.
