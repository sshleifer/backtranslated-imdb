One night, after renting One True Thing, I learned to respect my family and not take their health for granted. I have never seen such a real image of a cancer victim on the screen as Meryl. She deserves an Oscar nomination, but she has several strong competitors in the race. All I can say is Beautiful film, great acting from Stripe and Zellwegger. Meryl Streep revealed her true ability in this excellent film!
