It is also the best book I have ever read. Karl Urban and Steve Zahn are great together. It was drama, adventure, sweetness and sadness. I was laughing. I cried. It's hard not to laugh when Gus speaks. I wish Gus would hit Clara like Inez. Clara just led Gus to all these years with no intention of ever marrying him. She just liked to play with him. It was sad that he missed her all his life. It would be nice if Woodrow married Maggie, but she would still die from him. Woodrow was a man who could not express his feelings and restrained them. It was obvious that he loved Maggie after the Austin raid, when the rangers returned, and he ran to embrace her. Val Kilmer plays great characters. I liked his image of Captain Inish's skull. I loved the whole lonely pigeon saga. Comanche Moon is the best of all.
