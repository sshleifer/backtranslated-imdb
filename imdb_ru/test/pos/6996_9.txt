As a sci-fi fan, I also like Alien. But Pitch Black is definitely better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. Fits well in the Alien series. But it is not alien, it is something else. OK, enough comparisons. This film, but I think: why people are afraid of the dark. You cannot escape from darkness. It's impossible. You must face the darkness and the darkness. In this film, I also liked the fact that Vin Diesel's Richard B. Riddick character was not the typical good boy. He had secrets, and he did bad things in the past. For other people, he is a hero who tries to save them all. First of all, he wants to get out of this planet himself. There are other metaphors in this story. Every big fan of science fiction should see this picture.
