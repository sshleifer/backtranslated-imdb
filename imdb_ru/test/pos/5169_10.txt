This movie is my family’s favorite Christmas movie, because it’s a beautiful picture of what Christmas is. These days, living in a big city, which I hate, I love to watch movies about life, which I have always dreamed of. The city in which this film was made is my dream of life, which I have always dreamed of, and of the true sense of community that has been lost in modern society. I really don’t feel the true spirit of Christmas anymore, but watching this movie helps to regain that feeling. My family made this film on TV a long time ago, and now our copy is worn out, so I really would like to buy several copies on DVD for my family and me, if anyone can tell me where I can buy several copies, just send information here and I will continue to check. Thank you.
