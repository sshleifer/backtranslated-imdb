Best British comedy movie! Over the years, English comedy television programs turned into films and failed: “Do you serve?” “Army Dad,” the list goes on. However, the popular dark humorous BBC television show; "Gentlemen's League" managed not only to create a film that did not fail, but also to become the best British comedy film! The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse, with its dark and terrible twists, is the British Talent at its best! His intriguing demonic storyline, written by the League of Gentlemen (Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Rhys Shirsmit and Jeremy Dyson), is combined with the superb play of Gents (and the invited cameos)! This, I hope, is not the end of Royston Vasey, not after this great success anyway! Do not think that if you have not seen the "League of Gentlemen" on TV, you will not understand what is happening. All this is well explained, and by the end of the film you will be pleased with the result, but you are still hungry for more ... Mmmm, Special Stuff.
