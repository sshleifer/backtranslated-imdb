Good movie for horse lovers and most others. This is a movie about horse racing, and this is the movie “Little Man Gets a Chance,” and this is “how far will you go?” movie. Walter Mattau once again proves his adaptability as an actor. It fits like Lloyd Bourdell, a horse bum from Louisiana Cajun. This film gives you a rare glimpse of the Louisiana Cajun horse racing. He has a young four-legged horse, which is the best racer. "There was nothing but a gas station and a good horse." Bourdelles take the opportunity to make it big by taking the horse, Shadow, in Ruidoso, New Mexico, to get ready to run in the All-American Upcoming But how far will Lloyd go to gain fame and fortune? From this film also remember the scenes in which Lloyd spat out tobacco juice and waited for his truck to start.
