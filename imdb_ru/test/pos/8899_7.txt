"Asterix and the Vikings" - this is the first animated film "Asterix" for more than 12 years since 1994, when "Asterix conquers America." He is also honored to be the first digital animation of Asterix in digital color, which makes the exciting story much more exciting. <br /> <br /> Each scene of this film is vividly presented in bright cheerful colors, closely related to the color schemes of the comics on which it was based. Character design also sticks relatively close to comics, for better or for worse, while maintaining a simple but unique look for characters. Being simple in terms of character design, it allows you to spend more time and effort on the animation itself, which, by the way, is superior to many other animated films on the big screen. Character moves are very fluid and have a quality that goes beyond what a modest budget usually gives; in each scene, something always moves, and there are no signs of normal cuts in the animation of cost reduction. 3D computer images are easily integrated with traditionally animated 2D art. In any case, the shading style makes the 3D elements look more like traditional comic book drawings than CGI models. <br /> <br /> The storyline takes most of its elements from the Asterix and Normans comic, and this is where its main flaw lies. As an adaptation of the mentioned comic, Asterix and the Vikings, they get too many liberties with their original material. Comic lovers will certainly not like that they will not like the story of the film and its lack of relationship to the source. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this story can be considered really funny, if taken by itself, without comparing it with the source material. Highly comedic, well-written jokes interrupt the optimistic scenario. The funniest parts were the numerous references of pop culture and ridicule in modern life of the 21st century. Mobile communications, a commercial channel, commercial airlines and even sports cars are forged with great effect. Excellent chemistry and cast of actors (I, by the way, watched it in English), although I found a couple of voices, like Cacofonix, very annoying (but I think this is all part of his character). <br /> <br /> If there is something to criticize about the story, this is the absence of an asterisk. This story seems to be more like the story of Justforkix about teen romance and “adulthood,” when Asterix and Obelix simply play secondary roles. This gives a rather large sense of stagnation, since many elements of the plot are the usual basic elements of such teen films. Derivatives and cliché from time to time, only witty comedy and the traditional elements of Astriks (Romans, pirates, etc.) Managed to save this film from simple mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the best movie in the Asterix Animated Films Library, it’s certainly one of the funniest, scripts and the most beautiful animations. The DVD seems a bit hard to find, though ????????
