The Night Hunter begins in 1968, when young Jack Cutter (Chris Aguilar) unexpectedly passed on the family tradition of becoming a vampire hunter when another vampire hunter Sid O'Mak (Sid Haim) betrays his family and gives them to the vampire. To help Jack in his quest , they give him a book that contains the name of every living vampire, or a dead one, depending on how you look at it ... Go to "June 1995" and Los Angeles, where now is an adult Cutter (Don 'The U Wilson's Dragon, also known as co-producer, only Che left Looking after the names, including Argento (Vins Murdocco) and Carmella (Sophie Crawford), together they are the last of the American vampires. When they all eat in the restaurant, Cutter fails the party and kills them, is the work done right? Wrong, like Vampire King Bruno Fisher ( Nicholas Guest) calls the last four remaining vampires from around the world, French Tournier (Maria Ford), Asian Hashimoto (Ron Yuan), Ulmera (David 'Shark Fralik) and Sangster (Vincent Klin) to hunt down Cutter and kill him. Meanwhile, Detective Hooper (Marcus Aurelius) and Browning (Cash Casey) have no clue, and a curious reporter named Raimi Baker (Melanie Smith) becomes involved in the battle between Cutter and the Vampire, on which the fate of the Earth rests! br /> <br /> Directed by Rick Jacobson. I thought that Night Hunter was a very interesting way to spend more than 85 minutes. William S. Martel’s script mixes martial arts and horror with a fair degree of success, he moves at a good pace and, at least, is never boring and, fortunately, does not take himself too seriously. The names of the characters that refer to other directors / actors of horror films, albeit a bit sticky. Some may be surprised at how closely Night Hunter resembles Blade (1998), but was made a couple of years ago: a long coat alone with a capricious look, dressed as a vampire hunter who turned out to be an expert in martial arts, a nightclub scene and an innocent woman is drawn into the world of vampires. The Night Hunter does not really adhere to the traditional law on vampire films, for example, sunlight only irritates their eyes, they can only multiply during a solar eclipse (why?), Heart stakes and garlic are not suitable as a way to kill a vampire in Night Hunter it's breaking your neck. I could do with a little more horror and a little more blood, because it leans more towards the martial arts. The dialogue is rather obscene, and the characters are pretty cute and stupid. <br /> <br /> Directed by Jacobson doing everything possible to spoil the film, the militants are fine, but lacking something specific, and strange. When the sequence of actions occurs, he constantly shakes his camera, as if the camera fits in full cycle washing machine! Hi, Rick, mate, this is not smart or stylish, this is annoying and annoying. The blood frustrates with several bleeding gunshot wounds and several splashes of blood, breaking the vampire’s neck, unfortunately, a lot of blood is not needed. <br /> <br /> With a budget that probably didn't cost much, Night Hunter wisely done everything. In most cases, the acting was bad, but what about the "Dragon" in the title of Don "The Dragon" Wilson? Did he legally change his name? He signs dragon checks, Wilson ?! Does he receive a letter addressed to him in this name? I think I could do something like this, now I want to be called Paul 'The Killer Klown' Andrews ... <br /> <br /> Night Hunter is one of those crappy movies that goes beyond limits of their limitations and horror. become pure golden entertainment. If you like funny movies, then Night Hunter may be for you, if you are looking for a big budget thrill of the same spirit (! Vampires, veins and blood get it?), Then Blade and its continuations are probably the best choice. What the hell, I liked it, so sue me.
