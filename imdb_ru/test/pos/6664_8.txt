“War Movie” is a Hollywood genre that has been created and reworked so many times that a clichéd dialogue, a rephrased plot and excessive sequences of actions seem inevitable for any conflict involving a large-scale battle. From time to time, however, a war film appears that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and convincing story on a silver screen. The Cold Mountain era of the civil war, with Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger in the lead roles - this is such a film. <br /> <br /> Again, calling for the Cold Mountain “the war film is not entirely accurate. the film begins with (literally) a quick and dirty battle sequence that disgraces the director of Slava, Edward Zwick, but Cold Mountain is not so much about the civil war itself, but about the period and the people. The story tells of the disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who loathes the terrible war and the homesickness for the beautiful village of Cold Mountain, North Carolina, and the equally beautiful southern beauty he left behind, Adou Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman . At first glance, this installation looks like a formula, since the romantic interest of the house arouses enough sympathy among the spectators to support the adversity of reluctant soldiers on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even Something far-fetched. <br /> <br /> “Cold Mountain” soon takes a radical turn, as the fearless hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (accidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederation) and a long odyssey begins home. In the meantime, on the farm, Ada’s cultural methods are of little use in the fields; it soon turns into something like a wild beast. Adie came to the aid of Ruby Tews, who is played by Renee Zellweger, who helps Ade build a farm and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the isolation and isolation that the war seems to have brought to Ada. <br /> <br /> In these two places a vivid, convincing and sometimes very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, reinforced by Brendan Gleason's remarkable performances as Ruby’s ruthless father, Ray Winston as the unrepentant southern “lawyer” and Natalie Portman as the deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All were strongly affected and changed by the "war of the Northern aggression", mostly for the worse. The grim, penetrating anti-war message, accentuated by an effective, haunting score and frighteningly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, was conveyed to the audience not so much by terrible battle scenes as by injured land and injured people for whom the war itself fought Although the weapons and tactics of the war itself changed a lot century, its hellish influence on the earth is relevant out of time. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Minghella manages to keep this dark mood for most of the film, but unfortunately, the atmosphere slanders a rather cool climax that does little fair to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly linked at the beginning and end of the film, although by nature the distant, abstract and even absurd nature of their relationship somehow corresponds to the grim nature of the rest of the plot. <br /> <br /> Don't be mistaken, Cold Mountain has neither the features of a good mood, nor the inspiring military drama. This is a unique vision of the era, which will surely not only entertain, but also truly immerse the audience in the lives of people separated by war and absolutely desperately wanting to completely get rid of its terrible consequences.
