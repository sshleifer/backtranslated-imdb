Every role, even the smallest, was played and played with bravado. <br /> <br /> Unusual Jena Malone never makes a mistake. Her two colleagues are equal to her in this film. Ryan Gosling may be the best actor of his generation. Chris Klein gives his best performance to date. This is a film for reflection and conversation that should be watched by teenagers and young people. You will think and talk about this film for several days. Highly recommended.
