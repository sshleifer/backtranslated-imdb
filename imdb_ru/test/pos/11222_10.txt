I recently visited Sundance, as I often did in past years, and I was treated to small pleasures with sharp little indie, an abundance of dark comedies and now predictable portraits of dysfunction. But then I saw Mark & ​​Michael Polish's Northfork and remembered why I loved films so much. "Northfork" penetrates the screen with visionary courage and returns us to the original early work of Terence Malik and the existential landscapes of Antonioni. This film is impossible to explain, which is one of its strengths. Suffice it to say that this is an adult tale with many carefully thought out levels of meaning. It aroused my imagination and cast a shadow over all the other films I saw this year. This work of painstaking skill and refinement of writing, not found in most American films. I plan to return to this film several times when it comes to the neighborhood theater. Because it is a seductive piece of magic and mystery, a pursuing work where you can wander through the plains of Montana in search of angels and the very nature of heaven and earth. The cast plays this glowing piece with striking conviction, especially James Woods and Nick Nolte, who remind us of the nerve and courage shown throughout their careers. Perhaps Northfork will help us find a new wave of American cinema, where excellence in art and writing becomes the norm rather than the exception. Look when he comes to you and take your friends, because there will be a lot of questions, and the thoughts and feelings caused by watching the film “Northfork” will awaken the memories of the great film that was once seen in your past, and now, I hope may come back with the appearance of the Polish Brothers.
