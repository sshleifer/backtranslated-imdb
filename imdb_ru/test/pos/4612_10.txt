The powerful debut film of Murali K. Tallouri, which tells about the events in the life of a group of high school students, each of whom in one way or another is in crisis. The film begins with the discovery of the body of one of the students, then traces the life of the group in the previous hours, leaving the audience in suspense until the last minutes to learn the identity of the deceased. Each of the main characters is faced with serious stressors that we can consider as potentially contributing to suicide. Unknown actors give performances full of energy and emotion. Fantastically well done, especially considering the youth of a writer / director who was 19 years old when he wrote the script.
