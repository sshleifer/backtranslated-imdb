This film turned out to be what I expected. Of course, it is juicy, of course, it is predictable. We all know the tale. But, knowing that when you go to watch it, it's nice enough to watch. It was fun and cute. It really annoyed me that they showed geeks like children who didn't wash their hair there, or children who loved math and entered math clubs and wore math t-shirts. I was an outcast in high school and I didn't do it. It goes much deeper than that. Having to do with many things, some of which are related to how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and how significant you want to be for other children. Anyway, I will not go into that. I disagree with other opinions that Drew is not convincing as a geek. With braces, no make-up and unwashed hair, I don't think too many people will drool because of her. And even when she returns to high school and dumps these things. She still wears "wrong" clothes, "wrong" hair, and has a "wrong" attitude that can be considered cool. And her other "geek" friend can be beautiful, but no matter where I'm from, you can still be an outcast and be beautiful. (inside and outside)
