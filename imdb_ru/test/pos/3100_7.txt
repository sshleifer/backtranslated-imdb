The characters of Ma & Pa Kettle were very popular and controversial. The films in which their brood was presented paved the way for the television sitcoms, which followed him and sought to emulate his victory formula. One obvious mention is “Beverly Hillbilis”, where the new house was bought with oil money, and not won in the competition. You can even say that the comedy of the 1980s Newhart borrows from this series the idea of ​​backward rural characters. However, I think that Betty MacDonald, an author from Washington who created these characters, did not do more harm than good. Her portrayal of the characters makes them the subject of many jokes in terms of their perceived negligence and laziness. (The real family, on which MacDonald founded Teapots, successfully sued ... claiming that they were ridiculed and humiliated by these less flattering references). Of course, this is a comedy, and situations bring us a huge amount of laughter and funny moments ... and political correctness, as we know it today, was not in the 1940s and 1950s. But I think MacDonald could write these characters more intelligently, and Universal International could get their writers to show them on screen with great dignity (there is such a thing as good taste). More realistic moments when the eldest son Tom is ashamed of his rural heritage, but is learning to accept his parents and brothers and sisters as they are. For their part, teapots should understand that they do not quite fit into the modern world. This is not a joke ... this is sober truth.
