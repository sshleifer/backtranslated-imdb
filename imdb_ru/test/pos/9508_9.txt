This review contains YOUNG SPOILERS, but they are not enough to spoil the story ... <br /> <br /> I watched Nihon Chinbotsu (“Immersion in Japan or Japanese Shells, depending on where you live”) recently, a remake The film of the 1970s is about the same name that was based on the best-selling Sakyu Komatsu. This film is the pearl of Japanese filmmaking. It seems that Japan is sinking due to the subduction of the tectonic plate to the west. Americans predict that this will happen within 40 years, but, according to Dr. Tadkoro (seemingly a “crazy” scientist), this will happen in less than a year. The Japanese government is not so convinced, but it developed a plan for evacuation in case of natural disasters, and also formed a new team D1 to overcome the crisis. During a trip to China to discuss evacuation plans, the Japanese prime minister was killed and sent the office into a state of panic. The D1 team remains to deal with most issues, and is headed by the newly elected Minister of Crisis Management, Saoro Takamori (Dr. Tadkoro's former wife). Instead, she turns to Dr. Tadkoro for advice, and he has plans to punch huge holes near Japan to prevent the diving process. <br /> <br /> Japan will soon have to negotiate with various countries and convince them to accept Japanese refugees. Soon, it seems that many countries no longer want to agree because of the sudden influx of Japanese into their country and the ensuing chaos (if it ever happens, I hope that Ito Misaki will be safe ...) she can always stay at my home ... hee hee). The evacuation scenes are really well done, showing the chaos, suffering, and despair of civilians that they face in such disastrous times. And a lot of people on the surface of man, arrogance, egoism, bribery, courage, cowardice ... <br /> <br /> This is a really well-made film. storytelling is solid, with an attractive storyline and a great game. Dr. Tadkoro (played by Toekawa Etsushi) was very good, he portrayed a divorced and often insane scientist who kicks and smashes things. His frustration and anxiety were very noticeable, and this is really good. Reiko (played by the magnificent Shibasaki Kou) also played quite well, and she has the most memorable line in the whole movie (look at her to find out), and it seems to me that she has a good acting voice. She plays the love interest of Toshio Onodera (played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi from SMAP). Oh, I almost forgot ... she has really very long hair ~ And there is also a thin, but background love story that is well written, and if there is something that the Japanese are doing really well, these are love stories ... <br /> <br /> One thing that makes this film interesting is the technical explanations of what is happening and if you are interested in geography you will have a really good time (I know what I did ... hehe). I see that they did everything possible to make the theory of this film believable, and the first few graphic shows and explanations were done quite well (although you will have to excuse the famous “English” Japanese. <br /> <br /> OK, now about effects (it's all about effects, isn't it?). After watching the movie with pure trepidation, I have to say that this film has special effects that are on the same level (or even better) with some Hollywood performances. Volcanic eruptions. .. massive earthquakes ... destruction I ... the tsunami ... the explosions ... everything was done perfectly. The first scene is so steep, the 1st earthquake takes you by surprise, the mountains are falling, the destruction due to volcanic eruptions makes you cringe ... actually look like Mount Fuji is warming up, it's a miracle ... then you see how Shibuya falls to the ground ... it's so sad !!! However, what I felt was one of the best scenes was a gigantic tsunami scene in which rescue operations fail and people have nowhere to run and there is no hope to hold on to ... the final scene also deserves ivaet mention ... wonderful things. If you like effects, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes ... there is a great song behind every good movie. Seriously exciting "Keep Holding U" performed by the super-sweet and charming SunMin is a duet with Kubota, and it is just superb. I feel that the film really fits well and shows that no matter what kind of disaster hits us, our love and strength will keep us in our hands. Disaster scenes are processed by orchestral music, and sometimes silence (Japanese specialty) and really give a sense of chaos to the destruction on the screen. Oh, and did I mention that this is a really, really, really WIDE screen? Okla continue and continue about this movie. Yes, I liked it, and I hope to see it again ... He has holes in the plot, but all this is excusable, because it was just a great popcorn movie. Not perfect, but really well done. I would give him 9 out of 10. I'm glad to say that the most expensive film in Japanese history is also one of the best. If you haven't watched it, you really should today ... it MUST WATCH!
