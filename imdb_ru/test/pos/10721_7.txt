Not to mention the words, this heartbreaking story of a divorce led to a tragic battle for custody of a seven-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> One of the strengths of Kramer vs. Kramer is screenwriter director Robert Benton, who surprisingly adapted Avery Corman’s novel to the big screen. He keeps things beautifully simple and most realistic, conveying all the drama right from the heart. His talent for telling such emotional tales was to show himself again in Places in the Heart, where, like Kramer vs. Kramer, he showed that he has a natural ability to work with children. <br /> <Another strong point of the picture is a gorgeous game, deservedly winning four of nine Academy Award nominations, two of which are winning. One of them was Dustin Hoffman (best actor), excellent as an upset businessman Ted Kramer, a man who forgot that his wife is a man. As Joan's wife said, Meryl Streep demanded from the support actress Oscar a strong, sensitive image of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage. Jane Alexander was also nominated for her fantastic twist as Cramer's good friend Margaret. The last word in the acting game should go to the young Justin Henry, whose incredibly touching performance will make you suppress tears again and again, and the Oscar nomination got in his way. <br /> <br /> Glorious and Nestor Almendros “Cinematography and timely editing by Jerry Greenberg, while the musical piece by Henry Purcell is used to produce the effect. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this is a touching story about how father and son depend on each other when their wife and mother leaves. They grow together, get to know each other and create a completely new and wonderful relationship. Ted reveals himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life, and gradually comes to understand why Joanna had to leave. <br /> <br /> Of course, if nothing else, Kramer vs. Kramer demonstrates that no one wins when he comes to the battle for custody of a small child, especially not the child himself. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 10, 1995 - TV <br /> <br /> Powerful drama from Avery Corman's novel about heartache The battle for custody between alienated parents who feel they have the best interests in their souls baby In addition to the magnificent script and surprisingly controlled director, as from Robert Benton, this is an excellent cast, which makes this picture such a winner. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is great like Ted Kramer, a man torn between his glittering career and a son he desperately wants to save. Streep is also great because a woman lost in eight years of marriage had to leave before she disappeared as a person. In support of these two, Jane Alexander is playing very strong as a common friend of Margaret, an outstanding Justin Henry in the role of a boy caught in the middle, and the cast of the highest level. <br /> <br /> This very emotional, heart-rending drama is more than deserved - the 1979 Academy Award for best film, best male role (Hoffman) and best supporting actress (Strip). <br /> <br /> Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - Television
