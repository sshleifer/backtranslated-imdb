If this film is carefully studied, it is a little sad. This is detailed enough to address the very real problems of children who grow up in poor, dysfunctional conditions. Nevertheless, he retains his comedic value thanks to the energetic performances of Diaann Carroll and James Earl Jones. Sadness lies in the struggle and dysfunction of the mother (Carroll), who cannot truly help her children, not because she does not want or does not try, but because, obviously, she does not know how. Remember, this is a comedy, but if you have never seen it, or if you have seen it, watch this movie and see humanity in the characters. Good film
