Another nice Warner movie. I really liked John Garfield in this, although I wonder why Kagney was not in this role. Maybe it was too much like angels with dirty faces? I mean, this is another kind of Dead End Kids story, but I really appreciate them here, and this movie had many nice comic touches and good serious drama. The guys work great with Garfield. The good sequence was the whole “swimming” scene, which starts without worries, but ends too close to a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> One negative comment: Claude Raines was extremely mistaken. As a detective, a wonderful actor seemed out of place here, like a nun in a brothel.
