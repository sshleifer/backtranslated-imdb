Although several scenes of Wirey Spindell can be described as "over." I thought it was nice to see something that is ready to go to the level of confusing comedy. <br /> <br /> Wirey Spindell is a great movie with great dialogue. I would not say that this film is for everyone, but this film is on my top 10 list. <br /> <br /> If you can look beyond his casual insults and watch him on this film, I would hope you could see it in the same light as me.
