This movie is absolutely awesome. From the performances of Huppert, Girardot and Magimel to the script and direction Haneke there is not a single mistake. The film may alienate some people with its tough sexual themes and a slower pace, but this is really a masterpiece of the movie ... so don't let its complicated ways keep you aside! <br /> <br /> Powerful and deserves every award in Cannes!
