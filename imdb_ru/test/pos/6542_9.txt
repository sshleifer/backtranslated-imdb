This is the best car movie (this is a work of art / YER - a work of art!). All classic cars are not plastic fiction, I watched it again and again, I raped two videotapes and weighed a lot more. Many car lovers, young and old, will love this movie and watch it more than once! so rent it or buy it (just look) I would like them to shoot more (car) films like this V8 power, do not obscure the small talkers-hooligans !!!! <br /> <br /> (yes, 351 right?) (motor magic) (a lot of chariot) <br /> <br /> (you need to learn to feel the power)
