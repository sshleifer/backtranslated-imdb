every genius in something. Albert Einstein was a genius in science, William Shakespeare was a genius in literature, and the boys from War Hunters were true comedy geniuses in everything. Their satirical television show is a permanent hit of the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). After a small start as a satirical newspaper, the popularity of the hunters took off when they were given their own television show. Never stop arguing with actors who will do everything, even if they are arrested. Chris Taylor goes to Sunrise, a very popular morning television show on the air, and tells his partner that he doesn’t feel at ease; he creates a fake motorcade, drives into APEC’s advanced security zone and makes a very funny satire of Australian nicotine advertising, performing following actions: smokers around shout "NO GERY NO NO GERY NO". Despite the inconsistency, the show is becoming more fun and worthy of showing for many years.
