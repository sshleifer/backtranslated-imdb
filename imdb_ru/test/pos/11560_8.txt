Harvey Keitel demonstrates typical superb performance in one of his first major roles as a daring, ambitious, uncompromising young full-time producer Coleman Backmaster, a real talented director with an insightful golden ear and son of the famous jazz pianist Download. Coleman wants to record several tracks using the band's smoky R & B outfit (none other than Earth, Wind & Fire in their stunningly cool prime), but his tough commercial greedy label A-Chord Records is run by a tense, mob-connected middleman. Jerry Road Square (duly unified Ed Nelson) wants him to record a hit single for the terribly tasteless pop trio Carpenters, Pap, supposedly creaking clean band, which includes a smart pedophile stepfather Franklin (completely sneaky) Bert Parks) , the bitchy, neurotic daughter Velor (a beautiful, frivolous turn from a cheerful, pretty brunette Cynthia Bostwick) and a hedonistic wacky son Gary (former youthful comedian of the 50s Jimmy Boyd). An extremely naive and idealistic Coleman must quickly understand how the music business actually works, and play the dirty dirty game as best as possible, otherwise he will lose both the Group and his authority. <br /> <br /> Accepting harsh words, A harsh, aggressively harsh and impartial script from a syndicated columnist and rock journalist Robert Lipsayt, director Sig Shore (who is best known for producing "Superfly"), demonstrates a decidedly cynical and unflattering description various bribes, payouts, unfulfilled promises, backwards - beats, duplicates and double relationships, which are an unpleasant, but integral part of a largely corrupt rock music business, with especially thoughtful thematic ektami related art and commerce, the struggle for the preservation of artistic integrity and the recent commitment to homogenization in soft rock, a useless, creatively stagnant respectability. In addition, this rocky, depressing gem offers a rare, exciting, minutely detailed and believable glimpse backstage during the recording process, when cowboy cantilever booth recording Coleman diligently tries to “make chicken chicken salad” with his own words. The graceful beats featured a disc jockey and the legendary “fifth Beatle” Murray K as the wicked, depraved DJ Big John Little (Velor bites her hand after Big John caresses her hip during a live on-air interview!), New York soul music Frankie Crocker, DJ and host of NBC's "Friday Night Videos" as the most jazz musician, singer and songwriter for R & B Doris Troy (she composed the wonderful "Just One Look") as a church pianist and the plump, bald 70s Blacks exploiter beloved Charles MacGregor as a priest at the wedding. The rather poor sound and sloppy cinematography of Allan Metzger is inadvertently added to the total tattered, rough worldwide authenticity of the documentary style. Although technically this is a bit lacking, this film as a whole is still considered to be one of the greatest, most bitterly pessimistic unnoticed backstage stones of stone mining from the 70s.
