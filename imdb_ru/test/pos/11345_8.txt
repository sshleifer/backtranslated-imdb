In Hong Kong in 1962, editor Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife, as well as secretary Su Li-Zhen Chang (Maggie Cheung) and her husband, simultaneously moved to an old building. Each couple has just rented a room in an apartment on the same floor. Their wife and husband are far away from home most of the time, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like kung fu stories, noodles, and soap from a restaurant near the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a kind of platonic and repressed love. Later, they realize that their buddies have a romance, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and probably the depressed state of a married woman support her love on a platonic level. "In the Mood for Love" is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photo and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film did not have a script, and the actors were never sure that they would shoot. Later, the director edited his story based on the plot. When Chow moved to Singapore, it was in this story for many years until 1966, when his conclusion was deliberately open and not very clearly defined, leaving questions such as who the boy is with Li-Zhen.
