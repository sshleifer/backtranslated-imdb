I think that this television film was first shown the same week when Manchester United played in the Champions League final (1999), this week they shot a lot of football items, and this film was the absolute winner. It played on all the clich√©s that are released every season during the FA Cup, that is, brave outsiders, lucky clothes / talismans, a cup name, etc., and this turned out to be incredibly funny. surprised that it never happened before other big football events, even now when the world championship is just beginning. <br /> <br /> In several previous posts from fans who are not football players, it was said that they still love him, but a football fan would find that ridiculous imho.
