Perhaps this is not the most exciting or unbelievable episode that they did, but, in my opinion, it remains one of the most original episodes from Star Trek and the science fiction genre. Most of the ideas from the retro-fiction series, especially Star Trek, have been reused several times, this one, on the other hand, remains mostly a one-time triumph. This is among the episodes that impressed me the most at the end. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about this episode is how he managed to create such an exciting and exciting story with so few special effects. Now, without criticizing the episode, I have to admit that the effects are very outdated, but again, what can you expect from the 1967 TV show? But still the creature (“ort”) in this episode is basically just a carpet with some kind of colored rubber on it. And yet you forget about it after about 1 minute and start thinking of it as what it should be. In addition, the caves are not exactly like rocks, but you forget about it again after a few minutes. This episode is a living proof of how good acting and a good story can make you ignore visual effects. <br /> <br /> As usual, great to play in the title role. This episode features Spock’s Second Opinion series and is one of my favorites. In simple terms, Leonard Nimoy is definitely stolen here, and his acting is great. Not that Kirk or Bones didn’t get their share of the episode, but Spock is the most intriguing one. I like the fact that the episode is not about one particular character, but develops around a trio dealing with the problem of aliens. It is also nice to see an episode that happens not only on the Enterprise. <br /> <br /> As with most Star Trek episodes, this episode tells us about impartiality. I will not spoil the story, but develops around what seems like a typical monster story in the beginning. He killed several people and therefore must be killed. But is it really? I can assure you that the explanation in the end will not disappoint you. This is still my favorite episode of Star Trek TOS, and I put it on 10/10.
