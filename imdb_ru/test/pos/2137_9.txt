I like to walk around the museum. You can appreciate the great talent of the main composer Michael Cimino and this incredible artistic inventor of light. As I said, I like to be in heaven, revealing all the creations that this person can apply to one frame. Imagine when you can look at a moving picture of this artist. I can say: this film is one of the best.
