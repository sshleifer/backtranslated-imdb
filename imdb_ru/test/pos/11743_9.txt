This film always hits me hard at the end. Although the film’s problems — interracial romance and adultery — were controversial at the time, this film goes far beyond these narrow parameters of innovative novelty and unique uniqueness. Here we have a true love story, written by a woman involved in this novel, told in a brilliant aggressive style that extols the dignity and glory of insane passionate love. I “love” this endorsement of the only emotion that makes life truly worthy of life. Jennifer Jones is full of grace, and William Holden is just great as a reporter. A wonderful film that only people who were in such love can appreciate and understand. And for those who have not yet been in love, even one hope that one day lightning can strike you makes life worthy of life - because love is worth having, even if, but not for long - even if you lose - because love is " material "- essence - of life. This movie works for me. Warm experience!
