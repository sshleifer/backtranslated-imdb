This is my favorite movie of all time. And I always think of it as a requiem for John Houston. <br /> <br /> I must have seen it at least 20 times and never get tired of it. Mood, script, singing, dinner - it's like being invited to someone's house and watching events and not having the opportunity to participate, even if you want ... This is a rare treasure, this film, and I can't write enough praise for that. <br /> <br /> This is an incredibly good cast, with several faces in the Abbey Theater, as well as Frank Patterson's wonderful tenor voice. The poem by Lady Gregory, narrated in the film, is one of the most touching poems ever written. The Angelica scene, going down the stairs when she is listening to a song, is one of the best performances that have ever been seen in the film. I cry every time I see it ... for all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> We all lost love at an early age and cry for our young hopeful selves. <br /> <br /> Donal McCann starred in too few films that I like, he just loved the stage work and stuck with it, and it’s our loss that we don’t have his performances in the film anymore, because he does so much with this delicate role of expression and the image of deep love for his wife, who will never reciprocate, and he conveys such an inner sadness, knowing this. <br /> <br /> If you want your films and plot to be full, avoid it, you really don’t have it, or just throw a lens on characters at a dinner in Dublin 80 years ago, and all the little nuances and shadows of personalities are portrayed so beautiful. <br /> <br /> Bravo to all who participated in this performance. 10 out of 10.
