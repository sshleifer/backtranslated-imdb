I cannot but agree with the previous comment that “Driving Lessons” is more than a little tweet, but the accusation of one person is the support of another, I suppose. In my book this film succeeds in pure charisma, a considerable feat in itself. <br /> <br /> I can not wish that the story was a little less traditional, given the number of acting talents, but the end of the plot in any case looks like a backdrop for the interaction of characters. Dame Julie Walters, Evie, perfectly copes with the actress. Although Evie did not have a permanent job for many years, it is unclear when she visited reality for the last time, if ever (recall Edina from AbFab at 65, at some point she even had to fight its kitsch factor). Some may find it annoying, but I think it makes sense to emphasize how much she pushes Ben (Rupert Grint) reserved buttons to pull him out of her sink. Ben is equally isolated from reality, living his whole life under the thumb of his overly dependent mother, whom Laura Linney manages to breathe in some life, despite the fact that he is a rather one-dimensional character (you are an old powerful religious mother). I was quite impressed with Rupert Grint, whom I found a very honest and believable performance (not to mention how sweet, how everything got out), I can not remember many teenage actors today for whom I can say this. <Br /> <br /> The heart of the movie is what happens when the worlds of Ben and Evie collide. At first, Ben is understandably unsure, but also intrigued, because Evie is essentially the antithesis of everything he has ever known. Through a combination of Evie’s perseverance and Ben’s helpful nature, genuine sweetness develops between them, culminating in an incredible journey that gives Ben his first true taste of independence. <br /> <br /> The tone remains consistently light, even after a few people. Short melodramatic beats, but still there was an amazing amount of emotional resonance, the merit of the main actors. In general, I would say that if you are ready to sit back and allow yourself to be enchanted by some wonderful performances, “Driving Lessons” should not be disappointing. However, if “cute” is not in the vocabulary of your movie, it’s best to stay away. <br /> <br /> Another small note: the music of Sufyan Stevens stands out on the soundtrack, a pleasant touch.
