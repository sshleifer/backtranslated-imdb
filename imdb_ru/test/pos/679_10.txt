Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30s, 40s and 50s, you were guaranteed great entertainment, even if the image was black and white. Ida was able to capture the audience and keep them fascinated until the very end of her paintings. In this film, in the role of Mrs. Helen Gordon, "The High Sierra", 41 years together with Robert Ryan, (Howard Wilton), "Golden Gloves", 40 she forces you to guess how relationships will develop and how poor Mrs. Gordon can have a normal and happy marriage with love and true love. If you liked Ida Lupino, who could play the role of a criminal in a women's prison and hate a prison guard, you will like this movie. I truly believe that Ida Lupino did not receive the true recognition that she deserved for her great talents in the film industry !!!
