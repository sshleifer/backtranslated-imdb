Many years have passed since I saw these shows. For years I have been searching for someone else who saw them or knew something about them. I thought I made them. the one I remember most is the soldier and death. I would ask movie fans if they saw it, mentioning that it was Jim Henson, and people still don't know. these are wonderful fables. when I was this, I was very young, not even 10, and it left a lasting impression on my life and beliefs. I would recommend everyone to watch them, just remember that they are from the 80s so that they do not look like films today. just give them a chance. Jim Henson was well ahead of his time and died early.
