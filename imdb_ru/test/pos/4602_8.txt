There is no other word for this ... Fox threw it away without any marketing. No one in the country, except those who were looking forward to this film, knows nothing about it. All red flags soared. It must be a mess, it may not be as good as an office space, right? Wrong. Although Office Space is not, this film definitely has a satirical bite and wit. On some levels this is a misfire, but who is to blame remains a mystery. <br /> <br /> Based on what is currently shown in cinemas, I can say that IDIOCRACY is a good film. It's funny, sometimes funny. It is effective, sometimes ingenious. The fact that this is not as far as I can tell is over. We will again see something from this film, whether it be an extended cut or re-filming. Alone, it can be fun. From time to time it's stupid. <br /> <br /> Leaving the theater, looking around the shopping center, I was surrounded by advertising and billboards, commerce and stupidity. This is not such a damned dystopia as in 1984, but this film paints an ugly future for our culture. And it seems no one can do anything about it. In any case, go look at it, if you can, and try to find out what happened, that it was specially buried.
