Not only is it difficult to separately comment on the three parts of the Kislovsky trilogy, but it’s also obvious that the director wants us to do the exact opposite: review them in order, Blue, White and Red, and view them together as one finished work. However, these are different stories with different themes: freedom, equality, fraternity, and each of them is designed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry. Each of them should be seen independently, but I consider that they are best of all considered as one work. Together, I would rate the trilogy as 9; Separately, I put each of them in the top ten for 1993 and 1994. <br /> <br /> Red is most remembered in the third film as a billboard background, the profile model of which is the central of the three main characters of the film. The other two characters make a double double with varying degrees of recognition when they first encounter advertising placed more than life, near a busy crossroad of the city. This ad is not the main part of the plot of this film, but its image is striking and is one of the reasons why I called the film “Red” “stunning”. This is Keslovsky's third trilogy "Three Colors", based on the blue-white-red French flag and the three parts of his motto "Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood." Films are still focused mainly on these themes, adhering to the basic levels of one, two or three main characters, but with each film the complexity of the plot increases as the three principles move from fundamentally personal (Liberty, Blue) to relational (Equality White ) in social. (Brotherhood, Red). Red is my favorite of these films, and I give it 9. It stands as an excellent film, but for the full effect you must first watch Blue-White.
