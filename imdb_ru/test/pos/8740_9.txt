This film did not quite stay fresh in the minds of movie lovers, and this is a deplorable disgrace. His ingenious adaptation of the script should have received an Oscar nomination for the great screenwriter I.AL. Brilliant adaptation and flawless work by Ingrid Bergman. For Goldie Hawn, at such a young age, it must have been an honor to work with Bergman, who looked more than ten years younger than his 54 years — fifty-four! When it is on the screen, it flickers positively. <br /> <br /> This is a film that may seem outdated, but in fact it made me regret that I was in the sixties. Houn's fashion is as tasteless as Bergman's. (This is one small drawback - isn't her heroine too much for a girl who still lives with her sister? But then again, we will have Ingrid in a different way?) And who wouldn't want to hang out at a nightclub called “Slipped Disc”. <br /> <br /> The best compliment I can make in this film is that for some reason he gave me nostalgia for a decade that I had never seen, and that he left me wanting more. Speaking about the desire for more, I wonder what happened to the second sex actor Rick Lentz? (He looks like Griffin Dunn in this film.) It was his film debut, and I see no other major roles in his filmography. As for Goldie Hawn, she has since done so much that I was not impressed, but I cannot imagine another actor in this role. <br /> <br /> Since the film is based on a play, the delivery of the line may seem a bit scenic, but this did not prevent me from having fun. In fact, I am amazed at how ridiculous it is after thirty-five years. Since this film represents a bygone era, he unfairly slipped out of the mind of movie lovers. It is more connected with the films of the era, which were before him, than with the subsequent ones. But do not let this stop you from enjoying the pleasures that he has to offer. Excellent rating
