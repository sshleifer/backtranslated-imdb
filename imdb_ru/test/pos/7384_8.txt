I really liked this movie. I thought it was very well done. The interaction of the character was perfectly done, as was the characterization. The actors were definitely believable. The plot was very deep and intriguing. Although its parts are a bit slow and sometimes boring, it is definitely worth seeing a few times. The chemistry between the three main actors was great. If you don't want to watch it, then at least look at the drama between the characters. I mean, it was all just "Wow!" As if I could not look away. The whole film captured my attention and kept my interest, even through the slow parts. I liked this movie and almost everything about it. I liked the final because it was so interesting, and if you watch the movie a second time, thatâ€™s quite logical. But I do not spoil anything.
