George Armstrong Custer is known in history as an inept general who led his regiment to his death in the battle for the Little Big Horn. "They died in their boots," draws another picture of General Custer. In this film, he is portrayed as a bright soldier, whose mistakes and misdeeds are mainly related to his love of adventure. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong Custer, whom we first met as a confident recruit at West Point, Custer quickly distinguishes himself from other cadets, believing that he is a poor student who always has problems. Somehow, this never bothers Custer and only confuses him, since he sincerely does not know how he gets into such difficulties. Despite his poor position, he eventually ends up and becomes an officer in the United States Army. By mistake, Caster is promoted in rank. Before this can be corrected, he leads a regiment of the Union into battle against the Confederates. His campaign is successful, and Caster becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, marries his beloved Libby, played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is a very supportive understanding wife who stays steadfastly next to him and follows him into the border when he takes the lead of the Seventh Cavalry Regiment. Custer becomes a man of honor who seeks to maintain peace with Native Americans. To prove his intentions, he enters into a contract with the Mad Horse, the leader of the Sioux. When this treaty is endangered by conspiracy to spread false rumors of gold found on the Black Hills, Caster sacrifices his own life, as well as the lives of people under his command, to prevent the killing of thousands of innocent settlers. /> <br /> Errol Flynn dominates every scene in which he appears. He successfully portrays Custer as bright, arrogant, romantic and funny, depending on the mood of the scene. Olivia De Havilland, depicting Libby Bacon Custer as the love of his life, allows us to see his tender, more tender side. The chemistry between De Havilland and Flynn, which was filmed together in several other films, is so smooth that it almost makes the viewer feel that they are playing themselves and not the roles of Custer and his wife. Other actors portray their heroes for real, reinforcing Flynn and De Havillandâ€™s performances. Anthony Quinn as the Crazy Horse, Sydney Greenstreet as General Winfield Scott, Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp and other actors whose roles made this film interesting. <br /> <br /> A reviewer will appreciate this 4-star film. Although it is not historically accurate, it is very interesting. The film has a bit of everything. It has adventures, comedy and romance, so it attracts a wide variety of audiences. The cast of characters is superb, and the actors give believable ideas that make you forget that this is largely based on fiction, not facts. The reviewer especially likes that Native Americans were not shown by the bad guys, but simply showed that they wanted to protect their sacred land. <br /> <br />
