Philip Garrel makes us breathe in the forgotten atmosphere of the “New Car”, almost lost among the remnants of its ancient splendor, but ready to rise from the ashes, if we recall the past. On the other hand, those who are a little familiar with the director's objects may very well know how obsessed he is with a lingering sense of loss regarding the variability of reality. “Les amants réguliers”, therefore, shows us the parallel stories of “amour fou” and the sophisticated revolution destroyed under the guidance of young French students. <br /> <br /> The first part of this story is about the dramatic events of May '68 in France, caused by a series of amazing planning plans, a kind of cinematic style that put the student uprising in anything but enviable light on a completely black background. <br /> Much can be said about the features of black and white photography used to describe the battle between students and the police, where high contrasts give an unrealistic atmosphere to the episodes, and the darkness locks onto the excited bodies in secret. Images completely devoid of words show the real sequence of a myth made of brutal violence, increasingly emphasized by the annoyed reality of filming the film. Here, a person does not consider anything at all: he tends to disappear en masse. What is really important in these scenes of struggle is the value of mass suggestion, the blind rage of the juvenile attack, the sinister speeches of the forces of the crowd, even if they are perceived as separate entities, different from any emotions, with cold and Distant view of an entomologist who intends to catalog his collection insects. <br /> <br /> The second part of the story is described more quietly and intimately. A horrifying portrait of an egocentric generation looms on the horizon in search of their lost time, completely disappointed by the individual values ​​of people who tend to rotate around their axis between pairs of opium and deliver a funeral speech in praising their recent defeat. <br /> <br /> “Les amants réguliers” seems to occasionally evoke the shadow of the great Robert Bresson, is revised and corrected taking into account Garrel’s particular sensitivity, without departing from the main argument, trying to expand on the whole the views on the subject of man’s disappointments, which, though painful, can lead us to the truth. In my opinion, trying to get deep into the essence of the story, if a person allows himself to play and play by ear, he is likely to find that he can reveal the dark side of himself with terrible and irrevocable consequences.
