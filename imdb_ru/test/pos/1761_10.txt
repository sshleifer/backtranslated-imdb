Hoppity Goes to Town was the second and last full-length animation created by Max and Dave Fleischer, who created a parallel universe for Disney. While Disney films are well remembered today, both Fleischer’s Gulliver's Travels films and this one are forgotten. <br /> <br /> “Hoppity” is a fascinating original, not an adaptation, similar to the first picture. This is a major plus, you might think. No, critics, rarely on the side of the Fleischers, tore them for it. Yes, the story is not as tough as Gulliver, but how can you hate a film that flaunts so joyfully? <br /> <br /> It is filled with magnificent musical numbers and a very fascinating story, which is a crime to solve. The characters are cute and charming, and there is a heart in this movie. <br /> <br /> The Fleisser really outdid themselves here and never did it again. Most of their time will be allotted to odnopilenschik after they are abandoned at the box office. It's a shame that they did not continue to make traits. Who knows? Their next attempt might have become the masterpiece they were aiming for. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
