Farscape is the best sci-fi show period, for one main reason, everything he is trying to do is very good. From a technical point of view, the music is original and fits perfectly into the show. Special effects are abundance and higher quality than almost everything you see on your TV. The acting is also great, too many shows are currently using only the American market actors for their shows. Remember when you first saw the Matrix and said: wow, where did this agent Smith come from? This is the same feeling that you are watching Claudia Black, Anthony Simcoe, Lani Tupu, Virginia Hay and especially Wayne Paygram. These Australians are great, and this is happening in this great show. <br /> <br /> The plot is unmatched. The next thing I can remember is Babylon 5 during the episodes of the shadow wars, but it is even higher. It is a real pleasure to watch the sequence of all the episodes again, the subtleties of the interpersonal relationships of the characters are well written and executed. The overall plot is original and very interesting. I always crave the next show. <br /> <br /> Comic episodes are funny, dramatic episodes are touching, and action movies are tense. At the beginning of the second season there were some great comedy episodes that made me laugh out loud, which rarely happens while watching TV, except for South Park, Sealab 2021 or Seinfeld. The drama is even more complicated, regardless of whether Crichton meets with his mother or the characters face their mortality, everything is done with soul and intensity. Finally, it goes without saying that the action - the top. It's fantastic. <br /> <br /> If you are fond of science fiction in the slightest degree, if you like good television at all, if you like a good serialized plot, you must watch Farscape. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Ben Browder owns.
