I just got back from watching this brilliantly funny movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I kind of loved him because I could point out people and places I knew (“I go there every day!”, “I work there!”, “I had drinks there ! "," Hey! This is our postman! ", Etc.). but, nevertheless, if you crave “well-being” with a small amount of spices (sorry for the pun), this is just the right answer. Relationship, culture and, most importantly, love are woven together in a plot. <br /> <br /> Preston (where the film is being shot) has recently turned into a city, and it's nice to see that this work shows the place and addition to the sense of sunrise. he is also a prominent representative of many cultures in this part of the north. <br /> <br /> Amazing!
