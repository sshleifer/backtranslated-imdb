There is drama, tension and character development that you will enjoy, if you like drama that enthralls and entertains and educates. <br /> <br /> Authors know their material, and it shows. The direction is always fascinating and not blissful, but acting amazing. Why this show won no awards tells me that the “forces that exist” at Hollyweird do not know the drama or anything else in this regard. <br /> <br /> In this episode, the turn of the plot at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played. I am glad that it was not used as a shock scene for any climatic end of this series, which would be more typical and boring. Rent this series immediately! Let's hope that it is back to the disappearance of celluloids.
