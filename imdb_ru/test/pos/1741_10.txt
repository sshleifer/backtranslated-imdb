I liked this show. Such a talent; and I am so disappointed that it is canceled, only after the start. I have been looking forward to this show all week. And very sorry for people who were hoping to become one. I would really like to see who would win. It has just begun, and in my opinion it should not have been reversed. I hope that these young artists were noticed by talented scouts and have the opportunity to achieve their goals. I voted and sat waiting for him to appear; never knowing that it was canceled. And I could not believe what it was. I am amazed that he had low marks; because it was, in my opinion, one of the best reality shows on television.
