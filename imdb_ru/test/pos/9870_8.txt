... I do not like this film, and everyone will understand why. The plot is bad, as is acting. But, in my opinion, this is better than Halloween 5, although even this does not give a lot of amazing moments. Several scenes are really well directed. But these few moments do not give a reason to rent it. I do not despise the violence in the movie, but H6 shows unusually strong and bloody scenes that do not fit the Halloween tradition. The most lame aspect in H6 is the lack of voltage. There is no comparison with the first masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 gets only 4 out of 10 stars from me. If you want, rent it. But do not expect a big horror .... <br /> <br />
