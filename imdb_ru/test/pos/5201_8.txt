This film tries to escape to the typical “I fight, because I am obliged to defend the fatherland. The Nazis are all bad guys, I am against them ”(typical of German war films). How? Not to mention this too much, but simply referring to the war and prisoners of war. However, I would like to see a German film that would be somewhere between Come and See and the "bad Nazi" Das Boot. I say this because, excluding this factor, German films are the best, depicting the 2nd World War and the German side. You can easily see some German hierarchical relationships, very different from those in the US Army. <br /> <br /> This is a film that is trying to really understand what Stalingrad is, and I wasn’t there, and I doubt that most people were there now, but if I chose one film depicting this battle, sure the whole American enemy at the gates would not be. Why am I saying this? Because even the best soldiers are not heroes, and, given the conditions, they can count their lives instead of the fatherland. This applies to all discharges, and at the end you see von Paulus giving an example.
