<br /> <br /> It is well known and said earlier: no one can play Scarlett and Ratt, like Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable. Joan Wally Kilmer (no longer Kilmer, divorced from ex-husband Val Kilmer) plays her own Scarlett, and although this is a continuation and not a remake (God forbid !!!), she still cannot match the occasion (that is, her voice sounds angry several times, she has brown eyes [Scarlett had green eyes in both novels, and even Vivien Lee's eyes were green], and her vocal power was also not suitable for work. Scarlett is a southern beauty, so she has an incredible talent for flirting (as she did in the Scarlett novel and GWTW, of course) and to that would be a great flirtation like Scarlett, you will most likely need a higher voice like Vivien Leigh. <br /> <br /> I suppose I compare Kilmer and Lee too much, but when someone plays the same role as Lee, with Scarlett, you just can’t help but criticize any new Scarlett alleged. Timothy Dalton should have had no accent because both Margaret Mitchell Rhett and Gable in the fi I haven’t had one. His actions were never truly remarkable (except, perhaps, for his images of evil, indulging King Philip of France in The Lion in Winter), and he gives very little (if any) of freshness or vitality to his Rettu. <br /> <br /> Tina Kellaher (a born actress with enough credibility in her release) as Mary Boyle’s tragic victim is a prominent actor in the lead role. And, of course, Sean Bean is cold, calculating and not to mention the almost demonically evil Lord Fenton, the sworn enemy of Mary and the possible violator Scarlett. What I could not forgive the writer for is that Scarlett was raped in this film (a fact that has never been met in the novel; Lord Fenton is cold and ill-known among the Irish in the book, but he is not so heartless). as its on-screen counterpart. Another omission in the novel, but readable for the film, is the character Belle Watling, who was badly played by Ann-Margret in a cameo role, without which we could all live, seeing how the book was such a runaway bestseller, without requiring any help from Miss Watling . <br /> <br /> For the film itself, SCARLETT is very good, but not quite in the sense that it is “DELETED WITH WINDS”. Continuation. Another actress was badly needed for Scarlett and Rett. <br /> <br />
