I would not be sure that DNA tests will be irrefutable evidence against Anna Anderson. First read the book by Peter Kurt on which this film is based. Anna Anderson knew things that only the real Grand Duchess Anastasia could know (except for judicial evidence in favor of Anna). Secondly, compare the pictures of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Anyone can see that they are one and the same person. Third, visit Peter Kurt's website (URL below), where you can read detailed information about DNA tests, and why Franciska Shankovskaya and Anna Anderson are not the same person (scroll down to the ANNA ANASTASIA. ”“). Even Shantskovskaya’s relatives believed that their sister and Anna Anderson were not one and the same person. <br /> <br /> I will always believe that E.SN Anastasia Romanova and Anna Anderson really were one and the same person; I will never be inclined to the opposite. <br /> <br /> www.peterkurth.com
