When I first saw the poster of this film, I dropped it as another low-budget film targeting young people. A few days later, when he finally got to the theaters, one of my friends told me that he was good. <br /> <br /> A year later, when I first saw an advertisement, Anand was going on television, and finally the moment came when I switched channels, and for a moment I stopped to watch, that's all, in the end I watched the whole film. <br /> <br /> And after 3 years, I watched a movie at least 7-8 times, and I donâ€™t watch movies again and again !! <br /> <br /> This film is great because it tries to be different when all Telugu films were made up of 6 songs and 4 fights. <br /> <br /> This is a simple film, a bit slow, but very exciting script, there are no empty ends in the film, very well-understood dialogues that are really, very difficult to find. <br /> <br /> Classical and soothing music, magnificent performances by Radha Krishnan, some wonderful kirtans also appear in bgmusic, through the film. <br /> <br /> Cinematography deserves mention. Editing is not smooth, but adequate for a romantic such as this. <br /> <br /> But what really hits you in this film are two things: 1. how each scene was received with the utmost respect, the now famous Shekar Kammula. <br /> <br /> 2. The beautiful lyrics of Veturi. <br /> <br /> And one more thing deserves special mention, Kamalini, part of her success, attributed to Sunita, because she gave her such a beautiful voice. me. <br /> <br /> Other actors are equally good, the main role Raj and the little girl, and the way she screams when she gets a new dog. <br /> <br /> In the end, I can tell you that this film will soon become another classic film with the old classic romantic, along with another classic romantic piece by Kammuly, Godavari.
