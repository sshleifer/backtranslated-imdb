I caught this little gem by accident in 1980 or '81. I was in the awakening theater to watch two old stupid science fiction films. The theater was full, and (without warning) they showed a bunch of fantastic short parodies (to cheer us up). Most of them were pretty funny, but THAT appeared, and after a few seconds the audience was hysterical! The biggest laugh came when they showed “Princess Laye” with huge cinnamon buns instead of hair on her head. She looks at the camera, smiles grimly and nods. It made him even funnier! You should see the Chevabakka being played by the Muppet! It was very stupid and stupid ... but I could not help laughing. Most of the dialogue was drowned out because of all the laughter. In addition, if you know “Star Wars” well, it is even funnier - they intentionally make fun of some dialogues. It really works with the audience! Definite 10!
