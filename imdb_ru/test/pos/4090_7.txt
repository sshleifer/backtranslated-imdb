I saw the film “Lost Horizons” of 1973 and read many reviews of this film. I agree that the movement had a lot of room for improvement, but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a little different, and this film gave me that. I did not watch this film as a critic, but as a person who is looking for a little hope, a little mood, a bit of liberation from my daily life, and this is what I received. You can criticize acting and dialogue, but that's not what I'm looking for when I go to the movies. I expect a little liberation from my daily life, a little time when I can relax and imagine a better life, where people love and help others. It is a pity that we cannot enjoy the film because of what he tells us and stop analyzing it as an English teacher reading an essay in fifth grade. This can be very simplistic, but in fact, it would be nice.
