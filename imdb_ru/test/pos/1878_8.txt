a terrific movie for the science fiction channel, which far surpasses many of the unsuccessful previous efforts they made. Bruce Campbell is in great shape as a potential investor, who finds himself in a strange experiment conducted by insane professor Stacy Keach and his half-savvy assistant Ted Raymi. This film is pure gold, and it's great to see Kitsch and star on screen with Bruce, and the fact that most of the film works exclusively on Bruceâ€™s comic actor makes him laugh and makes me ask why this guy doesn't get more of his scripts. ? This is a really sick world. Definitely worth a look.
