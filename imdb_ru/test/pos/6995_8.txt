This film is a variation of the theme that we have all seen again and again - the Sedan adventure in space. All characters - ordinary heroes - are a furious heroine, Judas, a coward, etc. And so on. The only question, in fact, is who is the next one to kill him. Sometimes this tried and tested formula works — as in this case — but more often not — as a truly stunning Red Planet. <br /> <br /> So why does this work? Because it is stylish. The game is above average. And above all, it is not predictable. The conclusion is not signed. I really had no idea how this would end, and I was surprised how it ended. This alone deserves the highest mark in my book. <br /> <br /> This is an intriguing and interesting movie. And although this could never change the face of the movie, as we know it, it does not disappoint.
