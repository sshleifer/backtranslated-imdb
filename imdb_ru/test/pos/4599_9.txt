Shame Fox for dumping this movie. It was a complete rebellion, and I only hope that he will find a second life on DVD and cable. <br /> <br /> This is a fun satyr. He brings the situation “what if” to the extreme and does not give any blows (or blows to the groin). It makes you wonder ... what will happen to this empire when we become completely lazy and stupid? Everyone gets hit in this esp. a number of large corporations, and even Fox News take a blow (perhaps, therefore, the film was not released properly - except for the marketing department, which did not think up the campaign and did not know how to promote it), so we will just give up! ") Some may find the movie a second-rate because the groin is kicking and pulling, but the movie is much more. You either get what Mike Judge says or not. Most of the negative reviews I read seem to come from people that just don't get it or are snobs. <br /> <br /> It’s likely that in selected markets it will play for one week, so if you miss it, watch the DVD, it will be worth renting, and I'm in I’ll end up having it in my collection. <br /> <br /> Good work, Mike Judge, it’s a shame that you azhalsya, but you made me laugh out loud, and I look forward to the next film that you do.
