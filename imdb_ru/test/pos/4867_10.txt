This second pair of Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner is great as the first. Predictable, maybe, but I don't care, and I still laugh when I see it. Wile E./Road running shorts have always held a special place in my heart. Thus, knowing that the second disc of the Golden Collection will contain not only 11 of this, BUT they will be in chronological order (2-12, the first episode was on volume 1), I involuntarily looked at me. I like it. This animated short film can be seen on the 2nd disc of the Looney Tunes Gold compilation, volume 2. It also contains an additional comment by Michael Barrier. <br /> <br /> My rating: A +
