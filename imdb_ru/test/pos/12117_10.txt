This is a great anime movie. It is well animated, has a complex plot and very good music. I understand that some might think that this is a bit long, but I think it is a good length, and the animation is a good traditional anime. <br /> <br /> Three characters: <br /> <br /> The way they use Tenkai is masterly. For example, a double body image appearing in all these places adds to the ominous tone of the film. Tenkai's design is also good, the way he looks like a monk, and in the final scene the armor he wears. <br /> <br /> Old Man Andu is a down-to-earth and very pleasant character. When Giro meets him, this is a turning point in the film. <br /> <br /> Sanpay, Satsuma Shinobi, who entered the Tenkai clan, twice saves the life of Giro. Although he remains in the background for most of the film, he is indeed one of the film’s heroes. <br /> <br /> PLOT: The plot is good. It is traditional, without being unoriginal. Interesting is the historical time in which it is played out, the Meiji restoration. Tenkai searches for treasure to restore the shogunate, and when Giro finds him, he uses it to help the forces against the shogunate overthrow the shogunate. <br /> <br /> The way Tenkai deceives Jiro is interesting and has “Hamlet” feel for this. There is a sweet irony in the fact that if Tenkai had not forced the Giro to become a shinobi, I do not think that he could have killed him at the end (perhaps from a firearm, but not from hand-to-hand combat). <br /> <br /> The plot with all of death makes it mostly very dark, but there are some bright moments when we see some of Hiro’s childhood memories. In general, it is a good, dark, intricate plot. <br /> <br /> MUSIC: For example, the initial theme is very good for electric guitar and percussion. Sometimes they use what I consider to be taiko drums in this piece, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of good music. Like the one they play when they go to Iga-shinobi. I think the piece is called “Numatou” and it has an incredible flute. The flute may be a pan flute, but most likely shakuhachi. <br /> <br /> The ultimate theme of "Kamui no komoriuta" is calm and delicate. The vocals are beautiful, as is the song as a whole. <br /> <br /> ANIMATION: <br /> <br /> Animation, although good, is not perfect, and the blood that flows through the characters sometimes seems orange. The transitions are interesting, and I think some transitions are very good. One example of a good transition is when Jiro and Iga Shinobi are running, the sunset is playing and music is playing in the background. The transition is simple, but effective and pleasant to the touch. <br /> <br /> MY FINAL WORDS: I think that the plot, animation, music and characters make this one of the best anime films. I have ever seen.
