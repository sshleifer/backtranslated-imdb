His original premise is based on the US Civil War, but in the end it is a love story. We start at the beginning of the war, when the main characters (Kidman and Lowe) obviously know each other, and there is an obvious attraction, they kiss passionately on the day when he goes to war. The main purpose of this film is for the character Lo to return to Kidman and his struggle in order to achieve this, and her struggle for survival, until he returns. The reason why he cannot be persuaded is that we don’t see enough of this relationship before Luo’s character goes into battle - it’s hard to believe that 2 people crave each other so much, given that there were so few contacts. Otherwise, everything is in order, Renee Zellweger and her current father and his entourage are wonderful additions, as well as the threat from the gang pursuing deserters. Of course, this is a long film, but it is of interest, and the cinema is great. Worthy attempt, which is not quite cope, but, nevertheless, worth a look.
