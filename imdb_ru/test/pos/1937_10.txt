This is a forgotten classic of the film, and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton from him for Gummo. Gummo is good, River's Edge is much better. It's no secret that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor, no matter who walks the earth. No, in fact, he is a terrible actor. But he was born for some roles: Ted Preston, Esquire from Bill and Ted, and his role in this film. He is beautiful as a good-natured, but very apathetic and confused teenager. Then there is Crispin Glover. I think his performance in this film is the best of his career. He is phenomenal as a stupefied character. Then there is Dennis Hopper, who is also perfect. This film is simply amazing, and if you haven't seen it yet, run and watch it today. It's great. One of the best images of modern America that I have seen.
