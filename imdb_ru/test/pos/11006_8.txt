A documentary about a nomadic tribe in Tibet, overlooking a dry lake to get salt, doesn't sound very attractive. But this is not a film about popcorn, but a visual cultural festival in which you take part in a rapidly disappearing piece of humanity. Superstitions, epic songs and poetry, the belief of people who sincerely believe in following their own unique lifestyles is what the West had during Homer's time, but now, unfortunately, this is completely alien to most of us in the â€œdeveloped world. lost the spiritual peace that comes from adhering to established lifestyles, often with severe mental consequences in our increasingly soulless society. The filmmakers closely wove us into the fabric of these materially poor but spiritually rich and lazy salts. or see us in life that was more than a mall and pop culture, so turn off the land lines, turn off your cameras, turn off the lights on the driveway, and sit back and immerse yourself in an endless adventure.
