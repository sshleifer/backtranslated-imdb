Having read and watched the film “Gone With the Wind”, I found that it is very difficult for me not to compare this film with the original. Although I thought Scarlett, the novel, was great, the film did not take shape. It was a completely different story. Of course, there will never be other Scarlett and Rett, except for Lee and Geybla, but the new actors did a great job considering. I liked how the book and the film completed the story “Gon with the Wind”, because after reading it, I felt a surge of frustration, because it just stopped and made readers think about what happened. Scarlett finishes the story very well, and Alexandra Ripley did an excellent job with this book. I wish the film followed the story more, although it is great in itself.
