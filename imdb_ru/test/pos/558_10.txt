MUST SEE the documentary .----- There were so many things to watch for in this movie. It was a great documentary about the trial of a 15-year-old black guy named Brenton Butler. He is accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. This shows how the police took the testimony of the husband of the dead woman with the description of the man who killed his wife. It seems that the husband wanted to change some things in order to merge with what the police said he was wearing. The police investigates a little crime. Brenton's lawyer Patrick McGuinness carefully selects information to help his client. He tells viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use in the police to show their incomplete investigation and beat up his young client to make him confess. The camera goes along with McGuinness to where Brenton was interrogated. McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and how sound is controlled. He asks a policeman at the booth and asks what Brenton, one of the investigators, heard, and he challenges their own words. McGuinness is investigating with Ann Finnell every place that the police were supposed to go, and what they were supposed to do, but did not. The film shows the Butlers as a loving Christian family who believes in the innocence of their son and believes that God will free Brenton. They visit him in prison and pray with him to encourage him. There are scenes of group prayer for Brenton, the lawyers, the judge, and everyone involved. I am white, and I was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks. It was a shame to see how black and white policemen stick together when they think they got their man. The police have hard work, and I believe that most of them are worthy of respect, as in this film. I think this is an excellent film for everyone who is involved in the judicial system, including judges, the police and lawyers, and even potential jurors, to watch this film and learn from it.
