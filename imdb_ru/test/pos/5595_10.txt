Broken Silence or “Race Against Fear” (1998): starring Ariana Richards, William Bumiller, Susan Blakely, Tracy Ellis Ross, Teryl Rothery, Scott Vikarius, Marissa Rudiac, Ken Camru, David Nil, Bruce Dawson ... Director José Josés , screenplay Sarah Charmo, Gene Jennis, Phyllis Murphy. <br /> <br /> This is another Lifetime film created specifically for television, released in 1998, shot by long-time television director Joseph L. Scanlan. Inspired by true events, it is in many ways similar to most life films, warning a story for women, raising awareness of the predator hiding in the family (mother, father, wife, husband) and mentor (teacher, in this case, the coach on the track)). Young and little-known actress Ariana Richards (she played a little girl in the Jurassic Park) shows a very convincing performance in the role of high school girl Mickey Carlyle, who was raped by her trainer Kurt Ansom (William Bumiller) and who should suffer in silence no one believes her history, except of course, her own mother (Susan Blakely). Together, mother and daughter fight to put Kurt Ansom behind bars. The film lasts quite a bit, it is ultimately predictable, sometimes too melodramatic for the sake of the drama itself, but in the end it’s really powerful. The performance of Ariana Richards refers to day soap, but it is the strongest in the whole line-up. Her expression, body language and overall play are realistic in terms of how she, as a beginning athlete, idolized her coach, in turn was disturbed by him and now has to live with shame, trauma and further, fight him in court. William Bumiller plays the role with vile duplicity, although it is far from subtle. Previously, he scoffed at other star athletes who were silent and got to the top, and seem outwardly innocent. William Bumiller, a lesser-known actor, like the others, never played a similar role, but in general he plays a plausible and strong role. It is especially disturbing to see him in this role, because he is a sexy lead actor in everything he does, including some lesser-known films and in the soap opera “Guiding Light”. The only real problem I encountered in this film is its structure. When the film opens, we watch trainer Ansom going to rape Mickey, letting us know that this guy is useless. But it makes for poor character development and history. If the first scene were a sequence with initial credits in which we see Mickey running / jogging in the city across the lake, we would have the best character development, because we don’t know this trainer Ansom, although we would seem interested in The success of his star athlete is a really unpleasant job, and we would see Mickey idolizing the man she thought she knew, and then received a rude awakening when she realized that she was wrong. Directed by Joseph Scanlan is not new to drama for television (Nott's Landing, Star Trek, Quantum Leap, Outer Limits, Lois and Clark, The Final Conflict of the Earth) and films such as La Femme Nikitta. In 1996, Scanlan made another film for the rest of his life, looking like this “Confront Fear” (1996). He manages to convey the seriousness of the event. We are genuinely concerned that the coach is hiding around the soul, where he rapes his student. These scenes are graphic and should be viewed by adults to the audience, but its meaning is clear: sexual predators and rapists are not always strangers and can take various forms, and even secondary schools can be their victims. This film supports the cause of the struggle to prevent violence against women and calls on women who were silent victims to testify and fight, so that the perpetrators no longer harm other people. Despite other negative reviews, this film copes with the expression of its message and should be given to mothers, daughters, hi school students (including both men and women). As bad as rape, being silent when it happens is even worse.
