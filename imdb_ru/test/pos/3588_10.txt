There are many interesting things in this series: beautiful shots of some of the most impressive underwater environments on this planet. Being a staggering five-year period, one would expect less. I got the impression that some scenes from the first episode are repeated in the second, which, naturally, is only a minor flaw. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough is great as a narrator, and the comments are informative, leaving enough space for your imagination and well spaced so that viewers have enough time to reflect on the breathtaking images. If you have the opportunity, try not to watch the translated version of this series. <br /> <br /> Be sure to look for anyone interested in the subtleties of our blue continents, and just the best documentary on this subject I've ever seen.
