What is funny about Barker's Nightbreed is that this is a story about people in a rage, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere. In this monsters (night breed title) - "good" guys. He shares the meaning of celebrating the new, distorted and gloomy with the first film “The Addams Family” and most of the work of Tim Burton. It also has the beauty you can expect from a Barker play. <br /> <br /> Especially funny is the performance of Kronenberg as a truly evil human doctor who seeks to destroy the Night Breed. As in most classic monster films, residents surround the castle of monsters with torches and forks. Only this time, the modern situation replaces the castle with the old mausoleum, and the village “weapon” with cannons and bombs. And this time the sympathy that you experienced when you saw how the Frankenstein monster burned down in a windmill is the very center of the film. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, and even Barker did more interesting, and, of course, more cooling, work. But it is fun, it looks great and remains light, without mocking yourself. Worth a look!
