Who won the best Oscar for 1933? It was supposed to be Laura Hope Cruise for her gorgeous image of the most monstrous mother in the world. She is truly one of the greatest character actresses of all time. She played the frivolous Prudence Duverna in Camille (1936), and her most memorable role was Aunt Pittipat in Gone With the Wind. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunn was the “official” star of the film, but her scenes with Laura Hope Cruise were dynamite. <br /> <br /> David (Joel McCree) is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. His wife, Cristina (Irene Dunn), can continue her studies at the Rockafellar Center. Their first stop in America is a visit to David's mother, Mrs. Phelps. To say that Laura Hope Cruise dominates every scene is an underestimation. From her first entrance - in a mad rush of efforts to greet her "big boy" - all the attention is on her. Even sitting at the tea table, when she forgets about the existence of Esther, even forgetting how she drinks tea, you know that something is wrong (Hester has been living there for a long time). <br /> <br /> Frances Dee is absolutely sweet and so good in her role as charming Esther. Her performance in this film, especially the scene where she has hysterics and consequences, proves how underestimated she is as an actress. <br /> <br /> All the young actors are great. Eric Linden is great, like Robert, the youngest son, who realizes that his mother is terrible, but he can’t do anything to get away from his mother’s spell. Joel McCree, at some point, says: “painting the roses in the baths is more your style”. In the film about the sexuality of Robert there is a very subtle assumption. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunn is great in any movie or genre she tried.
