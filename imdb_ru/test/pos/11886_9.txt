If you're looking for a Kung Fu action movie, look elsewhere. While there are fighting scenes, the film revolves around its provincial protagonist, who is struggling to find his way into the Americanized Canton. Unlike most Kung Fu comedies, action scenes are used to enhance comedy, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> Cheung Booi is a statement about the farcical nature of kung fu movies, where the stars seem to always find a reason to fight. Instead of some grandiose drama about honor and respect, minor misunderstandings make the characters shout at each other and start beating each other. <br /> <br /> My young aunt, as is known in the West, is a story about Cheng Tai-Nun, played by Kara Hui, a young woman who marries an elderly landowner to keep his possessions from falling into his hands greedy and corrupt brother. After his death, she moved to Canton to live with her nephew, played by director Lau Kar Leung, and his son Ah Tao, played by Xiao Ho. <br /> <br /> The basis of irony is that, although Cheng is the same age as Ah Tao, her manner is more similar to her status as his great-aunt. While Ah Tao speaks English (extremely bad), plays the guitar and goes to costume parties, Chen completely fails when she tries to adapt to her lifestyle in Canton, complete with make-up, revealing dresses, high heels and dance scenes. <br /> <br /> What makes this film great is its realization. Lau Kar Leung is perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest director of his generation in Hong Kong, and Kara Hui won the Best Actress role at the first Hong Kong film award in 1982. In addition, this is probably the best performance of Xiao Ho. His chemistry with Hui is wonderful, and although he continued his career in kung fu comedies, often working together with Sammo Hung, he has the perfect combination of athleticism and comedy. As romantic tension and intrigue accumulate in the second half of the film, his whole face changes. He no longer travels life without caring for the world. He becomes a straight man and his associates Kramer, Elaine and George. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is how suddenly the comedic aspects of the film disappear during imprisonment. The film moves from a frank farce to a dramatic intrigue with a slight change in random music. But there is a certain symmetry in this. The film begins with intrigue, focuses more on Lau Car Leungâ€™s character and ends in the same way. But the final scene returns to the comedic roots of the film, giving a conclusion to both aspects of the film.
