I would say, “Bride of Chucky” is a “return to greatness,” but the series has never been truly great. Very good, # 1 was, # 2-3 were distributions, and I think this 4th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle / slogan: "Chucky becomes lucky." So he did the role of Jennifer Tilly, who completely rejuvenated this series, like Jerry Ryan for Star Trek: Voyager. Tilly didn't just create a presence; she added the much needed humor, story, drama, tension and a great joke / game for Chucky. And no matter how much I liked her in this function, she cannot get all the credit: the props (see the first 1-2 minutes for horror), the letter, the jokes inside (again, the opening + Pinhead) and the Chucky lines were great (“ In fact, if (it) was a movie, it would take 3-4 more just to pay tribute to him, among others.) Fortunately, Chucky and the series refused Andy to “Hide” Soul, and simply decided the new out of your body. He teams up with his ex (Tilly), whom he translates into a doll "The Bride", and a couple of teenagers Bonnie and Clyde (Really, Heigl?), To return this pendant, buried with the human corpse Chucky. This is for any fan of Chucky, horror fans of the 1980s, or even those who have never seen one of the previous Children's Play movies. Is it funny, dark, harmless, bloody ?? but not beyond that, and despite Tilly’s literal 20 minutes of screen time, it’s always nice to see her. In the end, you can barely see her playing poker. (Note: Of course, I took the link to Superman - Hackensack, New Jersey.)
