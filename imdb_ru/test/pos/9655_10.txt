This is a great movie that everyone should have. I really liked every aspect of it, from sword fighting, romance, costumes were really well made and put together. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. I also loved mystery and magic. Also a message about the power of love, that love is the greatest power that it is. I really like the king's heart in the sense that he wants peace, not bloodshed and hatred. I wish that I lived in such a world with flying ships, in heavenly castles. I also think it was really good how they brought the animals to the film. I also thought that the cook was really funny. I watched it many times in one day and still do not get tired of it. Just want them to bring it on DVD.
