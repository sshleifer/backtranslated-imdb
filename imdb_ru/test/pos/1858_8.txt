When this film unfolds, you begin to feel the mystery of human existence. If you carry with you questions, internal wars, insoluble riddles about the meaning of life, then you will feel this film with every piece of your body. Charles Darwin begins the war with a completely predictable end. War with God. His theories are reminiscent of the fact that God has nothing to do with humanity, has nothing to do with the wonderful world in which we live. Wild, harsh, ironic and chaotic, these words surround the mind of a character thrown into the universe of material truth. One who slowly expels hope in God from his mind. However, the film, like Charles Darwin, still sees the miracle and beauty outside of God in a universe of infinite evolution.
