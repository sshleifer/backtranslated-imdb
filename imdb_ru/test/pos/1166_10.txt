A solid British gentleman calmly gets up with tea with Candice Bergen and throws three of them with Webley's revolver in his coat. Whisper of the ghost of the Empire ... So that we do not forget! So that we do not forget! <br /> <br /> United States. Marines coming ashore from the long-gone _Brooklyn_. They carried Crags, it was supposed to be Lee, but, wow.
