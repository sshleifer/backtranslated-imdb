the bottom in its absolute highest perfection. who ever says that the slap comedy is dead and boring is completely wrong. not that this film is only liked by those who have a male nature. This is another high-quality British dark comedy with a lot of non-violent jokes, but it will help you relax and laugh at the stupidity of all this. <br /> <br /> is a real example of prosperity. British ingenuity and home-grown talent hats off to them. at the performance level, it reminds me very much of the early works of Marx brothers, where their acting styles have the same level of enthusiasm and devotion, which leads to a performance in which the audience can actually engage the innate human desire to see others suffer to feel safe, very much like the principle on which many television shows work. really amazing manipulation that makes all parties feel better.
