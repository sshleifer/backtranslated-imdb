As a former seafarer, I was really interested in this film: I personally took part in the search for a stowaway exit from Kingston Jamaica, where one person was found. We managed to pull him ashore, even though we were within territorial limits. On the other ship I was in, I was found, and we could not land it anywhere because of problems with the passport / nationality. In fact, he remained for a year as an almost “honorary” member of the crew and worked on his maintenance. Africa is notorious for its stowaway pickups. At the beginning of the film there is a great scene when the cargo ship enters the African port: its size overshadows everything. The crew landed on the beach for a little communication and intoxication. Still alright. The drama begins when the shelter enters the ship’s vast cave holds. Joss Ackland is great as the Captain, his drinking problem is being pursued by his nemesis Suche right in the form of a company representative on board. A fascinating search is classic, but we had no weapons. I question the use of weapons in this film. It seemed that this ship had a huge arsenal. In my experience, guns at sea are strictly limited due to customs regulations. Also having a dog on board was odd. Rabies laws, especially in Europe, strictly restrict the transportation of animals. In any case, Pertwi is magnificent as an embittered comrade. The horror that follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable: the gloomy metal background of the ships holds and the feeling that there is no place to hide, adds to the drama. Some of the crew of cargo ships are not in the murder and those who are involved are gradually drawn into a world of violence from which there is no escape. The pursuit of the ship, especially the scenes of the engine room, is the “edge on the seat”: there is extreme claustrophobia. The feeling of metallic pressure and death, which is just the barrel of a weapon. The film is brutal: my girlfriend had to refuse to view it during filming and beatings. While it continues on the Suchet in the comfort of its well-appointed cabin, gets drunk, not knowing about the chaos 3 decks below. This is an intense film, a vicious, but the real idea is that we can all plunge into violence like this. Slow and true. Think of the machinists who carried the Jews to Auschwitz, the clerks who worked out the timetable for these trains. I always remember someone who visited the Dachau concentration camp at the end of the war, and he said that one of the guardsmen S.S. put a table for birds near the crematorium camp. This film is like this: ordinary people suddenly find themselves in a world of irresistible violence!
