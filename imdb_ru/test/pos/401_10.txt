The kind of "small" film in which the studios used to succeed, but rarely removed. Like the "soulful" version of the more famous "The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells". Ian McShane is superb as a DJ and soul music lover who is obsessed with reuniting members of a classical soul group, and the film follows his exploits as much as the members of the group; the cast, which includes such authentic musical talents as Isaac Hayes, as well as acting actors Taurean Black, Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas. By no means to be epic, however, it is a piece of pure gold.
