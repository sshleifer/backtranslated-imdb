- she has Carla Gujino * yay * and the wacky final * boo * <br /> <br /> - “Jaded” is a very erotic story about a beautiful woman who comes to the city trying to escape from her past. While there, she meets with two lesbians, and after a couple of drinks, they decided to have fun. But one of the girls goes too far and rapes her, and the second keeps her. She is found on the beach, where the incident happens the next day, and is taken to hospital. After that, we spend the rest of the film, watching as she tries to knock down two girls, and at the same time learn some new information about who she is and where she comes from, and a little about her past. <br /> <br /> - Director and co-author of the film Karin Kroot copes with this movie, given its extra-budgetary budget. It is tame and sometimes looks like 16 mm, but it fits the film because the plot requires a sharp look. All the actors are good at what they are given, and in fact there is nothing to complain about. An outstanding feature in the film is, of course, Carla Gugino, which exposes all this in this film. In fact, she is more naked in this film than in the City of Sins. Christopher MacDonald is also in the film, but his character is really meaningless, but it's fun to watch. I didn’t pay much attention to music, because it doesn’t attract attention, but it does work with what it has. The film received a rating of R, and this is a very good reason. it is sometimes very sexy and very visual. From time to time, it essentially borders on the soft core, but sex scenes are necessary for the film, so it does not seem like it's just for the sake of presence. Although there is one meaningless scene in which we see Chris McDonald taking pictures of her, this scene was a bit meaningless, but I don’t think this is really a big problem. The only mistake in the film is that we don’t see a lawsuit after everything we experience in the film. It's like having sex and not having an orgasm or something like that. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the talented Karin Mole has never made a feature film since. This very gifted woman can do great things with a very small budget. I really hope that she will return to the game soon, because she is an amazing director. Jaded is not a masterpiece of erotic cinema, but what we have is a pleasant film that shows how a great director is shot. <br /> <br /> - Cover up the children and close the curtains, you don't want people to think that you are watching porn while watching this movie.
