This film easily competes with the emotional power, dramatic impact and first-class performances of "12 Angry Men." I took it off on a whim and was amazed that I had never heard of it before. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if it was Emilio Esteves ’s directing debut, but the pace, interaction and character development as well as some clever camera work related to the character Esteves plays is all a natural look. <br /> <br /> The interactions of Martin and Emilio contain the same amazing chemistry that we saw on Wall Street with Martin and Charlie. Kathy Bates is remarkable in her characters with subtle despair and escape; a variation on her character in "In the game on the fields of the Lord." It is annoying, and yet you can simultaneously empathize with it. <br /> <br /> At some moments, I feel that the plot slows down the touch, and the moments between Estevez and his ex-girlfriend almost seem written to another. In the film, Estevez is shot as another character. But these are minor complaints. <br /> <br /> This film must be based on a true story or written by someone who has experienced this experience. I rate this 8 out of difficult 10. <br /> <br />
