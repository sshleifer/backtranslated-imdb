I first saw this film by chance when they showed it on TV, and I woke up too late ... Although I was really lucky. This is really incredible; from the location (as isolated as possible on this planet; because of which the “abyss” looked like an alien in the council pool), through interesting characters him? "-" Then we are mistaken. ") and the consequences (more disgusting than that of the Alien). <br /> <br /> However, the real tension and fear in the film have nothing to do with the effects. These are people you start to fear; knowing that one of them can - or cannot be - "They all seem." This, of course, the feeling of "who goes there?". <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great; it really enhances the isolation, fear and seriousness of the situation. <br /> <br /> Finally, the epilogue scene really, really shortens. Even more than "But again, who does?" Zest Bladerunner. Enough said.
