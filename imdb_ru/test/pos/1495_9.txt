Mr. Bean, in which the legendary Rowan Atkinson appeared, was a huge hit during his jogging in the 1990s, and I probably saw him for the first time when I was about ten, shortly after, so I saw repetitions. I, of course, was not a big fan at the time and did not see too many episodes. I really didn't get to the show until I was a few years old, just a few years ago, when I finally watched every episode. Unlike earlier, it made me laugh many times, and since then it has always been like this when re-watching episodes! <br /> <br /> Mr. Bean is a mysterious, self-centered, antisocial, extremely naive jester, whose best friend is his Teddy! He is largely isolated from society, and it is not easy for him to live, as he constantly struggles with very simple things! This is because he lacks some fairly basic knowledge, and he has a child's mind. He gets into various troubles wherever he goes, and finds very strange ways to try to solve the problems he faces! Not only does he often create problems for himself, but sometimes for other people, which he is often not inclined to realize! In other words, Mr. Bean is a walking catastrophe! <br /> <br /> The humor in this show is very visual, and there is very little dialogue. Gags are almost always spectacles, which mostly tell the show. Despite the fact that sometimes there may be a weak gag, I would say that the vast majority of them are funny, often funny (there are so many of them)! Although Mr. Bean is certainly not the hardest comedy ever created, it is still great for many of those who love visual humor, and because of the very limited dialogue you donâ€™t even need to speak English, to enjoy the show That's why he got such a worldwide reputation! The show lasted for several years, but the episodes were made very gradually, so only fourteen were done. Nevertheless, this is a classic series, and it deserves wide appeal!
