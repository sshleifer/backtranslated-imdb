I bought my first album Zep in 1974 (at the age of 17), and since then I've been hooked. This DVD has taken pride of place in my music collection. Not often a group can boast 4 virtuosos in their lineup, but here we can. Each participant contributed to the group, but on the stage together, the electricity they generated was more than 4 people. This masterpiece covers the entire career of the group from Led Zep 1 to Coda, and it is beautifully captured on this DVD, as each concert shows how the group has become more and more over the years. Recently, my copy disappeared, but I am pleased to report that I was found in the room of my 17-year-old son, since the new generation will know how good these guys are. This is a must have for those who appreciate rock music. Long live Led Zeppelin.
