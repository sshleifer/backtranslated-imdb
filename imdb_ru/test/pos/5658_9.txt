During World War II in the Philippines, Japanese soldiers go hungry, die, grow weak and become more and more insane. A small group of soldiers, trying to stay alive, eventually resorted to cannibalism. This film perfectly describes the madness that overtakes people in extreme conditions. There are several humorous roles in this film, but most of them are very slow and realistic films. It follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another, and ultimately to death. A very interesting film showing the death and horror of what could be the most terrible war in the world.
