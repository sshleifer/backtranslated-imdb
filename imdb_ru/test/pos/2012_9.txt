I liked this show, it was in the UK, but not at peak times, and they seemed to move it across all charts, so I couldn't watch them all. I was surprised when he did not return, and had no idea why, I still do not know, but I think it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances of the two leashes, they were very believable as friends, Two supporting actresses also added well to the mix. I guess it was part of a series of shows that focused on lifestyle, Friends were the obvious major, but sex in the city appeared a few years later. <br /> <br /> Characters, take coffee with you, they drink in nice bars, something like this, a little rustic.
