This film is a knockout, the fires in the plain in question (burning at the end of harvest time) A happy memory of Tamur, He experiences this in his thoughts many times, and at the end of this dark movie, Like a man dying of thirst, he believes that he is at home, and this last illusion is all that he has left. Billy Wilder's Big Carnival (Ace in the Hole) is the only film (that comes to mind) as gloomy as this little masterpiece by Kon Ichikawa. Although I think the whole movie is brilliant. Two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of Japanese soldiers trying to escape (crawling on the stomach) was ambushed by Americans and killed, True horror, And like an American soldier and a pretty Filipino girl A soldier with a cigarette on the side of the road, she smiles, waving a jerk, then her face changes with rage when she sees two Japanese soldiers trying to surrender, she grabs a gun and kills them with joy, the American soldier tries to stop her, but she has no chance , for me it OVOR the atrocities committed by the Japanese in the Philippines, in general, a great movie if you have the desire to do so.
