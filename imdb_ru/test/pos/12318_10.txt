John Houston ended his wonderful career with one of the most sophisticated and sensitive films I've ever seen. By his farewell, he decided to adapt James Joyce's beautiful story “The Dead” and made not only one of the most faithful adaptations of the literature to the film, he also created a film that after more than 20 years still surpasses many modern cinema. <br /> <br /> When I watched this film a few years ago, as a university student, I looked at the screen with awe, marveling at every aspect of the film: acting, writing, directing. , costumes, plays, music, cinematography. Thinking about it now, I still cannot do anything for which I would criticize. Houston just knew how to tell a good story. <br /> <br /> Good credit should be given to Tony Houston. He knew better than to interfere with the text, which is not only perfect in itself, but already quite visual for a movie. Father and son allowed the story to sigh and enjoy the long, fascinating conversation between the characters and meaningful silence. <br /> <br /> Donal McCann also deserves credit for his role as Gabriel Conroy. I have never seen him in a movie before, and have not seen him afterwards, but he gave one of the most touching performances I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> In general, The Dead is a wonderful cinematic experience from a legendary director who has never ceased to be superb.
