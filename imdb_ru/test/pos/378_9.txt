In Truffo’s feature-length interview with Hitchcock, it is obvious that Big Ala’s fear of the police goes back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station with a note. The note said: "He was naughty, put him in jail for an hour." The police are required, and since then Hitchcock has experienced a deep fear of being wrongfully blamed and taken by the police. <br /> <br /> “Strangers in the train” is probably one of the best in his “wrongly accused” series. The film is based on the novel by Patricia Highsmith. This is the same author who wrote the Ripley series. She was always fascinated by intelligent criminals. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock’s discovery is very strong and immediately leads you to the main characters: Guy Haynes, a famous tennis player, and Bruno Anthony, a beginning criminal. These two guys share chemistry, which at the time was probably much more than what the audience could chew on. Bruno tries to convince Guy that they can commit the murder committed (without leaving any evidence) if they change the victims. Bruno will kill Guy's wife, who will not divorce him, and Guy will kill Bruno's father. Motives - respectively, love and money. <br /> <br /> Bruno’s work must be seductive and homoerotic. This is not something that was done by chance. In fact, Hitchcock edited two versions of the film: one in the US, one in the UK. In the American version, the lure volume of Bruno was slightly reduced. <br /> <br /> “Strangers on the Train” is a very deep film, but more importantly, this is another great Hitchcock thriller. A great example of an exciting scene is when Guy climbs the steps to Father Bruno’s room. Hitchcock reasoned that the attention of the audience should be distracted at this stage so that they did not find out what Guy would find in the room. Hitch treats us to a huge, formidable dog at the top of the stairs, which distracts attention. <br /> <br /> The most famous shot in the film takes place during a tennis match. Bruno constantly pursued Guy to Guy to execute his deal (killed his father). When Guy looks at the audience, all heads turn back and forth. All but one - Bruno. He looks straight at Guy with a smile, “I'll get you.” <br /> <br /> The end is another example of waiting. Both men fight for one key evidence on the carousel, which rotates at insane speed. A worker crawls under him so that he can get to the control panel. When we finally get off this trip, and the film ends with Guy proving his innocence, we remain drained and devoid of nails (for those of us who still bite their nails!). <br /> <br /> “Strangers on the train” creating thrillers from the master himself. I will not give up on Leonardo if he comes to teach me painting in the Renaissance style, so you shouldn’t either. <br /> <br />
