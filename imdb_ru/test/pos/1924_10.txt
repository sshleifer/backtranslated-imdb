Deep water (2006) **** <br /> <br /> "It doesnâ€™t matter ... it is waiting for you to slip in." These words (paraphrased) are perhaps the best sum of the nature of the ocean that I have ever heard, muttered. His rage is boundless, not least her loneliness. These words are taken from the fascinating and heartbreaking documentary Deep Water. This is the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur sailor who participated in the Sunday Times race around the world in 1969. If you do not know his story, it is better to stop reading now. Do not read this or any other Crowhurst or race information. Find a movie and just watch. <br /> <br /> After the first single round-the-world voyage in the ocean in 1967, adventurers and adventure observers began to look for the next one. This time the trip had to be done without going ashore or stopping along the way. Stepping on hard times, Crohurst saw in the race a great chance to get his family back on their feet. In childhood, he experienced financial difficulties and wanted to return to such a life. So he decided to find sponsors and soon did it at Stanley Best and Rodney Hollworth. The two men recorded a potential cash cow and provided Crowhurst with a boat, on the condition that, if he left the race, he would have to pay the expenses himself. However, his boat needed to be repaired, and he feared that he would not be ready by the time of the last day of departure. However, his sponsors told him that he just had to go ?? in the end, they took the dough and waited for it many times. <br /> <br /> The details of this story are notorious: Crowhurst's boat began to draw water, and its progress slowed to a crawl. Faced with the decision to try to go around the Horn of Africa (certain death in such a boat) or turn back (financial destruction and poverty), he was looking for a third option. He decided to hide alone on his yacht, waiting for other competitors to go around Cape Horn in South America. From there he will join the race. He reported false positions and record speeds. Then he stopped all communication because of the fear that his position would be given back. He also had to painstakingly make fake accounting logs for every day of the journey that he did not commit. In the end, loneliness, guilt, and the realization that he is likely to be caught is too hard for Crowhurst. His latest journal entries make Kurtz's thoughts seem perfectly sane. Just a few weeks from the house, he turned his boat away from the house, and reportedly jumped overboard shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> Odyssey of Crowhurst is fascinating, and its end is heartbreaking, but the blows are inevitable. Our dreams so often turn into fears, and the consequences of our actions often leave us with so few options for a happy ending. This is a story of immersion in madness, teasing the endless precipice of cruel seas. The filmmakers do a wonderful job telling this story. He combines the awesome audio and video recordings made by Crowhurst and the stories about his increasingly insane journal entries. The story begins slowly and can distract some viewers, but the rewards of this story are completely worth how it progresses. <br /> <br /> There are also questions to some other competitors, such as Frenchman Bernard Mauzier, who was on a par with the likelihood of winning a speed match, only to get out and start a second trip around the world. Also in the film is Robin Knox-Johnston, who was the winner of the competition. He donated his prize money to the Crowhurst family. <br /> <br /> It is not fair to read briefly about the Crowhurst saga. This, of course, is interesting, but the quick review bypasses the raw emotions and oddities presented here. The final moments of Deep Water are truly heartbreaking, listening to the thoughts of his widowed family, and adoring and understanding his friends. This is a fascinating story, and it is she who carries the documentary into such wonderful channels.
