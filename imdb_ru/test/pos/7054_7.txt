I liked this movie for the most part, but I have to say that if someone other than Bill Murray was in the lead role, he would not be so good. He brings energy to the role that raises the film a step higher than it otherwise would have been. Basically, I enjoyed the jokes for one consultant, and there are other fun things in this film, such as a hotdog eating contest. This film will also set the stage for summer camp films with competition at the end. Almost in every camp movie there is either this plot, or the plot about unruly or concerned children, or their combination. In this series, there would also be a rather strange shift in tone, since both films are films for the whole family, and the third and fourth are more adult-oriented, more like the old teen comedies of time. This is the opposite of the police academy films that have moved from R films to PG-13 to PG movies. This series comes from the opposite R. However, this first and only good film deserves some chuckles mainly because of Bill Murray.
