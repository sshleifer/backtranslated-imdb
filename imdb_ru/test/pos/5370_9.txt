One of the best lesser-known occult horror films of the seventies. This is a sandy, exciting, scary, surreal here and there, and sometimes even very clever, which is not the case with many films of this kind. I cannot fail to see some burning symbolic and metaphorical moments in the society of the seventies and the generations of the time when this film was shot. The screenwriter was obviously cooking, also providing some good old scenes from the crypt. With a job well done by a creative director, the result is interesting and thought-provoking. A simple but effective finale specifically shows how those who can deal with these things. <br /> <br /> The great cast was largely unknown to me, with the exception of LQ Jones as a capricious but funny sheriff and Strother Martin as a city doctor. It's no wonder Martin always ends up stealing a movie. With such a voice and skill, for me he is one of the greatest psychos in the cinema, anyway. What an actor! <br /> <br /> For me, this is a little mystery why this film has not received much greater recognition. I think that he deserves an almost equal place in the occult canon of horror, along with The Child of Rosemary and the Exorcist. One damn movie!
