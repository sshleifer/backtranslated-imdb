When a circus arrives in the city and places a cage with a lion directly above Bugs Bunny’s house, Bugs is somewhere between the frightened and the fearless. Despite the name "Acrobatty Bunny", it is only at the end when Bugs and the lion perform acrobatics. But even before that, it’s pretty funny what Bugs do to not be eaten; one way or another, he always manages to use the weakness of another character against him, and then pull any convenient object out of thin air! The beetles later hit the circus on Big Top Bunny. I liked this one more, since the latter weakened the drugs a bit, giving the antagonist an Eastern European accent (I know it was during the Cold War, but still). I recommend this one. <br /> <br /> And at the end we can confirm that in this cartoon it will never be Aloha Oe.
