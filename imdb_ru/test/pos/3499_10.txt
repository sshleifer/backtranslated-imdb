As an American, I have not encountered this character before, which is good, because some of you were disappointed. I have nothing to compare. I have not found the pleasure of senseless idiotic humor in American teenage films, and although this is a slightly similar type of humor, I could not help laughing. I almost never laugh out loud at the movie. And usually in the film there are some funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from beginning to end. My only disappointment was when it was all over. I'm going to buy it on DVD when I find it.
