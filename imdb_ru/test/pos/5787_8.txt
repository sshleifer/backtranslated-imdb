The end of the Suburb neatly collects many of the problems with the approaching "Peak" of world oil supplies. As the world’s population grows, so does the demand for oil and electricity. When we extract oil and electricity, we reach the “peak” of production. Requires more oil, less oil is generated. The inevitable result is conflict and major changes. <br /> <br /> This movie will be disturbing and disturbing if you are new to the topic. You can react first with anger and denial, because the consequences are so grim. This must be a must-see. Besides politics, optimism is undeniable mathematics. <br /> <br /> The suburbs are in the spotlight because our suburban residential areas will be the communities most affected when the price of energy soars. While intuitive logic tells you that big cities will be places that should be avoided during a crisis, the widespread nature of the suburbs will make it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain an effective community without our means of transporting us. <br /> <br /> Peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by survivors and madmen. This question will be at our doorstep sooner than we think. This film is a clear, consistent look at it.
