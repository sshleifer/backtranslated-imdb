Gilmore Girls is one of the funniest, smartest, witty, sarcastic and heartbreaking television shows I've ever seen (the second after my favorite TV show of all time, F * R * I * E * N * D * S) . The fast paced and many references to pop culture can be confusing to some viewers, but as soon as you understand Gilmore’s path, you’ll catch on to life. Just a few random comments, I recently (finally) started watching season 6 and wow! This is one of my favorite seasons. I love the Luke-Lorelaya thing, and the whole drama in various episodes is (as always) exciting. The only thing I don’t really like is an amazing bad attitude and reckless actions that Rory suddenly “accepted”. Unfortunately, I do not find it very realistic and I hope that this is not just a way to stir up another drama in order to keep the season strong. In general, a great season, and I can not wait for the next !!! <br /> <br /> ~ ashly a.k.a. "Tookie Clothespin"
