I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say that this is one of the few books that I could not put off while reading. <br /> <br /> The film, however, turned out to be largely what I expected a lot of action, with something of a mysterious storyline. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role for Professor Langdon than in the Da Vinci Code. <br /> <br /> You don’t have to worry that it’s as bad as the Da Vinci Code. that's all there was not. Much more interesting, more action, more tension and less unnecessary disputes. If you have not read the book, do not worry, it will still be very interesting for you. And if you read this book, let's say you are a little disappointed, because I found that many scenes are missing, which I was looking forward to. <br /> <br /> Overall, a pretty impressive movie for any ordinary movie buff. But maybe not something special for Dan Brown fans.
