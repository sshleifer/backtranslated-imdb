Well, I'm not going to add to the diatribe that was “preached” about this film. <br /> <br /> All I can add is that under no circumstances does he even pretend to be a “historical” picture. Unlike "Braveheart", "Titanic" or "Patriot", each of which has very reliable and serious historical corrections, exclusively for theatrical effect (perhaps the worst of the excuses). <br /> <br /> Has everyone experienced a sense of humor around it? <br /> <br /> All I can add is to rephrase the words of the good Captain MacLean - “It looked fantastic, and we were damn good laughs.” <br /> <br /> - Last note. What surprises me is the fact that in the historical setting there are comments regarding “contemporary music”. I wonder if the same people would have made the same judgment about the Moulin Rouge. I suggest no.
