Due to a very misleading advertising campaign, I saw this film in cinemas at a relatively young age of 10 years. The trailers on TV portrayed the film as a comedy, and I did not give rest to my parents until they took me. After watching the movie, I was amazed. I had no idea what to think. Absolutely different from everything I've seen before, leaving many questions for such a young mind. Needless to say, I loved it. This morning was the first time I watched a movie in 2-3 years, and I still think this is one of the greatest films made in the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are both in great shape, like a mysterious person who may or may not be from another planet, and a psychiatrist who develops a connection with him, trying to unravel his mystery. The cast is also close to perfect, every resident of a psychiatric hospital is incredibly convincing in its own way. The open final was handled very well, providing plenty of evidence to support what you think happened at the end. How this film did not receive at least an Oscar nomination for this year is beyond my power. If you havenâ€™t seen this movie yet, go to Wal-Mart NOW. The DVD is usually in the basket, take it! <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
