I am glad that it was the work of foreign filmmakers, because it cannot be blamed for unfair bias. The police in Jacksonville, for no reason, rush with the court in this case and choose the first black suspect to accuse in the murder of a white foreign tourist. They have chosen 15 years. an old child who is as close to a saint as you can accidentally find, and then make fools of yourself, trying to come up with an unlikely case against him. In addition to the injustice caused by blatant prejudice, there are 6 months of unfair imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager. One question arises: should we, as a society, compensate those who are accused, imprisoned and subsequently found not guilty? This document is well prepared, professionally recorded and presented in an exciting package, from which you do not want to take a 1-minute break. If you care about social justice, do not miss it. It certainly deserves its Oscar.
