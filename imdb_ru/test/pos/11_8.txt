I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I entered the theater, I was not in the mood for that at the time. It looks like the Olive Garden — I like it, but I have to be in the right mood to fully enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I’m not really sure what was holding my breath. The trailers looked good, but the water theme gave me bad memories of Kevin Costner's latest film on the theme Waterworld. In addition, despite the promise Ashton Kutcher made in Butterfly Effect, I still haven't fully sold him. Something about this guy just annoys me. This is probably due to his monkey features. <br /> <br /> It took about two minutes for my fears to subside and my doubts to disappear. The film immediately throws us into a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than the orange facelift of Kenny Rogers. My problems for a short time felt the initial appearance of Kutcher due to the fact that too much effort had been made to paint him ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses, a hard toothpick in the mouth and a sporty grin that would make George Clooney proud? Yes, we understood. I was completely ready to hate him. <br /> <br /> But then he had to go and show a pretty strong performance and make me soften my blows. <br /> <br /> Gosh, ape-man! Effectively combining tense, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor and solid play, The Guardian is a film that I dare say most viewers will like. You can argue about his cliché, predictability and rare moments of digested sweetness, but none of this diminishes the value of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I had a bad feeling that the tempo would slow down too much when Costner starts the training of the young guys, but, on the contrary, the training may be the most interesting aspect of the film. Coast Guard rescuers are heroes whose stories have never been portrayed on the big screen, so I feel a look from the inside at what they are going through and how difficult it is to make it very informative and a great way to familiarize the audience with this. recognized group. <br /> <br /> Do you have what it takes to be a lifeguard? Think about it - you have to perform dangerous missions in cold, dark and turbulent water, and then you have to fight with disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia, and lack of oxygen, trying to help people stuck in panic who depend on you. for their survival. And if all this is not bad enough, sometimes you cannot save everyone, so you must make a difficult decision about who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> A person who wants to take all this responsibility? Not me! I had no idea how it really was for these guys, and who would have thought that I want to thank Ashton Kutcher / Kevin Costner for his education? <br /> <br /> The Guardian not only does a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of heroes, but fortunately for us, it also entertains its paying customers well. <br /> <br /> THE GIST <br /> <br /> Filmmakers who want to look from the inside at what it is like to start a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean may want to give The Guardian a chance. I saw it for free, but if I had paid, I would have felt that I had received the value of my money.
