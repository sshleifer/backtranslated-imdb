When I first saw the movie, I thought it was cute - a family movie. However, until the end of the night and over the next few days, smart moments and funny phrases continued to return to my thoughts and our conversation ... There are a lot of things happening, the classic elements of farce, a good game of characters and Wendy Malik’s storyline is just hysterical. To designate his “film about well-being” is contrary to wit and fun — it is smarter than it seems, like “This is a wonderful life.”
