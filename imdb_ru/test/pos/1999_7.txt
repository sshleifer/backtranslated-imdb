This film is from Turkey, where you will not find the traditions of horror films. At first I was afraid to watch only an adaptation, but, seeing her, I changed my mind. It has an original script. A love movie using the horror theme. Most of the players are not famous young people, but their performance proves that a new generation is coming. Perhaps this is a sign that Turkish cinema is returning after 20 years.
