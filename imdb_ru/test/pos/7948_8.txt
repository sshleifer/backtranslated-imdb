SPOILER WARNING - AND I REALLY MEAN THIS !! DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU ARE NOT READY TO USE THE MAIN ELEMENT OF THE PLOT !! <br /> <br /> OK, first I have to say that I have a relatively high tolerance for depressive films. I will watch and evaluate films about true life horrors (such as war and the Holocaust) or where death and sadness are important to the plot, BUT I hate films like STEAL MAGNOLIAS and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, where the film is built around manipulative death. hero. So already, no matter how well this film is made, it has a BIG blow to it, because one of the main characters dies from the illness at the end (although they never say WHAT he had in the English version with subtitles) . <Br /> <br /> So you might ask yourself: "Then, if this incredible film hates this type of film, then why did he even watch it?" You would have an excellent comment to ask about it, although I hope I'm really not awesome! Well, when I found it in our local library, I had no idea what it was about !!! The film was not designed specifically for export, as the subtitles were in Korean, English and Japanese, and the box was printed in Korean. Well, being a fan of trial films from any country (I saw films from at least 30-40 different countries), I tried. <br /> <br /> Well, besides the obligatory death, I loved the movie and hated it as much as it ended. While I usually hate the miraculous endings of the Hollywood type, I wanted the guy to escape with the help of some new medicine or an experimental operation. I was very upset that he had to die - especially because he seemed to be one of the nicest people I had seen in the movie in a long time. His smile was contagious, and I really wanted him to finally get a girlfriend. Oh well, at least I can appreciate the message of the film to be used at that moment. Excellent acting, music, etc. But, for me, this is not the most pleasant finale. This film was good enough to entice me to try some more Korean movies.
