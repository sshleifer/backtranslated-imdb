Although this can hardly be compared with other sci-fi giants, such as 2001: “Space Odyssey” or “End of the Meeting with the Third Gender,” LIFEFORCE works like a completely frantic and whimsical blend of science fiction and horror elements. For some reason, despite the dialogue, which is approaching the absurd and acting, which does the same, he manages to work because of several very different elements. <br /> <br /> Freely based on Colin Wilson’s 1976 Space Vampire novel, directed by Tobe Hooper (POLTERGEIST; TEXAS SECURITY MASSACK), is engaged in a joint US-British mission aboard the British Space Shuttle Churchill to study the Halley comet . Led by an American commander (Steve Reilsbek) they find the alien space ship in a coma. And when they explore the inside of the spacecraft, they find alien creatures that look like giant bats. Later, Churchill reached the orbit of the Earth, but no response was received from radio calls made from the mission’s home base, the Space Research Center in London. Colombia begins to meet with Churchill, but they discover that the entire ship has been sunk by fire - all except alien creatures encased in glass that are far from being touched by fire, look absolutely perfect. Aliens are returning to Earth ... and the incredible happens there. <br /> <br /> These space vampires flee from the Center for Space Research and instead of draining their victims with blood through bitten wounds, they suck their victims of life force completely out of them. One of them is the Cosmic Girl, a completely naked vampire played by Matilda May. Railsback, the only actual survivor of Churchill, was bought by SRC chief (Frank Finlay) and a British special agent (Peter Firth) to track May, who is in telepathic contact with him. Pretty soon, however, the vampires turned London into a scene of pure holocaust; people are either driven out or turned into zombies, and the threat from NATO to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation is becoming more and more serious. Railsback finally catching up with May, and sacrifice themselves by piercing it with a large metal saber. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly inconsistent, certainly uneven, but still worth watching, Lifeforce, despite the frequent inconsistency of its script and its actions Benefits from the amazing work with special effects of John Dykstra (STAR ​​WARS), one of the best ever seen. Another working element, and this surprise, is Henry Mancini’s incredible orchestral score, almost Wagner’s, just like John Williams ’ball for Star Wars — and Mancini, like Williams before him, uses the London Symphony Orchestra to boot! <br /> <br /> Nowadays, largely forgotten, as well as the critical and box-office catastrophe in 1985, LIFEFORCE, if not for some other reason, should still be considered for those who like weird things. There has never been such a film, and certainly there will not be anything like it.
