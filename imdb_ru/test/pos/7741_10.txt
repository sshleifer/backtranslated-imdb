I like this film and all of its aspects, well put like a comedy and drama. The acting game is gorgeous in the performance of the star cast who play beautifully in the high society of New York. The landscape is incredible, absolutely breathtaking. I also like this story: a successful architect from New York, experiencing a mid-life crisis, leaves his betrayed wife and flees to the Greek island to hide with her daughter, who wants to go with him. just cant express my love enough for this movie. "Show me the magic."
