In Alfred Hitchcock’s film Strangers on a Train, Patricia Highsmith Guy Haynes (Farley Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) meet for the first time on the train and discuss the idea of ​​two murders. Anthony's rather persistent one suggests that he could kill the unfaithful wife Haines, and Haynes could kill the powerful father Anthony. The absence of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes remain solved. The essence of the conversation leaves Haynes more relaxed with the impression that this proposal is not entirely serious. Complications arise later when Anthony kills Haines's wife in an amusement park, and then chases Haynes to keep his side of the deal. <br /> <br /> The differences between the two men are obvious from the start. Haynes is a professional tennis player, respectable and rather modest in his achievements, while Anthony’s life goes nowhere, and he admits that he was thrown out of three colleges for drunkenness and gambling. Haynes has a relationship with a senator’s daughter whom he wants to marry. Anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical maneuver on the part of Haynes to secure a career path. Differences in character are also enhanced visually. Anthony often lives in shaded areas and travels in a boat called “Pluto,” while Haynes is often seen from a more heroic point of view, represented by low camera angles. <br /> <br /> There are some striking visual sequences, such as: - <br /> <br /> (1) The murder of Haines’s wife, which can be seen from the reflection of her glasses that fall to the ground when she tries to free herself from Anthony. <br /> <br /> (2) an image of Anthony alone, dressed in black and looking very small against the backdrop of the huge white building of the Jefferson Memorial. <br /> <br /> (3) The case when all spectators at a tennis match shake their heads in unison, following the action, while one head (Anthony) frighteningly remains motionless in a position looking at Heins. <br /> <br /> (4) The scene in which the carousel gets out of control and eventually effectively falls. <br /> <br /> Frequent use of "doubles" throughout history, for example, Haines and Anthony were originally presented as 2 foot notes coming out of their taxi and going to the train. When the train leaves the station, there are 2 sets of tracks, each of which provides a choice of 2 ways forward. Two men discuss the killing of two potential victims and order two double temples. Hitchcock's cameo sees him fighting on a train with a double bass. Haynes feels cheated when his wife refuses an agreement with her to meet with a lawyer to arrange a divorce. Haynes's wife goes to an amusement park with two guys. When Anthony encounters her before killing, he lights the cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses. Later, Anthony becomes very embarrassed when he meets the youngest daughter of the senator, who he considers a double for his wife Haynes. Anthony also feels like a double when Haines refuses to continue the second murder. When Haynes drives alone in a train going to Metcalf, he sees two people in the same carriage, knocking their feet in the same way as he and Anthony. <br /> <br /> The film takes place at an excellent pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as the youngest daughter of the senator) are particularly strong.
