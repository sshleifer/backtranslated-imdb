I rate this movie on a curve, in other words, this is not the best movie that has ever been made, but it does exactly what it intended to do. This is a great T & A film. I have no idea how much T or A was seen in this film, but I saw one frame in which there were 16 naked T at a time, just to give you an idea. Everywhere there are topless girls. There is a wet t-shirt competition scene. And the culmination is the game of touch football between two women's teams, and every time someone strikes, the entire enemy team loses a piece of clothing. I don't know why it gets such a low rating here. Perhaps the people who gave him low marks thought they were going to see Citizen Kane. I love this movie and hope to find more similar ones. If you are looking for a GOOD T & A marching film, I would recommend this one.
