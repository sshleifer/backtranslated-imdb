A sign of what to expect in this film came when I noticed that it was the first (and probably the last) film that has in its credits “Vomiting Technique”. <br /> <br /> In some pair of watches silly jokes, cheerful violence and excellent humor. <br /> <br /> This film was exactly what you would expect from the guys from the Lower, and it’s very nice to see them in great shape after the life of Rick Mealla. the threat of an accident. <br /> <br /> Richie (Mayall) and Eddie (Edmondson) are too similar to their lower characters, if we can criticize at all, and Edmondson does a surprisingly good job with the director of the film. <br /> <br /> This film has already produced predictable comparisons with Fawlty Towers, which are simply not there, and Guest House Paradiso is hardly Torquay! <br /> <br /> Beware of the wonderfully created dialogue between violence and chaos. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Bottom, you probably hate it, but I liked it.
