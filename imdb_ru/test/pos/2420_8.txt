I read a few reviews of the film, and I got the impression that it is not as good as previous editions of Karate Kid. Although “Karate Kid II” still remains my favorite, I felt that this fourth episode of the film series is compatible with others, and it has some important lessons to share. Unlike previous versions, a karate student is a teenager who follows a slightly different path than a teenager. Maggie finds this a bit more complicated, but fits the case. The plot twists are believable and predictable. I found that the bad guys are a bit one-dimensional, but this weakness is present in all parts to varying degrees. The camera work is impressive and from time to time shows some beautiful landscapes. Zen monastery is strict and charming. Zen monks add a bit of humor and lightness to the narrative flow. I liked the "Zen Bowling" scenes, which are a humorous counterpoint for a more serious Zen shooting scene earlier. The quality level of the movie is like a good TV series. The music chosen for the background is very good, especially when the Little River Band plays "Listen to Your Heart". The lessons in the film are valuable and worth studying. They feel loyal to the spirit of karate and take care not to extol the fighting unit. In general, I liked it.
