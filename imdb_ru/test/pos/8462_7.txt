I saw this movie when it came out, and then a couple more times later. I watch it now 20 years later, and this is still a very good story. Is there a movie in film life? Yes, but, alas, at that time there was no life time yet, so some air was needed. <br /> <br /> The cast was excellent. The story was a little schmalny; Two women become close friends and without the knowledge that one of them has an affair with the husband of other friends. She is invited to the house for a party, and that is how she learns that her lover is the husband of her best friend. She is terrified and tries to break the affair. Shortly thereafter, he tragically died in a car accident that leads to both women. Of course, the wife accidentally finds out about this case and wants Holly to leave her life, but their friendship can win, because they need each other. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good story. great cast and performance. I really liked it.
