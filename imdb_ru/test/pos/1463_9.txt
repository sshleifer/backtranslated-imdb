After the heights in the dark, it never seemed that Holness and Adobe could create something half better than Garth Marengi. However, I think that the man in itself is as good a show (in good episodes) as a dark place. I can’t say that 2 of the episodes are really not that good, but the other 4 are sure to make up for it. If I had to choose 2 excellent episodes, then I would choose the pilot of Formula 4 Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and the great Garth Marengi. already having some idea of ​​the program is a real plus, since Dean Lerner plays a lot from the inside, but even if you haven't seen a lot of Dean, I recommend it, as some of the gossip he launches are genius, i.e. His argument with Def Lepord about their name. In general, a great show that simply does not score points due to a couple of less funny episodes.
