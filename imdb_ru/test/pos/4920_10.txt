When I first watched the trailer, I had to decide if this series would fit my collection. But, having heard about it, I decided to buy it. When I bought the entire collection in a box, this was exactly what I wanted to see. It was very funny, and the characters were pretty cool. Favorite characters of the series: Marion, Carrot, Knights Haze, Big Mom and Dott. I also liked the starting and ending songs of the theme. The show also has some great voice talents from Tiffany Grant, Jason Douglas and others. But, nevertheless, this show is one of the greatest. So if you want to see something cool. Then this is a show.
