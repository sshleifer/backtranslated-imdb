The main criticism of “EARTH” is that it is cheap, special effects are bad and so on and so forth. Yes, some special effects are terribly bad, but many lose sight of what is actually quite funny, which is very important in my book. <br /> <br /> For comparison, just look at the latest STAR WARS Films: they have the latest, greatest special effects created with the latest technological advances that can create stunning visual effects as far as human imagination can imagine , and yet, with all this brightness, these films were as exciting as a funeral. As Yoda would say, it's funny that it is not so! In other words, who cares that FX is not the best when the spirit of the film is swift, humorous and clearly tuned to the side of action. I love everything about the EARTH KERNEL: the contrast between heavy Victorian England and the wild, otherworldly, colorful environment of Pellucidar, character set, the concept of the lost underworld, telepathic pterodactyls, rebellious human slaves, Jubal is ugly (laughs), inspired by Peter Cushing's association which is great!) and Doug McClure, great music (this is really good), the cinematography of the amazing Alan Hume and, equally important, Caroline Munro. She is sexually sexy in this film. One of the sexiest beauties in B-films ever filmed on screen. <br /> <br /> Seriously, anyone who doesn’t like this movie doesn’t know what fun is. Give me on EARTH NUCLEUS over any sturdy STAR WARS prequels any time! At least she has Carolyn Munro, which none of the CGI fx can recreate.
