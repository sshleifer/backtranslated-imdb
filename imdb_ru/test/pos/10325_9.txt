Well, other reviewers pretty much covered the highlights of this great little pearl, that is, the story that began in life as the material for Buster Keaton's quiet classics "7 Chances." Comedy, or acting in any genre for this, simply interprets the scene and the lines that someone wrote and performed before, if it is not completely original creation. Here we have The Stooges, essentially making the material that was written and performed by someone else, and yet for a small budget, a short period of film time, they cope with things just fine. Regardless of what is written in their films, the real "puppets" know that they have made a great contribution to the lines and direction. They took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation. The words spoken by Emil Sitka during a documentary about boys. Here, what seems to be their usual anarchy because of something as simple as marriage is actually organized chaos. Each line is ideally designed with the corresponding physical actions. How many comedians today can claim such skill? The most obvious is the Seinfeld team, but no other that I have seen in the last 35 years watching television. Critics will always be “fluff-fluff” by The Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others, but again ... who ever remembers the names of the critic or what did they say? Just watch, laugh and enjoy!
