I think this is definitely the case. A letter of such quality that beginner English students should simulate their conversations after dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey (Bronson) and Miss Catherine Davis (Deborah Ruffin) (more on this character later) is very clear and to the point: Miss Davies says: “I hope you like chicken. This is the only thing I know how to do, “to which Quersey deftly replies:“ The chicken is good. I like chicken. ”If it’s not English grammar 101, I don’t know what it is. <br /> <br /> Another thing about this character is Miss Davis: Quersey is sleeping with her on a second date after she practically rushes at him and tells him she wants to see him “for the last time” (this is the fourth time they met) before moving to her sister’s house in Binghamton, New York, to run away from the creeps; then he really she doesn’t see her eyes while her body burns in the street in just a few minutes. Quersey doesn’t even call f name throughout the film. Never. Never say: "Come here, Katie" or "This is a beautiful dress that you wear, Catherine" or "Be careful, Katie, otherwise the goose will go!" <br /> <br /> And while this “love" develops between them, Freiker (Havan O'Herlihih) keeps a close eye on them. It’s like if Quersey used her as a lure to get to Freiker, just like he uses the camera or a car. Of course, when Fraker bites, Quercy bites hard ... in the most incredible sequence of events, ever sealed ennyh in the film! The last fifteen minutes or so may only compete with the last thirty minutes of the Delta Force in their brilliance. And that attaches great importance to the Delta Force. In another movie, you can see Ed Lauter kill Alex Winter to bring back Charles Bronson, a restless gang leader apparently calling to a neo-Nazi biker hotline to help him, and clever Broadway dancers wearing mesh tops posing as street punks, everything was written for a soundtrack written by none other than Jimmy Page. If this is not the highest comedy, then there is nothing funny. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there are a thousand ways to declare the unintended comedy Death Wish 3, but the only way to truly understand it is to watch and judge for yourself.
