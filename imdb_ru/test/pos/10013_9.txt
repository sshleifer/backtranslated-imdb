I saw this film at the 2002 Rotterdam International Film Festival. It seemed to be one of the less popular films at the festival, however, as it turned out, the more interesting. <br /> <br /> The story of an actor trying to enter into a fight with himself and his surroundings after quitting drug addiction is based on real facts. In addition, the characters playing in the film are real people experiencing this experience again, this time for a film that is partially set up as a stage play. Not only do they all turn out to be good actors, Jia Hongsheng's parents are actors and in real life, the methods used to highlight their relationship with Jia are very effective. <br /> <br /> Jia Hongsheng - the actor of some Chinese militants of the late eighties begin with the nineties. Later you can see him in such wonderful films as Frozen and Suzhou River. In the interim between these two career achievements, Jia becomes a drug addict and loses all desire to act or even do something productive, with the exception of a few futile attempts to become a guitar virtuoso. <br /> <br /> I like the way the writer of the script decides to focus on his behavior after giving up drugs, not on drugs. We really feel the pain and struggle that Jia is in. At the same time, we hate him for the way he treats others. <br /> <br /> The film draws the viewer to the tedious pattern in which Jia seems to be dragged along by her parents and sister, who are trying to take care of him. As we conduct personal “interviews” with the characters, we feel that we are becoming acquainted with Jia, not only through ourselves, but through others. <br /> <br /> The film feels heavy, but Jia’s scenes repeat. Bejing and parties with friends ease the tone. As well as bitter humor in many events throughout the film. The music is beautiful and stayed with me some time later. This film may not appeal to many people, but for those interested in a more serious and modern Chinese film, this is a strong recommendation.
