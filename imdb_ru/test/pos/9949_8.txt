I remember running home from school almost every day to catch 5 monster movies on the KTLA channel, but I never ran home faster than when this movie was planned. Somehow, the idea of ​​being a boy and having a giant robot as a friend appealed to me in a completely unique way. Of course, I pretended to be Spider-Man, Batman and other superheroes, but I really wanted to be Johnny Sacco over any of them. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this film for 30 years and I still remember it well. Who can forget how a giant robot fired rockets from his fingers! Or how about Gilloten throwing his nails to blow up! Gosh, I can still whistle a musical theme that sounds at the end, which is so tragic that I remember crying a few times! <br /> <br /> Only in one other film there is such magic, this film is in my head, and this is the Wizard of Oz. But I have seen this film many times since childhood. Of course, the “Wizard of Oz” is a real classic, while “Journey into Space” is a nonsense with a low budget. These two films should not even be mentioned in the same sentence, but for a young boy it’s not high production value or continuity that captures your heart, his flying monkeys and giant robots! <br /> <br /> P.S. My cousin used to create a very accurate impression of the Giant robot (he pronounced it as “Giant Robot”). If you remember, the giant robot had a special way to fire its missiles, and my cousin cold. I made him endlessly repeat this procedure for my personal pleasure.
