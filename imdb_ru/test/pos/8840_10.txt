It could not. <br /> <br /> From the cutting dialogue to the super special effects, this film has been a joy everywhere. The immediate feeling of bitterness in Antarctica, the closeness to the characters, which accumulates at a basic level before the actual action warms up, and the tricky finale combine to make it one of the most memorable and enjoyable films. > <br /> In contrast to the long list of films that have tried to use the theme of visitors from another planet, The Thing comes out on top and laughs. Who can forget the perfectly synchronized dialogue and amazing special effects? Special effects that are much more impressive than computer-generated images that we see today. For example, I discovered that some of the most enjoyable aspects of a film are how we were slowly introduced to each member of the film crew, and how they all had some distinctive character traits. It was not just a meaningless flick of bloody slaughter and horror. This movie had a feeling. Emotions. <br /> <br /> I really can't recommend this movie highly enough. I have not yet seen in my class anything that could come close to matching, not to mention the improvement, almost perfect action and time used in this clever multi-dimensional cinematic feat.
