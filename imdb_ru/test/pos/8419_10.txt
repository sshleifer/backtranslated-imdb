Shvaas is awesome! Given that the manufacturers had a tight budget, they did an excellent job. It is necessary to watch. The little child did a great job, and there was emotion in his eyes. Grandpa is at his best. The photo is gorgeous. Technically correct and very creative. It helps to add a lot of emotion to the main content. The film will keep you captive, and do not be surprised if you are shocked after the film and the story remains in your memory for several days. I sincerely hope that they will get into the final Oscar nomination <br /> <br /> Enjoy and not miss again
