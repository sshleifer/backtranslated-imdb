I discovered this film by accident, and it was a really pleasant surprise. Christmas classics, it is also one of the great comedies of the 40s. The storyline is simple: Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stenwick) makes a living writing culinary columns for the magazine. At Christmas, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet), asks her to invite a young, weakened sailor to a farm in Connecticut, about which she writes. The only problem: she does not have a farm, and she does not know how to cook. To get out of the jam, Elizabeth agrees to marry a rich friend (Reginald Gardiner, who has a farm) and flies to Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix. <br /> <br /> Peter Godfrey has a great leadership, and the cast is truly wonderful: Stanwick has never been better than this witty and yet romantic woman. Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall make fun and supportive people characters. The only weak point is the lead man, Dennis Morgan. He starts well, but as the film goes on, it gets really boring. You feel almost sorry that Elizabeth Lane ends up with him, not with Gary Cooper or David Niven, who both would be more suitable for the role. In any case, this is a merry Christmas movie with a refreshing bill, and I advise it to anyone who loves to spend merry and sweet holidays ... in Connecticut.
