The second live adventure for Asterix is ​​much better than the glued elements of ten different stories that were called the first movie, instead staying close enough to the original comic. <br /> <br /> In short, Queen Cleopatra has made a deal with Cezer to build a palace in Egypt to show that the Egyptians are great people. Royal Architect Edifis is looking for help from Asterix, Obelix and the Druid Getafix to complete his task. There are a few high-profile laughable moments, some jokes that only the French can get (mock up at 35 hours a week), while others are more versatile. Special effects with a large budget are impressive, but overshadow the jokes from the original comic strip. <br /> <br /> Depardieu and Clavier still work brilliantly in pairs, and Monica Bellucci makes a great casting in the role of Cleopatra. In addition, for lovers of comics, funny pirates watch make up for their absence in film 1.
