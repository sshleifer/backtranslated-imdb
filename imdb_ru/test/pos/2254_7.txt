The film “All Illuminated” comes from the first time by writer-director Lie Schreiber, who adapts Jonathan Safran Foer's first novel. The book was ambitious and extensive, its magic-realistic elements and vivid use of language, it would seem impossible to imagine on the screen. The film, wisely, tries less. Although the end result is not as wildly original as in the novel, it is still a complete film about a strange Eastern European journey or, as one of the heroes would say, “a very rigorous search.” <br /> <br /> This character is Alex (Eugene Hatz), a young Ukrainian who loves American pop culture, but cannot understand English directly. Nevertheless, his grandfather (Russian actor Boris Leskin), managing a travel company serving American Jews, convinces him to work as a translator for Jonathan (Elijah Wood). Jonathan explores the history of his family and, in particular, tries to find a woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. During their quest, more than one family secret is revealed. <br /> <br /> Jonathan from the film (not to be confused with the author of the novel) is a polyleukpman that steals his grandmother's prostheses in order to add to his collection of “family things. Wood's calm, wide-open look works very well in this role. Hatz makes his debut as a frivolous, frivolous Alex. His malapropism is hilarious, but he is also able to cope with the character’s growing self-awareness. Mickey's dog is very funny, like crazy Sammy Davis Jr., and one of the few dogs I have ever seen is not very cool and not easygoing. <br /> <br /> “Everything is lit up” eventually the Holocaust acquires a human scale, asking us to recall it not as a general event, but as millions of specific small tragedies. Resembling a European film, he also ponders the influence of past events on contemporary young people, such as Jonathan and Alex. With an original perspective, strong performances and some very vivid visual effects, "Everything is lit" is a great job for a beginner, and I hope Schreiber will continue to make films.
