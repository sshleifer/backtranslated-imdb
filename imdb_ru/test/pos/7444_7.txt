SOME BASIC SPOILERS, YOU WERE WARNED <br /> <br /> I saw this film yesterday at the Venice Film Festival, and I have to admit that, being a fan, it was REALLY IMPRESSIVE. Great graphics, great music, great dubbing, great action films and so on ... BUT there is but. ALL the film was thought EXCLUSIVELY for gamers who liked it, and therefore he can enjoy every link, character, joke inside (you should see a joke with winning music, which is especially comical), and so on. D. Poor man who is not in the FF world, Obviously, he will see the magnificence of the technical part, but CAN'T understand the inner satisfaction seen, for example, the appearance of Barrett and the shooting at Bahamut FULLY OF THEM WHERE. He will ask himself: “WHO IS THIS GUY?” And I cannot blame him. He can't even understand what a gamer feels when there is an opening game music in OPEN SEQUENCE, Nanaki runs in a canyon with his two cubs, howls on the ruins of Midgar, and then "498 years ago ...". Almost all the characters appeared or were quoted (including Riva, Tseng and Elena), and Renault and Rude were really stupid and comical to see, but the last impression the film left me was “the last dream of a hardcore gamer, but much less for a Fan movie ... ".
