I like Armand Assante, and my cable company’s resume sounded interesting, so I’ve already looked at it twice and will probably be back again. <br /> <br /> The early stage is difficult to follow, but later it becomes clear. I believe that the screenwriter coped well with his tasks. <br /> <br /> Some actions are not convincing, but perhaps this is because I have always expected some kind of double cross-cross. In this case, a bad acting game would be the insincerity of the characters interacting with each other, so it fits very well. <br /> <br /> An important topic - the owner of the carnival (Assante) launders money for the local casino. and his wife snake charmer (Dagmara Dominchik) wants to steal him. She complains to Archie (Reedus) about how terrible her life is and how he could help her out of this. <br /> <br /> There are 3 or 4 plot rotations (which is probably the cause of all these weaknesses), and as soon as you think you have solved the mystery, something else will happen. <br /> <br /> My account 8/10 is basically a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> I won I won’t say more - I don’t like spoilers, so I don’t want to be them, but I believe that this film is worth your time.
