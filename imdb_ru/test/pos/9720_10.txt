Each story has a lesson for young and old. But what I have to say can ruin a future story. But I believe in what I have to say to everyone. for one particular episode only: Soldier and Death. <br /> <br /> Well ... of all the stories that stand out to me, this is “Soldier and Death”, because it was a moment in my life. I realized that life was the limit. I am not kidding. Airing was on my 8 1/2 birthday ... and I will always remember that. I did not remember its name until tonight, but I created a new synopsis. (May 15, 1988) <br /> <br /> It is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part of life. It is also difficult for adults to admit that children can accept this fact. I am living proof (currently 28 years old) that children can accept this fact and remind adults from time to time ... <br /> <br /> I write this with tears in my eyes. Heath Ledger - a wonderful actor of my age - died today. It reminded me of the many lessons that I learned in my life. Therefore, I write this as a reminder to young and old ... no one is immune from what awaits us. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say that death will happen, but this story was the first time I saw death as not a bad thing; but part of life was literally in this story. I can't help it. It was a turning point for me, and it will always be. <br /> <br /> And for that ... <br /> <br /> I love you, Jim Henson (and I still remember most of your work in life until the day you died, and your Muppets Memorial) and thanks to Brian Henson for keeping the Workshop !!! Honestly, I thank you, all your colleagues, editors and interns. <br /> <br /> A scene is just a scene / A show is just a show / But Imagination will create Magic / The world will know this forever. <br /> <br /> Thank you !!! <br /> <br /> (And for everyone who doubts me ... Dance, Magic dance)
