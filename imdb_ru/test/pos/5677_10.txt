BLACK WATER should be one of the best Australian films that I have seen in many years. My friend and I sat holding each other's hands, jumping in all the right places. This is the same crocodile film, like OPEN WATER. In other words, creatures are only part of a dilemma, a trap in which people find themselves in the circumstances. It is amazing to see how director Andrew Trauki and David Nerlich extract so much anxiety and anxiety from such a modest situation. And when I say “terror”, these are not exaggerated, artificially constructed tortuous moments, but smaller touches that, when you ask yourself “how I would feel in such a situation”, lead you to the conclusion “scared to madness”. The performances were magnificent, the progress and magnificent cuts to a different life in the mangroves were excellent, and the last moments of the film seemed very correct. This is a successful debut for two directors who should be justly proud of themselves. Go and see this very beautifully made and played intense film.
