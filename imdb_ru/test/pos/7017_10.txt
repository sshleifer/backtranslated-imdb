I think dirty dancing was a great movie, they tried to have another party in Havana, which was good, but it didn't look like dirty dancing. I would like to see another dirty dance with the same people. without them, I think it will be a mess. In many cases, films are made, and when they try to add more, they begin to change people and make the movie go down the slope. I would really like dirty dancing to have another one to see what happened after they could be together. Patrick Jennifer succeeded together. This film was shot in 1997. Itâ€™s time to do another one. but this time we start by stopping and leaving the same people in it.
