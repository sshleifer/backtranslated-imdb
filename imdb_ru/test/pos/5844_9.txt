Oz is a great series, one of the underrated television shows. It has something to do with the soap opera that something bad always happens, and it fascinates every case of evil. From my conversations with people who are actually in prison, this rings true. Each interaction has some fraud running in the background. Behind each action is a scheme, a plot in which you can play someone else. I love this show so much that it is one of the few TV shows that I bought completely on DVD. <br /> <br /> And yes, I agree with the writer before me, who noted that there are elements of satire in it. A character in a wheelchair who offers his preconceived outlook on life does so with a certain humorous humor.
