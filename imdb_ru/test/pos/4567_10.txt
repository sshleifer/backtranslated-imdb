Claudine is a film that in the worst case represents the American system. The social security system was originally created as a springboard for those families who needed this extra hand to stand up. The film clearly showed how the social security system is destroying the family unit. In other words, if the father or any man appears in the lives of women and children, their financial support from the system will be jeopardized if it is not terminated. The fight of the poor can be seen around the world. I would like to see a reproduction of this film in stores where everyone can rent or buy for their library collection.
