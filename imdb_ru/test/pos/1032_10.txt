President Harry S. Truman once said that the only news in the world is a story you don't know. <br /> <br /> Seven years before the outstanding Pulitzer Prize of Richard Rhodes “Creating an Atomic Bomb”, the BBC released a seven-part mini-series “Oppenheimer” that explored the character of the people who designed and created weapons that opened the atomic age, forever connecting science and technology with the state (and, in particular, the military), not just creating history, but also changing the world forever. <br /> <br /> The production is flawless, nothing less than a miracle; not only the main characters, but even the minor characters have a strange resemblance to the people depicted. In particular, Sam Waterston starring American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, scientific director of the Manhattan Project, who was based in the laboratory of Los Alamos, New Mexico (the place he personally chose); Manning Redwood as General Leslie R. Groves, who oversaw the entire Manhattan Engineering District (the official name of the project); David Suchet as Oppenheimer's physicist and main opponent, Edward Teller (who whispered Ronald Reagan almost forty years later and brought us the Strategic Defense Initiative Star Wars) and Jan Sheldon as Kitty Oppenheimer. Attention to detail is consistently excellent. <br /> <br /> Partly a thriller, partly a love story - and, ultimately, a tragedy, this series accurately recreates a chapter in world history - and in science - that we cannot forget. Highest recommendation. <br /> <br /> (NOTE: Viewers who liked this show will also enjoy the 13-part series by Jacob Bronowski's The Man's Ascent and the BBC movie by Michael Frein's Copenhagen.)
