When a group of escaped criminals manage to flee to a remote island, they soon discover that a strangely threatening doctor lives in their new home (Richard Johnson from Zombie 2), a mad scientist (Joseph Cotten), his beautiful daughter (Barbara Bach) and hordes of superstitious the natives. According to the tribesmen, the doctor has created grotesque creatures half human, half fish for evil, secretive purposes. one day, they begin to change their mind. "Screamers" - a very interesting mixture of "Mysterious Island" and "Humanoids from the depths." There are a lot of blood with a really steep decapitation scene and a tearing throat. so-so, but the film is dynamic and interesting. Give it a look. 8 out of 10.
