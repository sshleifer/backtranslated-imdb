I saw this film many years ago, I tried to find it, but perhaps for obvious reasons it is nowhere to be found. It was so esoteric, and, nevertheless, it is one of the few films that stayed with you for a long time. I'm still not sure what the reality of the film is, and perhaps, like the principle of uncertainty, darkness is a definite thing. Acting is great, the atmosphere is always filled with premonition, the general melancholicity is permeated, and yet it is difficult not to plunge into the story. I rented it, thinking it was science fiction (it was in the science fiction section with some completely misleading advertising), but it’s quite clear that it’s not. Or horror, or even the unknown. In fact, you feel thankful that the director took it upon himself to make such a film for which there is obviously no solid audience. I know that some people have complained about the short role of Klaus Kinski, but I think this is very appropriate - its limited impact is crucial for shaping the mystery of this film.
