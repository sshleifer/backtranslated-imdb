Despite the fact that he was following his critics, I got great pleasure precisely because he is. Eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. Soderbergh has long been engaged in artful art, won the Oscar and is at the top of his game. Ocean 12 is Steve's easy, commercial, fluffy day on Midway, if you like. Usually I'm not a fan of Zeta-Jones, but I even have to admit that Kate is awesome in this movie. This completes the cries for the upcoming trekle, and I will be one of the millions who flock to see George, Brad and Mattâ€™s 120 minutes playing out Clooney's Lago di Como excavations when they are cheating on some rich, bad guy. If we moved the 3 parts of The Lord of the Rings, I ask if we can drool over the lid of salt and Clooney pepper again?
