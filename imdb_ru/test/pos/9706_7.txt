Just left the preview, and wow, this movie was hilarious. Perhaps better than the first, but at least its equal. If you do not like a donkey or a really unnecessary number of male naked bodies (much more than the first), then stay far, far away. But if you dig out all this stuff, then this film will not disappoint. Toro Totter - the greatest invention in history. OK. so my review was not long enough ... Everything else I have to say is poor, poor Dunn, they really knock this shit out of him. So if you like masochistic humor and fertile male nudity, and certainly the nastiest female nudity ever (John Waters participates, do I need to say more?), Then this film will keep you in the seams because of this. I never stopped laughing, and actually came out wet with sweat.
