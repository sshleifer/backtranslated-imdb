Excellent and touching story of the end of a uniquely intimate affair. Again, the meaning of the film, paraphrasing another comment, is that all relationships can be unique and intimate. A really high-quality short film that caught me most busy, but at the same time allowed me to go down to the sofa and look motionless and quiet. Bobby and Tessa are powerfully moving characters, and anyone who has experienced the end of a love affair will find this film a cathartic exercise. In addition, the idea of ​​“film in the film” is very well combined with this cast and quite fascinating, although somewhat melancholic.
