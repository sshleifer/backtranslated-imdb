If you've ever seen "Open Water," then this is the same rough, sharp, indie-style film. I liked the action, the suspense. building it all slowly, I just hope they don’t do what they did with Open Water, with this continuation ... but anyway, the only thing I didn’t like was the annoying younger sister, all the time rooted for the crocodile ... the film begins as it should be, the children are going on a trip, they hire a guide who mysteriously left 5 minutes. before they got there, so I think his assistant took the two sisters and the boy out of the water, now consider that this is the second day of their adventures, oddly enough, the first day they spent in the wild, hmm crocodile farm .. so they are there, and everything is fine for a while, then an explosion, a crocodile time ... very intense, you know something in this film, you don't see a crocodile, damn it a lot, but when you do it, damn take it, it's very scary, I like the muzzle and the eyes of a crocodile, and a cloak of fog that seems to envelop the crocodile For the first time, when he raises his head above the water is very very creepy, but good, in general, this is a great movie, if you can pass by the annoying little sister.
