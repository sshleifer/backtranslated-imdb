I liked this movie because of the dialogue and the excellent playing of Candace and Jacqueline. However, until now, when I watched the Betty David Marathon at TNT, I never knew that this film is a remake of the 1943 Betty Davis classics called Old Friend. Bette is shooting along with Miriam Hopkins, with whom she was in a terrible feud during the making of the film, because Bette had an affair with her husband Miriam, who shot her in the film before they made “Old Familiarity”. <br /> <br /> In any case, both are worth every minute spent watching. I highly recommend this movie if you like a lot of dialogue and drama. In my opinion, this is a study of the psychology of women and their relationships with each other.
