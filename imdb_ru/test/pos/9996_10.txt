This film gives golf a high rating, it was well played and well directed. We give you an idea of ​​the history, which will appeal to some sports fans. One historical factor gives it a high rating; the golf course in Brooklyn was really well done. I am in the northeast and have seen in Brooklyn fans and those who love the game. The film was well made at all levels. MUST SEE 5 stars. The acting was excellent, Disney has another winner in his bag of Great Movies. If for some other reason, watch the film to give hope and support to young people who may not see hope in their lives. I would tell you that the setting, while in the late 1800s and early 1900s, is very realistic. Costumes and dialects were also at their best. Above and beyond dereliction of duty for a golf film. Be sure to look for both fans and non-fans.
