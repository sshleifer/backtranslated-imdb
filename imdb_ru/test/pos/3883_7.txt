James Aaron, a plump actor living in Chicago, is a man who loves to eat things that do not suit him. This became clear early on when Dick, a friendly seller, advises him to stay away from junk food. Aaron, an actor working in the Second City of Chicago, is a loving person who is not very lucky in the love department. He still lives with his mother, a posh lady who encourages him to go out and enjoy. James has another job - a kind of “impartial camera” where people tune in to unusual situations, for example, they surprise the mechanic and tell him that he is the father of his daughter, whom he never knew. <br /> <br /> On the day he meets his friend Larry, he learns about the casting for the remake of Marty, his favorite movie. Being a big man, he clearly identifies himself with the character of the film. The life of James largely coincides with the life of Paddy Chaefsky in the picture. He wants to try himself in the role, because he knows that he can pay tribute to this role. <br /> <br /> One day he meets Beth at the fountain with soda. James likes a woman who once invites him to go shopping with her intimate clothes. He ends up having sex with her, thinking that they are fine, but Beth has another surprise when she tells him why they went to sleep, because she never did that with a fat man. Being frustrated, James stumbles upon an attractive elementary school teacher who seems to share his love of jazz. In the end, we see James fulfill his long-time dream of playing a major role in the play of "Marty" in a nursing home. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin, a benevolent character, demonstrates a talent for this type. comedy is associated with his friend Larry David. Although both men differ in style of play, his view of James Aaron is perfectly justified. As a director, he did it before, although this is an original concept that he should follow. <br /> <br /> One of the advantages of the film is the people involved in the project. Sarah Silverman impresses Beth. Bonnie Hunt emphasizes his role as a school teacher to good results. Mina Kolb, his mother, the role she played in "Curbing her enthusiasm" with excellent results. Director Pavel Mazursky is also in a minor role. Joey Slotnik, Tim Kazurinsky, Richard Kind, David Pasqueci, Larry Neumann, Jr., Gina Gershon and other actors make a valuable contribution. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin is a talented man whose next efforts will be welcomed by his fans.
