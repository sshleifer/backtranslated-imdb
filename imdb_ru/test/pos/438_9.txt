In this film, there are frames that can be pictures of Renoir with bright colors on a muted background. The humorous combination of sexual honesty and innocence refreshes the fifties in this film and makes the old storyline of genius that becomes a star pleasant. The “can-can” number at the end seems realistic and exciting, but not as much as in the American dance sequence.
