Beautifully photographed and short film. He remembers the feeling of this family and most of the country in the period before and after Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br /> I highly appreciated the visual appearance of the film - naturalistic and at the same time poetic. The magnificent work of the great DP, David Boyd. <br /> <br /> Despite the family film, the story never turns into a midlin or saccharin. We understand and believe the motivation that promotes a young boy on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother to his older brother and I don’t wonder why he is going to do what he does. I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother during this crisis time. The child is strong and Jonathan Ferrat’s performance is superb, as is Ron Perlman’s veteran performance.
