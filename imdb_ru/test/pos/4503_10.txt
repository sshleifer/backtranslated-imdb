This is absolutely one of our favorite games of 2007. <br /> <br /> The tale of two boys who came from different worlds, but as close as the brothers, is brilliantly told. <br /> <br /> Fine shot, and the script - from childhood to adulthood, he never hesitates. <br /> <br /> A brilliant understanding of the lost culture and a very good way to understand the cultures and traditions of Farsi is also an exceptional story in itself. He is both compassionate and exhilarating, billowing and filled with great sadness, joyful and depressing. <br /> <br /> With excellent casting characteristics and great technical skills behind the scenes, this is truly a film at its best. > <br /> The highest recommendation: a real piece of life that uplifting and informing.
