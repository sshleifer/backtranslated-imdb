"All Abir-r-r-d" Vries Frenleng - one of the best cartoons of Sylvester and Tweety. Unlike many repetitive cartoons in the series, which simply transplant the same tired jokes into a new setting, All Abir-r-r-d makes maximum use of its concept. Tweety and Sylvester are domestic animals that are sent unattended throughout the country by train. Dealing with both a vigilant official and an evil bulldog, Sylvester is denied work. Sylvester and Tweety’s cartoons have always benefited some additional participants, and “All Abir-r-r-d” is a good example of how these extra characters help. Although they are not particularly memorable creatures, they throw a few more obstacles in the path of Sylvestre and make for a more interesting battle. This early shorting of Sylvester and Tweety presses many of the right buttons, and although Tweety is often particularly annoying with its forced wit, there are some delightfully brutal antics between Sylvester and the dog, culminating in an amazingly brutal climax that is unfortunately overshadowed by the final unfamiliar not qwip from tweety.
