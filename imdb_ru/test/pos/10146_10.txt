Some people say that the pace of this film is a bit slow, but how is this different from any other Hitchcock movie? They all move very deliberately and, like a dot, voltage spikes and brilliant installations are injected through them. This film only gives us the necessary amount of comic relief, which makes waiting scenes even more intense. The Albert Hall scene is one of the best examples of Pure Cinema that exists in the Hitchcock collection (probably the best of which is the almost Rear Window). Hitchcock's “pure cinema” meant a series of, as a rule, small pieces of a film that could be combined without dialogue in order to tell the story visually. This, of course, is the basic definition of the sequence of Albert Hall, as well as the shorter sequence of stairs at the end of the picture. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock doesn't have many mistakes here, and the actress is gorgeous, especially Doris Day in a rather amazing serious role.
