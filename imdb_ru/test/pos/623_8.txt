Superbly created low-budget thriller with more turns than you can shake a stick, and a lot of disgusting humor along the way. <br /> <br /> Actors play it very well, although Richards himself The focus of a film director is sometimes difficult. A tiny cameo with two scenes by Sir Alec Guinness, posing a threat to the Moscow criminal tzar, is just icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Worth watching again, but not in the dark nights when you are all alone!
