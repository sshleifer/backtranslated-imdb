Watching "Plots with a View" (in the US called Betty's Commitment), I had the feeling that more films were to be made in Wales. It depicts a woman (Brenda Bletin) in a small Welsh town trying to get away from her ailing husband. So, she and the funeral home manager (Alfred Molina) came up with a plan ... but there will probably be some glitches along the way. <br /> <br /> I would say that the character of Christopher Walken is in the film (how could he not be?). But in general, the whole idea is just very neat, abundant in some “ooooooooooooooooooooo,” especially the haunted scene. This is a film that I would like to get into, just to experience it. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, Naomi Watts and Miriam Margoyls are also starring.
