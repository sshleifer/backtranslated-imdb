A touching love story, reminiscent of "In the mood for love." Based on Chinese poetry and how Eastern people use it to transfer their feelings to each other, the story focuses on the school teacher who wants to become an exemplary teacher, as well as a good husband and father. A senior student is very attracted to him. When the story unfolds, we see the emotions beneath the surface in his 20-year marriage and the way he fights against the moral dilemmas that stand before him. Beautiful and touching story.
