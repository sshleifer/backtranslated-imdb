I watched this film "Miniseries" on TV in 1989, and it was a terrific movie. I would like to track his copy to watch it again and again. It's been 15 years since I watched it, and it's still remembered. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning he attracts you. Characters and storyline continue to hold you. The ending was great. The feeling and rage that the son showed, having learned the truth about his father, are unforgettable. The expectation of how it will turn around and how he will confront his father is very tense. <br /> <br /> If you can get a copy of this film, you will love it. <br /> <br /> Then email me and let me know where I can get a copy.
