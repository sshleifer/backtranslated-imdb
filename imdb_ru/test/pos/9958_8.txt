The Venetian Merchant was one of the most popular plays of Shakespeare during his lifetime, but he fell into difficult times in the 20th century because of its undeniably anti-Semitic content. The play was also called schizoid in its transformation from comedic to tragic scenes, which is why some say that two plays try to coexist as one. Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes, who played William Shakespeare in the movie “Shakespeare in Love”) is in love with Portia (Lynn Collins, great), but he needs to borrow a considerable amount of money to achieve it. He goes to his once-amateur gay man Antonio (Jeremy Irons), who has no money for his personality, but takes a loan from Jewish moneylender Shaylock (Al Pacino). Shylock is surprised and offended by the fact that Antonio, who insults him for his religion, now comes to him for money, but he proposes this, provided that the penalty for default on loan obligations will be a pound of flesh to Antonio. Which, of course, is happening. Bassanio and Portia offer Shylock significantly more than the initial loan instead of a pound of flesh, but Shylock, distraught after his daughter leaves him and marries a Christian, refuses to take it. Portia, in a scene where viewers are never quite sure where to place their sympathies, deprives Shylock of what the law should belong to him, and then deprives him of his wealth and religion. Originally, Shylock was introduced as a cartoon villain, but contemporary actors and directors turned him into a tragic figure opposing the injustice of Venice of the 16th century. Al Pacino does an excellent job with the role of Shylock, and Jeremy Irons is as good as Antonio, but I think that the work of Lynn Collins in the role of Portia is the best part of the play. Portia is one of the few notable female roles in the canon of Shakespeare, and Collins is great in that role. However, Joseph Fiennes is more than boring; I never really enjoyed his often overworked acting style. I give the "Venetian merchant" 8/10.
