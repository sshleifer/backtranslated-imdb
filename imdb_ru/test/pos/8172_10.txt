Having raised Mormons and faced fanaticism of the church towards blacks (they were not allowed to hold the church priesthood when I was a member), I was not aware of the organizationâ€™s policy of weaning gays and women from fellowship until I left the church in 1966 year (I was 20 years old). I was stunned when I learned that gay friends were excommunicated even after serving in missions. LAST DAYS expose gay men to harassing Mormons. The film is long overdue. He perfectly shows how the two leading males agree with each other, and at the same time he manages to grow and develop as individuals. LATTER DAYS has a great heart, great original music and extra notes from Jacqueline Bisset. The film brilliantly tells the story of a man who leaves outside organized religion and restores his soul.
