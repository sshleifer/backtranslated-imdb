It was a great movie that lasted only 67 minutes. In this film, there was an aspect of the film noir, and I am glad that Nolan decided to film it in black and white. The plot is simple, but interesting, which does not let you get bored. Even the dialogue was good along with the game. It reminded me of what was going to happen in Memento, not in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him, for example, saying “everyone has a box” in which he put his personal belongings. In addition, on the writer's door was the logo of Batman, which seemed ironic, because Christopher Nolan later shot Batman Begins and the Dark Knight, two other great films. In the end, there is a great turnaround that I don’t intend to spoil those who haven’t seen him, although I thought what would happen when Cobb gave the young man a D Lloyds credit card. I also liked that the author had a copy of the "Republic" of Plato, one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely a movie that you need to watch more than once to get its full presentation, plus it lasts only an hour. There is a circular aspect to this, ending where it started, which I think is quite brilliant.
