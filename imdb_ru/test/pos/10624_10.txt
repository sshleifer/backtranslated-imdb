If it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin that contains a whole in the diverse expressions of its opposites, then the cinematic portrait of Erica Kohut has its own reality. Professor Kohut treats his student pianists with a kind of fascist sadism, at the same time wanting the same for himself. Her outward expression projects her desire. That is why it can hurt without guilt or remorse. <br /> <br /> Together with her comes a talented, charming, beautiful young Walter Clemmer (Benoit Magimel), who is attracted by her passion and intensity. He wants to be her student to be with her. She rejects him out of control, but because of his talent, the Vienna Conservatory votes for him. He falls in love with her. She pushes him again, but he will not accept the answer "no" and thus begins his own way to depravity and loss of self-esteem. <br /> <br /> At this point, the viewer may ask the question: who controls? Sadist or masochist? In fact, who is a sadist, and who is a masochist? It is hard to say. Is this the person who has just been mistreated both psychologically and physically, who actually lies on the floor of the wounded in grotesque triumph and satisfaction, or is this the person who jumped out of the door, sated, giving the order that no one know what happened. <br /> <br /> But Erica is not just a sadomasochist. She is an extreme sexual freak. She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability. In fact, this is not even true. She says she doesn’t care what others think. She doesn't care if they enter and find her bleeding on the floor, because she is in love. Love, she calls it. For her, sex and love are one and the same. <br /> <br /> At some point, Walter tells her that love is not everything. How ridiculous such an extra thing for her. How groundless comments. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully cut out and masterfully filmed by director Michael Haneke, who tells the story through artful cinematography and carefully designed scenery in which the essence of the action is not only clear, but also illustrated (as in the bathroom when Walter rises high above the booths to find Eric inside). It also uses accurate positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well-calculated segments from one corner to another. This is especially important in a scene in which Erika, like a blood-drained corpse, caught in bright white and black light, lies beneath her lover, tough as a stone. Here, for the most part, we see only her face and the sharp outlines of her neck with her pulsating artery. We no longer need to see. <br /> <br /> Eric Kohut is perfect for Isabel Huppert, who is not afraid of extremes; indeed it stands out in them. I have seen her in many films, and what she does better than anyone becomes the soul and body of the character. Like the woman she plays in this film, she is not afraid of what others think, and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. Performance and challenge are important to her. No part is too demanding. No character is perverted. It’s as if Huppert wants to experience all of humanity and wants us to watch her like her. She is always charming and almost flawless. She is not just the leading light of French cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time, who has gathered amazingly diverse work. <br /> <br /> I think this is very instructive and gives us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance at The Lacemaker (La Dentellière) since 1977, when she was 22 years old. There she was apple-sweet in her red hair and freckles, as well as in her pretty face and her cute little figure playing the Parisian hairdressing salon Pomme. Her character was shy of sex and modesty - an ordinary French woman who once hoped to become a cosmetologist. Here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and completely depraved. <br /> <br /> Hoppert is lucky that she is an actress in France, where there are such roles for women older than the age of starlets. (Hollywood would never have made such a film.) In American cinema, only a few of the best and most hardworking actresses can hope to make a career after thirty years. Huppert significantly increases her openness due to her abilities and range, as well as because she is ready to play unsympathetic roles, here in the “Ceremony” (1995), in which she plays a nasty, evil killer. <br /> <br /> See this for Isabel Huppert. You will not forget her, nor the character, whom she will realize.
