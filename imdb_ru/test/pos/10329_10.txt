Bug Juice has changed my life. I know it sounds weird, weird, weird. But it is so. I'm from England, Bug Juice never went on the air, but five years ago I went on vacation with my family and saw him on Disney Channel. One day, seeing this series, I got hooked and wanted to go. It took my parents a lot of strength to get me and my brother to Waziyat. I have been going since 12 years old, and this was my fourth year this summer. If you are a teenager reading this, come to this camp, it changes your life. You make lifelong friends in Wazi. No matter who you are or someone at home does not love you, everyone loves you in the camp. You have so much fun. If you want to watch, go to www.wazi.com and see for yourself. It's so fun, I love it there, this is my home away from home
