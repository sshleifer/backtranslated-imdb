I just adore this show. It is so funny and awesome. Cusco is such a funny and interesting character, I love him. This is what makes this show what it is, although Kronk and Ism are also so funny and charming. The show is wonderful for me, because it always makes me laugh, despite the fact that it is only once. It's just funny, and all the characters are so cute and cool, which makes the show worthy of time to watch, unlike some Shit on Disney Channel. Try next time to show it, if you watched the movie, and even if you have not seen it, you will still find it very pleasant, so continue.
