When I first watched the film, I said to myself: “So that the film can be made this way.” Wong Kar Wai's magnificent poetic love story captured me everywhere and even after the film. I have to admit that this is one of the best love movies, perhaps the best I've ever watched. The content and the form perfectly match. Watching the secret love, we see characters in limited frames that limit their movements and feelings. Beautiful camera angles and lighting make sensations and blues even tangible. I want to congratulate Christopher Doyle and Ping Bing Lee for their fantastic cinematography that creates a mood for love. The music also defines the sadness of love, which plays in beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in a desperate mood. And, of course, the performances of actors who make love so real. In the end, all the elements of the film are perfectly matched under the guidance of WKW and give the audience a feeling of love.
