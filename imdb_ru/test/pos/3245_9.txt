Sandy Australian film with all the elements of success. Two Hands is the ability of Australian cinematographers and actors to create high-quality, popular material. The film has a new perspective and uniquely includes drama, suspense and comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this film very enjoyable on many different levels - but I can also appreciate that it cannot be a cup of tea for everyone. ” The film has a distinct Australian humor, as it depicts the sinister underworld of Sydney and talks about the life of a young man (Ledger) and a young woman (Byrne), discovered at a crime scene. <br /> <br /> Two Hands is dedicated to the topic of good and evil, both on an interpersonal and personal level, and is considering the implications for “our” actions. <br /> <br /> Filming is fascinating, and the dialogue - with humor. With Brian Brown, who plays Pando and Heath Ledger as Jimmy, battling him on the screen in the most bizarre situations - this Australian film is definitely not without acting talent. <br /> <br /> This subtle action / comedy has become a cult favorite of its kind, and one of mine too.
