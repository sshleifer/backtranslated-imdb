I love Sarah Waters' Fingersmith and was worried about the television adaptation, as I was disappointed with the BBC version of "Tipping the Velvet" (which Keely Howes could not sing, although she was beautiful, but Rachel Stirling could not sing). be able to act). Fingersmith is a very complicated affair with breathtaking twists and turns, and I wondered if it could be done in three hours. <br /> <br /> I don't need to worry. The device was excellent, very little cut and went with incredible speed (although I was wondering if you had not read the book, did you miss something?). It was like the drama of the classic BBC costume, and I constantly had to remind myself that this is a modern book. <br /> <br /> The game was stellar. Sally Hawkins plays out her heart as Sue Trinder, and Elaine Cassidy, the slow burner, which by the end of the story was as hot as Maude Lilly. Love, passion, the implementation of acts of betrayal, which both were supposed to commit, were written on their faces. It was a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> I hope Rachel Sterling watched: this is how you play the character of Sarah Waters!
