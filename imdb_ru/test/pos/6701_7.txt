Well, let's first deal with this: like cinema, Lifeforce is rubbish. Like fun entertainment for SF lovers, it has a lot of value. If you like watching these old black and white SF B-films - giant mutated spiders / ants or alien monsters roaming the desert - you really enjoy Lifeforce. <br /> <br /> Bad things: the story makes little sense, and the game is pretty poor. Good things: the special effects are halfway decent; he has a cordially different British story (it unfolds in London), which is perceived differently by most SF films; and it has the well-to-do Matilda May (funnyly pronounced as "Cosmic Girl"), wandering around absolute naked. <br /> <br /> In short: it's fun. <br /> <br /> I have seen him half a dozen times, and every time he appears on TV, I spend time watching it - admittedly, this is partly due to naked Mrs. May - but this is also done with a little humble stupid sf.
