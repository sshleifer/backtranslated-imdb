Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictional story about a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agasha is a hard-working, hard-working policeman who heads a simple criminal group that makes a name for itself by killing dangerous criminals during organized police meetings, rather than locking them in prison. His loyal officers obey him without question, but discord arises when one of his officers, Imtiaz, gets upset because of the high status of the Sadhu and secretly competes with him for the killings and the status of the criminal. The new recruit is also promoted to brotherhood, and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead in his first work. Further changes are taking place in the form of a new police commissioner, who does not approve of Sadhuâ€™s tactics, and everyone is embroiled in domestic politics. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see such a well-directed fighter from India. The film is excellent, the story is well told, and the tension unfolds when the drama unfolds. The actions, pace and political ploy convince the viewer that they are a fly on the wall, testifying to blood, sweat and tears from a close and personal look, and that events are based on a reality that, no doubt, why we are told that this is not the beginning film, although it is likely that the director Shimit Amin took the liberty with the actual data. However, Ab So Chkhappan is an extremely polished part of filmmaking.
