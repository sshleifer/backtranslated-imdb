So what is the "Return of Batman"? <br /> <br /> He was sold as a thriller, and many people who saw him seem to think they were watching a thriller - but in fact, there isn’t much action, and Tim Burton seems to be hardly interested them. <br /> <br /> People often compare it to the “rougher” superhero comics of the late eighties, but to be honest, if you read “The Dark Knight Returns”, this seems a little absurd; Burton's excessive imagination has more in common with the TV series "the sixties" ("Penguin" rolls in a giant plastic duck, for the sake of all saint). <br /> <br /> The style of Burton is often called gothic, and it is a little closer to what we see on the screen; The penguin - deformed, wicked, with a tangled history and underground lair - represents a gothic threat, wearing Dickens' more respectable clothing - Udolfo, disguised as Uriah Heep. <br /> <br /> But what about a catwoman? She can be resurrected from the dead, but this PVC jumpsuit is definitely twentieth century, and the world of her alter ego Selina Kyle - all meeting rooms and apartments - reminiscent of the romantic comedy of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> And then she clicks. A clever but oppressed secretary surrounded by a lonely millionaire? Subsequent complications caused by deception and disguise? “The Return of Batman” is definitely a romantic comedy in the old Hollywood style, filtered through the feelings of the S & M Burton dungeon. He has more in common with the “Goodsaker Proxy” (including expressionist kits) than with other superhero films. <br /> <br /> Like many romantic comedies, she centers around the makeup of the heroine; not from an ugly duckling to a swan, but from a rug to dominatrix. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of his (often remarkable) career performances; she is symbolically sexy as Catwoman (poor Halle Berry never prayed), playful and vindictive, catchy because she knows how to act with her whole body. Looking back, though, these are her scenes as Selina, which are impressive; almost every one of them is a small comic gem, especially a glimpse of her lonely family life. This delicately balanced tragicomic performance, and it is in these scenes that the film really comes to life. Nothing touches me like Selina and Bruce Wayne, dancing under the mistletoe under Susie and Banshee, a weapon held between them, simultaneously endowed with power and captured by their alter ego, doomed to conflict. Forget about the easy sentimentality of the Big Fish or the unique emotions of Edward the Scissors - this is the most soulful scene in all Burton films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, madness, self-hatred and a little bit of wit, all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by actors - especially Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> In another place, Danny de Vito almost fits her, finding the wounded dignity buried under these truly repulsive long johns. The villain from the comics, depicting the top of the bark, is nothing more than a fake one; Burton's Penguin is a wild creature subjected to his own make-up in the style of Eliza Doolittle (literally “the ugly duckling”). This is the most radical and funny invention of Burton. Max Shrek Christopher Walken completes the perfect triptych of villains, gliding between casual charm and empty-eyed psychosis with unnerving ease (and it's just me, or does his company logo resemble Mickey Mouse? Maybe we should ask former animator Disney Burton). <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan's “Batman Begins,” a real action movie, was praised as the first film about Batman; I admire Nolan's film, but it would be a pity if he was allowed to outshine this particular gem.
