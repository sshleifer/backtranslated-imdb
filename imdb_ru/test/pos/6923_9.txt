This film is a joy to watch and should look good on DVD and video. I believe that you really need to be Irish to appreciate some subtleties, such as accent, colloquial character and some characters' attire, but let me assure you that when Dylan Moran imitates Barrel, imitation is pretty familiar to most people from Dublin, because in our beautiful city we have a lot of characters who look, act and talk like that! A simple simple comedy and the genius of Michael Keynes, playing alone, cost money, but beyond that the plot is great, the script is fantastic, and the dialogue is fast and agile. The perfect lightweight entertainment movie without Jim Carrey's humor.
