The slightly reprinted episode of the previous week paid off unequivocally with the episode that conquered the height. There was a certain deus ex machina taste in climbing, but it was a good start for all this. As is now customary with this Doctor, the moral, ethical, and emotional considerations of his actions were in the center of attention. They were always there in the classic series, but they were a minor issue to hide when the Doctor was in the heat of battle. This regeneration even excuses the cyberman during the battle! This episode finally shows that Mickey embraces the heroic side that was hinted at in previous episodes. His journey from zero to hero is complete, and it was completely convincing. In this episode there was everything, with fears, humor and scenes that brought a lump to the throat. After much deliberation, I can finally say that the new series is better than the classic in all respects. Based on the harsh Whovian, you can get no better recommendation than this.
