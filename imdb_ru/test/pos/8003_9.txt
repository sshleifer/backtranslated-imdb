Tim Burton, the man behind the original movie "Batman" and "Beetlejuice", brings to the world the sequel to "Batman", which is superior to the original in many ways than one. First, Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito are a great combination of Batman's enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to rattle some heads in history, and the penguin works just like the Joker worked in the original. The sets are awesome and flawless. There are so many dark alleys in Gotham City that you will never know what is happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives him ill fame is a script that sometimes seems lost, and then it does not recover for some time. The direction of Tim Burton brings superhero movies to the new kingdom. Surpasses all superman movies and other Batman movies by mile. Although from the point of view of implementation, the new Batman begins to bite where it is lacking, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.
