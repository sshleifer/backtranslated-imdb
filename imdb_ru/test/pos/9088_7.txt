Countless TV shows and memorable performances of four of today's megastars (as well as Hope Davis’s debut on the screen) are still wary of Flatliners. The story of non-academic studies of five undergraduates of medicine, pursuing the insane idea of ​​discovering the secret of death, finding out what happens after death, and then returning to life. Nevertheless, the storyline was not designed as exciting as the idea of ​​the plot itself. <br /> <br /> There are popular stereotypes about developing a common script for a teenager slasher on Flatliners. There is Nelson, who creates the idea of ​​deciphering death, pretty, but reticent Rachel, David tearing the Gordian knot, fortunately so that he will not be dismissed from school, lady Joe and finally, the smart guy Randy kill my classmates, no matter how insane they are. ") They joined hands in an experiment in which Nelson's heart would be stopped and refilled. Then they decide to continue this experiment in strict secrecy at night on campus. Soon after the experience Nelson They start the race for the wildest and longest death experience, risking their lives one by one. However, they soon realize that their daily lives are influenced by the experiences they had. A visit to the afterlife returns their wrongdoings from memories of childhood. Depolarizing their deep unconscious vigilance, they begin to experience somatic delusions and visual hallucinations. <br /> <br /> When a moment comes to explain the subconscious, director Joel Schumacher skips that azhdogo humanity is subconscious personality, which they do not know, this inner personality keeps a person from becoming a loss of identity. If you lose or depolarize this subconscious personality, you will surely lose your individuality instead of refreshing childhood memories. I wanted to add this as a film mistake, which critics already mentioned in the early 1990s. Obviously, here in this film Schumacher made the actors touch this least of all. Then why do they hesitate to continue the experiment after studying their lesson, as if death were intended by God? David was introduced as an Atheist, now he, as it turned out, believed in God, recalling memories from his childhood. After the 180-degree change in David, it became clear that Schumacher’s film was so conservative and animated; ultimately, therefore, it is never classified as a science fiction work. Alas! It had good potential. He even tried to distinguish unconscious maturation from the experience of death, starting to believe that death is so natural that it is only part of human life. <br /> <br /> More than in the film, it was also remembered to remember that with the film. Jan de Bon as a cinematographer who worked almost every time with Schumacher, creates a dreamy atmosphere, as if it were a gothic horror film. The blue color schemes on the walls, reflecting the faces of the actors, provide first-class light that is perfect for the film. Close-up shots of the gargoyle statues in campus buildings, catholic frescoes in the walls, cameras for stopping traffic and speeding dynamic cameras all belonged to Bont's skills. <br /> <br /> Flatliners have become a cult film over time, thanks to their sociological portrait of an X-generation teenager, especially because of its futuristic editing style, with sequences of storyboard connections, such as the aesthetic component of a video clip. These were times when video clips quickly developed and quickly alternated. This style was very rare in those years after his pioneer Tony Scott "Hunger (1983)".
