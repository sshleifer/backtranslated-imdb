I love foreign films, and this is one of the best. I tend not to see it as a comedy, as it is listed, and I find it a comment on how we see others around us. Firmin, leading in the film, is not considered mandatory, because it works in a large firm, and people always say and do something around her, that otherwise they would not have told others. leaves her with a bunch of information that can make or break a mere mortal. :) This actress is as beautiful as this character, and this is a sharp fairy tale. This film has a main story and almost a lot of stories. I just hope that if someone decides to make a US-English version of this film, it’s not “Three Men and a Baby” that will definitely do a disservice to this film.
