While video technology may be outdated, this classic piece of music, now on DVD, is the best version of Sondheimâ€™s most important and honed work on Broadway. If you have never seen SWEENEY TODD, you should buy this DVD. I saw this performance in November 1980 at the Kennedy Center in Washington - and fell in love with the previously written Murder It Wrote by Angela Lansbury. Subsequently, I tried to find all her works, including: MOVIES: Harvey's Girls, Portrait of Dorian Gray, Manchurian Candidate; Compact discs: "Mom", "Dear World" and "Gypsy"; and much more. The rest of the cast is also flawless. All in all, this wonderful DVD gives us the final version of Sondheim's opera!
