Since I'm a fan of Natalie Portman, I had to watch a movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. It sounds very sincere. Throughout the film, it seemed that Natalie was a mother, and Susan was a mother. Character Susan continued to make bad decisions and because of this continued to be offended. <br /> <br /> I heard that there was going to be a love scene with Natalie and some guy (he was in External Providence), but Natalie only accepted the script if this scene was deleted. And I think this is great. I think that a love scene would spoil the tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Natalie should be able to choose good films because I havenâ€™t seen her in a bad movie yet. Thus, any film with Natalie Portman will undoubtedly be noticed by me. <br /> <br /> Good movie. 7/10
