Our America is multicultural, with so many subcultures. This film simply tells the story of a snapshot in time in one of these subcultures. This is basically an objective view of a group of forgotten people living their lives, not paying attention to the rest of the world. In general, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thoughts and showed lives that could not be seen otherwise, right in our backyard. Must be seen by everyone. Having lived in the USA all my life, I had no idea that there are citizens here who do not know that they are citizens. This film helps illustrate the diversity of our country, showing this small part of the southern state. The obvious conclusion is: if this is really real, then what else do we know nothing about?
