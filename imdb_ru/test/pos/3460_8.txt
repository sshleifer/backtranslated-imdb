This is definitely a film that will make you think about the daily struggle that a person can survive every day. The magnificent play of the two main roles illustrates this again, and you will not regret seeing this film in any way. <br /> <br /> This is a heartbreaking story about two new friends exploring the ups and downs of everyday life seen from the seat of a wheelchair. Their friendship is verified, as well as their spirit, when they receive their apartment outside the nursing home. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to anyone who loves photographs of friends or just wants to see a wonderful and soulful film that avoids all cliches and traps and never gets wet.
