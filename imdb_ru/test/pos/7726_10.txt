Even to the public who does not love opera, the name BARZET immediately recognizes the name CARMEN as an opera about a gypsy whose capricious love destroys men. But no matter how the opera is considered today as the main one in each repertoire of the opera house, the real story of a wild gypsy created by Prosper Merimee in 1845 has never been told the same way as in this cinematic version by the richly talented Spanish director Vicente Aranda Mad Love "," Amantes "," If they say that I fell ", etc.). The inclusion of the author of the novel as the main character, looking for the story of Carmen from one of her lovers - Jose - gives the right advantage for the story of this famous gypsy woman. <br /> <br /> Carmen (amazingly beautiful and talented Paz Vega) works at a cigar factory in Seville, adjacent to the military station, where the real Jose is located (Leonardo Sbarglia). Carmen Burna and in a dispute provoked by one of the factory workers, drawing attention to the fact that Carmen is a Gypsy, Carmen kills a colleague and is arrested. José is physically attracted to the voluptuous Carmen, and when Carmen flirts with him, he agrees to let her escape - his retribution is the promise of a night of passion with Carmen. Carmen keeps his contract, giving Jose his first sexual encounter, and Jose is doomed. The lack of military discipline leads to the fact that he loses his rank and ends up in prison for some time, but after his release José faces Carmen again, kills one officer and runs in fear into the hills to live with Carmen smugglers and Gypsies. people. There are many incidents to experience a passionate connection between lovers, but when Carmen’s real husband is released from prison, destructive behavior takes possession, a behavior that involves Carmen’s passion and romance with a bullfighter, and Carmen’s and José’s passion ends with a tragic end. <br /> <br /> One of the factors that makes the story (so adapted to the screen by director Aranda and Joaquim Jorda move so well is the role played by Prosper Merimee (Jay Benedict): his interrogation by Jose completes the story that Bizet opera only outlines. Acting is excellent, Paco Femenia’s cinematography and José Nieto’s superb music make a huge contribution to the success of this very beautiful film, for those who love the opera Carmen, and for those who want Teli, who admire historical works. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
