I really hate musicals, because musical numbers start suddenly and usually spoil the scene, but this one is completely different - it's just great. The plot may not be a problem for the audience, but the simplicity of people's life stories makes this film great. <br /> <br /> I have seen it at least dozens of times, and yet I'm not tired of the plot, characters or music (I just like the soundtrack - this is the only soundtrack I really wanted to have, and, most likely, he will be the only one I owe). <br /> <br /> For me, this is definitely a kind of film, great characters made up of entertaining songs, and a lot of things that you can think about after the movie ends.
