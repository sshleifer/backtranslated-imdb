In this film, I noticed two things. (This is not a spoiler, just a mistake in telling stories.) When Cole leads Bill to his first B & E, he finds a “box”. As soon as Cole finds it, he says: “The box. Everybody has a box. ” A minute later, before throwing the contents on the floor, he says: “In fact, we were very lucky. You don't see them often. ” <br /> <br /> Observation No. 2 (Spoiler alert!) <br /> I had to look at it three times, I could not understand a couple of things. Then I looked at the chronological version and saw that during the time changes, they flashed memories from the last to the previous. So in some moments we actually looked three different times in 1 minute of time on the wall. <br /> <br /> It was good, because I don’t know how many more times I could watch it before returning it to Netflix. <br /> <br /> The color is intrusive to me.
