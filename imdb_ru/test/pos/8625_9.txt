About 12 minutes after the song, in the scene where Dariel Hanna and JFK Jr are embracing for the first time, a really beautiful song sounds ... what song is this ?! And who is it sung? This is a song that sounds very romantic, this is a singer, playing the piano, etc. I tried everything in the world to find music on Google and in iTunes, etc. But it just doesnâ€™t fit, not even on Lyrics sites . So, if you hear this, I would really like to know about it enough so that I can try to buy a CD with this song or find it in iTunes. I don't know if my email will swell, I'm new to this ... but I will look back.
