Both the book and the film are excellent in their own right. They are slightly different, but this reinforces, rather than detracts from, excellent scenarios and actions. The historic atmosphere, a young girl looking for love, an amazing background of a music hall and a trip to the lesbian world of London in the early twentieth century make this film exceptional. Andrew Davis, as a screenwriter, transcends himself when he writes this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. Rachel Sterling and Keely Howes are great actresses and they do everything in their power. The rest of the actors are very good. If there were more than 10 out of 10, I would give!
