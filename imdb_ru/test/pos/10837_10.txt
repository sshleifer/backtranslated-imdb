I have to say that this is a sign that this film is attractive for all ages, if someone should rightly protect themselves from something remotely homosexual, absolutely loves this thing. <br /> <br /> I thought that every last moment of this movie is amazing, and the cast was great, but I have to say, Anna Chancellor ... where you have been all my life. <br /> <br /> I used to see Anna in several other things, I was just amazed at how gorgeous she was. <br /> <br /> Diana Letherby is perhaps not the most attractive of heroes, but of course she could take me home if she liked ...
