I read countless reviews telling about the superiority of the mini-series. Of course, I cannot agree with such a general statement. If you analyze all aspects of video / film production, then there are many areas in which a film may be significantly superior to others. <br /> <br /> Of course, many comments are valid for certain mini areas. -series. In particular, in relation to a larger number of flows (customs officers) and more developed flows (such as a Pakistani farmer and family). However, I found that the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones is much more convincing than that of desperate women, from poverty to wealth, which "will not return." This is a much more pleasant temper than these cold women, who seem to have no particular reason for her turning quickly to evil. (And yes, I understand ... her children. She was in despair; I just did not see such despair in her.) <br /> <br /> Next, I appreciated some of the more detailed plots. in the mini-series, the character Benicio del Toro was very convincing. Anchor for the movie. This thread was changed (as an alternative to the Pakistani family) only in good ways. Fantastic adaptation. (Of course, I am skeptical that such a pure person can exist in such a system, but I donâ€™t know enough about the politics of the nation to argue). <br /> <br /> After watching the first episode of the mini-series, I actually revised the film. What for? I kept reading about the fantastic game. I found the performances in the first episode of the mini-series ridiculous. Of course, this improved as the mini-series developed. Now, having just finished both versions in a few days, I cannot agree that the performances in the mini-series reached the same level as, say, Benicio del Toro, who was brilliant in the film, although Orman, Paterson, Shah, Lindsay Duncan was very good. I also feel that the police in the film far surpassed the mini-series. I was not impressed by the Germans everywhere. <br /> <br /> Finally, the dialogue presented in the film is much more nuanced. Especially in scenes that are almost verbatim. "Carefully, you start to sound like your husband." unlike Hahahaha! You talk like Carl. Again, I found some actions in the mini-series very inconclusive. It was a prime example. <br /> <br /> Other excellent aspects of the film, in my opinion: evaluation, cinematography, editing. <br /> <br /> Should I complain that the film was not longer? I think it was a fantastic adaptation, given the format. The changes were by themselves. I mean, you would sit in a theater for 5/7/10 hours. Of course not. <br /> <br /> Miniseries: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Film: 9 out of 10
