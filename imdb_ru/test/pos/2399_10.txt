Fred Carpenter showed on the screen Eddie Monroe in Boston College, and, judging by the enthusiastic reaction, he has something to rejoice. Indy, well-trained, well-made, impresses with its large budget. This film has it all: a tough script that captures you and does not let go until the most unexpected end. This viewer did not expect this! Excellent performance around. Craig Morris and Jessica Tsunis were particularly well played in the lead roles, showing strong results. And thanks to Frank Bongiorno and Alex Corrado for creating two detectives, as attractive and interesting to watch as any other film. I really liked this movie. This confirmed my belief that some of the best works in the cinema would be owned independently, and Fred Carpenter looks like one of the best.
