I found this show by chance and was surprised to find that none of my friends had ever heard of him. It was one of the best shows I've seen in months, if not years, and I can't wait for new episodes to be released. The sleep cell depicts the psychological struggle of an undercover agent inside a terrorist cell who must make tough decisions all the time in order to maintain cover while remaining true to his true cause. This is a very well done show. It keeps you intrigued from the first episode to the end and, although progressing slowly, fast enough to make you feel on the verge. Quite realistic and humane, it covers important topics, and each episode presents an interesting question for reflection. This show is not 24 or any of the police shows on TV, nor is it trying to be anything. It is authentic and unique. This is a show about a man, his difficult choices and his life in a fight where a simple mistake can cost him everything. <br /> <br /> I gave this show 10 points for a great plot, good progress, excellent cinematography, great music and realistic characters, each of which can tell its own story.
