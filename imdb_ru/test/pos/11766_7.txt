Not an ordinary movie, but a good one. Billy Bob is very funny in this film, as he says what he says, etc. I was a little surprised when I saw him, because I just thought it was a normal comedy, but it was something more. He had a very good story, great characters and a good balance. <br /> <br /> Favorite part: probably when Billy Bob runs in his mantle shooting rippers
