My 5-year-old daughter loves the Barbie movie series. I had mixed feelings about this — I didn’t want her to buy the whole image of a Barbie doll, and admitted that films were a marketing move to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for Mattel. This morning, although she asked me to watch this film with her, and - it was a lazy Saturday morning, and I had nothing to do - I agreed. I don’t know whether films were made to help promote dolls that seem to lose their appeal a little because of what I’ve heard, or if dolls exist to advertise films (or, rather, a little of the other), but in any case, I must admit that, to my surprise, it was not so bad. <br /> <br /> This is a funny and creative story, full of magical places, people and memorable characters (both good and evil.) In fact, Annika (“played” by Barbie) must find a way to build a “stick of light” in order to to reverse the evil spell of the wizard Venlock, who, among other things, turned his sister into a flying horse and her parents into a stone. The animation here was pretty good - not Disney-Caliber (if you think of Disney as the standard you can strive for), but overall it's pretty good, and although the film is clearly intended for young girls, not middle-aged men, I still found there were enough turns to make me wonder how it all will turn out. It is true that there were some holes in history, or at least some logical inconsistencies, but again you need to remember the target audience, which really would not think about such things. This is a good family movie. 7/10
