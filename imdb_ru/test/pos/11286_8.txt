Born, of course, experience, and an unusual experience in this. The use of color is fascinating and sometimes frustrating. A LOT of what is happening on the screen is incredibly difficult to make out. Your gaze is either hidden by a sudden bizarre change in color and tone, travel symbols and occasional cuts in the sky. The sound is very intrusive and long-awaited addition. It really helps the nihilistic and hopeless tone that stifles this film. <br /> <br /> As for Begotten, the theory of “rape of the environment and rebirth” seems rather accurate to me. But I wouldn’t spend a lot of time concentrating on the meaning, it almost doesn’t matter. It is clear that the director did not want to explain anything. It simply presents it as it is, and if you want to find a meaning that depends on you. <br /> <br /> Watching Begotten is definitely not a walk in the park, but I was fascinated by the discovery. It really looks like watching the worst nightmare of man. What we see is sometimes distressing and very unpleasant, but surrealistic fairy beauty is present there. If you're a fan of an art-house / experiment and haven't seen Begotten yet, make it a priority. I doubt you will ever forget this. I am sure I know that I will not.
