I would say this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge sees that no one will notice, therefore, Office Space. He makes a statement about the fall of society and that the survival of the fittest is just an impossible dream for 500 years. It is pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies that usually rule during the day. Yes, this is a lot of funny humor, and he has to tell the story and understand its meaning. But genuine frustration on Private Joe Bowersâ€™s face is priceless, and in some cases we can all relate to him at some point in our lives. <br /> <br /> If you do not like humor, look at it from a different point of view and look again. I needed to watch it twice to truly appreciate this film for what it is. And after I watched it twice, I'm going to read the book now.
