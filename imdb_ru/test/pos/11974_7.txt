I would consider myself a fan of Dina Kunz; After reading a few of his novels, and I liked them all, but unfortunately, I still did not bother to read "The Observers", so I had no choice but to evaluate this film for merit, and not to compare it with a book I don't have to read. I entered into this expectation of something terrible, and while I definitely did not get a brilliant horror film; I tend to believe that these are fans of the book who appreciate it, because as a film in itself, the Watchers are an interesting and somewhat original small horror film. The plot clearly gets some influence from the Predator and begins with an explosion in a research lab. It was not long before the ranch was killed by some strange beast, and the dead daughter's boyfriend picked up an ultra-smart runaway dog. A secret government agency is soon on the case, as the killings continue. The boy is still fascinated by the dog's mind, but this is somehow related to the killings, and the agency is also soon on his tail. <br /> <br /> The script for this film was originally written by Paul Haggis, who later rejected it. I do not know why ?? The inscription here is not so absurd as its 2004 hit Crash! In any case, the main reason why this film works is undoubtedly the dog, which, besides being pretty cute, is also the best actor in the film. Corey Chaim, the echo of the “Lost Boys” success is a person who behaves, and in fact he has a pretty good chemistry with a dog, although it's a little ridiculous to see him talk to him most of the movie. The plot is quite tangled, and as such the film is more than dirty; but the absurdity of all this pulls him into more awkward moments. Michael Ironside also appears in the film and plays the role of a “bad cop” government agent well. The monster, of course, is one of the most interesting things in the film, and how it kills people is always fun and fun; although, unfortunately, we cannot see much of it, and when we finally do it, it is rather disappointing - obviously, the filmmakers have seen the Bigfoot and Henderson! Nevertheless, this is a film that can be easily watched, despite numerous problems, and I would recommend any inexperienced spectator of the horrors of the eighties.
