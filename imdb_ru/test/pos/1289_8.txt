Christopher Nolan's first directorial work, a year before he made Memento, is almost as brilliant as this classic. He uses the time difference in the same way to tell his story, and she is very smart. <br /> <br /> Bill is a young writer who starts stalking complete strangers just to see where they live and what they are all about. One day he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and admits that he is up to it. <br /> <br /> Cobb is a robber, and he takes Bill to several jobs to teach him the ropes. Both men are a kind of voyeur, and the connection between them begins to grow. <br /> <br /> But Cobb has a hidden motive for the development of this relationship, and all this is very cleverly connected in the end. No, I will not spoil it, but this is a very cool film, and I start to think that Christopher Nolan is a genius. <br /> <br /> If you like movies with an unexpected ending, this film is a must see.
