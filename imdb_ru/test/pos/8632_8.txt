The talents of Abbott and Costello shine in the happy children's version of Jack and the Beanstalk. Using the tones and colors of sepia, music and choreography, song and dance, the transition of players from one role to another, as well as various other aspects of this very beautiful film make it obvious that the methods and styles used for The Wizard of Oz are played here. works well for our fearless duet. There are some other things that make this movie enjoyable for me ... Buddy Baer, ​​Max Baer, ​​Jr., from Uncle Beverly Hillbillis, looks like a policeman and a giant. Pat Costello, brother Lou, who hosted writing spelling Enaria. These things help make this movie fun. It, however, has its opposite side. I think the choreography is poorly done. But the cute melodies and accompanying vocals help to divert attention from rather careless dance numbers. Some players, to be exact, in love the couple (the prince and the princess) are not very good at their trade. But these things are a small price to pay for an extremely pleasant walk on the yellow brick ... uh, I mean ... climb a beanstalk.
