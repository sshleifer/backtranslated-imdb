It's so much like movies like PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS, that it's impossible to think that Tarantino films were not a source of inspiration this Thursday. However, for low-cost B series films, this is not bad. The gangster storyline is fascinating and fun, and it also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm that we can find in PULP FICTION. There were not many resources, but the film was well prepared. Acting is also good. I liked the scene when the girl was sitting on the couch and teasing the doctor ... It was hot and funny at the same time! The soundtrack is also nice. I didn't hear too many songs, but I liked the ones I heard. I scored 7/10.
