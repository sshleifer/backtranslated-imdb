The process of truth and reconciliation in South Africa is a vital and probably unique human experiment. This film perfectly shows the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe that everyone should watch this film, as I think very few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being done in the process of “Truth and Reconciliation”. Almost every country has its own part of history, which is still a source of constant hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand how to deal with the past. What is happening in South Africa should guide us all. I found it trustworthy, exciting and sometimes frustrating. There were no outstanding acting performances, but this added to the power of the narration. Once again, the BBC contributed to taking a complex topic and releasing a top-class film.
