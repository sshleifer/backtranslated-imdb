Despite the previous reviewer's note, this is an interesting and interesting documentary with a lot of clips from classic science fiction films from the 1950s that influenced Spielberg, Lucas and others in their later efforts. I agree that Spielberg’s films do not even belong to the same league as the films discussed here, such as William Cameron Menzies’s The Brilliant “Invaders” MARS, to name just one of the many titles studied, but this is still remarkable 1950s review. paranoid fiction. Yes, this has been turning into a commercial for the cool remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS for the last fifteen minutes; You can turn it off. The rest is surprisingly good, and it's nice to see that modern filmmakers remember films that inspired them, even if they can't begin to match the originals.
