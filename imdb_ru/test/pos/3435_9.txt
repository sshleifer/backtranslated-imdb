Schenbarth is one of the funniest films that came not only from Peter Dalle, but also from the Swedish film industry itself. This is a film shot in black and white to feel the atmosphere of the last days before Christmas in December 1945, which is very good. Almost the whole plot takes place on the train, non-stop to Berlin. The train is a mixture of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics, and the literary critic of the Gunnar failure, which is played in Sweden by the famous actor Gustav Hammarsten. The leading role of “Gunnar” is a type of person who, although his intentions for the better, seem to be very funny in drawing everyone who is with him into distress and into hell, especially for the Finnish war. Returning home is a wounded soldier played very funny comedian Robert Gustafsson. The train also has a doctor who cheats on his wife with his mistress. Together they planned to kill the doctors' wife, who also travels on the same train, not knowing about the intentions of her husbands. Will the doctor's wife shy away from plans to kill her, and will everyone survive the unfortunate Gunar guy?
