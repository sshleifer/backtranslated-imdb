as can be read in many reviews, this is a movie that you love or hate - obviously, there is not much room for opinions between them. For example, I think this is a good sign. <br /> <br /> I have always appreciated this film, although the genre is not my typical style (I have never watched Titanic, for example, I don’t intend to). <br /> <br /> The English patient is patient, because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment, unlike when they are “at home” (Catherine), it shows how destructive love can Being slow, strong and extremely painful, it excites because of an extremely passionate affair, the pain of those who left behind, how senseless it is to feel to move on. <br /> <br /> The photo is amazing, not to mention the acting. The pace is slow but timely, and this is true for the book, the graphics, and the depth / development of the characters. To put it in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here), it amputates the layering of this film. People tend to have difficulty with the pace of movies ... as if they are rushing to work ... hey - take life! ;-) Enjoy ... <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4.5 out of 5.
