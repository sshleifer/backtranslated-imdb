This film was really a breath of fresh air from the many Hollywood crap I recently saw. The game is gorgeous, and the characters are attractive and strangely adorable. This story is nothing special, it is simple and works well. Easy movie to just sit down and enjoy. The mood was fantastic, and the shooting really helped propel the film and offered great visual effects. The film obviously has aspects of horror, but a bit more focused on the humorous side of things. You will not laugh out loud hysterically with this, but you will smile all the way to the end. Humor very well with the characters, and a great game does not hurt. I actually watched this movie based on the fact that Ron Perlman was in it. His role is a bit smaller than I expected, but it doesnâ€™t matter; the rest of the cast does more than enough to keep you engaged. If you like horror, watch this. If you like comedies, watch this. Just go ahead and watch it anyway, it is really quite excellent.
