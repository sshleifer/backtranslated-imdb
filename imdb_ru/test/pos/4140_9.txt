This film set the standard for all rock biopsies. This was achieved thanks to the energetic actions of the presenters, the sustainability of the camera work (avoiding the cliché rock videos that were actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), hard editing and an unbiased view of the star as a person, not a symbol or god ). Yes, there are minor holes in the plot, and random details that are a bit superfluous, and there will always be disputes between the families of those who are personally involved in particular. But the problem here, as in the much later film “I’m Following the Line” or the famous biopic of Elvis Carpenter of the same era, is whether the meaning of a performer’s life in his time and place is a catalyst of fan ideals and gratitude. and this is certainly the case here. We are moving away from this film, understanding not only how Buddy Holly became a star, but why. I don't understand what else you want from the movie.
