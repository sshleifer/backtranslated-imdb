Do you not hate those slashers who never started? Sometimes they need a whole hour of lame red herring before any real action takes place. "Tourist trap" is not so! If this is usually a horrible slash you want ... than usually a horrible slash you get! Much of this And constantly from beginning to end! This film contains, perhaps, the largest introductory part in the horror film of the 80s, when a teenager, walking after an engine malfunction, is trapped in an abandoned house and is attacked by a creepy collection of wax statues. Four other lambs in the slaughterhouse arrive at the house and meet a completely insane maniac who looks like a mixture of Leatherface (from "Texas Chainsaw Massacre") and one of those insane sculptors from old films about the wax museum. “The tourist trap” is a thrilling horror spectacle with genuine expectation, terrible images, incredible weirdness, painful humor and stunning makeup effects. The plot twists are not always original, and the actions are pretty lousy, but seriously, who cares? The fast paced and great killer icon made this “Tourist Trap” take my place among my 5 favorite slashers. A little surprised by the complete lack of nudity. It is a pity, because all the girls look amazing and after 10 minutes the obligatory line “Who needs a bathing suit?” Says.
