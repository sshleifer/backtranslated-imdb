This is an amazing film: a romantic thriller with an intricate, but perfectly aligned and stunningly symmetrical plot, brilliantly supported by the use of repetitive visual motifs. Everything in it is beautifully shot: women, apartments; but more surprising is the destructive juxtaposition of images, in almost every scene there are echoes of another. This is a story told by light, color, in many almost parallels. Every time I watch it, it makes me excited. <br /> <br /> The game is great too. Romana Beringer is amazing, like a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown: everything in her is changing with her mood. Vincent Cassel plays a very different role than his role in La Haine; but no less excellent: agile and responsive at the same time. And Monica Bellucci - ah! Monica Bellucci, simply put, she plays (is?) The most perfect woman in the world. In three quarters of the way, there is one little scene where she only makes a smile; and yet at this moment it is said about the hours of Hollywood junk. <br /> <br /> We canâ€™t do justice to this film without mentioning at least the excellent sequential climax: sad, shocking, ironic and subtle in turn. But if one moment captures the brilliance of this work, then this is the scene at the beginning of this incredible denouement, the prospect of which has been teasing us all throughout history. And yet, when the moment comes, he is treated so delicately, so briefly, so dexterously, that, thinking, he suffocates. Only a director of astounding confidence would dare downplay this vital point. But trust is justified. Cinema is not much better than that.
