This is the best movie if you want to be inspired by following your heart and never giving up your dream. Elizabeth Taylor - Velvet, and in her prime (at least in childhood), Mickey Rooney is a cynical girlfriend who eventually becomes her coach, and they go to the Grand Prix with obstacles with their favorite horse, Pi - short for Pirate "- only for Velvet to become a jockey and have a chance to win. Those of you who have not yet seen this, I will not play the final, but you have to see it, and as soon as you do, you will love it. Pay attention to the very young Angela Lansbury as older sister Velvet.
