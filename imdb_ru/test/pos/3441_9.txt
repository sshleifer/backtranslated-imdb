I just finished watching the film for the first time in its entirety (although I watched some parts when it was first shown in the UK in the mid-90s), I really think this is a masterpiece of a movie from the end of the twentieth century. Undoubtedly, a film of this scale raises many questions, for example, why are there some narrative differences between the Hermans of the 60s in Haymat and Herman in this film? For example, in the first film, Herman has a rather substantial relationship with his stepfather (he finances Herman’s electronic music), whereas in “Die Zweite ...” there is little mention of his father until the last episode. <br /> <One more thing interests me; Reading about Edgar Reitz, I am struck by the historical similarity between him and the character Stefan (in the spoiler) in the last episode, it turns out that Stefan won a prize at the Venice Film Festival (Reitz received the award for the best debut working on his film “Mahlzeiten” there); The film company Reitz is called “Edgar Reitz Film Production”, and Stephen is also named the same. I am interested in Stefan being an autobiographical character, because besides Helga he is probably the least handsome of friends. <br /> <br /> Maybe Stefan is a red herring, I don’t know what I know, because I liked this film and I want it to look more like it, except for “The Cache” Michael Haneke and Werner. The Duke’s "Grizzly" lacks ambition, courage and passion in modern cinema. I can't wait to see number 3 now.
