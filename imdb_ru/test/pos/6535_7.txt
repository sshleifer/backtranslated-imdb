Aaron Carter plays the pop star (JD McQueen) in this film (unexpected surprise). This is a typical movie in which the lead lady (Jane) is madly in love with pop star JD McCwin (like many other girls), but sheâ€™s lucky that she spends her days with JD and establishes relationships that look more like fantasy. JD has to go to public school to continue his studies in mathematics in order to go on a summer tour. The problem is that the Ph.D. is not well versed in mathematics. He finds the smartest person in school (Jane) who teaches him. Jane teaches and falls in love with JDJ. In turn, he falls in love with her, but JD's spoiled everything and had to fix everything in order to win the girl and make the summer tour. The film is definitely worth watching. Aaron will be a great actor !!!
