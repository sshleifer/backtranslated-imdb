China Syndrome launched a series of films about the potentially damaging effects of misusing nuclear energy, the black cloud of paranoia, which has hung over America for most of Reaganâ€™s years. This is a well-thought-out and effective drama that received an extra blow from its stars with great power, in particular from Jack Lemmon, who plays a high-ranking official at a nuclear power plant, who suffers from a crisis of conscience. But one can not help but think that this was an accidental nuclear accident on Three Mile Island, which occurred just a couple of weeks after the release of this film, which gave it a strong appeal as a classic of the 70s. No matter how watchable it is, it is certainly not a classic. <br /> <br /> With a redhead Jane Fonda as a news reporter and bearded Michael Douglas as her cameraman (and, by the way, producer of the film). <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
