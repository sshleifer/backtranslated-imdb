I must say that Tarcem Singh, the director of The Cages, has quite easily established himself as his first film, which is considered one of the most visually striking films in modern cinema. <br /> <br /> The Cell is an inner experience rather than a movie. As a thriller, he rises above most of his colleagues, with competent editing and a terrific score, effectively creating an exceptionally tense atmosphere. Nevertheless, in the final analysis, it is Tarsem’s ability to create complex and disturbing scenery and images that carries with it an amazing sense of horror in the film. <br /> <br /> As in several recent films, I was shocked by disturbing hypocrisy among those who spoke negatively about the Cell; In defense of the film, I will consider some of these questions. The plot seems to be the main concern, and, although it is not revolutionary and largely borrowed from Silence of the Lambs, it was never thought of as the most important aspect of the film; The plot itself is the means by which Tarsema’s vision — at once terrifying and amazing — seems to the audience, much in the same way that the story “The Silence of the Lambs” is secondary to the fascinating study of his two main characters, Lecter and Starling. While “The Silence of the Lambs” is clearly the best film, it is irrational to condemn the plot of “The Cages” and, at the same time, to praise “The Silence of the Lambs”. <br /> <br /> My last concern is the mention of directing "MTV style". It hurts me to see the condemnation of directors who use innovative camera and cinematography techniques. A camera can be much more than just a tool for recording events; Angles, panning, color adjustment, etc. are all fully used in the “Cage” to create a feeling of a sleep-like state that otherwise could not be achieved. This is important for the film, since the whole premise behind it is the visualization of the subconscious serial killer. If you just want a series of static shots, stick to theatrical productions and generally throw a movie. <br /> <br /> However, “The Cell” is very interesting, frightening and exciting in both pace and design. Anyone who is able to watch through — perhaps boring, but never boring — the script will find one of the best films of the year 2000.
