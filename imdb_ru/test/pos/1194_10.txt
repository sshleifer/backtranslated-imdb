Absolutely amazing! Humor, violent music and anti-war message make this film the best of all I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> First of all, I like how smart this film is, especially in Vietnam. plot. I wonder how they make army officials impose a bill to look ridiculous. Follow this with the serious situation of real war, and then with imprisonment (which makes me boil with anger at war); and yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen. Wow. <br /> <br /> In addition, the music is really cool. But what is unique in this musical (for example, unlike Evita or the Wizard of Oz) is that the lyrics do not tell the story. Mood influences (along with visual effects and dialogue between songs): “Donna” is a cheerful song that emphasizes a happy mood, while “Flesh Failures” has a strong driving rhythm in a minor key. <br /> I also noticed that the LSD scene is not very flattering. Now I am definitely not going to use drugs (not what I had ever intended). <br /> <br /> Given all the circumstances, this is a terrific movie. The only negative comment I can say is that it is sometimes difficult to hear the dialogue. But who cares? 10/10 stars!
