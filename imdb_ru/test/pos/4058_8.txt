It is actually a lot of fun. I really enjoyed it, although Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were anything but original! All the characters are great and the story is pretty good, plus Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy are just awesome at that! Rene Rousseau is great in his role, and there is a lot of laughter everywhere (especially when Déniro forges the lines of Clint Eastwood and Danny Glover), plus the final is just great. Yes, this is just another episode of the cute film about the film “Buddy Buddy”, but it works because of the fantastic chemistry between De Niro and Murphy!, Plus he also had great chase scenes! In fact, this is not so great, but I found it to be a lot of fun and a great way to pass the time! However, the main villain was very weak and not at all good. This is not the best police film "Buddy" Buddy ", but it is still very interesting, and I thought that it was also quite well made and written!, Plus the final was quite funny! I liked it a lot, although it wasn’t that great and originally, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together, I highly recommend it! The direction is very good! great camera work, cool views and keeping the film at a fast pace. Acting is a lot of fun! He is cheerful, very cute, with science fiction Together with Eddie Murphy, he did his usual cool things, pulled out some really funny faces, it seemed like he enjoyed it, had some funny lines and had a really cool character! (De Niro Rules !!!!!!!). Eddie Murphy also amazing, he was having fun, as De Niro was doing his usual funny things, obviously loved being in front of the camera, and while he can do it. In his dream he was still very happy to watch! (Murphy Rules !!!!). Rene Russo is fantastic here! She had a cool character, and although she had nothing to do, she added a lot of screen presence and made her character always interesting, she was just gorgeous! (Rousseau Rules !!!!). William Shatner is surprisingly funny, he did not overdo it and brought a little laugh to the film. The main villain is fine, but rather weak and rather soft, but still he did what he had to do adequately. The rest of the cast does well. Overall, I highly recommend this one! *** 1/2 of 5
