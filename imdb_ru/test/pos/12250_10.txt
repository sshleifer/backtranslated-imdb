I not only think that it was the best film of 1987, but probably he is on my own amorphous list, as one of the 10-20 best films I've ever seen. For some reason, I'm really connected to this film, and this is one of the most personal films that I saw at that moment in my life (I was 26). Whatever it was, I am strongly identified with the character Holly Hunter (and I am a guy!). She plays an extremely bright, dedicated and tense woman who could not understand the romantic relationship. In this film, she said so many things that I would say or say to others in similar circumstances. And the ending of the film, in my opinion, is very, very sad. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this role was a big breakthrough for Holly Hunter. Obviously, I was not the only one who appreciated it so highly.
