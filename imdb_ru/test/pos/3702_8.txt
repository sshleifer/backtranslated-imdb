At first I didn’t have a particular faith, but as a citizen of Costa Rica I can confirm that the film shows the reality in which we live day by day and shows many things of our culture, such as our way of speaking, our music, our way to defend their rights without any fear, without weapons. <br /> <br /> I’m really proud of the work they did and the fact that they didn’t forget the message they wanted us to receive, not caring for money, but actually working with a small budget, allowing us to appreciate beautiful scripts and great photo. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this movie, you will not regret it.
