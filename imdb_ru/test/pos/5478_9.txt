This is a Hollywood movie. The powers of the participants are not revolutionary. This film will not change the world. Nevertheless, it is well made, well worked out and works well, which is of great importance. <br /> <br /> This is the cat-and-mouse story of a disgruntled former CIA assassin who feels deceived by a secret service agent who defended John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. For obvious reasons, the agent was concerned about this failure in the subsequent years of his career, and when the film was released in 1992 or, probably, in modern America, it would be a potential killer Mitch Leary (John Malkovich off-road) in which he gives a transformative speech) was absorbed disappointment and anger and decides that he is going to kill the president. He imagines that he has a common affair with secret service agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood in his cold-blooded, calm, good-natured grumpy best), who, in his opinion, should be displeased, as he, because the Warren Commission blamed the Horrigan - unjust, says Leary, for the assassination of President Kennedy. Tensions are exacerbated by Liree Horigan-Leary phone calls, wanting to keep Horrigan close, but do not betray their location and plans. <br /> <br /> René Rousseau copes with the role of Lily Raines, a friend with whom Horrigan develops adult relationships. It's nice to see the relationship between two equally competent peers (even if Rousseau is rightly much younger than Eastwood at the time of the shooting). Rousseau is a calm, capable agent, able to go against the clever Horrigan in a friendly banter. This is a good role for Rousseau, allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman, and not just a romantic interest by default for an older man. The play is driven by Wolfgang Peterson’s competent guidance, thoughtful use of music in plot development, and excellent cinematography make this film, which I can watch again and again.
