Can a mentally retarded black youth become a catalyst for uniting people in the city of South Carolina? The answer, apparently, is that, despite its shortcomings, James Kennedy understood much more than what he had been given, and went to become an adaptation on the sports scene. In addition, the film says that many of us do not notice people with problems who can be helped, if only we have the patience that Coach Jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart. <br /> <br /> Radio Director Michael Tollin is a film formula inspired by real-life history. However, the film is not a complete failure due to the inspirational performances that the director was able to get from his remarkable actor. <br /> <br /> Coach Jones plays an important role in getting a young man, who is called Radio, because his passion is because he collected them, went in for sports, the passion he finds in this backward man who had only heavy blows in his young life. Radio from poor origin lives with his mother, who protects him and questions the coach's intentions. At first, students perceive the radio as a talisman, and then his solar disposition prompts him to accept everyone, because he is a good man without an ounce of evil in his body. <br /> <br /> The film owes much to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr., who make up an excellent pair as a trainer and radio. Mr. Harris, one of the best actors of our time, he never misses everything he likes. He gets the essence of a principled coach who sees the opportunity to correct what bothers him from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr., also at her best, depicts a mentally retarded young man. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is superb. S. Efata Merkerson, one of the best actresses of her generation, does an interesting job as the mother of Radio. Alfre Woodard, another good actress, plays with the principle of high school with style. Debra Winger has just a few scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> Radio, being sentimental, will warm someone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people in our society who know nothing. about how quickly we will judge them. Michael Tollin offers us many ideas in the right perspective.
