I just shot this movie in the video store last night. It was new and not released long ago, the rent was only for the night. I, my little sister and my elder brother, who usually hates to watch such films, sat down and looked. Once the film began and, after sitting there, watched it, we all historically laughed. Even my brother. This movie is funny, I actually laughed. No matter how funny some movies are ... even if I think it's funny, I sometimes can't laugh. But this film ... I was laughing. My brother ended up thinking that it was the best movie of this type he had seen. In the end, I watched the movie again after 2 or 3 hours.
