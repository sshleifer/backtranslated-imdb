I have a vacation in Hong Kong now, and I just saw the general police officers at the cinema .... what can I say ... it was so cool !! <br /> <br /> All you could wish for was this! Basically ... just look if you can ... I will make my friend send me a VCR when it comes out .... <br /> <br /> The only bad thing is the sly American style of talking, taken by some actors hl ... like Edison ... "How are you, my man?!" but it added even more humor ... hehe <br /> <br /> Look ... especially if you like any of the following genres: HKfilm, action, comedy, fiction! SEEITMAN !! Edison also wrote a good song for her ... so download it ... Edison Tse - Heroes
