After I read it: “At the time of its release in 2002, its budget of $ 47 million, or $ 327 million, was considered the most expensive French film. However, Astérix et Obélix contre César (1999) had a budget of 48 million dollars, or 274,620,000 francs, which supposedly made it the most expensive French film ever. ” I discovered the reason why I found this film one of the most beautiful and colorful of everything I've ever seen. I liked the scripts, the clothes (especially from Cleopatra) and the atmosphere of the film! This is so fun and fun! I found the jokes clever and funny, and I have to consider this movie to be in my favorite comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> The cast is also excellent, with Monica Bellucci (who is very beautiful as Cleopatra) Gerard Depardieu (excellent Obelix! Christian Clavier, Jamel Debbuz (as I first saw in Amelie Poulain)) among others!: ) <br /> <br /> I recommend this film even to those who do not know the comics Asterix and Obelix. You will be very fun! :) <br /> <br /> aka "Asterix e Obelix: Missão cleópatra" - Brazil
