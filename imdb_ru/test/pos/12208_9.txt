All I can say after watching the first season DVD is that I can't believe NBC is in the "green light" of this show. This is so different from what is now in fashion, with the exception of Lost. Those who miss the X-Files may have a worthy successor. Not as mysterious or intense as “Lost”, I believe that it is generally more interesting. <br /> <br /> Such an extended history is difficult to do. I mean, it can grow into a child's drop, if most of the elements do not stick together. But they agree, and I think that the cast is excellent, the clarity of the writing, the excellent location and props, as well as the special effects are very good for the television budget. Of course, this pushes to the fact that it is plausible, but, as it happens, it is never so stupid as to insult your mind. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this is a great science fiction drama for the whole family. I doubt it will be a long-lasting classic such as the X-Files, but at the same time I recommend taking a DVD if you missed it, like I did the first time. This fall my shows should have increased by another episode! <br /> <br /> PS: I just heard that it received support from NBC ... I hope that Sci-Fi will pick it up.
