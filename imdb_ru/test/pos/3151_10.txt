The reader is an excellent example of how a short film should be. A piercing story told simply through a well-written dialogue, beautifully drawn images, a musical score that is easily interwoven with narration, and characters depicted with thoughtfulness and grace. <br /> <br /> I saw this film at a festival where other interesting films and ideas were shown. But in none of the other shorts were there all the elements of great film production, united in one film, as in The Reader. The reader caught the attention of every visitor of the festival in the room and plunged us into the emotional life of the characters for 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Duncan Rogers has created a wonderful film, and I hope to see more from this director, be it shorts or a full-length film.
