The third film in the cycle of incomparably brilliant films "Operation" and the third in a row masterpiece "Joshuu Sasori: Kemono-beya" aka. Scorpion: Beast Stable Woman (also known as “Sasori: Den Of The Beast”, in which I live) of 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects, but equates (or exceeds) their brightness. The entire original Sasori series with the wonderful Meiko Kaji stands out as the absolute highlight of the WIP cinema, and all the films, especially the first three, uniquely combine the “Operation” movie and art house like no other movie. “The Beast Stable” is the third and second in a row “Sasori” film with Meiko Kaji, the last director of the brilliant director Shun Ito and, in my opinion, the greatest of them. The first film “Joshuu 701: Sasori” of 1972 is the absolute masterpiece of the Operating Cinema and simply the DEFINITION of the Operating Art. In the equally brilliant first sequel, “Joshuu Sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô,” Ito added more surrealism and symbolism. The third film, Sasori, The Beast Stable, retains surrealism (although not quite to the same extent as the second one), and it even has more social criticism than its predecessors. Topics such as poverty, forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central to the film. <br /> <br /> This third film “Sasori” is brilliant and sublime in all aspects and, perhaps, the greatest of all, in general, brilliant, cycle (for me this is the one in which the first was the second). Once again, “Best Stable” is very artistic and very similar to Operation. Visually stunning film shows a huge amount of brutal violence and again meanness, as well as a sequence of incredible surreal beauty. Stunningly beautiful Meiko Kaji is once again gorgeous in her role as Nami Matsushima (aka Sasori). I absolutely worship this wonderful actress, and I am sure that I am not the only one who does this. The remaining performances are also great, especially Mikio Narita is great as a police inspector who is obsessed with catching Sasori. The musical score is the same in all three films, with Urami-Busi, sung by Meiko Kaji herself, as the main theme, which is great, as the score is, more simply, pure perfection. Like its predecessors, Beast Stable is an absolutely brilliant Exploitation-Art masterpiece that no serious movie lover can afford to miss. The whole Sasori cycle is high on my personal list of favorites of all time. "Beast Stable" is probably the most brilliant masterpiece of all! 10/10
