Gary Cooper and Marshal are changing identity, as they both agree that Cooper will be more effective in dealing with criminals. What is remarkable about this film is the costumes of both Marshal and Steve Cochran, who is a bad guy. Cochran wears his pistols backwards, likely to be able to cross shot. The film begins quite excitingly with showdowns with Wild Bill Hickok. Ruth Roman, looks very pretty, this is the marshal's bride. There is a lot of action, never boring, but you have to concentrate, because the story is a bit complicated. Good fun.
