Having not seen the version of this story of 1936, I cannot offer any comparison. However, I can say that Stephen Sondheim’s musical attitude towards this story is absolutely ingenious. Only Sondheim could come up with music and lyrics that are themselves stellar, but at the same time perfect for very fancy themes. If someone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is, he should see it (and “Dr. Strangelove”). When Mrs. Lovett moves from “the worst pies in London” to a booming business with great recognition, we don't say “Soylent Green” - but the ingredients are similar. Especially brilliant is the song in which Mrs. Lovett gives her idea to Mr. Todd. Even in the introductory number, the line "... they went to their Creator is shaved impeccably ..." gives a great idea of ​​premise, drama and comedy. Fine!
