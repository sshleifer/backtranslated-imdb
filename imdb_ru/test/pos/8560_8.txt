Of course, going into this, one would expect it to be a typical, silly T & A film, and it is. But it does have some pretty well thought out humorous moments. Given the era in which it was made, and the obvious aspect of exploitation, it still remains one of the best comedies with the film of that time. <br /> <br /> While watching this film, you will surely see inspiration for many scenes in Revenge of the Nerds and many other films of the same genre. Most of the acting is terrible, and WAY beyond that, but that's exactly what I expect in such a film. What he lacks in acting ability, the more he compensates for his camp value and complete disregard for something useful. <br /> <br /> What is surprising about this film is that there was clearly some money there that went into it. Similar films made today simply do not have that style. If you can turn off your brain and turn on your sense of humor for an hour and a half, you will love this movie. I dare not find anyone in this film, at least SOMETHING that they find funny, if not funny.
