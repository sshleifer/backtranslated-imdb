Five years after she teamed up with James Cagney in Enemy of the Public, Mei Clark reappears, this time as his bride with Cagney's character on the other side of the law. It seems that in her relationship she also shouted more chances, trying to get Johnny Cave to be a little more practical with his money and his career. You should have assumed that they would come back together after she gave him a shoe in order to challenge her wry boss; these things have a way to work in pictures. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching Cagney in this. I usually do that, and here he looked as if he could listen to the characteristic movement with his shoulders, which he used for good effect in “Angels with dirty faces” depicting Rocky Sullivan. It was right after he threw Cavanaugh (Robert Glekler) out of his office during the first attempt to bribe a new boss, "Weights and Measures." He turns to the camera and picks up the phone, as if completely pleased with his response to the cheater is very cool. <br /> <br /> As far as I understand, it was not one of Warner Cagney's films, but it is quite possible that it was. Warner often dealt with the affairs of the common man, and exposing the dishonest traders and politicians who defended them would be in their favor. You also have these wonderful New York street scenes depicting the cars and shops of that era, with self-made signs measuring flour at eighteen cents per pound. Hey, what about a furniture store selling a living room set for one hundred and eighty-nine dollars, today you can get a disposable chair at this price. <br /> <br /> The best part of the picture is the Meat Counter Scene, when Cagney, James Burke (Aloysius) and the butchers play ball with underweight chicken. One of the easiest moments of the film, but you understand how tense people can become when they are caught in a fraud. Same with the truck driver Johnny made to sign the exact delivery; he was just not used to it. <br /> <br /> In general, a pleasant departure from Cagney’s more typical gangster presence, even if not to the level of his feature films. It is fairly easy to obtain as one of several Cagney publicly available photos, and they can often be found in relatively inexpensive collections.
