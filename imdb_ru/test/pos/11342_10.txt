The incredibly impressive novel by Kar Wai Wong, which is perfect for me. Recruitment in the 1960s in Hong Kong. As we have shown, this happens in turbulent time. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung play Chow Mo-Wan and Su Lee-zheng Chan. A man and woman who meet each other in an apartment in Hong Kong in which they both move. Chow Mo-Wan works in a newspaper company. Su Lee-chen Chan is a secretary. Two very different people. Chau Mo-Wan and Su Lee-cheng Chan create a special bond after both of them learn that their spouses constantly have extra-marital meetings. Together. <br /> <br /> The characters Chou Mo-Wan and Su Li-chen Chan are nothing short of amazing. Both Leung and Chung manage to combine such amazing chemistry with each other, which is better than any Hollywood novel that is released today. Combined. The film tells about the two main roles and their feelings after the infidelities of their partners. Kar Wai Wong manages to create such a strong character development between these two characters that you really start to feel them. Lyng and Chung are incredibly amazing and better than any Hollywood couple shown on the screen today. Combined. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to describe Fa yeung nin wa, except for a beautiful, energetic novel, which also has a capricious, atmospheric work with great cinematography. So many elements of this film help to make it flawless. Along with Kar Wai Wong and the actors, the cinema from Christopher Doyle and Ping Bing Lee is haunted. Beautifully understated. Images from Kar Wai Wong help you create your own world. The world that creates these characters. Original, melancholic and nostalgic. This film is incredibly unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Costumes created by permanent artist Kar Wai Wong William Chang are simply amazing. Cheng, who wears an elegant dress with beautiful ankle-length patterns in each scene. She is a thief scene. Her costumes say a lot about her character, and emotions fit into all the colors of her dresses, which are used brightly and smartly. Very original. Chang, also a producer, creates a brilliant setting for a dark movie. Especially with the help of the amazing music used in the scenes and masterful editing of the film, Chang again. William Chang seems to be the incredibly versatile and unsung hero of this film. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is one of the best in this millennium. Incredibly convincing and full of nostalgia. The shots are fascinating and stalking. Kar Wai Wong to some extent turns out to be a master at the top of his game. Actions; Music; cinema; editing; production; costume and direction help create ONE small, small perfect movie. A masterpiece in the romantic film industry. Visually impressive. In general, a masterpiece for filmmaking. A film that reminds me of old classic Hollywood was one that never was. Never forget Fa Yong Ning Wah. I know I won't.
