Beguiled is one of those underrated films in a director’s and / or actor’s career that ultimately plays better than expected. The same year that Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel collaborated on Dirty Harry, they also worked together on this little psychosexual drama in the country of the Civil War Confederation. This is almost 180 from what “Harry” had for the viewers. Here is a film that is under scrutiny, and with a low-budget, almost useless affair compared to what Dirty Harry drew. It is also a story where Eastwood is not surrounded by a world full of dangerous men, but by women who, despite their first appearances, have darker sides to them. And there is even romance between some of the rougher and more complex scenes. But in this kind of framework for making a film, Siegel actually has a little more freedom to do things with a style of painting that wanders in something more European; Here and there, they remind me of the work of Polanski in the 60s. It all works, although quite well, even with initial doubt that these two figures of male filmmaking (Eastwood is obvious and Siegel, having occupied his niche in B-noir and low-budget thrillers) can extract material that can possibly be made for a movie on all life. <br /> <br /> Here and there it was very exciting and darkly comical to watch Eastwood play these girls. He does something a bit disruptive in his performance, still having some sort of Eastwood's manliness - if there is such a thing close to his clichéd film image - from time to time a step ahead of this small school for young women, and not others. See Eastwood in such a play as in Misty for Me (another work of Eastwood in 1971), shows how great he can plausibly play with very good actresses. In particular, there are four main female characters, each of different ages and with a different attraction to their Yankee men. While Siegel’s work, which controls all the actors, has its moments in the first half, in fact, as soon as the story crosses halfway through the sequence of dreams (less successful than the director could), the real rich scenes begin to rise. Much of this is the best that Siegel dramatically directed, pushing the psychological and emotional boundaries of scenes where they were not expected. <br /> <br /> This is a complex film, despite all this praise, because it doesn’t draw anyone as too respectable - only the character of Halley, the duty slave played by May Mercer, is partly separated from what happens between too curious women. and McBurney. Along with this, the East here plays a role that is and is not the one that he usually saw, as at this time of his real formative years in the cinema. He is an antihero here, which was his calling card of Westerns and other thrillers he was engaged at that time. But, unlike those films, he is actually not in the mode when he is “more than life” to express it, as he is a deserter, a womanizer, a deceiver and cunning even in the most charming and welcoming moments. If this is not one of his best acting works, which is difficult to compile, given his catalog, then it is worth seeing fans who want to see his other side. This is due to him, but also to what happened with his collaboration with Siegel, since they both risked at this time in Hollywood.
