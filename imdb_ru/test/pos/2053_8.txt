A wonderful Christmas story on the theme "Susie the Host finds her Inner Amazon." No, I'm serious! Amnesia Gina Davis begins to improve when she is hit on the head. From this familiar beginning, we are moving in an unexpected direction. Good pace, good action, fun story, a lot of explosions and chaos.
