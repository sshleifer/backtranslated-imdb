Personally, I have a weakness for horror films that are set up in hospitals and shelters, so I had a good feeling about watching this film “Do not look in the basement”, although his reputation is questionable. Well, it turned out I was right! This is great, dirty entertainment with a pair of effective shocks and delightfully ridiculous characters. Of course, you have to look beyond poor performance and a completely illogical plot, but if you succeed (and if you are a fan of this kind of horror, this is an essential quality), you will be rewarded with an outrageous “video-nasty”, in which and madness form the main elements. A young and cute nurse Charlotte arrives at a remote sanatorium, where she should start a new job. She learns that the doctor who hired her was killed by the patient, and the deputy head physician seems reluctant to accept a new arrival. Life inside the sanatorium is rather peculiar: patients run freely, but every door is not locked. After a series of strange events, Charlotte discovers the terrible secrets that the institution hides .... The first 10 minutes (preliminary loans) are great, as is the completely insane climax. Everything between them is almost without surprise and tension, but you wait patiently, because you just feel that the final will be wild fun. The asylum patients are crazy textbooks, but I still love them. Some of my favorites include a former judge (who still speaks exclusively in legal terms), a suspicious army sergeant and a crazy old lady. “Do not look in the basement” is a great entertainment with a small brain, especially recommended for fans of the 70s junk cinema, sick puppies and other scum. Crazy took refuge, yes !!
