I went straight to the big screen to watch this kicker. This is the only film I know about that directed by Tarsem Singh, but the boy was intense. This film was a complete mind stimulator and one of the best special effects of its kind. <br /> <br /> Characters were vibrant and nothing more than creatures created in your own mind or nightmare. This film is scary and interesting, and it is full of fear and delight. This film doesn’t compare with any other that I’ve seen, except that it looks weird. In this respect, this is a rather big step over the "Clockwork Orange". Be sure to watch this movie on the big screen and do not wait for it to be released on film. It will not be twice as bad as on the film. <br /> <br /> This film is not for those who go crazy easily. It will ruin your mind and leave you with images that take time to forget. But for those who love to be shocked ..... ENJOY!
