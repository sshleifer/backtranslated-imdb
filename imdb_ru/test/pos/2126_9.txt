I feel that this film is different from many others in that it shows a family of girls who really care about each other. They may have flaws, but bitterness and resentment do not occur with these girls. Try to find it on TV or in regular movies. It's a breath of fresh air to see how girls are feminine â€” in beautiful, feminine dresses and shoes. Compare this with today's clothing in stores, that is, torn and worn jeans and jackets, etc. In the storyline there is an evil thread, but this is what makes it more realistic and interesting. I know this is an animation, but it still gives you the feeling that families can stick together and go out well. I would recommend this film for boys and girls.
