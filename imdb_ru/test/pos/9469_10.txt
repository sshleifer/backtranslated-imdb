I thought this movie was absolutely fun. I already knew that it would be a funny movie, but it was funnier than I expected. Of course, there were some silly jokes, but they pissed me off. I thought the actors would be pretty bad, but the actors played this comedy well. I have to pay tribute to Amanda Bynes, she was remarkably similar to her brother and had a terrific performance in childhood. As for the other actors, they were also funny. Of course, there were moments when you screamed “how can you not say?” To the screen, but this is all part of the fun. As a result, the plot turned out pretty good. There is a happy ending, but what did you expect? <br /> <br /> In general, it's just ridiculous.
