This is a typical Sandra Bullock film in which she plays a muscular (but secular) woman who is in trouble, but finds a way to survive and become a hero. Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> There are a lot of holes in this story. Things just don't add up, and some expectations are a bit commonplace. But - this expectation is very good. There is a lot of tension in this story, because of which there is a strong paranoia. The story begins slowly, but begins rather quickly and remains the same, which makes the film attractive to the viewer. That's why I give him a pretty good rating â€” the film draws you into it. Bullock is prettier than annoying that she is usually for me, so this is my movie with the highest rating with her in it.
