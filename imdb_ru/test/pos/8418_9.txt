I am a Maharashtraan teenager living in the 21st century, and it’s obvious that I’m not very fond of Bollywood, let alone Marathi films. However, when I watched “Shvaas”, I had a unique feeling that only an extremely effective film can create. <br /> <br /> It is a fact that, as in most Indian films, the film has a true and complete effect only when viewed in the original language. Most of the emotion and meaning of the film is embedded in its Marathi dialogues, which, no matter how hard they try, cannot be effectively translated into English. <br /> <br /> Shvaas explores in detail the relationship between grandfather and grandmother. And this fully justifies this strong bond. Dialogues such as "smear scab pan laahat ek aakhe" (my chapter is also one in a million) reinforce emotions. Anyone who has closely watched the relationship between the grandparents will be able to relate the situation to the image in the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is definitely worth a look. This is a film that has had a huge impact on me. I will definitely recommend it to everyone!
