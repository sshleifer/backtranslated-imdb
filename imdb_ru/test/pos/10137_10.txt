EXCUSE ME!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!! CUBA GOODING, Jr. Had to win an Oscar for his image in this film !!! He was a movie! Although in some areas of the film may not be enough, Cuba was awesome ... and for me this is the best role he ever played! The scene in the film, where he finds out that his mother died, made me upset and cry in THEATER !! I guess I could really relate to this film because I saw the same attitude towards people as in my own school, growing ... what a tragedy! Getting to know the “real” radio and coach at the end of the film was really special! If you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears, you need a heart test! If you like "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty", you will also love "Radio"! I wish they made more of these films ... Radio is a real bargain!
