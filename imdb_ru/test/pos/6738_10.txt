One of my favorite movies. An excellent cast, led by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Serious dramatic situations with brilliant comedy beats. Accurate blend of character and history. Real people with real problems, and each has a different relationship with each member of the family. Sensitively goes from slightly sad to ridiculous. Read the quotes. This is the best adaptation of the play of Neil Simon. <br /> <br /> If you want to know more about Eugene, check out “Biloxi Blues” (starring Matthew Broderick, who played in both stage versions) - everything is fine, but a little darker. Away from the Broadway Connection created for television.
