In my opinion, this film has a decent story, very good fighting scenes, but I was a little disappointed with the end of the film. I think it would be better if Lydie Deneir also knew karate or if she knew to use some kind of weapon her character would also become more interesting, and she was a worthy opponent of Cynthia. I think that when the director shot the final “battle” between Cynthia and Denis, he wanted to finish the film earlier, so he didn’t care what the end would be. In general, I think that fans of Cynthia Rothrock will be very pleased with this movie. This is not like "yes, madam"! or swore to justice, but it was quite entertaining, and Cynthia looks amazing in this film, so my rating for this film is solid 8/10
