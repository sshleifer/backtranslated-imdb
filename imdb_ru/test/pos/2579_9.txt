Craig Brewer grew up in Tennessee, it can be seen in his film. Forget the black guy on the action White Girl. It happens, but it's not Samuel L. Jackson about Christina Ricci. More importantly, this film is about the values ​​and culture of people in this city of Tennessee. How they cope with divorce, abandonment, sexual abuse and psychological disorders. While in the cities of the North, Midwest and West Coast millions are declining, the city councilor, who also solves his problems, becomes an advisor and mediator. This is an interesting concept that can not get along well with everyone. <br /> <br /> Brewer shows us the region in which he grew up. Yes, it is still infected with racial problems, although there are more serious problems in many megalopolises. This is in the subtext, and not in the main plot of the story. People lead a simpler lifestyle, but life is still complex and painful. <br /> <br /> Jackson and Ricci do a fantastic job in this movie. Jackson, an aging former blues guitarist who makes a living on his little farm. His wife, 12 years old, leaves him for his brother, so he falls into depression. Meanwhile, Ricci and Justin Timberlake spent the last wild sexually charged night before going into the army. Ricci suffers from childhood sexual abuse, although this will not be known later, her agony can only be repaid by sexual raids with different boys (black and white) in the city. <br /> <br /> When Ricci was beaten and left dead on the road near Jackson's farm, he finds her and takes care of her. He believes that this is a divine intervention, that this half-naked White girl is left in his care. He squeezes his Bible and prays for guidance. He abandons her sexual achievements and instead treats her with dignity, respect and care. Some few men in her life have ever done. <br /> <br /> She sees Jackson as a man of honor and morality in time, but he also carries his own pain. He plays the guitar and sings to her. Yes, this is blues and damn good, with the minister advising her, she gradually understands how to deal with childhood sexual abuse. Jackson, thanks to the transformation of Ricci, understands that he must allow the healing of his own pain. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake returns, discharged due to "anxiety problems." When he searches for Ricci, who lived with Jackson during her recovery, he discovers that she was erratic and unfaithful to him. <br /> <br /> He finds her and Jackson at the bar, where Jackson decided (as part of his healing process) to retire and play the blues again. Timberlake follows them home and confronts Jackson and Ricci. <br /> <br /> You will need to watch a movie to get the rest of the story. If you decide to watch this film, do not forget to look at it from the point of view of a foreign or independent film. This is a piece of life from a particular region of America that few of us can see. This is interesting and revealing. It also shows us that regardless of the color of our skin, we all have similar problems that can be solved with similar solutions.
