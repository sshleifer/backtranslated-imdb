A touching documentary about the human face of the 9/11 tragedy, showing how one small community came together to honor the memory of two school friends lost that day. The film interweaves the lives of Chris and Tom through interviews with family and friends and fragments of old photos. Through their memories, we see two tragically ragged lives. The film also tells how, thanks to a series of coincidences, the inspiring memorial garden was created thanks to the efforts of many people, both known and unknown to the two victims. Through laughter and tears (and sweat) we see the power of hope, honor and love. This film evokes many different emotions, but the last feeling is the admiration of the human spirit, untouched by tragedy.
