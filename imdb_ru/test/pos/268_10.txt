I'm surprised that my only comment so far on this tv. the film ... as far as I know, the series itself had a huge number of fans, reviewers and real people who praised him for the man. In any case, let me immediately tell you that if you, like me, love tough cops of drama, you will like the character of “The Lost Child” Tennyson, the heroine of the whole “Main Suspect” series, who fought with the creation of the male police throughout the series, getting to its present, relatively powerful rank in the hierarchy of hard work police, perseverance, and simply talent for the work of the police. In fact, she is an ambitious careerist, but she has a romantic side, and of course she is not a hater of men. Unfortunately, her relationship with the evil hours that her career requires and she never got married, so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest novel, she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother and putting all her police work at risk, not to mention future progress or abortion — what she would choose. This abortion has never looked great in the subsequent drama — it is very skillfully handled, in less than a couple of minutes of screen time, a miracle of saving in writing scripts and editing — but this always exists, unlike Tennyson’s desperate efforts to find another “lost child” - kidnapping victim - before it's too late. The story takes a lot of turns before an unexpected ending, and one is fascinated by the plot and characters (although I found that many villains are a bit overwhelmed), the police, and especially Tennyson herself, are not always competent, nor are those who are cute, figures, given the unpleasant work which they have to do, in the nasty underworld in which this series usually dwells. <br /> <br /> Mirren herself said that she would not make more films in the series, but despite the fact that she was always in the role of Tennyson, the series itself is also “proof of the actor”, like my other addiction American "Law and Order" by Dick Wolf - whoever appears, everyone could go on forever. Like my hot hope.
