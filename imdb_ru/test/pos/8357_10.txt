A fun movie, I had a great time watching it. The star (Kuneit Arkin, sometimes referred to as Steve Arkin) is a popular actor from Turkey. He played in many cool guys, movies about epic swords and novels. It was fun to see him internationally and in lousy gloves. If I remember, it was also dubbed in English, which made things even more funny. (sort of like seeing John Wayne speak Turkish).
