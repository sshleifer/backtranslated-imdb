This was the first publicly available picture of Chaplin, and the results are mixed. The film is a biting satire of Hitler and Mussolini, their minions and their fanatical way of life, especially regarding the persecution of the Jews. It was bold and forth in 1940 and must have made many people squirm. <br /> <br /> Compared to Chaplin's earlier work, it is rather pale in comparison. The sweet, funny style of his silence, in my opinion, far surpasses his first walkie-talkie. There are many meaningless bits that drag on. If it were silent, it probably would not have happened. <br /> <br /> I think that one of the most fun moments is the moment of a musical hairdresser and the dance of the globe. One of the most touching moments is obviously the speech at the end. <br /> <br /> “The Great Dictator” is an effective and sometimes moving film that is a very important part of Chaplin’s history and cinema history. These are flaws, but Chaplin is in great shape.
