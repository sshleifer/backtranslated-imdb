Millions of gold travel by train to the American treasury. Journey to Lois Lane to report it. On the way, the train is attacked by masked thieves. They tear off a car with armed guards and attack the rest. This leads to a fierce fight between the remaining guards and thieves. Thieves overwhelm them, but then Lois Lane bursts in. She discourages thieves from the train (at some point with a weapon), but the train begins to spin out of control. Lois cannot stop this, and thieves will stop at nothing to get gold. Well, that Superman is on the way! <br /> <br /> Fast, exciting, non-stop action. Probably one of the best cartoons. Just great.
