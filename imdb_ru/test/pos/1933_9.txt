1931 also introduced the "American tragedy", the original story of "who he goes with, a poor or rich girl." it was a really interesting movie. Babs Stanwyck was as pretty as she could, the same Sally Blanc. Monroe Owsley, unforgettably played husband Babs. I have never heard of him, but it seemed to me that he was very similar to Bing Crosby from the “big show” (32 years old), even bald ears and winged ears. Ricardo Cortez, a rich playboy with a heart of gold. true pioneer of cinema is back. the dilemma is resolved at the end, to the links of the title, and I believe that Annette Hanshaw had a hit record, although the voice-over succeeded. I also enjoyed the dance floor scenes. I am sure they were genuine; the group leading once was excellent. Good job, Lionel Barrymore !!!!
