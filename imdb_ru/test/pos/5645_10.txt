This is probably the greatest war film and, of course, one of the greatest films. In this gloomy view of what we can call only hell, there is no sentimentality, a patriotic agenda, even an encouraging message of universal fraternity. It is this quiet rigor and lack of manipulation that gives the film amazing strength. There are also no attempts to make a hero from the main character Ichikawa Tamura. He is just a poor doomed juice, trying to survive in a world of horror, who hopes, but is not sure that he can hold on to his humanity in the process. Ichikawa's great lack of slopes and illusions causes the Lights on the Plain to stand alone. Ichikawa died in February 2008.
