I watched fantulosa! because over the past few years, Michael Sheen has become one of my favorite actors, and if you haven't seen him anywhere, firstly, you are not ashamed, and secondly, get a copy of Heartlands or Dirty Filthy Love in your hands. This performance did not disappoint - Michael Sheen almost magically turned into Kenneth Williams and gave an idea that was as tragically moving as it could. Not to take away something from other shows, but, like Kenneth, Michael really stole the show. I don’t know how he does it, but every performance I’ve seen, Michael gives, he seems to turn into a metamorphosis until the character he plays becomes truly believable, and no matter how hard I try, I can not blame him. Need to go for tea, enjoy!
