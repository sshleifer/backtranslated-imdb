This episode of Colombo is one of the best and possibly one of my favorites. Starring: baby Rosemary John Cassavetes as a maestro, his wife as Blythe Danner (mother of Gwyneth Paltrow) and his mother-in-law played by Myrna Loy (one of Americaâ€™s greatest leading actresses in films of our time). In any case, I do not agree with anyone who criticizes this film. This episode is one of my favorites, because you have a great cast that does an excellent job. I love to watch Colombo with my favorite dog, which he never calls in the series. This time this episode is devoted to classical music in the Hollywood ball, one of the attractions of LA Of course, Colombo is fond of classical music as well as anything else related to crime.
