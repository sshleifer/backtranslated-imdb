This is a well-crafted piece from all favorite masters of suspense. As usual, technical elements, such as camera work and lighting, are outstanding (especially for film time). I did not find the first part of the film very exciting, but the last one probably compensated for one exciting scene after another. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn’t like about this movie was Farley Granger’s choice as Guy Heins. For some reason I did not find it very plausible. On the other hand, Robert Walker looks like the ominous “bad guy” of Bruno Anthony. <br /> <br /> Overall, I highly recommend it.
