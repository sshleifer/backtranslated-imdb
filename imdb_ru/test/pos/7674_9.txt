I was given a solo "Summertime" in the 5th grade for our spring choir concert. Since then a great appreciation of Gershwinâ€™s music has arisen in me. I like the obsessive melodies of this Gershwin opera. Returning to the 5th grade (about 10 years), I got an LP for practice, and also really love the soundtrack. I recommend watching this movie, and if you can get a soundtrack, get it - sometimes you can find it on eBay - the old LP used. I searched and searched to try and find a soundtrack on a CD. The songs on this have amazing musical arrangements, and I really wish it would be put on a CD for purchase and also wish they would restore the film and put it on DVD. This is a really big job, which, I think, will be useful for current and future generations. Some may think that the film is slow and boring, but I think it's quite the opposite. Although Poitiers and Dandridge dubbed musical voices, I think that voices fit well with individuals and individuals. The speaking voice and the singing voice of a person can be completely different. Porgy and Bess, as well as the songs in this opera will always have a special meaning for me.
