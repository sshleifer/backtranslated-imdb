As Roger Korman said in an interview, low-budget filmmaking allows filmmakers to risk non-standard ideas. Well, it will be difficult for you to find a film that flourishes just as originally as George Barry’s Mortal Bed: A Bed That Eats. <br /> <br /> The film does have a reverse story, and it's interesting. I will refrain from giving any details so that you can hear them yourself if you risk seeing. Suffice it to say that the named piece of furniture has an insatiable hunger, absorbing the reckless bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims like acid. <br /> <br /> “Bed of death” is a creepy, haunting little click that plays its absurd premise in such a way that it goes beyond the usual assortment of black dishes. He occupies his special dream world in such a way that I can take him seriously. This is really a strange and unusual horror movie. He is interested in exploitative ingredients - there are several tasty servings of female nudity - and yet this is art, albeit an art with completely distorted sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not so bad for a film with a microscopic budget. and Barry gives the film the good and atmospheric quality of the "midnight film." The acting role in the cast is as boring as you can imagine, although Patrick Spence-Thomas provides a reasonable amount of seriousness as an artist / storyteller, and one particular point of interest is to see one familiar face at hand: the future Boy meets the World Father William Russ ! <br /> <br /> This film may not even have found such a small cult that he had if it were not for pirated copies doing the rounds; This, of course, should be considered as one of the cases when this practice ultimately helped the film - even if the shooting took years. <br /> <br /> If you have a taste for truly strange obscure subjects, the Death Bed can be exactly what you mean. <br /> <br /> 7/10
