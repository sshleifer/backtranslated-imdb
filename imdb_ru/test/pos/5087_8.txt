Although the short-lived "Amazing Spiderman" was one of the best for television versions of the famous comic book hero. Only Wonder Woman (Linda Carter) (best in the genre and Incredible Hulk (Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno) were better. <br /> <br /> Amazing Spiderman surpassed 1966- Batman 1968 because the elements of the last camp often destroy the adventure. Spiderman surpasses all three TV interpretations of Superman - Lois and Clark, Smallville and, of course, George Reeves "Superman", which raises the rear. <br /> <br /> "Amazing Spiderman" was a militant in the late 1970s, in the pre-CGI era, when tricks had to be performed with tricks, and not in the database computer "Spiderman" had its very talented stuntman to perform deadly challenging brave acrobatics. His name was Fred Waugh, who wore a spy costume for militants. The “Sound of Music” was Spider-Man during the dialogue scenes. Spider-Man Hammond also had his secret identity with Peter Parker, similar to Christopher Reeve - Superman / Clark Kent, Adam West Batman / Bruce Wayne and, of course, Linda Carter the role of Wonder Woman / Diana Prince. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, only the series had thirteen episodes. Because when the first episode went on the air in November 1977, the whole Wednesday watched it on CBS on Wednesday night. In fairness, CBS should release this pilot episode, as well as "The Deadly Dust", "Captive Tower", etc. On a DVD soon. “Spiderman” was short-lived, but he had followers of the cult, and, in my opinion, was damn better than the star’s interpretation of the movie of the famous comic book with Toby McGuire. <br /> <br /> CBS may be hesitant to release these episodes for two reasons. (A) For them, there may not be a broad market based on the lack of duration of the series and the generation of children and young people who were not born when the series was shown in the 1970s. (B) In one of the early episodes, Spiderman talked about plotting terrorists in the World Trade Center, which was attacked twice in many years after this show was broadcast in 1993, and, of course, destructive attack on him. a country of 9/11/01 in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost. <br /> <br /> However, I don’t think it would be a bad taste to release this episode of “Spiderman” even if the show was an adventure derived from a comic book and a camp in nature. The live action "Amazing Spiderman" is not very many fans, but there is a cult of fans. If and when CBS releases it on DVD, this cult consequence can be explained along with the episode in which Spiderman saved the towers in 1978, but how in September 2001 real life turned out to be different from movies. I like to follow the news, but I also like science fiction / fantasy. So I look forward to the release of "The Amazing Spider-Man on DVD."
