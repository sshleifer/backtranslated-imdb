You have to love baseball, and you should at least be like Tom Selleck, but if you meet these criteria, you should fully enjoy this movie. Selleck plays a former major league star who turns out (?) Sold to Japan when his career ends. A really well thought out and fascinating look at Japanese customs and behavior. Superb auxiliary speeches by manager Selleck (Clint Eastwood from Japan), his girlfriend Takanashi and his translator Chemistry between Sellek and Takanashi works very, very well, this is indeed a very good romantic film, other than baseball. Look for Heisbert as a teammate long before he became a regular shill for Allstate. The film turns very well. It's easy in my top fifty films of all time and maybe my favorite on baseball.
