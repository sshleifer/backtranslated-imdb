I liked this show, but I don’t remember that some day I disliked it, starting with “Americanization of Emily”. The city sheriff, who is trying to steal the city blindly and go to Mexico, should love it. Like everything he does, he has a tongue with a cheek that marks him as a Garner product. James plays the same character in many of his shows and films, but for some reason he never becomes stale. <br /> <br /> P.S. re: Kill the main character <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, the “good” brother was killed and replaced with an “evil” twin to raise the rating, i.e. make it more than any other western on television at the time. I think this show was too far ahead of its time, and I still miss it. Television without Jimmy Ji shows something is missing.
