Pretty damn good for a French movie. I have not seen any of the previous films by Katherine Brailat, and therefore I have no opinion on this compared to her previous work. French cinema, as a rule, adheres mainly to feature films and leaves filming and star cars in Hollywood. This is probably a good business strategy, as no other film industry in the country will have the resources to compete in such projects. Films about filmmaking are often boring, because they have little resonance for people not engaged in business. But it interested me more than I thought. Despite the title, (strangely in English), this is really not a big comedy, despite some funny moments. Iâ€™ve only seen a few Anne Pario films, but it shows a generous amount of talent and diversity, from the action / psychological drama La Femme Nikita to the curve of Innocent Blood. This film also expands her range, as she plays a more or less ordinary woman, but is still irresistible on the screen. Glory also Roxane Meskida, with whom I was a stranger. She plays a very inexpressive actress for most of the film, whose talent ends at the end. If you don't want car chases and explosions to entertain you, check it out.
