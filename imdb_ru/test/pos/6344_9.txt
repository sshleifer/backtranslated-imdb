This is a wonderful continuation of the award-winning mini-series "The Lonely Pigeon" in the 1980s This sequel is perhaps better than the original. It is definitely more for the family. The language is more restrained. There is a lot of violence, and one particular scene with Cherokee Jack is especially horrible. However, in general, a great movie. The game is great. William Peterson is fantastic. Such a wonderful dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comic time. John Voight successfully fills Tommy Lee Jones shoes as Captain Call. Ricky Schroeder perfectly plays the role of a young boy who grew up without a family to claim him. Highly recommended.
