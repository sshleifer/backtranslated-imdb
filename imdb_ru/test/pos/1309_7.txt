I just watched it with my three children - 12 years old (boy), 10 years old (boy) and 8 years old (girl), and this film was an old-fashioned family fighter. Although he was definitely aimed at the children's market (I would say, from 5 to 13), he certainly was watchable, and as a parent, I am pleased to find a film that is suitable for all ages, but it is suitable for viewing by the whole family - especially young children. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Ricky, a bit of a boring one with vivid imagination (this can definitely be seen in his dream episodes), which prevents kidnapping of people and major theft of works of art during a flight to Washington for a school trip. Ricky's father is an airplane mechanic, so Ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft inside out, but is also the main weapon in his computer flight simulator. This is very convenient when the pilot and co-pilot are in the cold because of a series of misadventures, and there is no one who could fly the plane. I do not want to distribute the plot.
