Marco Poloni (Kostas Mandilor) was born to a family of bakers in the Bronx. Although Polonis have been known for their pastry for decades, the business has experienced difficult times. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is the most talented producer of desserts in Manhattan, but it seems that she cannot take a leading position in the confectionery industry because of the glass ceiling. The chance encounter of Marco and Grace leads to a conversation about a possible solution for both of them. In the near future, there will be an awesome Golden Halo contest, and Marco wants Grace to become a partner with him. At stake is a huge amount of "test", ha-ha, for the winners, enough to establish Grace in their own business and save Polonis's canteen. Grace reluctantly agrees. But there are complications. Some of the judges and associates may have problems with Grace and Marco. In addition, although Marco and Grace both have some attraction for each other, Grace has a long-time, very rich guy. Can Marco and Grace win the competition? This is a wonderful film for romantics at heart. First, it's a good cast. Holly has always been a wonderful actress with a noticeable hoarse voice that contributes to her attractiveness. In this film, she perfectly played a decisive, but beautiful Grace. Mandilor, the newcomer, also admires the great competitor baker. The rest of the actors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro as Marco's mother, are pretty cute. As in the film “Distinguishing Feature,” costumes, scenery, and manufacturing comforts are not reproachable, and the script may still seem fresh and fun, despite some familiar themes. Treat yourself, romcom lovers, to the sweetest pastry by watching this movie. This is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a large box of quality chocolates.
