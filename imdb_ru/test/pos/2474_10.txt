The most amazing movie I've ever seen. I did not read the program and accidentally stumbled upon a movie. I thought it was a real documentary, and I felt bad from what I saw. I just found out that it was a film after it was finished, and I looked on the Internet for more information about the “park of punishments” in the USA. It was incredibly real, and it is easy to believe that this really happened in the USA, if you are from Europe. I have to admit that I felt really anti-American after watching the movie and before I learned that it wasn’t really like that.
