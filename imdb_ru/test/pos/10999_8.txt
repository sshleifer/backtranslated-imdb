Squire Gotos is one of the most "stupid" episodes of "Star Trek" and, therefore, one of the most spectacular. The entertainment factor, generally speaking, is fueled by the confrontation between William Shatner and the fun guest star of this episode, William Campbell. <br /> <br /> During an unidentified routine mission, Sulu suddenly disappears, and Kirk soon after Spock immediately begins to search for his missing colleagues (and, although he would not like to admit it, friends), while two grounded crew members have to deal with the mysterious, omnipotent, vibrant Trelane (Campbell), the self-proclaimed Squire Gotos, a creature capable of creating or destroying everything he wants, thanks to the sheer power of his mind. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the plot may seem reworked from previous episodes (honestly, if there were any science fiction shows, there was not at least one godlike character), but this feeling quickly disappears thanks to the winning using an exaggerated humor scenario, and all of this is transmitted through Campbell’s deliberate camp execution: his Trelan is, in fact, a version of the track of a spoiled child, the body of an adult, while his curiosity, ignored by ignorance (His knowledge is very limited), probably, was the inspiration for Gene Roddenberry, when he came up with the character Q for the next generation of the pilot, about two decades after the episode aired. <br /> <br /> In short, the key to evaluating the Squire of Gothos is this: “stupid” doesn't necessarily mean “bad.”
