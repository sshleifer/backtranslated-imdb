The first full-length adventure of Jim Henson's beloved fool characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle, as Kermit the Frog leaves his carefree, swampy setting for bright lights (eg abandoned by Hollywood agent House DeLuis who overheard his singing); On the way, he meets Fozzy the Bear (a pitiful comedian at El Sleazo Cafe James Coburn, in which Telly Savalas plays the bouncer, and Madeline Kahn plays as the patron!), Rowlf, animal animal drummer and his quiet drummer play the piano. the back, the funk band, the selfish beauty queen Miss Piggy (at a ceremony chaired by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc. During all this time Kermit and his colleagues have been pursuing burger magnate Charles Durling and reluctant assistant Austin Pendleton selling cars, Ice cream and balloons to, respectively, Milton Berl, Bob Hope and Richard Pryor served the food of arrogant waiter Steve Martin, who was almost brainwashed by the crazy German scientist Mel Brooks and finally landed to listen to an Internet tycoon movie Orson Welles (who has Cloris Leachman for the Secretary)! A nice song from the song of Paul Williams, who also acts as a resident pianist at El Sleazo. For reference, I recently acquired four of the subsequent Muppet films and had to watch them in the coming weeks when their turn came.
