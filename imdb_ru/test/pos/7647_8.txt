This surprised me. <br /> <br /> I read several reviews in advance that called him a good B film and was prepared for the worst. Halfway through this, I suddenly realized that I was completely immersed in it and enjoyed it very much. There were some really tense moments when you sat forward, nervously fiddling with the remote control or any other object within reach. In general, this film definitely does not deserve a B-grade rating. <br /> <br /> We must pay tribute to director Gary Ellis and writers Bill Boatman and Todd King for their film debut. I hope these guys will continue with big budgets and some studio support.
