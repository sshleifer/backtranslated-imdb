This little film brings back a lot of memories, both pleasant and dirty, about what can and does happen when you are a working musician. Not very pleasant accommodation for the group, the leadership of the venue, bouncing, telling you what to play, full applause .............. This is far from a farce, this is actually very precise as depicted musicians, professional and others, who have traveled a long distance to hold a season of concerts on the spot. There are moments when everything is going fine, there are other moments when you immediately start to miss your partner and wonder what the hell you're doing so far from home. In the end, you have to make the most of it, because there is no other way out.
