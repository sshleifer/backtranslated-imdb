You understood correctly! Bobby was Mike's imaginary friend throughout the film, even at the very beginning, when he was heading for California. His mother knew about Bobby and did not stop Mike from leaning on Bobby because imaginary friends often meet with small children. <br /> <br /> That's why they both have a stomachache at the same time. That's why the boys were so close. <br /> <br /> In the end, Mike let Bobby go. "King" was arrested. Mike could go on without Bobby. For the same reason, Mike's mother did not seem alarmed when Mike received a postcard (Mike wrote and mailed) from Bobbyâ€™s tourist stop in the West and other postcards from around the world. You noticed that Mike's mother turned the first card over and looked at the postage stamp. What a wonderful mother did everything she could in the late sixties. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 for me. Brought back memories ...
