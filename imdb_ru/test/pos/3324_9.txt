I feel very strongly that this film was like Waiting to Exhale with white women in the 1950s. As in Expectation of the Exhalation, all the female characters mingled with men who were married or useless. The only difference, besides the obvious, was that there was not much humor in this film. I would even say that it was tragic. Only one of the male characters seemed kind and sincere (Nadezhda Lange's boyfriend), but even then there was a conflict in this relationship. <br /> <br /> The story was about three young women who lived in the same apartment and had hopes and dreams of success. Unfortunately for them, the romance did not seem easy, although they were young, intelligent and attractive. This film could have been called tearful, with the saddest part involving the character Suzy Parker, whose obsession with the former boyfriend leads to tragedy. <br /> <br /> This is a must see.
