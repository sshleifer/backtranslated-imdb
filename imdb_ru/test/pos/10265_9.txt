He could not come from another country or from another time. This film simply combines psychedelia under the influence of the late 60s of Italian cinema. So pseudo serious and sexually free. Luxurious settings and dreamy music make it a visual and auditory pleasure. Plus we get the beautiful Dagmar Lassander, of course, she is very good looking. A bizarre movement makes for a wild trip, and if the noise in the middle of Mimosa seems to be too long by the end, this is another rather charming feature of time. You probably expected these few minutes to separate the screen and your girlfriend, and this, of course, foreshadows a turnaround. Perhaps it would be better if Philip Leroy did not look so strange with his wearing red hair and a distorted expression on his face. Although he is doing well, he has many silent moments when Dagmar jumps, and he has to demonstrate a mixture of love and hate. This is no ordinary narrative film, but for those who love something else, this is certainly true.
