This is a great B-movie horror movie that borders on horror and comedy. This is a genetically mutilated scorpion in space. Could this be more unreal? This is a hybrid between "Alien" and "Chainsaw Massacre." The film was shot in Stockholm with a mixed mix of Americans and Swedes, who interact beautifully with each other. Director Martin Munt does an excellent job finding comic moments in this script and gets some good laughter from the audience. The film was shot with little or no money, and itâ€™s very interesting to see what can be done with limited resources. Stinger possesses all the qualities of a B-movie horror movie. It's funny and scary at the same time, and the actors and the team are committed to their work. It's nice to see that such films can still be made! I would recommend to watch it if you like movies of this type.
