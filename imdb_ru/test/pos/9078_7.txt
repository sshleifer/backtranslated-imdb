Hollywood is one of the best and most beautiful things that have happened in my life. I admire and admire how Hollywood generates ideas and implements them. It makes me think about the size of the human brain. I saw the Flatliners a long time ago, but the story, the direction, the cast and all the action are still fresh in my memory. The story begins with the fact that our lead actor Sutherland was saying, at sunrise, what a beautiful day to die. For all of us, this is a story that shows emotions that are sometimes hidden in our mind throughout our lives. Never able to understand a few things in life. This shows us the motivation and improvement of our quality of life. In any case, I offer this to everyone who watches it once.
