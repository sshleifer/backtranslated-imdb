Something that I think some people overlook is big science fiction, is that it predicts some part of the future. No other theatrical film that I can remember, did not predict that when the space shuttle would go to study Halley's comet, a catastrophe would occur! Some differences were that Churchill (the shuttle in the film) actually went to the comet, the Challenger was only in low-Earth orbit; Churchill just burned inside, and the Challenger exploded - hey, the vampires should have returned to the ground. One big similarity (and it’s always a failure!) Both had mixed male / female carriages - the legend of Halley’s comet and the catastrophe continues! <br /> <br /> Besides this, you can’t say a lot about this film, which hasn’t been said before. In a separate film about space, science fiction, horror films and sex, he did not give anything truly new, but, like in all the magnificent dishes, it is the combination that matters. And put together, it was a very original and satisfying combination. <br /> <br /> I just want Matilda May to drain her victims through another part of her body!
