When I heard that there was to be an ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corporation] mini-series based on living in the Changi [World War II] camp ... with an emphasis on “comedy elements”, I was skeptical and somewhat critical. /> <br /> My father served in World War II. Such was the barbarism of the Japanese, he could talk about the horrors in Labuan and its surroundings (where he was) until very recently. Together with my father, I was honored to know many great people (with a stronger character and spirit than I ever will), who witnessed acts of unspeakable barbarism on the part of the Japanese Empire and never recovered completely. The Name "Changi" intended to evoke horrific images for many centuries ... <br /> <br /> But after watching, I was very impressed with the actors, characters, and the complex plot lines of this wonderful series. , Now I see Changi as the highlight of my week (keep in mind that I only watched three episodes ... I hope that the rest of the episodes meet the standards set by the first three). <br /> Black humor works extraordinarily well (however, the jokes with flatulence are a bit exaggerated), and although much of the horror was suppressed, the series is pretty close to conveying the fearless spirit of the survivors who could continue with their lives, despite fleeting memories. <br /> <br /> Some of them will find it difficult to keep track of the “memory” format, <br /> <br /> but I can’t think of a better way to pay tribute to men who have suffered deep emotional scars while continuing to intern. when painful repressed feelings come to mind, sometimes years after the horror. <br /> <br /> One of the darkest chapters of the Second World War, the 20th century, and, (I would say so far), in the history of mankind is transferred to a new one in this series, and I hope that it will serve as a retransmission irresistible misfortune generated by the wartime generation. <br /> <br /> Continuing “Changi”, I don’t think that I will ever be able to hear the sharp melody “On the way to Gundagai” again in the same way.
