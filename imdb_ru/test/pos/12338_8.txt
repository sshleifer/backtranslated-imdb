Since Jason and his friends have taken possession of horror films around 1980, most horror films have involved groups of hormonal teenagers torn to pieces who are focused on shredding rather than waiting. <br /> <br /> This little movie is different. Made in the early 80s, he does what every good horror movie has to do — bring your worst fears to life as you sit around, knowing that these horrors are not far off. Then you make these terrors boil, just don’t turn it into a biology lesson class. <br /> <br /> The story tells Meg Tilly right before she got a brief twist with fame beginning with “Big Cold” and then returned to obscurity in the early 90s. Meg plays an outcast teenager who just dies to get the good graces of the classic mean girls. They tell her that she can be part of their small group if she spends the night in the crypt. The mean girls want to scare her and make her leave the crypt, which gives them a double reward - torments the exile even more and gives her a reason from jump. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the famous occultist Karl Ramarevich died a strange death shortly after he claimed that he had found a way to return from the grave and on his return to command great magical powers. At first, his daughter does not believe in it, but she listens to a tape about her father's experiments, which included his successful animation of little dead animals and his plans to come out of the grave with power to revive the big game and get further power from these animations. She also learns that she may have inherited the power of her father and may be the only person who can stop him if he truly resurrects from the dead. I think you know where this story is going, so I’ll stop here. Did I mention that the magician was buried in the same crypt in which the character Meg Tilly spends the night? <br /> <br /> I’ll mention that the commercial DVD containing this film looks somewhat humiliated compared to what you expect from a movie that was made quite recently. I saw it on TV in the mid-1980s, and I remember that it looked better than this. The problem is that the original negative of the film was never found, so the DVD had to be created from the printout. This means that it comes bundled with dirt and scratches. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking out for any horror fan. It was a film made independently, and an example of that unusual material that you could usually find on TV late at night, until the commercial turned this time interval into a vast wasteland around 1986. Only such a TCM film no longer broadcasts such a film.
