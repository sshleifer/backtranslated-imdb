I like this film because it has a good approach to Buddhism, for example, the way Buddhists use to take care of all kinds of sentient beings, combining some fancy and real situations; In some parts, the picture is very good and there are a lot of messages about freedom, like a hawk episode, always staying focused at any moment, even in difficult situations. These are also funny situations, like Swonk's birthday and, speaking of this, twice the awards of the academy her actions show us how people who used to live in such a culture try to behave with resistance when Miyagi leads her to a Buddhist temple, and she slowly changes her mind. And, of course, Pat Morita was always gorgeous.
