The story takes place on the streets of SÃ£o Paulo in Brazil, where a boy named Pixot grows up alone without parents. Left worried and without direction, Pixot falls into child shelter with other teenagers from the street. Behind closed doors, terrible things happen in the collective and in the children's groups. And there is one last trigger that blows up the place, the last incident that makes Pixot and his friends get out and escape. From this moment on, the journey begins, overflowing with strong friendships, broken friendships, love and hate, criminal activity and just relaxing on the beach telling things, something like us and you, sometimes me too. <br /> <br /> I think this film is perfect in many ways, because it affects you on many levels, it did it to me anyway. The document-like style used to depict Pixot and his entourage makes it more realistic, and actors who really are street children and live a similar life help humanity in such circumstances seem more natural. It also has a social commentary on child abuse, but I think the film is so good that it puts pressure on the story, not on political views. The last scene, which I think is the best part of the film, gives me the impression of something beyond what I have seen before. So full of emotion and yet so unsentimental makes this film a truthful, believable, unbearable, unforgettable story. A true heartbreaking masterpiece that is so underestimated! <br /> <br /> My vote: 10/10
