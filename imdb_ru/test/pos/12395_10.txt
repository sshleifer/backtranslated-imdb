At first I rated this movie 10/10. For me, it's just one of the best I've ever seen since my birth (I'm 23 years old, but I've seen a lot of movies). History is cruel, but reality is not? It went deep into me and shook my guts. I saw it about 5 or 6 years ago, and it still shakes me - and I still remember it! <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is no “national preference” (this expression is a direct translation from French) for this film. I mean, this is not true, because this is a French film, which I highly appreciated: he really caught me when I saw it. In addition, I don’t know Marcel Karn well, so I don’t know if he is his best film, but I know that he’s not the most famous: Hotel du Nord, Quai des Brumes and Les Enfants du Paradis is the most famous. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film was shot in black and white, but it tells about the current problems of young people (not blackheads), such as love, friends and study. It can even be frame by frame with real young actors, Dolby sound (tm) and special effects (car accident), it will still be a great movie! <br /> <br /> Problem: Maybe this is a film that young people will see (from 16 to 25 years old) - and, of course, higher - so that its meaning is clear ... I said that it was a great movie ?
