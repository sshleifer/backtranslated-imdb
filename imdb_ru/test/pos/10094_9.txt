For most of us, life is an unfolding process of love. However, for others, such as Su-mi, in the power of darkness and fear. Based on Korean folk tale Dzhangha and Khongryun, Kim Ji Woon's brilliant Gothic horror story “The Tale of Two Sisters” revolves around two sisters Su-mi (Lim Su-jeon) and Su-yen (Mun Jong Yong) who live together in a creepy Victorian mansion. Feeling alienated from the world, they cling to each other for survival, and older Soo-mi obsessively protect younger Su-yons from danger. For Soo-mi, however, not reconciling with the circumstances connected with the death of her mother means mental illness and mind, contrary to reality. <br /> <br /> Although we can recognize such major products as haunted houses with ghostly observations, Doors that open and close by themselves are a cruel and domineering stepmother and other events of high oddity. In the "Tale of the Two Sisters" great psychological values ​​are revealed, including the inability to let go of the inner demons and the inappropriate desire for revenge. Soo-mi says: “Do you know what's really scary? You want to forget something. Completely wipe it crazy. But you can never. It can't go away, you see. And ... and it follows you like a ghost. "There is a timeline, but the viewer can only figure it out. The plot cannot be generalized, only offered, and the film makes us think, objectively or subjectively, what is happening on the screen. < br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, Soo-mi, a clearly worried young woman, was interrogated by a doctor in an environment similar to a mental hospital. When the doctor asks her to describe what happened “that day,” the film breaks out when Soo-mi and Su-Yong return to the home of their father, Mu-hyun (Kim Kap-su) and stepmother Yun-chju (Hume). Jung-ah. The stepmother is hostile and offended, and the father is passive and distant, but it is obvious that Su-mi really hurts. As the girls try to adapt, they are constantly frightened by the presence in the house, which may be nightmares or supernatural phenomena. Soo-mi sees a figure at the foot of her bed hanging over her and oozing black blood, a dinner scene in which the guest apparently sees a ghost hiding under the sink and goes into convulsions, a monster appears between the legs of one of the sisters, people mysteriously disappear from the photos and many e other manic schizophrenic devices to keep the viewer on the verge of madness. Despite the fact that we feel that most of the story is a projection of someone's mind, we do not know whose film constantly challenges us, at least until an important prompt is offered in the second half of the film. Filmed in gorgeous cinematography in low light, The Tale of Two Sisters has a unique elegance and other worldly beauty that goes beyond all panic, and there are plenty of them. He pursues in several senses of the word, and his images can look at you when you least expect it or want it. While the film may not offer the weary traveler much in the path of light, it shows us where we can end up if we choose darkness. According to the wise observer: “Guilt is never the answer - whether it blames himself or others. Rather, the answer lies in the complete rejection of judgment - both about oneself and about others. Forgiveness and understanding have great healing power. ” "
