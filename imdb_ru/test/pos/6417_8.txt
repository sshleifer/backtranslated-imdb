The tracks, of course, are not your average mileage of the Giallo mill, and this is not bad. Unlike his previous work, the film “The Fifth Cord” (which was your “classic” Djallo), the film Luigi Bazzoni leaves almost all Djallo trademarks, not murder; The focus is on psychological secrecy. From the very beginning it is obvious that this will be a completely strange film, since the film opens with a scene on the moon. After this, things don't clear up, since the lunar sequence turns out to be Alice’s dream of a worried woman. Alisa is tormented by dreams about an astronaut stuck on the Moon, who apparently appeared after watching a movie called “Footprints on the Moon”. After something goes wrong, Alice decides to go to a deserted tourist destination called Garma. Upon arrival, she is surprised because the people she meets seem to already know her. Alice also meets a young red-haired girl who seems to know her already; the girl tells Alice that she looks just like Nicole, except for better and with shorter hair ... <br /> <br /> The fact that Footprints doesn’t talk so much about sex, murder and other things Giallo's trademarks speak a little about this in the backseat with its main audience from the very beginning, since most people going to this film will not get what they expected (or might have wanted). But on the other hand, Footprints respects the fact that it does not simply follow from what came before it. By 1975, Giallo began to lose its popularity, and many of the films that came out during this period (with a few very noticeable exceptions) were just repetitions of what it was before, therefore Luigi Buzzoni would have risked a great chance in this film. Florinda Bolkan gives a strong role in the lead role; and the fact that she is not the most beautiful heroine of Jallo is not really important. The mystery develops beautifully everywhere, and although it can sometimes become a little painful; Traces, generally speaking, are intriguing for a while. Probably, it will not surprise many people that the ending has no special meaning and does not clarify anything; but it nicely adds to the strange cult value of the film, and in general; I give footprints thumbs up!
