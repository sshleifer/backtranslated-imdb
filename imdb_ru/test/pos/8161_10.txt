Without a doubt, the most impressive recent gay film I've ever seen. C. Jay Cox hit a nail on the head with this. The way he dealt with issues of faith, family, and sexuality was very well done. Casting was perfect. Wes Ramsey did a fantastic job of removing Christian character, and Steve Sandvoss will knock out your socks in the role of Aaron. Both brought unbelievable realism to the roles and influence of these problems on young gays. For a gay man who grew up in a very religious environment (although not in a Mormon one), identification with Aaronâ€™s character was phenomenal for me. We strongly recommend this film to everyone, true or not, who cares how young gay men have to deal with family and friends in an often unfriendly world. By the way, the music in this movie is awesome! Another great job is K.J. Cox.
