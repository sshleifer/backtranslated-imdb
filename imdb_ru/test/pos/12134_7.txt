Has anyone ever read or heard Scorsese or David Chase's comments (executive producer of the Sopranos) about Death Collector / Family Enforcer? I bought a DVD after having not seen it for some time on cable (for example, 20 years), but I saw “Goodfellas” and the whole “Sopranos”, launched today. Looking back, both guys should have seen the Death Collector / Family Enforcer and absorbed the scent, perhaps inspiring the tone of their masterpieces, both of which are the opposite of the Godfather romantic trilogy. Being a Jersey guy, it’s interesting to see how Jersey grasslands have developed since the mid-1970s. This is not a swamped landfill, although earlier from time to time the body found itself on the local waterway. It is also a little sad to see the newly built World Trade Center across the river at the opening and closing of the scene. Who could imagine?
