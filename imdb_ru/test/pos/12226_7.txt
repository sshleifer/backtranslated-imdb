This is one of the best science fiction series. This includes character development, some really tense moments, and rational episode scenarios. As another commentator said, it looked like it was a mini-series, not a full-length series with episodes of filler and a low budget. <br /> <br /> The problem with the show, which in short is a series of Godzilla This is that it started too big, with incredible monsters, fantastic science, and then it all came down to what the local Americans did something. Then the show ended too soon, as the Olympics were coming and hey! A sci-fi show is a sci-fi show, but half-naked athletic people running around aimlessly are much more important. Thus, they made only 15 episodes instead of the expected 22. The audience was also small, as people really did not understand it at 8:00 pm. In the end, the costumes made it. Trust the marketing plan to destroy everything that looks original and promising. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: you have a show with good special effects, for example, huge monsters that kill people or destroy boats, then switch to genetic engineering, transformation people, human clones, the end of the world, tsunami. In addition, the only fillers are scenes with aggressive cattle or other annoying people who are killed for their stupidity. The disadvantage is that after 15 episodes that prepare something huge, the show ends. There is no real end, no closure, just the bitter taste of the tissue in your mouth, as if you had just swallowed a piece of costume.
