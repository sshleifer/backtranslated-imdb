When you read about this movie, you want to cringe. I have seen it countless times, and yet I cringe! So what attracts here? I think that for me this is an extraordinary romance. I find it very refreshing to have a strange connection between this browser, similar to Jimmy Breslin from New York, and the ballerina “out of luck” (with health) You are confused by Paul Sorvino because of his flimsy approach to courting this woman. Like a guy in a bar who can't take a hint. He is a bit overweight (at least as a potential groom for a ballerina. I hope this does not sound hostile) and, perhaps, a little older. A good change of pace from the Greek god who cares for the super model. Bill Conti's account was stuck in my head all these years later, which is a pretty good sign. However, some actions are terrible. The subplot involving a young Puerto Rican boy who made friends with the character of Sorvino is ridiculously bad. But the first scene, in which Ditchburn warms up to Carol King, involves you directly in this story. Good luck in finding. You might think that Lifetime will broadcast it or even WE, but I have not seen it for several years.
