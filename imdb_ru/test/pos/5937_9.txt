I enjoyed both Van Dykes for many years and was glad to see them again. <br /> <br /> It is also cute and funny, and easy to watch and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Dick was good when he was younger, but I enjoyed him more when he got older. <br /> <br /> Son Berry was a great student to follow in the footsteps of his fathers. <br /> <br /> Together they make an excellent team and work well together. <br /> <br /> I’m disappointed that I didn’t find another 101 kill anywhere. <br /> <br /> I have seen both of the examples shown. I hope for more, because this is a really nice duet to watch. <br /> <br /> It is safe to say that Berry follows in his father’s footsteps, they speak the same way and have the same manners. <br /> <br /> It would be nice everything that they do separately. <br /> <br /> Be sure to see what they are doing alone and together.
