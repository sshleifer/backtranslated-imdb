The excellent debut film for the director Batman Begins, the film "Next", about a man who follows other people for the inspiration of the characters in the stories he writes. In the one person he follows, he decides to go further, and this person turns out to be more than he expected. <br /> <br /> Using non-actors and my uncle actors, I am writing a director's production, but otherwise I completely create the film by itself, almost without a budget and produced independently, this film is much more than you expect. <br /> <br /> For anyone who loves Memento and difficult turns, turns, strikes and fiddling with time, this is definitely a movie for you.
