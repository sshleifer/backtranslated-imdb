People talk about how horrible the script was and how terrible the animation was, but Rainbow Brite and Star Stealer are really Japanese anime for children. If you look at anime today, it is made in the same style, and it is very popular. I don't think this movie was ever meant to be viewed by adults. Just as I don't think it was ever intended to be serious. What people hate in this film is what I love. Rainbow Brite - one of the best cartoon characters ever created in my opinion. She's smart. She's funny. She cares about the environment. She takes care of her friends. This film has a lot to teach young children. My younger brothers even liked this movie. I have to say that this film taught me a lot when I was a kid. When he came out on DVD, I was first in line to buy it. This is a great kids movie. So if it’s not perfect, there’s really nothing perfect if you look at it carefully enough.
