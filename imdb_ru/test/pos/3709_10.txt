William Faulkner was one of the American writers who won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Faulkner mainly wrote about life in the South, especially during the years of depression. Many of his stories have been adapted to the screen. Stories like “Two Soldiers” are a cute tale about two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Older brother Pete Greer goes to Memphis, Tennessee to attract hundreds of thousands of young people, some of whom will never return home. His younger brother does not take his care well. He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without money to find his brother. He suddenly becomes a soldier of a different kind, as he wants to enter the service also at 10 years old. Ron Perlman makes an amazing performance as a military leader who manages to take care and get involved with the boy. This short film won an Oscar for best short film action movie, which is deserved. If he was longer, he could compete with longer films. Everything else, like costumes, artistic guidance and the re-creation of the American era in 1941, is perfect. The film also features a heartbreaking war at home, since most Americans have experienced a great depression. Actors and actresses are not known, but they make first-class performances. If Hollywood would make more quality films, I would probably go to the cinema more. If there were more quality shows on Broadway, I would go to the theater more.
