This is typical for people who complain about something when they have nothing about it ... So we are talking about gays who are in love with natural women. First ... This is a true story, so you cannot say that it is implausible. Secondly, it is written by gay, so everything that happens to gays is just silly. Personally, I think it was the best love story I have ever seen. And I am very gay. I think it shows that true love is a person, not just looks and sex. And it has nothing against who is gay, straight or bi unlike many other shows. Maybe we in Europe treat this more, because most TV shows are a little deeper and make you think more than American television ... Plus, we are not afraid to show certain things. <br /> <br /> You want something funny with one of the best in England (Leslie Sharp) and you want to see a decent believable love story without extra juice, this is for you. I know i love it
