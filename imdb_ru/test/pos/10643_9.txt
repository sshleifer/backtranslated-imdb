After reading the biography of the last Russian tsar (Nicholas II) and his inability to enlist the support of the army, I decided to try this film. <br /> <br /> I watched him completely unbiased, and not knowing anything about it (except for his reputation). <br /> <br /> This is what impressed me the most. <br /> <br /> 1) Pictures of battleships, and soldiers were used as supplements. I thought more than once: “If this were done at this time and in this place, 80% of this would be generated by a computer.” <br /> <br /> 2) Realism in this. From the film infected by the larva, to the shot of the sailor with his candle and the legend “Killed for a bowl of soup”, this film does not make concessions to the PC (which, fortunately, has not yet been invented). br /> <br /> 3) Slow immersion into the madness of the sequence of Odessa steps. From the first shot, when a homeless person appears, you realize that something may be wrong; since all the pictures are compiled, you will eventually feel comfortable in your surroundings. Then an amputee appears, and people begin to fall in dramatic poses. However, frames are being compiled ... until the Cossacks appear in the scene, and incredible matching shots appear. This scene is easily worth accepting. <br /> <br /> 4) The fact that this film is 100% propaganda. On the other hand, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan, he also had something to do with “propaganda”; just a different look. <br /> <br /> In general: the film is overshadowed by a slow narration. Nevertheless, Metropolis, Dr. Caligari's Cabinet and this film are excellent examples of ingenious, sharp films that are still remembered for their true worth. They really make modern films look boring and repetitive.
