I was surprised that I liked this movie. But it reminded me of the 2004 version of the first Friday of the 13th. There were a lot of silly elements, but at the same time there were a lot of cool ones. The storyline was good - predictable if you saw more than one or two horror films, but filled with one-liners, to make it worth it. There are several memorable scenes worth seeing. Several of the problems that I had with the plot were related to the continuity of the characters. For example, in the initial scene, the stuffed animals (who were people on the stakes, whose blood was exhausted to grow the crop) looked very real, but later in the film they looked more like fake stuffed animals in blue masks. The plot had a few spaces, and the game was mediocre, but at least it sounded like real people, unlike Hollywood films, where the dialogue really sounds fake when you think about it. The culmination of the last scene, when the main character says: “I’m not a baker, I’m Connell!” And throws a stuffed head in response, that his friends were mostly killed by these creatures at that moment.
