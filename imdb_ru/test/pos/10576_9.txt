I am usually disappointed by what the media today calls "lesbian" films: suicidal bisexuals; lesbian psychotic killers; women who experiment with other women, but end up with men; ridiculously beautiful women who make each other start men and so on. <br /> <br /> FINGERSMITH is fortunately on a very high pedestal above this garbage. This is a believable love story, which REALLY acted every cast, up to the most minor actors. In addition to the very attractive central conflict, the romance between the heroines is well developed and believable thanks to Cassidy and Hawkins. <br /> <br /> I also saw the TROUSERS TIP, but FINGERSMIT far surpasses the former, both in character development / conflict, and as an actor's skill. <br /> <br /> FINGERSMITH is pleasant and pleasant to watch, offering lesbians everywhere a great sequel for BOUND.
