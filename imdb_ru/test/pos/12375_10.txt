One of the best silent dramas I've ever seen. German expressionists created the same dark and dark things, but with performances that were rather restrained and naturalistic for the day. No camera loot and unintentional laughter due to wild eyes waving their arms. Sjostrom convincingly showed himself as drunk, mean and frightening David Hill. <br /> <br /> Shot mostly at night in a dirty Swedish slum, the film had a very claustrophobic sense of affection for the plot. low-key lighting and widespread use of the iris. <br /> <br /> The narrative had a deep and typically Scandinavian feeling of despair and hopelessness: the film begins in a rather dark light, and then we told the story of David Holm in a series of memories (and memories in memories - a rather complex structure of history for 1921 ), where his character is offered numerous chances for redemption, but he does not use them, and we know that he will not do this, because we have seen him die as drunk and miserable and angry, as always in the present. The penultimate scene is as gloomy as everything I've seen in all cinemas. <br /> <br /> Writing and directing are difficult and intelligent, even by modern standards. In several cases, Sjostrom skillfully sets up an audience to suspect one thing, and then pulls out a surprise. For some viewers, the final may not be so unexpected, but I did not expect it to be released. <br /> <br /> This film deserves complete restoration and release on DVD. Or even a crappy budget release. You just need to be there so people can see and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10, which rounds to 10/10
