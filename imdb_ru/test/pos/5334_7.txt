In the first feature film with characters Aardman, Wallace and Gromit managed to reproduce elements of all the previous half-hour shows that were broadcast on television. <br /> <br /> Wallace runs a company that humanely captures fraudulent rabbits from people. gardens, and he has a brilliant idea to test his invention on the unfortunate rabbits, as soon as they are caught. Of course, as in the other films about Wallace and Gromit, it’s not quite the way it was planned. <br /> <br /> As in the case of "Shaving in the face", Wallace has a love interest, in this case the village lady Posh, and a big, mean villain with a bull dog. Gromit is perfectly animated with a wide range of expressions, making the character laugh out loud funny. And, of course, Peter Sallis provides Wallace's voice again and fits perfectly. <br /> <br /> As in the movie “The Great Day”, as the film progresses, “cheese” has a very strong effect on the comedy effect. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, this film is a little on the long side. There are great effects and some fragments that make you sit and look, but perhaps this story would work better as another short story than pushing it to its full length.
