I watched this movie today on LOGO TV. I was absolutely fascinated by the powerful messages and storyline in this film. I don't want to mess this up. I will say this, I treated the internal struggle of Aaron and his upbringing. Being a gay who grew up in a small town, I was so good at “big secret” and the decisions I made. This film has had a HUGE impact on me, and I plan to buy a copy of it in the very near future for my personal library. I just finished the movie and started calling my friends to recommend it. It had such a profound effect on me. For those who read this comment. Watch this. Try to get distracted as little as possible. Also, keep yourself open. This is not a movie that can be watched as a Disney movie or movie of the week. Instead, take the time to watch and actively listen to the dialogues, as well as read between the lines and participate in the plot. You may be in tears. Since the "Steel Magnolias" have not been shocked by the film. This one did exactly that. Thanks to actors, screenwriter and film crew for creating an emotionally charged romantic film about homosexuality and religion. It was long overdue.
