I just fell in love with “Life in a big way” when I first saw it! The reason # 1 is that I LOVE, LOVE, and I AM A HUGE GENE KELLY fan. He was such a wonderful dancer, actor and choreographer. Not to mention his extremely beautiful appearance and his sensual personality. I like his role in this film. He was such a gentleman. This film demonstrated his remarkable acting talent. I also liked Marie Macdonald. It was my first time when I saw or found out about her, and this wonderful film made me a fan of her. In fact, the entire cast in this film was pleasant and gorgeous. Humor between the butler, "Everett Hannover Smith," and his father, Mr. Morgan; Humor Mrs. Morgan in the courtroom, and especially the grandmother Morgan’s direct attachment to LEO GOGARTY and her concern for her. And the GENE number "FIDO AND ME" is amazing. The first dance number with GENE and MARIE is also very good. I would recommend everyone to watch this movie. He will truly remain dear to your heart forever. Or at least it's mine. And you will fall in love with GENE again. I rate this as my favorite number 2 KELLY CINEMA GENES, and I have seen and have quite a few of his films. They are part of my daily life! So believe me when I tell you, you will love this movie! Watch it and enjoy it !!
