Despite the ideas of the reviewers, I liked this movie. In fact, I liked more than the Interview with the Vampire, and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise’s attempt. All the main players in the series attended: Talbot, Lestat, Armand, Maharet, Hyman, Pandora, Mael, Marius, and another half a dozen (although most of them are in cameo). Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main players (and Jesse from Talamask). In addition, in spite of other reviews, I think that this film and music were true to the image and ideal of Anna Rice, at least as I perceive it. Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places irresistible (her first entry and mini-dance scene). The film did not cover the entire series of books, but I thought it was a good addition. <br /> <br /> I’m a big fan of this show, mainly due to Ann Rice’s style, sensitivity and abilities. And I found this film a true and often excellent presentation of the author's vision.
