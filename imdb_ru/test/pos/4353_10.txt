The questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in this masterfully processed historical documentary. The shift of beauty and the horror of one person walking through life is revealed in the aggregate. Dieter and Herzog are united and connected through a mental labyrinth, which was transformed into a single straight corridor, the walls of which were plastered with images created by one person, characterizing himself with the vibrations of his own vocal cords. This film, within 80 minutes, opened up a new dimension of storytelling. What I call this, apparently, a new meaning. In the end, only God knows, isn't the MIRACLE something that God does for us, but decides to stay ANONYMOUS? <br /> <br /> This is a requirement to see. If you want to experience the wonderful horror of war, this documentary will cleanse your soul to the bone.
