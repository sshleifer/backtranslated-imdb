The wind and the lion - an amazing, wide film. This is a monument to what was once the film industry, but no more. <br /> <br /> Connery, despite the thick Scottish scandal, Rysulu plays very well. He inspires the viewer in a way that many leading characters cannot. <br /> <br /> Candace Bergen in one of her early roles is amazing, as the kidnapped socialite Mrs. Pedacaris, showing courage in the face of the adversity of humor, too). An amazing film, rent it or buy it, and you will not be disappointed.
