(Contains spoilers) <br /> <br /> Russia in the 13th century. The first image shows the relics of the last invasion: the molding form, human skulls and the horse's skeleton. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) drove the Swedish army and made such an impression on the Mongolian ruler that he proposes to raise it to the rank of captain. But Nevsky replies: "Die in your homeland, but do not leave it." He intends to fish, build ships and trade. But he warns of a more dangerous enemy: closer, meaner, and no way to buy yourself: Germany. Their goal is Novgorod. They have already reached Pskov: mothers and daughters suffer for their fathers and sons. The marauding occupying forces distribute loot. Rich merchants want to buy their freedom (always a place for some anti-capitalist R.), but “ordinary people” are ready to fight. They want Alexander to be their leader. Pskov burned to the ground. The Teutonic knights feel invincible and simply smugly smile at the Russian women, who helplessly watch their fathers and sons being killed. Babies are thrown into the fire, and high-ranking church officials watch and remain idle. In Novgorod: Olga Danilovna has two fans: the rich and balanced Gavrilo and the tall and cheerful Vasily. She promises to marry the most valiant. Vasily calls Alexander Nevsky to Pereyaslav. The prince decides not to wait for the attack, but to strike right away. Even women wear chain mail ... Invaders want to lure the "Russian bear", but Nevsky’s trick stands the test: Lake Peipsi is his war zone: his people know the territory, but the Germans who are harder will break through the ice ... <br /> <br /> Open your eyes and see the most impressive battle scenes ever filmed. This is not just a lot of extras (which, I think, were pressed in this patriotic exercise), but Eisenstein’s masterful management of such a large number of people: he moves divisions like pieces on a chessboard, and almost every shot resembles the composition of a picture by Rembrandt or Rubens in fantastic outfits). Russia in the winter looks scary in itself, but Eisenstein’s visual imagination is unrivaled. Heaps of corpses are immersed in cosmic light under the infinite horizon. At nightfall, Olga and other women are looking for survivors with torches. A devotee falcon sits on his master's dead body, while the crow waits for the right moment to select the eyes of the deceased. Eisenstein’s direction and Prokofiev’s assessment make ALEXANDER NEVSKY a Rolls-Royce among propaganda films. Nevsky, of course, is Stalin's alter ego, and the Russians are tall, handsome, heroic, and they have the perfect hairstyle. The Germans are bearded savages and look like members of the Ku Klux Klan. The actor playing Basil gives a performance of one person with four characters: first hesitant, then heroic, youthful lover and comic relief. Cherkasov’s main duty is to look heroic. At the end, Nevsky-Stalin shows his generosity: he forgives the “little soldiers” and changes the knights for soap. Only the bearded killer and the treacherous cleric are handed over to the mafia. He does not forget the last warning: he who comes with the sword will die by the sword ... He kept his promise. 10/10
