I have to tell you that I have been a Star Trek TNG fan since my childhood. <br /> <br /> Well, some time ago I gave my friend a few DS9 episodes and asked him <br /> <br /> "Hey, man, what are you watching lately, because I finished watching all the episodes TNG, "he said. "Well, I got these episodes of Farscape." I said, "OK, let me try." At that time, I was pretty sure that I wouldn’t like it, because I had just finished watching TNG and found it great. ” <br /> <br /> I had 3 episodes watched. Those, apart from the show, did not impress me very much, at first I found it childish, and I thought it was just another TV show, good adventures, but regular. The music was slightly different, neat special effects, although I had a vague impression that the actors did not fully penetrate the skin of the characters. <br /> <br /> I watched 3 more episodes, thinking that 3 eps was not enough to decide whether I like it or not. Then the show started to understand me, I got a good understanding of the action and wanted to see what happened next to poor Krayton .... the rest is history. <br /> <br /> I think what I like most about the freedom of the characters in the context of the action is in contrast to Star Trek, where everyone slept, when they had to do, and too much high-tech technology. <br /> <br /> The show got better with each episode, the Tori line is very interesting ..... what can I say, this film is like poetry. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend !!!
