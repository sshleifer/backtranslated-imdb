For me, The Late Chrysanthemums were interesting not only because it was my first Naruse film, which I liked completely, but also because it was technically as modern and innovative as his 30s works that I saw . This does not mean innovative editing in the sense in which Godd would have presented it with Breath in 1959, but rather the opposite. <br /> <br /> Editing was just as fluent as in the best Hollywood films of the 30s / 40s, but at the same time it is incredibly appropriate in terms of how he told his story. Unlike them, he never purposefully emphasized anything or tried to make himself “invisible”, but together with cinema he made me feel that I was traveling in a calm stream, constantly feeling the waves under me, like a gentle hand stroke or an almost imperceptible wiggle of the cradle . In this sense, the film was comparable to the work of Oz and Mizoguchi, but somehow even more subtle. <br /> <br /> What was so modern was that the installation seemed almost like a character, like a wonderful camera. work in Dreyer's Ordet (1954) or Vredens dag (1943), which reveals to us a deeper understanding of the film and its characters, and not just shows them to us. <br /> <br /> I feel that the editing and cinematography of Naruse is the most interesting aspects of his films, raising the significance of the stories beyond the obvious. Do not forget about the wonderful sets and settings! I believe that the story itself is rather arbitrary. <br /> <br /> The narrative and its characters were presented in a very interesting way, and I thought that in the first half of the film a delicately inventive range of emotions was created. and interconnections. Unfortunately, the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and formal compared to the setting (although in itself it would be ideal to fit into any other, less complex film). Somehow, I felt that he had failed a little in trying to dissolve the many layers he had woven. Perhaps he should have kept them intact. This criticism may seem a bit harsh for the viewer of this film, especially since this procedure again resembles how Ozu behaved with the plot in his films. Unfortunately, I do not yet have the feeling that Naruse could raise the story and her characters in the conclusions of his films in the same sublime way. The best efforts I have seen to date - Ukigumo (Floating Clouds / 1955) and Midaregumo (Scattered Clouds / 1967) - supported the energy that he built throughout the story, while providing sharp and resonant endings. <br /> <br /> This is already more than most filmmakers can do, and, in my opinion, this is the basis for real mastering the cinematic environment. In this regard, and given the resonance of the last two films that I saw, he may have already become one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have at the moment is when I am. I am going to see more of his films on the big screen.
