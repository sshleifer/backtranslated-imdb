Why at the end of the film there were no people of Sean Connery fighting the French instead of the Germans. Since the French occupied Algeria in 1830, tribes from Morocco and Algeria raided French military and civilian settlements. This film could be a continuation of that historical aspect, when the French seized Rasaudli so that his followers would not raid Algeria, and then his followers would attack the French in order to free him. <br /> <br /> The film is still stereotyped about the shootings between Germans and Americans. When Americans shoot at the Germans, their guns (even pistols) make loud noises, create big bloody bullet wounds, and their enemies shout after a shot. When the Germans shoot at the Americans, their guns do not make loud noises, do not create bloody wounds, and their enemies make weak sounds or do not hear them at all. <br /> <br /> In real life, the American Crag rifle, America was the worst rifle until the early M-16 version appeared. The burglar was difficult to maintain, unreliable, and the rifle bolt was always jammed. German Mauser was one of the best rifles in the world. We were so impressed during the Spanish-American war that we made a copy of it and called it the Springfield rifle. <br /> <br /> Finally, the people of Morocco should have a word for artillery, since the French used them in their raids against Morocco. I did not like it when Rasuldai felt stupid due to the fact that in the Moorish dictionary there is no word for artillery. Instead, Rasuadli said that the Europeans had guns on wheels that shook the ground.
