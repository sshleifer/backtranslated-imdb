Nevsky - one of the great epic war films. Of course, others, such as The Birth of a Nation and Napoleon, came earlier, but this one is no less influential. Acting is in stock, but anyone who knows about Eisenstein first knows that this was part of his theory of cinema. This film, unlike many of his dumb works, talks about the heroic man as well as about the group. This reflects Stalinist philosophy, which came to the fore by 1938. However, his film shows us the power that can be generated by people coming together to fight something that they consider evil. Nevsky is just one of many men. He is a prince, because he is the strongest, and not because he is somehow different from the rest. Romantic aspects of the film give more personal history than Eisenstein had previously allowed. Not all elements work, and the film is probably too long, but still resonates.
