Evil Professor Moriarty is preparing to take control of both Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon that can win the war for the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce return to the screen as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's beloved detective and girlfriend, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, in this entertaining little riddle. Universal Studios did not waste money either on bizarre production values ​​or on a rational scenario, knowing that its two stars would be all that the audience needed. In fact, Rathbone, like a brain ego, and Bruce, like a clumsy id, seem to become the heroes they create, and happily keep their faces straight while simultaneously participating in the most complete nonsense. <br /> <br /> Dennis Howie makes his first appearance as the pursued inspector of Lestrade Scotland Yard; Teaming up with Bruce, these two kind-hearted, but pedantic guys really can save the life of the intellectually superior Holmes twice. Lionel Atville, master of the sinister, who deserves greater recognition for his talent, copes well with the role of Moriarty, turning an evil scoundrel into an enemy worthy of Holmes, savoring scenes in which he can inflict torture and pain. /> <br /> William Post-Jr. and Kaaren Vern play a Swiss scientist and his girlfriend, who are in the center of the puzzle, but they are not given much to do. Sweet Mary Gordon appears in the role of landowner Holmes, Mrs. Hudson. <br /> <br /> Rathbone gives his already classic Holmes interpretation a threefold disguise, telling the viewer that the great detective at heart was a little boorish actor. <br /> <br /> This film, which is very poorly based on the elements of short stories by Sir Arthur “Dancing People” and “Empty House,” followed SHERLOCK HOLMES AND TERROR'S VOICE (1942) and was preceded by SHERLOCK HOLMES in WASHINGTON (1943) .
