"Doppleganger" (or "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun", as it is more commonly called) was written (with the participation of the late Donald James) and produced by Jerry and Sylvia Anderson, known for their television "Supermarionation" shows such as "Storm Birds" . <br /> <br /> The International Space Agency Eurosec discovers the existence of a mysterious planet on the other side of the Sun and offers to send a manned flight there. The committee will reject exorbitant costs and postpone the project. But when a security leak was discovered at the agency, fearing that the Russians might get there first, the project receives a green light. <br /> <br /> American astronaut Glenn Ross (Roy Tinnes) teamed up with British scientist John Caine (Ian Hendry). After several weeks of grueling workouts, the Phoenix takes off, heading for the unknown. <br /> <br /> Three weeks later, their ship falls into a gloomy mountain landscape. Ross survives, but Kane is seriously injured. The light moving towards them is visible ... <br /> <br /> I will leave a synopsis here. Up to this point, the film was exciting, with great special effects (Derek Meddings) and music by permanent composer Anderson Barry Gray (why it was not released on C. D. remains a mystery). But when Ross and Kane collapse and we discover the secret of the alien world - it is our own duplicate, everything is the same on it, the only major difference is that everything changes to the opposite - it becomes less interesting and ends with a crushing anti-menopause . I think that the movie was not the right place for this idea, in fact Jerry and Sylvia later did something similar to their show “Space: 1999”. Ross risks (and ultimately loses) his life, trying to return to Earth - to his Earth. But why? New Earth is so similar that with the same success he could not worry. <br /> <br /> Roy Tinnes recently starred in the television series "Invaders" and gives a decent performance (it is a pity that there were no such scenes where he was rowing with his wife). Ian Hendry is good at Kane, but disappears from history too soon. Several actors began to appear in the Anderson film "U.F.O." such as Ed Bishop and George Sewell. Blink and you'll miss Nicholas Courtney ("The Brigadier" from "Doctor Who" in a tiny role). But acting honors come to the late Patrick Weemark as Jason Webb, head of Eurosec. The character is not so far from the "Sir John Wilder", which he played in the "Power Game" AVV. Webb is such an insidious character, for which he looks amazing. The contribution of Herbert Loma (like a spy with a camera hidden in the false eye) is slightly more than a cameo. <br /> <br /> As I said, the special effects are amazing, as are the sets. So the movie is worth seeing, but don't expect much to happen when the action moves to the mirror planet. With a stronger scenario, this could be another “Planet of the Apes” or - dare I say it - “2001: a space odyssey.” <br /> <br /> In Anderson’s productions, he made the future look like a great place, an adventure playground where science was cool, all had fabulous cars whose doors opened vertically, sexy women and absolutely didn’t assume that something seriously wrong. Now we are in the future, and people still watch the Coronation Street every night. What a disappointment. If mirrored Earth really exists somewhere, you can hope that this is a better place than this. If all the women there look like Lynn Loring or Loni von Friedl, I will be on the next flight!
