The Box is one of the strangest films I've ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word with a picture: Imagine that during the past month you have been biting on pixies and paint fumes, watching only the repeated launches of the Twilight Zone. As a result of coma, you end up in the hospital, where the nurse seems to enjoy the adrenaline shot in the drip. The dream you dream of in a coma will be something like this movie. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: A man appears at the door of the pair. He gives them a box with a button on it. Press the button, they will receive a million dollars in cash, and a person they do not know will die. I will try not to spoil anything, but from there things turn into a plot that is so intertwined, complex and purely original that it makes you doubt your sanity. But hey, most of us have been sane for some time now, and change is good. <br /> <br /> BENEFITS: Awesome storyline, overall a good game, not a slow moment as soon as it starts. He asks questions of human morality, which are rarely, if ever, asked in popular culture. This film is deep, it has a meaning. This is not a summer fluff of blockbuster special effects (not that something is wrong with this); this film had a relatively low budget, and it was shown in some places. But I think that maybe this is what makes me love so much. <br /> <br /> Cons: the first twenty minutes before they begin, are really quite slow. At the end of the film you will be so embarrassed that you just have to sit down and think for a good half hour. I can guarantee that this film will not receive enthusiastic reviews from your colleagues or most critics; this is too strange and explosions do not occur every three seconds. In fact, there are no explosions in this film (except that your brain burst from trying to understand what the hell just happened). Personally, I do not think this is bad, but many will do it. <br /> <br /> RATING: easy 9/10. I have never had the experience of watching this movie. The only reason I can't give it a 10/10 is because itâ€™s too swamped. There are a few big things left unexplained at the end that still bother me when I sit here and write this. But in general, this is the best experience that I got in the cinema for a long time. But keep in mind that you will not like this film, if you can not sit back, turn on the suspension of disbelief to about 150% and prepare your brain for impressive acrobatics. <br /> <br /> Visit www. thestuffblag.com for more reviews
