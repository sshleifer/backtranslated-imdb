I really like this movie. Looking back, we can say that this nation was really at risk from the nations that attacked us or started a war, that is, the Japanese and Germans. Robert Cummings and Pritsilla Lane played well the main role. The cast ... Otto Krueger, Alan Baxter, Clem Bevins and Norman Lloyd were also outstanding. The direction, pace and finale have passed and continue to hold my interest. So much so that I bought my own copy. Thank God, for Turner Classic Movies, they show a lot of really classic films, including this one. <br /> <br /> Of course, Robert Cummings was not a light actor, although I’m a big fan of Gary Cooper Joel McCree, two of my favorite actors who were first offered the lead role, I don’t understand that they would lead to the role which would have surpassed the performance of Bob Cummings. <br /> <br /> This is a film that I like to watch repeatedly and encourage others to watch.
