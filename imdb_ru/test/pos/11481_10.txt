In America, a video entitled “Cartoon Scandals” was released, in which prohibited cartoons were shown for several hours. <br /> <br /> Most of them were from the Second World War era. This is where I first saw (and heard) about it. <br /> <br /> A rooster during a news broadcast turns into a vulture with an Asian face saying, “Fuck, please!”. After that, the eighth minute of propaganda is played out as a newsreel. <br /> <br /> Visco is racist, but if you look at it as part of a story, you can (and should) be forgiven. <Br /> <br /> Cutting cards for making sandwiches. <br /> <br /> Demonstration of the ruins of Rome when calling Mussolini "Ruins number 1". <br /> <br /> Minesweeper with a broom. /> <br /> Pilot bomb with a pilot who says: "GET ME HERE." <br /> <br /> And of course stereotypes. Each Japanese man was painted with big teeth, constantly bowing and saying “please” at the end of each broken sentence. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing? An air raid siren in which two bowing men hit each other with pins. ooo-oooo OOO <br /> Hey, AOL. Release it. It deserves attention. My wife laughed at it. And she is 100% Japanese.
