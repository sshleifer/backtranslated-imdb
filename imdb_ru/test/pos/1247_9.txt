In my opinion, this is one of the most underrated films of Bruce, this is a stunning spiritual film, with a neat story and a stunning performance by Bruce Willis! All the characters are great, and I thought that Willis and Spencer Breslin were just great together, plus Bruce Willis is just great in that! This is undoubtedly one of Bruce’s best comedy performances (“Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa”, ”and I thought that she was very well written and made, plus the final especially cool! ) changes throughout the entire movie! plus the ending was pretty good. I think it should be higher than 6.0, and this is one of the best Disney films I've ever seen! plus it has a lot of amazing moments. All the characters are extremely cute and they also have cute love story, plus Bruce and Spencer Breslin had very funny lines (Holy Smokes!). In my opinion, this is one of the most underrated films of Bruce, this is a stunning spiritual film, with a neat story and a stunning performance by Bruce Willis, and I say it’s a must see! Direction is great! John Turteltaub does an excellent job with this job, shooting a camera and just shooting a movie at a very fast pace. Acting perfectly! Bruce Willis, as always, is amazing and amazing, he gives one of his best comedy performances, he is cheerful, did a great job with Spencer Breslin and Emily Mortimer, had some funny lines and was dead throughout the film, he was one of the main reasons for which I liked this movie so much! (Willis Rules !!!!!!!). Spencer Breslin is great, like the younger version of Russell, he was very funny and never got on my nerves, he is one of the best children's actors! Emily Mortimer is as good as Amy, and she was very sweet, I liked her, she had decent chemistry with Bruce. Lily Tomlin is funny, since Janet liked her very much. Jean Smart is good at what she had to do, which was not much. The rest of the cast does well. In general, you must see! **** from pf 5
