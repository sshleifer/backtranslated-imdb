This fascinating film, interesting to those who love a good romance or adventure, should definitely be seen among exciting unusual scenes in Indian corners and a plot inspired by Bollywood, but based on reality. And by that I mean “good,” and not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. The East meets the West in another look at the film about friends. The performances inspire and sparkle, the epic with cinema and the plot are interesting, fascinating and insightful without a trace of Schmalz or cheap jerking in the hearts. HARI OM is a sweet film that does not rot. See it!
