I loved the Complete Savages! Why did they cancel anyway? They had to make a second season and so on ... God! They always cancel good shows ... and leave all the boring stuff. Nothing interesting on television since The Complete Savages has disappeared. This show was a great idea. The lonely father of a fireman with five crazy sons and a lazy dog ​​... Each of them has his own madness in this house. TJ is always a kid ... always younger ... Kyle is swinging! He breaks everything he touches! He is always in custody, he always does not what he needs ... But, nevertheless, he is so funny to everyone that he does. Sam is smart. He is always shy and stupid when it comes to girls ... Finally, he ends up dating Angela. Chris is a sports guy who has nothing to do with school, school and the like. He is always funny. And finally ... Jack! Scala show. The oldest of all, macho, "rock star" ... But still as crazy as everyone else. Nick ... helpless with these guys. Oh! And I almost forgot! Uncle Jimmy ... He's a man! He's like a 30 year old kid. He looks like the same nonsense as boys. I always wondered how he turned out to be a firefighter ... And the dog is the image of the whole wild family. The thing is ... that this show was all about to become something really big. There was everything, man! But of course ... they canceled it ...
