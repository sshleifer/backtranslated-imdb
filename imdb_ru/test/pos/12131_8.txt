I agree with Vince, this film paved the way for Goodfell. The scene when Sands threw peanuts at the pianist reminded me of his “How Am I Funny?” Routine in Goodfells. This is a very underrated film and deserves some attention. As in many other movies about mobs, the theme of "The Death Collector" sounds true: always respect Don.
