I watch some of the episodes (for example, the entire 1/3 of the film dedicated to the battle on the ice) in the film by Alexander Nevsky, filmed by Russian legend Sergey M. Eisenstein (directed by Dmitry Vasilyev in his only significant film). credit), made me realize how much you really need to send, at least on a scale like this. If I were a member of the awards group at the time this film was released, I would probably award Eisenstein with the director's award of the year posthumously. This is such a crazy cinematic genius blow to remove some of the things shot in the film, although for someone like this director after leaving his best work - Potemkin's Battleship and October - this could be something he mocked at the beginning. But against the background of the film, which sometimes frustrates a little how little gray color falls into a black and white object, it still remains a miracle of celluloid almost 70 years later. The Lord of the Rings fans, so to speak, are introduced to the film’s grandfather. <br /> <br /> To say that something is a propaganda work already gives it a meaning, and often a bad one. This is something that has a full message and point of view. It is still a matter of heated controversy (see The Crowd of Controversy over Moore’s films) about whether great art can emerge from something that should cause the audience in a certain way. In this particular case, the Russians are against the Germans. At a time when it was approaching World War II, Russia again faced the “German invaders”, and it is interesting to note that Eisenstein was actually authorized to make this film, as a call for the Russians to never forget the crucial part of their history. The end result seems to be what is actually a bit commonplace after seeing the battleship and October; if nothing else happens in these films, then this is what Eisenstein is most concerned about how the image and content can finally come together for the viewer, this style can completely embrace the viewer without fail. Under these conditions, Alexander Nevsky is fearless. <br /> <br /> But even with the whole idea of ​​“Russia is great, and the Germans are bad,” there are some small moments when things are done a little less strict, a little less strict to these ideals. For example, when we see the Germans for the first time in the Impregnation, it is not some faceless blob that is completely barbaric and has a blind winning intention (not that they were not going to take everything they could). They also have their own national pride that it would be equally important for them to move forward with what their Christian leaders say. At least the evil of the painting has a face, although it is kept at a minimum level so that a more common side can be involved. Before the battle on the icy landscape there is also a short scene where the Russian troupe has a joke: he told and laughed, and this adds a little depth, where there may still be a little. Because most often in the film “Alexander Nevsky” with its battle songs filled with pride for the war, there are no difficulties with the characters, especially with Nevsky himself (played in an ultra-heroic way, polling only from the very beginning) Nikolai Cherkasov) , must be so in the intention of Eistenstein to have it as the only infallible force, with which it is necessary to reckon in the story. After all, looking for naturalism in the Eisenstein film is like trying to find a non-kosher pig in a grocery store. <br /> <br /> But the real reason to see the picture is not an acting game, anyway, but for the film’s view of how it moves and takes in such a vast environment that Eisenstein puts out. On an epic scale, it is as ambitious as his films of the 20s, with many additions, not only in the main battle scenes, but also in scenes in cities, out of hundreds of people passing through. In fact, I would say that any director who works in Hollywood or elsewhere, who is thinking of making some great epic, especially war, would have watched this film very well, even with the sound turned off. It is even better if it is considered a silent film in which visual touches are sometimes visually emphasized. You can spend a whole month analyzing the battle on the ice, how it starts with the fact that German soldiers go far and then appear ahead like beetles and then, as Eisenstein interrupts a close-up of the actors fighting, and then the wide shots. and with fast editing. And, of course, you cannot ignore the power of music, Sergei Prokofiev put one of the best inspiring scores of any epic work. All this time directorial editing forces us to look at this insane action with breakneck speed. If it were just a short film, he would surely be on a par with great people, very much like the sequence of the Odessa Ladder. <br /> <br /> If I found it a little less awesome, it would be because of mistakes this comes from a director who is much more suited to a quiet environment than to sound. While I had not yet seen Ivan the Terrible, my only negative criticism would be about his leadership of actors, which is as wide as possible, with a melodrama at such a high level, stunning (the subplot of two soldiers fighting for Olga, best example i can think of). But even if we take this into account, Alexander Nevsky is generally too unusual to ignore, and he strengthens his participation in hostilities and making films to a level that sets the benchmark for films even today to try to justify them. Excellent rating
