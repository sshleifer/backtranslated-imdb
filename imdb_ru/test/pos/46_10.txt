I watch this movie almost every night that was on HBO. In my opinion, this could be successful in the theater, provided that the advertising leading to it was on a higher scale. I was deeply impressed by the actress who played the nanny. She is an outstanding actress. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrence Howard. He is a very understated actor, and he deserves much more respect than he received. Ebony Magazine made a good article about him, giving him some of his due supporters. Lackawanna Blue gave me an understanding of the stories my parents tell us. They were from a similar city "Philadelphia, Pa.", Where they were supposed to have fun at the joints and the like. I also like to say that Mos Def is an incredible actor. He found his calling. I saw him in several films where he played different roles, from the thug to the doctor, and he has everything! In general, please put the Lakawanna Blues on the video for hire.
