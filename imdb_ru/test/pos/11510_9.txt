I have seen this movie many times. I read Englar Alheimsins, written by Einar Mar Gudmundsson, who received a Scandinavian book award for this work. The film does not start in the same place where the book begins. It happens in Reykjavik, and the main character, Pall, is young and lives well with his girlfriend. But when she breaks off a relationship with him, he has headaches that irritate and anger him. And soon he begins to have big mental problems, and then the film begins. Soon he will be placed in a psychiatric hospital in Iceland called Kleppur, and there you will see such wonderful characters as Victor, who considers himself to be Hitler, and Or, who thinks that he writes all the Beatles songs and sends them to them wisely transportation. Ingvar E Sigurdusson, who plays the role of the protagonist Pall, works so well that it makes you gasp. In addition, the music in this movie is insane from SIGURRÃ“S, and just for the cost of the music you have to watch the movie. Overall a great movie to see.
