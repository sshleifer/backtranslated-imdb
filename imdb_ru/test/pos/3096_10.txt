Successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good example. You can write a big question on the ambitions of youth, but the Duke does an amazingly good job. The purpose of the film is to show people and even the world from an inhuman point of view. <br /> <br /> The film consists of three parts: “Creation of the World”, “Paradise” and “Golden Age”. Images of each are in contrast to voice-overs. Although the text of the “Creation” (from Popol Vuh, the Mayan myth) refers to the primordial wasteland, the scene goes no further, illustrating the myth. It lives on waste and on various damage patterns (fire, smoke, wrecked cars). Images from "Paradise" is something besides this, and the "Golden Age" is darkly comic ?? higher culture is a strange roadside musical act. <br /> <br /> Popol Vuh assumes that humanity is the central object of creation, but the film does everything possible to destroy this concept. His mythological structure does not have a referent in human historical time. There are no human characters to talk about. When a boy is standing with a dog in an extended shot, the initial assumption is from the point of view of the boy; by the end it is much more dog. In the same way, a lizard is a stronger character than the person who represents it, and the partner of the turtle hardly looks like a person with his big flippers. <br /> <br /> Animal stories and nature documentaries are always anthropomorphized, but Fata Morgana doesn’t. Of course, the dunes look like a female body, but the comparison cuts in both directions. Supposedly, only people can easily distinguish between their creation and nature, and here planes and factories are represented near mountains, lakes and waterfalls. People and civilization are part of a wider natural landscape. <br /> <br /> In 1979, Herzog changed the idea when he remade Nosferatu in terms of the vampire.
