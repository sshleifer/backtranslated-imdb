As a cameraman, I couldn't help but admire the gorgeous appearance that this photo has achieved. The performances were excellent, as was the story. Just when I thought this film was going to slow down, it is not. The heartbreaking tension, the excellent pace of editing, and the multitude that know when to be calm, have all gathered here under the competent and able guidance. The camera has always been in the right place. Love it.
