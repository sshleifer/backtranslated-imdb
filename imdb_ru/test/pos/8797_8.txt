This film has a brilliant soundtrack and an excellent game from some rather unknown people. I especially like the heroes of the bad guys from the Welsh docks who walk around like American rappers who are tough. The joke between the Jeep and the Coop is brilliant, they seem to be best friends almost as if it were true in real life. I have experienced some things in this film, and let me tell you first-hand that these people do not play (especially when Jeep and Coop speak and sniff coke). Danny Dyer is priceless as a Moff, a prescription party dealer, and he has the funniest lines in the movie ... <br /> <br /> “I’m happy when I don’t have brine, when I feel the music, you understand .... daaaaa! I knew you would not let me down, I knew it !!! "
