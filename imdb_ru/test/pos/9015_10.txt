I had the honor to attend the regional premiere for this, this is one of the funniest British films ever, the plot is fantastic, focuses on a young girl who unwittingly turns into her ideal man at a computer fair, while creating a copy of herself who fell in love , the film is full of jokes, visual and auditory, and it is bright and fresh, and the acting is of excellent quality, released in the UK on July 2. must go see it !!!
