After about a 7-year rocky road on NBC, it was decided to make only one last super contribution. The series has been on the bubble several times due to the lack of numbers that would qualify it as a blockbuster of television hours. He has always had a significant solid core of solid body followers. <br /> <br /> It was almost as if the series with the full title "HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET" (1993-99) was a kind of "Mr. in between." It was too big to just be canceled, but too small to finish the case of Mad Rating Nonsense. <br /> <br /> During an unreliable stay on Friday night, they presented some of the best and bold artworks of hourly dramas. There I said it was Artistic, Artistic !! But please remember that we mean artistic, and not just false, pretentious, pedantic, politically correct preaching. <br /> <br /> When it was finally clear that this was the end of the line for "HOMICIDE"; This super episode was produced like this 2-hour film for a TV movie. <br /> <br /> Looking at all the events of the past season and the parade of permanent characters, the film crew came out and gave us what turned out to be a super sending. <br /> <br /> OUR HISTORY? ?????. When we join this story, we discover that the commander of the Baltimore murder investigation unit, Lt. Al Jardello, “pulled out a pin,” that is, resigned from work. But "G" is not yet ready to truly resign. So instead of a rocking chair or a fishing rod, we see that Al is running for mayor of Charm City. <br /> <br /> While in the city, he stops some campaigns and makes speeches, a former lieutenant detective takes a killer's bullet. Alive, but in a coma, he was taken to hospital. <br /> <br /> News spreads quickly, and, as if officially triggered, we discover that all the Baltimore squad detectives we saw on the show appear to offer their services and assistance. All these former and present sneakers are great when they enter and follow every leadership and opportunity of leadership. <br /> <br /> The producer found a way to deal with those who had previously died, bringing their memory into the story. They were able to answer some long-standing questions and even present some of them undetected here. The whole story completes the series in the most pleasant and original way. But at least for now, we will leave it as “secret”. <br /> <br /> Wrapping everything in a neat, small package, this television film certainly gets our approval. Regarding the assessment of the film about the murder, we must give him even A or A +. But, regardless of the rating, it was not as high as in a typical weekly episode.
