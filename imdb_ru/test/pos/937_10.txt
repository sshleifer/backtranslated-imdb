I feel at a loss, such a brilliant film. Kislovsky - a writer, philosopher; and while an excellent director, his greatness lies in his writing; and "Red" is his paradigm. This film is a metaphysical study of the judgment of the artist in the creation of his fictional world; how an artist can try to remake life — even his own — through his art, even though he cannot escape the knowledge that, no matter how he involves himself in his story, it is still a fiction, and he is still out of his Remade World, still burdened with his unreality and the reality of life, which he tried to artistically redo. And in a magical way, all this is not to a small extent due to the wonderful story about the secrets of love and destiny and the characters who live this story, this predetermined fate. If I had to choose, I could nominate this greatest film ever made.
