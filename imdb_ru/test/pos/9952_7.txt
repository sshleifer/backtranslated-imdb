The Venetian merchant William Shakespeare depicts Venice of the 16th century. Al Pacino plays Shylock, a Jewish moneylender who plans to take revenge on a Catholic who looks down on him. The film is a slow plot at the beginning, which accumulates over more than two hours. The film gives a very good and sure view of their characters, especially Pacino. Hearing that Pachino plays a Jew, you might think that this will not work if you look at Pachinoâ€™s previous roles in gangster films. Nevertheless, it works very well, you have to pay tribute to the costume designer and film director. The appearance of all the characters agrees well with the period of time in which the performance takes place. The costumes look like a renaissance look that you can imagine. <br /> <br /> The film has an anti-Semitic atmosphere. From the first minute to the last, it is shown how the Catholics are trying to use the Jews in every possible way, to the point that they are kept locked up in the "ghetto" and not allowed to engage in regular work. Compared to the Passion of Christ, another recent film that people thought was very anti-Semitic, the Venetian merchant makes Passions look like a Jewish holiday. The film shows how Jews, or at least Shylock, wanted revenge for the cruel treatment of the Jews. Pictures from the scene also seem very timely, and the landscape is sometimes very beautiful or very ugly depending on the scene of the film, which makes it much more realistic. Showing the beautiful and the ugly can also be viewed as anti-Semitic, because the ugly is usually shown around the Jews, and the beautiful around Catholics. <br /> <br /> Although the film clearly shows a serious aura of certain roles, add a little humor to the act. Oh, such a serious process between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) adds humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) come to court and decide who will be the winner and the vanquished. This in itself may not be funny, but seeing that these were women dressed as men, you can find it quite funny. The whole crossdressing scene, no matter how attractive it was, could probably become even more memorable if makeup artists and director Michael Radford noticed that the two women still look like women and are easy to recognize. The director could also make sure that women speak in a normal voice, and do not try to speak like men, which partially removes the scene, but does not kill him completely. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film gets 7 of 10
