This is a very good black comedy, with a great look at how different people perceive the same situations differently. Each of the three main characters met a girl named Jewel, played by Liv Tyler, who represents a separate male fantasy for each of the three men. Each of the three men goes through the same situations, but when they tell other people about them, their perception of the situation is very different from what the other two say. This is a very good concept, perhaps not quite original, but it works well in the film. The plot is very good, very strange and extreme, which makes it a good black comedy. The acting is equally good, none of the actors seemed out of place or not in their league. The comedy is very black, tar in some scenes, and many people will definitely be offended by this, but fans of the black comedy will probably like it. In general, this film is not for every taste, but most people who love black comedy will surely enjoy it, as this is definitely one of the best black comedies. 7/10
