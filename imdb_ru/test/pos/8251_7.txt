Brilliant enough to be believable and at the same time to deliver a lot of pleasure, this is a clean piece of the 1970s (even the police really need haircuts!). Filmed in and around London, a conspiracy by an American ex-prisoner who tries to drive straight, but is sent as an electrician to a bank in Mayfair and then puts on criminal Lord David Nivenâ€™s nuts and discovers that he is preparing a crime for the century. <br /> <br /> I liked its simplicity and even its innocence, it goes back to the time when films with capers, where only it is, capers and violence were not part of the deal. <br /> <br /> In general, you could have done a lot worse than watching this: he had enough turns and turns to give him a little fun and a throw that obviously enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Beautifully made and watchable.
