Having never seen either Oliver Stone’s film or Eric Bogosyan’s films, I didn’t know what to expect from this film. Having played with the idea of ​​buying it for a while, I finally got it for free as a supplement to the Sunday newspaper, and I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> He tells the story of Barry Champlain, a talk radio host, who can be incredibly rude to his visitors, often putting them in their place before they understand what is happening. Although it was this that made him a popular radio show host, it also brought him many enemies. <br /> <br /> The acting role in this film was incredibly impressive, and there was not a single stupid actor in it. Eric Bogosian is great in the role of Barry Champlain, a troubled radio host with Alec Baldwin, who acted as Barry Dan's boss. It also has the voice and cameo Michael Wincott (my reason for this is to see). <br /> <br /> The story was really well written, because, despite his arrogance, you feel that Barry is telling more about his troubled life, and you see how vulnerable he really is. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to everyone because it is fascinating and, more importantly, real on many levels, two of which were inspired by the life of a real radio show host and the fact that you really get the lead radio shows and subscribers, such as those shown in the film in reality. <br /> <br /> High recommendation and 10/10. <br /> <br /> Yes, Kat Squire
