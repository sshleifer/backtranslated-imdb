I watched a movie about 13 years ago when I lived in Airlie Beach Culd, Australia. I found it on the shelves of a small shop in the back, which most do not bother to browse. <br /> <br /> To my pleasure, I found him and watched him, intending one day to own him and be in my collection. I still do not have this, but one day it will be. <br /> <br /> I like the concept with poetry and fantasy. Semi deserted street scenes with a lively command city in the background add to the visual effect. <br /> <br /> I have repeatedly mentioned this film to people who like this genre, only praise. He is stuck in my memory and will be for a long time. <br /> <br /> I fully recommend this film, but only to those who are of this type. <br /> <br /> This commentary and one from Los Angeles, California can help you when choosing to watch this movie. Comments may be negative, but I found them positive if you look past derogatory connotations.
