I like this movie. Not because of the romantic storylines between women, but because of the visualization of human power, despair and liberation. This film is a must see. Entertaining! Emotional! Exciting! All characters are very well written and depicted by some very talented actors. This story is a story of self-discovery and sexual awakening. Journey of the mind, body and soul. You find yourself identifying with the characters and in some moments, even with the plot. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I recommend watching the movie first and then reading the book. If you read the book first, you will be a little disappointed. Script adaptation cut a lot, and some things have been changed. Some for the better, and some for the worst.
