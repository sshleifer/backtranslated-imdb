If you expect this movie to be full of action and capture you from the start, don’t watch it. But if you like such meditative films that remain in your head for a while until you get the details, then you will like it. Now don't get me wrong, there is an action, and there are things that are just not happening in the usual way. <br /> <br /> In essence, the plot is in a post-apocalyptic world, where someone fights for his (or his) way of survival. In this fight, they lost the ability to speak ... I don’t want to write anymore so as not to spoil your film, but believe me, if you like SF authors like Lem or Kapek, or even someone from Orson Scott Card, you do this love this movie.
