WAGONMASTER is one of the most poetic narrative films ever made, ever made, but difficult to love. I like this movie, but I recommend watching other John Ford westerns before taking a look at this one. When I first saw it, I was 18 years old, I did not see too many other westerns and I hated it. I thought it was incredibly boring. I kept waiting for something to happen. It took me a few years to love this picture. First, I loved the westerns as a whole - traditions, characters, landscapes, ways of communication, etc. - and this made me realize when I saw WAGONMASTER again that a lot of things happen in it after all. <br /> <br /> I was also just a more experienced movie goer at that moment and learned to appreciate the visual narration and listen to what each image told. WAGONMASTER is a very visual film by one of the most brilliant filmmakers working at the height of their careers. <br /> <br /> The film is a celebration of lifestyle, and its theme is more emotional and inner. than other westerns westerns. In fact, this is not as accurate as arguing that he has far fewer external actions than other Westerns. (Other Westerns have an outer action and an inner emotion.) It quite nicely puts its Mormon pioneers in the context of nature. There are many pictures of animals and children — not for any superficial, narrative purpose, but to illustrate this idea. That is why the film can be called a poem. This is not about a superficial story (which barely exists) almost as much as about an emotional idea, and it conveys this idea through composition, editing, sound and music. In fact, it can be argued that this is a more pure form of film production, because the images directly express the emotional idea of ​​the film, and not primarily serve the "story". <br /> <br /> Give this film a chance and allow it to exist on its own terms, and not on terms of other westerns or other films.
