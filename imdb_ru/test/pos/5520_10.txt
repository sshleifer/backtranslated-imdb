Look, this is a low budget horror movie that suffers from all the problems associated with low budget movies. But you have to see it, just to see Lisa Erickson as Julie. She is a hot and cool actress! These horror films often reveal a rare gem, and The Power gave us Lisa Erickson! I don't like anything more than sitting in my studio with a cola and sticking this film. My friends Bob, Bill and Dennis agree .. Lisa is not only gorgeous, but also beautiful. The film itself is often amused, and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in this regard. But as soon as Lisa gets on the screen, things really start to change. Others are clearly not in her league. This is not an Exorcist, but, as I said, if you want to see a funny little movie with a hot little actress, this is one that is worth seeing!
