Summary: based on the true story of American Congressman Charlie Wilson, who (according to this film) played an important role in the US secret war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Comments: a rather funny movie about not-so-funny things, especially since they were real. But, concentrating on the film, Hanks is very good at acting as a kind-hearted, mischievous female congressman who becomes the champion for the secret war in Afghanistan. Hanks, and the entire film, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman, have a rather humorous tone. It would be so appropriate to add a comedy to the genre. But the story she tells, and perhaps the biggest ending, is really serious. <br /> <br /> A story about what happened, with some questions about what could be. So the film works like a comedy, if you want, and much more serious, if you want it. Something for everyone? 7/10
