I remember when I first saw this movie. I looked after my mom's girlfriend, and one of the children offered to watch it. Thinking that this was “frankly ridiculous“ Prince of Thieves ”, they slipped into the video recorder, I was ready for several hours of boredom. What I received was a shock, pleasant, I confess, but still a shock. <br /> <br /> Now you all know the legend of Robin Hood, right? I will explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, he cut money here and there and distributed it to people who needed it, all the while seducing the beautiful maiden Marion and annoying Sheriff Nottingham and Prince John. These are the basics! We now turn to the review. <br /> <br /> This film was released in 1993 and is an extract from the legend of Robin Hood and, in particular, the story of the Prince of Thieves. <Br /> <br /> Freely following the legend, Robin Locksley first meets in an Arab prison during the Crusades in the third century, and together with Mavr, as they were called in those days, he makes a cunning escape with his cellmate Asneeze. <br /> <br /> After escaping, Asneeze begs Robin to find his son Atchoo, an exchange student in England, and look after him. This is Robin swears to do! Robin swims back to England. <br /> <br /> He returns to his home, Locksley Castle, and discovers that he is being taken to the back of the trolley from the bailiff service, and passes through the sad revelation that his father, dog, cat, and even a goldfish are all are dead. Desperate for a familiar face, he finds a faithful blind servant of the Blinkin family sitting on a toilet with a jazz magician in Braille. The fun continues throughout the film. <br /> <br /> As with all the stories about Robin Hood, Robin has to destroy the evil plans of Prince John and Sheriff Rottingham, which wreak havoc and charge exorbitant taxes from the kingdom of King Richards while he is away. <br /> <br /> Those who are familiar with the films previously shot by Mel Brooks will have a little idea of ​​what to expect. In the end, this is the man responsible for the death of Dracula and loving her and the young Frankenstein. All the jokes, which range from visual jokes to amazing witty comments, are in exactly the right places throughout the entire film, and there is not more than a minute between a laugh. <br /> <br /> Cary Elvis (by the way, the only Englishman who plays Robin Hood in the film), which many of you recognize by Princess Bride, brings his cheeky grinning twinkle into this film and does a wonderful job. From the outlandish heroic posturing to the viciously sexual gaze, it is truly amazingly funny. And a man in tights looks better than me! <br /> <br /> Richard Lewis is jovial, like a whiny, arrogant Prince John with a constantly changing birthmark. He brings the guy's behavior to a tee, and his bellicose American vocalizations are great. Throughout the film, the mole on his face constantly changes position: it starts on the left cheek, then on the right cheek, then on the chin, then on the forehead, before returning to its original place. This is a subtle joke based on a mole on Alan Rickman, when he played the sheriff in Prince of Thieves. <br /> <br /> Roger Rees, because Rottingham's slovenly sheriff is remarkably slimy and nasty, and he has excellent features throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There are some people here that you will meet in other Brooks films. For example, Robert Ridgeley, who plays the executioner in this film, also played the executioner in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He likes to add subtle references to his early films too; with a few in this film that the staunch Brooks fans will easily discover. Those who watched "The History of the World", part 1, learn the music for the song "Men in Tights". In addition, when Patrick Stewart arrives and hugs Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Takman) pronounces the line “it's good to be a king”, one of his lines in “History of the World”. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is amazingly comedy, even those with just a few lines give them a great depth of warmth and humor. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so amazingly warm and funny, in my opinion, all these are improvised scenes. Although there was a kind of scenario, some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves, such as the scene in which Latrina (Tracy Ullman) prays for Rottingham in her bed and he falls over the ceiling, landing exactly where she wanted him, which was completely designed and thought out by two actors. <br /> <br /> There are several special effects, and there are small, but funny moments of computer camera cheating. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is unforgettable, with some very funny songs and a couple of tender love songs. You will be singing "Men in Pantyhose" or at least humming it for a few weeks. <br /> <br /> The rating is “Pg” and I say “BAH HUMBUG”. There is no bad language in the film, except for the use of double meaning, and one statement sh! T, and violence is minimal. In fact, I would even say that it does not exist, except for a few scenes of comedic battles. <br /> <br /> A great fun movie that will appeal to both adults and children!
