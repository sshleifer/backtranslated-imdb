I saw a lot of movies, and it just amazed me. Trauma, suspense is just awesome. I ended up wound up in a psychological fear and philosophy of it, and connected it with reality. Films that play and challenge your mind are films that you will not forget, which cause you to doubt your reality. The problem may be in quality, but this does not detract from the essence of the film. <br /> <br /> The idea is brilliant, and the final leaves you just shocked and with a question that you need to look for an answer. I just totally loved it! So many tips, twitches and riddles. One of the best movies ever, hands down.
