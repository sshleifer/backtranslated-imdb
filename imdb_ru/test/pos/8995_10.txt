My family really enjoyed this movie. As for what this film will do for rugby in the USA ... I am sure it will be debatable. But as for me and the people around me, I know that after watching the movie, we became more curious than playing sports, and I personally gained more respect for the game. You may wonder how this is possible, especially since the film does not talk about rugby. But the simple fact is that it attracted you to the players and the emotions of the game and life. The film was inspiring and interesting. It made us laugh and cry. The chemistry between Shaun Astin, Big Buda and Shaun Faris worked well. Some might think that the film is a bit cliche, but I seriously wish Hollywood would make more of these films. I could not but draw an analogy with the game and the struggle of life. In the end, I found myself testing my life to understand what I needed to do better in order to become the best person I could be. To be honest, I was grateful that this film taught morality, values, and teamwork; there is so much the opposite. After watching this, I really hope that my children will be trained by someone who has a philosophy like Coach Gelwix.
