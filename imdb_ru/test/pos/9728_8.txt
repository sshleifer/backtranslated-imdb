Robert Cummings, Larayne Day and star Gene Muir in the film “And One was Beautiful,” a 1940 film that also starred Billie Burke. At one o'clock and 15 minutes, it looks like a film by V. Cummings - a playboy by Ridley Crain, which many women desire, including two sisters, Katherine and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir). Catherine is the more terrestrial of those who like to repair cars, and Helen is a fair-haired blonde-haired butterfly with beautiful dresses. Ridley returns to the city, and, believing that he will not be at the party, Helen decides not to attend. As the family friend arranges the party, their mother (Burke) sends Katherine in a stab dress. Ridley is there, and both are connected. But Ridley has more superficiality, and when he sees Helen at a dinner party, they start from where they left off and go to the club. He becomes terribly drunk, and Helen refuses to drive his car first, because he will not let her go. After some time and breaking the heel of her shoes, she gets into Reedley's car as he drives past. He loses consciousness, and she takes the wheel, accidentally hitting and killing a cyclist. <br /> <br /> Ridley can't remember anything, so Helen lets him take the blame for death. The heel of women's shoes is found in the car, and Kathryn sees her sister burying her shoes - plus, something in Helen's way makes her understand that Helen is not telling the truth. Ridley is convicted and goes to prison, and Helen marries a man he doesn’t like and goes to South America. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful film, although at the time it was not a list of performers. Cummings plays the role that Robert Taylor would play (this is the MGM film) - he is handsome and very kind, even if he doesn't have the dazzling appearance of someone like Taylor. Laraine Day is my favorite actress, MGM constantly lent someone because they didn’t know what to do with it. Why, I wonder - a wonderful actress with a gorgeous face and voice, she revived many films. This one is no different. Her Catherine is purposeful, responsive and completely sweet. Jean Muir is a lousy actress. <br /> <br /> So who was the beauty? We all know, even if MGM did not. <br /> <br /> A small gem is strongly recommended.
