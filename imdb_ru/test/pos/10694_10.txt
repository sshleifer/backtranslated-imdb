This is an action film that makes me feel very peaceful and relaxed every time I see it. The film (except for its conclusion) demonstrates that, despite the extreme disagreements, it can still be won. <br /> <br /> This film is very refreshing and will probably be banned at any time. Get a copy before the police burn every copy they can find. They do not want you to have hope for the future or think that you have a chance. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if “Political Correctness” does not suppress it, it will be a great movie to show. on dvd. Such a release may contain interviews with the writer and director, as well as related goodies. I am sure that he will sell several copies, and I will be one of the first to buy it. <br /> <br /> - Mincka
