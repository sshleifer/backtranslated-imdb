A good show, a really good acting game, and the director tells us about his storyline in an interesting, unpredictable way, especially since, in fact, they are two people in a room. He does not go through many modern films, but he doesn’t pull. Bol is frivolous enough to believe her “now” of her character, who is still involved and is not going to return to her “career” choice - so it is plausible without having to show us a deep self-assessment of her soul ... innocence, meekness and class to cope very well with Buddy. A bit grainy in the quality of the film, but consistent with the tone of the story. It could be a little polish hair and makeup, but definitely worth a look.
