No blood, no sex (although it exudes passion), no special effects, but only one of those pearls that fall on the screen of your film when you are not really watching and grabs your attention. <br /> <br /> Great game, great scenery, great music, beautiful story. If only there were more films like this! <br /> <br /> Filming moves us in time and makes us feel as if we were there. <br /> <br /> The action looks like real life and raises us to the level of awareness of “nanny”, for which no one is hopeless, the least people in her own home are halfway through. <br /> <br /> Best of all, this is a true story of losers who learn to "fit in." I was a little jealous of the good times everyone seemed to have in the film! Can we spend some time in the nanny house?
