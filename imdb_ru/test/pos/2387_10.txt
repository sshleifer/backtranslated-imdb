I liked the Eddie Monroe movie. The film had all the components that supported me while watching. I especially liked the plot twists on this path and the unexpected ending. Craig Morris has the potential of Brad Pitt, both in appearance and in talent. His blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newman. Fred Carpenter raised this film to a new level. I liked the cast. The music, cinematography, talent, locations and script were awesome. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and talented director. He gives his job 200%. The film has a great texture. I hope that Eddie Monroe 2 will appear. I would really like to see how Nicolette gets his profit. Eddie Monroe Fred Carpenter - Hollywood level.
