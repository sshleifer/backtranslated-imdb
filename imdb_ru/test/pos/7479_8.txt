Is Thursday an original movie? Gosh, but it's a lot of fun! I just caught it buried on the movie channels one night, and it was a nice movie. I expected a lot, but what I got was some interesting scenes (I really liked the first ones that I saw in the store), some funny stories told by the characters, and a bit of action added to the mix. Polina Porizkova had several good performances by young actors, and I was particularly impressed with Aaron Eckhart (who made a further impression on me in the films “Your friends and neighbors” and “Erin Brockovich”). So, if you want 90 minutes of quiet fun, check out Thursday.
