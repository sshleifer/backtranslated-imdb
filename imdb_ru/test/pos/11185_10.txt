Curse of the island of monkeys. Released exactly 6 years after the success of Monkey Island 2. You may think that after the strange finale of Monkey Island 2, he will complete Monkey Island once and for all. But it all turned out to be a ploy to lure Guybrush into captivity. But enough about that, the whole point is that Monkey Island is back, and the voices are just phenomenal. If LucasArts were to make a movie / cartoon about Monkey Island, it would probably be what it would look like and sound like. This is a really good story, and everything in it is simply amazing. If you have not heard of the Monkey Island series, buy the Monkey Island Archives or The Monkey Island Booty Pack and play all the games, starting with The Secret of Monkey Island, then Monkey Island 2 and The Curse of Monkey Island. Monkey Island 4 was really good, but this one surpasses them all.
