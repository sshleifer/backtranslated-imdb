If you were looking for a film in which an uncontrollable nymphoman was chained to an extremely religious southern man by a radiator, then look no further than the latest release of Paramount Vantage “Black Serpent Moan”. Not really looking for what I just described, you say? Well, then it would be best for you to go with Jazelf and Mauzy to your local theater and still see it, as Samuel L. Jackson's character Lazarus would say. While you are open and do not take everything seriously, there is no reason why you will not leave the theater, glad you saw it. <br /> <br /> In the third sentence from the director Craig Brewer, we are taken to the deep south, where, as the film slogan says, everything is hotter. While there we meet the God-bearing bluesman, Lazarus, as mentioned earlier, plays Jackson and almost always half-naked Rey; Christina Ricci boldly assumed the role. In the film, this unlikely pair of cross paths is long enough for their characters to learn lessons from each other. Both lessons ultimately convey to us the audience that, no matter what, we are all humans. No one is perfect, and if everyone understood this, we would be much better. The question of whether this will be understood or accepted by everyone who watches the film is a different story. <br /> <br /> One thing that is not negotiable is how big both Jackson and Ricci are. You might think that in the role of a sex-obsessed woman, replay would be taken for granted, but no, not here. Ricci breaks through and demonstrates real talent with raw work, which also doubles as her best today. Then we have Jackson, who disappears completely and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he is. Unfortunately, the third star of the film, Justin Timberlake, who plays the military guy Ray, is not that great. In the beginning he fails miserably, as he seems to be trying too hard. Later he raises him a little, yet he is far from the level he reached in the January Alpha Dog. <br /> <br /> Another thing that Black Snake Moan can boast of is a great soundtrack. Contains tracks from The Black Keys, John Doe, plays from Scott Beaumar’s score and, of course, four, if not to count, four tracks from Jackson himself. This is actually one of his songs, the main performance of the film “Stackolee”, which is the fuel for the fire of this great collection. It is only the price of the ticket. Other notable musical delights from the soundtrack are Beaumar’s Chain, When the Lights Go Out, from the Black Keys, and the title song, which is also one of the most memorable scenes in the film where Lazar sings Rei on a stormy night. br /> Although Craig Brewer's efforts cannot remain without mention. His latest film, Hustle & Flow, which ultimately exceeded low expectations and received critical acclaim, put it at stake. What he did with the Black Snake Moan will be what sets him apart from other newcomers to the industry. He not only shot "Ston", but also wrote his script. The end result is a story that is amazing and smart. When you look, you feel that you know exactly where he is going, despite his valiant composure. Just as you think you predicted the next move, Brewer shifts gears and takes a completely different route. However, there are some spots in the script. The background characters are dull and flat, and the final is somewhat disappointing. It made me crave for something more exciting. After so many highs, I think the final scenes were a bit weaker than the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I think that most people who see the “Black Snake Moan” will not like it because of. In fact, they will not be able to stop themselves from thinking about how unlikely situations are. It is depressing that there are many other films with equally incredible, even more outrageous scenarios that have received wide acclaim. These are questions of race, religious motives, and sexuality, which the film demonstrates, which will have a greater influence on opinion than anything else. Just thinking that a black man puts a white woman in his house is enough for most people not to even think about it. Simply put, it is not for everyone. As I have already said, in order to fully enjoy this, you must be open, otherwise you just waste your money. For those of you who can do this, I highly recommend it.
