Uzumaki has a very unique story, and I will never again look at the spirals in the same way. In fact, this is not a terrible tingling in the spine, this film has a dark sullen acid feeling. At certain moments, was it just me or did you see the vortex images? Camera shots are interesting, and the film gives vent to the imagination. The strange supernatural sensation of this film attracts you, as the name suggests. The acting is well done, and the urban setting itself seems wrong. <br /> <br /> This may require several views. Great trippy movie.
