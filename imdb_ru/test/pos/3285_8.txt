It was a pretty good episode. Although there was no "trapped in the closet" or "cartoon wars", he had a lot of things. The character of Al Gore and this strange "super-cereal" thing were damn funny. But the scene that made me adore this episode was one, I'm sure everyone will agree, was one of Cartman / Kyle's greatest moments. When Cartman is superstitious about Kyle, he will steal his gold (which, of course, is fake!), And he turns out to be a few inches from his face. Suddenly, Kyle wakes up, and they begin a crazy conversation in which Cartman tries to act as if everything is all right. Cartman got the treasure at the end, although predictably, it was pretty funny.
