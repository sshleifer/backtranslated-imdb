I saw it before 'bubba ho-tep' at the fantastic film festival in Montreal. all about it or puts a hat on Tim Burton (or completely tears it off). nevertheless, I liked it, even if it is a very derivative. What impressed me most was the quality of the visual effects given the obvious budget for the laces. Scenography and props were inventive and original, although there was definitely no script.
