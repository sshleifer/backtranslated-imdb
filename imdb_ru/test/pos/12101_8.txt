Vera Akin made me once again realize the depth of my passion for this city called Istanbul. Being called a city of cultural mosaics, Vera Akin contributed to this decision with the help of a mosaic of music performed in the film. Moreover, the climax of the film, in my opinion, is the stage in which the Senar Museum (Turkish musical diva) sings at the age of 86 just as she did in her younger years, and rolls the glass of crayfish in the air, without pouring one drop, which is a traditional act in raki culture. She is simply amazing. Sezen Aksu (Turkish pop singer) with her mystical and meaningful views at the end of her song, which gives the film a Turkish title, makes the scene no less than a climax. And last but not least, the beautiful scenery of Istanbul can cause nostalgia if you are not around. Caution!
