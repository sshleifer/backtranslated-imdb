Wonderful cast, thrown into modern mystical romances for intelligent adults. Yes, they also need a love story to rekindle these hidden impulses without Hollywood fluff. All this under the masterful guidance of Antonioni and Wenders, who both love to attach their characters in exotic places and make them overshadow their surroundings with long wide shots. It's nice to see that in the mid-life crisis sector there is lust.
