The premise of the story is fairly common; the average family wants to get out of the rat race; wants to find a simple life .... so they move from Sherman Oaks, California to Lake Tomahawk; children in tow. <br /> <br /> The lake is beautiful, they rented an old house .... but wait; there may be something in the lake; people are killed, and no one knows how (let alone why). Gerald McRaney is a great, familiar face for viewers of a lifetime; Valerie Harper is also good; Since this film was shot in the 88th, perhaps the screenwriter should create a sequel! <br /> <br /> You will also like Barry Corbin as an eccentric city, and Darryl Anderson as Bruce Dern, like a crazy military man. <br /> <br /> While the storyline is a bit overpriced; if you are a movie lover, you will be reminded of similar scenarios from the film "Psycho"; "" Deliverance ""; as well as other horrible stories of this genre. A few shots from the camera and episodes will give you a sense of deja vu <br /> <br /> Sit down and enjoy; if you don’t take it too seriously, it’s very interesting; and better than, for example, a more recent film: <br /> <br /> “I know what you did last summer”; it seems they made the best films in the good old 80s!
