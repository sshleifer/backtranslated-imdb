I accidentally stumbled upon this movie on a DVD at a blockbuster rental. “Journey to the Planets” is a great two-hour BBC documentary / drama about the future “big tour” of the Solar System. Trying to adhere to current knowledge of the planets and space flight, as well as plausible expropriation of existing technologies, this film tells the story of astronauts about traveling to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto. <br /> <br /> Special effects are great for TV shows. I found the actors believable as astronauts. The situations presented are mostly plausible, and you will learn a lot about the science of planets and space flight! Only two minor complaints: I sometimes found that some situations and dialogues were a bit messy. In addition, I am not sure that one crew and ship will be sent to one mission to see all these destinations at the same time. Most likely, visits to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc. Will be / will be separate missions. <br /> <br /> They didn’t try to save on this show with production values. The scenes of Venus and Mars were actually filmed in the northern deserts of Chile - the driest region on earth and the dead man for the Martian landscape. The sequences of weightlessness were filmed on a diving Russian transport aircraft. Producers could fool any of them using studios and CGI, but chose the real thing instead. <br /> <br /> I would like to highlight the great music that was written for this film. The exciting theme of Don Davis is the first thing that captures you when the film starts, when a great shot of Pegasus passes by the screen, and David Sushhett says: “The fate of a man is to explore the stars ...”. <br /> <br /> I watch it on a small television screen - one regret that I have. What a delight to see in the cinema or, even better, in the IMAX presentation!
