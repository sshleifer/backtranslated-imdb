This is my favorite Indian film of all time. This is a comic genius. Salman Khan is cheerful. But Amir Khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. Carisma Kapoor’s outfits tell their own story — it makes you wonder whether the stylist deliberately forced her to wear some clothes just to make the film funnier (at some point it looks like a diaper on it) which makes me laugh from the very beginning to the very end. There is not a single boring moment, every scene is funny, even songs and dance moves will make you laugh. I especially liked the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) "restores his memory." I have seen this movie so many times that I lost count. And I am so happy to say that this time Bollywood can take all the responsibility for this fantastic film, as far as I know AAA, it is not a copy of a Hollywood film (THANK YOU GOD). In general, I recommend this film to anyone who understands Hindi / Urdu and loves a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Look and you will like it !!!!!
