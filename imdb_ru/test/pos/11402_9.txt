Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the best examples that any potential director should take a close look. Of course, you could spend a lot of time reviewing the classics from Hitchcock to Scorsese; but it allows them to follow their example for the modern generation and research at half strength. <br /> <br /> With a start, I suppose you can look at the film, how simple the story is, perhaps even dokudram, which focuses on the late 1970s porno industry - And what an industry it was! The other half can focus on the incredible details that a brilliant filmmaker can achieve by simply using polyester and * um * rubber. But to be honest, “Boogie Nights” returns the clear, cloudless, cinematic expression of your face that I have not experienced since the great films of the 1970s were shot ... ironically ... or brilliant. The story is full of richly detailed characters with whom you can either communicate, love or hate; but the effect is obvious - you feel something about them. Among the characters are two performances: Burt Reynolds as a director Jack Horner and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams / Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is as gorgeous as Heather Graham ... but if I focus on any one actor, it must be John S. Reilly. John's play is the perfect balance of comedy time and emotions, controlled by characters ... I am a fan of the plot “Ever see the movie Star Wars? ". People say that I look like Han Solo. ” In any case, the appearance of the film is incredible, the director of photography and the director / screenwriter / producer came up with a bright color and bright style that can be compared with Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick (in terms of his excellence in his craft.); but with the creation of his own unique look and the advancement of the edge of the longest single shot I have ever seen ... it was the sequence of the New Year's party. <br /> <br /> Music, as in any big film, is its own character. Sometimes he absorbs himself with sadness or grief ... but mostly it's all about fun, dancing and having a good time; the spirit of the 1970s. Okay, back to the show. <br /> <br /> Bert Reynolds plays the role of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden that the future “movie” means his genre. Awful transition from tape to tape. The loss of his art as it were ... and changes in the mentality of the people with whom he works. Valberg adds the perfect blend of innocence and sex bravado needed by the character. For all those people who have seen the Burton Monkey Planet, ignore Wahlberg’s performance in this film ... hire a boogie-woogie evening and see what a good script can change! <br /> <br /> Julianne Moore plays the expectant mother for everyone, and at the same time she experiences flour and torment when life imitates art; and she loses all those around her. Heather Graham is a sweetie, but later holds her and steals some scenes even from the greatest Mr. Reynolds. Each character is multidimensional, rich in life and performed by actors who seem to be perfect for this role. <br /> <br /> The film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting and provides an uncompromising look at the fast paced lifestyle of the 1970s. This does not justify and does not tell lies; and offers viewers a journey back. But more importantly, the film gives us a great example of how films should be made; and a new director, whose bold visions return art to the movies.
