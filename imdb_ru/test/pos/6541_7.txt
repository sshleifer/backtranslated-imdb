I assume that we all, no matter whether we are fans of cars, love the sound of the Dodge Challenger as it roars along the road, the noise of 57 Chevy that screams with ecstasy when it rushes around the corner, and above all the explosion of sound as a classic vehicle, it explodes. I'm not the biggest car enthusiast, for that matter, but any of the above really helps my engine! It is impossible to deny the importance of transport in the cinema. It was even said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences on early cinema (the view from the window is almost like a moving picture and the idea of ​​transferring to another time / space). But the car remains the most popular and most luxurious, it even has its own genre: the genre of road transport. A genre that focuses solely on the beauty of cars. In essence, this is just porn! Car porn! And I'm not talking about this rather unpleasant documentary on Channel 4, in which men actually had sex with cars. I think everything that floats in your ... car. Moving on ... while idle doesn’t work quite like a pornographic VANISHING POINT (Richard C. Sarafyan, 1971), for example, with its car windows closed in motion, it’s all bumps and curves (!), It doesn’t mean that a car not the main focus of this film. In fact, the cars themselves become characters (more on that later). They are objectified and fetishized just like women, in fact, maybe even more. And holy saint, these machines are something! Each car in this film (except those in the background) is just beautiful ?? Works of art, no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> As I said before, these incredible machines, in some ways, are given to the characters themselves. You really start to sympathize with the car! SPOILER ?? Most noticeable during the scene in which the car is broken and burned. It became almost a convention of the carsploitation genre; 1978 Evil Plymouth Fury from KRISTIN (John Carpenter, 1983), Satan's Lincoln Mark III custom in CAR (Elliot Silverstein, 1977), graceful little Mini Coopers from Italian WORK (Peter Collinson, 1969) to friendly Volkswagen Beetle in LOVE BIT Stevenson, 1968) and, of course, every car from DEATH RACE 2000 (Paul Barthel, 1975) and even WACKY RACES (1968-1970), each of which had its own character. Ironically, this emphasis on the car often takes (!) Human characters! And this, of course, is the case with RUNNING ON EMPTY, in which only one human character (a blind character who controls his car with his hearing, not his eyesight) has a certain dimension, the rest are very ordinary characters. These are all your stereotypical 1980s Australian teens; big hair, annoying accents, and none of them would look out of place in the neighbors, especially in the style of Kylie Minogue. But who cares? It's all about racing and emergency cars! This is it! If you do not like it, you really look the wrong genre. <br /> <br /> Car scenes are certainly an advantage of this film, and the best that it has is what it takes. They are fast; very fast! And we are not talking about a rather annoying technique that some films use when they record a car’s “acceleration” at a speed of about 40 miles per hour and then speed it up. Ohh no! Not with this film you do not. Do these machines move at maximum speed in real time ?? There are no editing tricks. So, we have speed. Check it out. What about failures? Check, check, check! While cars don't crash ALWAYS a la incredibly BLUES BROTHERS (John Landis, 1980), when the cars in this film crash, they surely crash! It would seem that they use gunpowder or something similar to build cars with one blow, and KABOOM - on fire. In a sense, it reminded me of "TRILLER: A LARGE PICTURE" (Bo Arne Vibenius, 1974). <br /> <br /> There are quite a few scenes between these simply amazing scenes (especially at the very beginning and at the end) that slow down everything that has been done and, in my opinion, cannot add very much to the film. Note: you need more exploding cars! However, there are a few exceptions that are great scenes? SPOILER, especially the rape scene. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a male film! Film boy! Full vroom cars are vrooming around out-of-town areas and a couple boobs added for good measure as well. I would recommend this small film to everyone, even if they are enthusiastic cyclists (!) ?? This is a great movie that you can just turn off the brain, lean back on the leather chair and put it on full volume! I will give 3.5 lvl out of 5 lvl ?? Bruuuuum! P.S ?? Do amazons sell it for just £ 2 ?? This is a real deal, although there are no special features on the DVD.
