After watching "Waco: Rules of Engagement," I just sat there, not believing what I was witnessing. Big cover by the FBI, massacre by fanatical government agents? I clearly remember the Waco standoff, I was 17 at the time, and I watched it all on CNN. I remembered thinking about all the children when I watched the burning of the camel mountain in April 1993. I remember how sorry I was for the children, but I felt that it was the fault of their evil leader David Koresh and the other Davidians. The Gazhetski film clearly and undoubtedly shows, although it is biased, that the FBI lied again and again. I think this film made a great contribution to the resumption of a new investigation into the incident in 1999. The results of this new investigation were in some sense predictable, the decision was based on a fact that was as gray as the facts that Davidian presented. I was very disappointed with the verdict, because, as far as I know, he did not take into account all the lies, misinformation and concealment of evidence from the FBI and other officials. Why no one can be held accountable for the fact that it impedes the work of investigators from the "Texas Rangers"? Why were they allowed to desecrate the crime scene and destroy the building shortly after the incident? These are questions that the government did not answer me. Most importantly, and children? In this new study, I was not told who was responsible for spraying flammable CS tear gas into the composition with many dangers for igniting this gas, and I did not find any answer to whether or not the children's muscles contracted due to the effects of the gas. were alive. If they had done this, I would, of course, have thought that Janet Reno or anyone who was ever responsible for the raid should be accused of mass murder or manslaughter. The question Gazezki raised, but not mentioned, Was this a direct plan for the responsible people and their tanks to cut holes and burn the building with intent? (a plan that would have been implemented with an efficiency of 112%) or the responsible officials were so incompetent that they did not know the consequences of their actions? Both are equally scary. Even if the Davidians set fire to the complex, the officials in charge undoubtedly gave them the opportunity to do this work. If the responsible officials knew how they claimed that the Davidians would set fire to the complex, then why? Did the tanks cut all the holes in the building, turning it into a furnace, and why did they have no plans to fight the fire, which they knew would happen? Dark questions that still will not disappear. The last and most urgent issue of this film is how the government demonizes Davidian through the media, which simply convey it to the public. I distinctly remember the resentment I felt for the evil Davidians I saw on CNN in 1993. Now that I’m older, I can see a clear line of communication emanating from the government every time they prepare to massacre civilians along with their intended goals. To demonize people with words like; “They have other illegal values ​​than we do”, “they do not enjoy freedom” and “they pose a threat to our freedoms and way of life”, so they are much easier to kill ????
