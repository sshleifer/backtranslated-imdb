One of those films that I happened to meet in The Criterion Collection, and, as usual, allowed myself to change the pace. This turned out to be a great solution. I was almost hypnotized by the quality of the film, the story he told, and how it was told. The almost minimalist feeling of the film with a rare dialogue and almost constant music only added a whole evocative level to the film. This is a really great movie to spend time with and enjoy.
