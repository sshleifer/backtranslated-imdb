I remember when this NBC mini-series went on the air when I was in high school. After reading the novel, I decided to check out some fixtures. I did not expect much from the TV mini-series, but now I may have to check it out. This is actually great, and the best possible film version. Writer Simon Moore, who wrote the TV show for the original mini-series Traffic, on which Soderbergh's film was based, came up with a brilliant narrative vanity that helps the story flow smoothly: he creates Gulliver's adventures as memories, with a real story starting with the fact that Gulliver returns home (it all happened in one trip). Gulliver, played by Ted Danson of Cheers, looks crazy when his wife, Mary Steenbergen, greets him at her home. Unfortunately, the house is currently owned by a local doctor, James Fox, who designs in Steenburgen. At first, Gulliver seems to be alarmed, but when he begins to tell stories about tiny people, that's all Fox needs to throw him into an insane refuge. All four travels of Gulliver are connected in this version in the same order as the novel (the only time it was made in the film). I like the way his current situation reflects his memories. Gulliverâ€™s little son, whom he had never met before, reminds him of the Lilliputians. Doctors who watch him in his cell from a mezzanine loom above him and remind him of brodingnags, and the scientific inquiries of doctors remind him of the insane scientific experiments and theories of Laputanians and professors at the Academy. Finally, when he is being tried, he is remembered of Hoynhns and Yahus. The cast of this item is amazing and includes Peter O'Toole, Ned Beattie, Alfra Woodard, John Gilguda, Kristin Scott Thomas, Omar Sharif and Warwick Davis. The biggest drawback of the mini-series is that the game is really uneven. You have all these wonderful actors, but the supporting characters are often played by actors who probably were good in the episodes of L. A. Low, but do not succeed in the drama of the costumes. Ted Danson is not particularly good, although he has several episodes in which he is superb. It is probably better that he did not try, but all the other characters in the film speak with an English accent. Steenbergen is actually pretty good, and overall not bad. Another disadvantage of the series is that the adventures take place too quickly. It is incredible that Gulliver spent eight years away from home, as stated. But, in general, he very well reflects the tone and purpose of Swift, and thanks to its structure adds a new emotional level.
