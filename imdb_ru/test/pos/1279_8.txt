An untidy man, known as Bill, lives in a small, dreary apartment with a Marilyn Monroe poster on the wall and his typewriter for the company. Only a man can not think of what to write. He wanders the streets after people, just to see where they are going. Maybe it will inspire him to write. He begins to follow a well-dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for several days. While in a cafe, a well-dressed man sits at a table on the opposite side of Bill and asks why Bill follows him. A well-dressed man says his name is Cobb. Then Cobb unexpectedly informs Bill that he is a robber, and even begins to take Bill to the houses to steal things; although Cobb insists he doesn't go to other people's homes just to steal. He says that he loves when people know that he is there, and interrupts what they take for granted. For example, he puts on panties from another theft in men's pants. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a movie is told in flashback. The director used this technique in abundance in his recent article "Memory". Bill ultimately decides to get a haircut and dress in a suit according to Cobb. At the club, he meets a blonde lady who met the owner, a bald man who is very dangerous, she says. We see a scene where a bald man uses a hammer, hence the men on the fingers of a man in Blondeâ€™s apartment. These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director is showing us, and they all fall into place when we come to an amazing conclusion.
