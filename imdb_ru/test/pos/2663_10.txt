I write this review right after I heard about the death of Stanley Kubrick. This is a big loss, and I write about 2001: SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel that this is an unsurpassed film of Kubrick, for which he will be remembered the most. This picture is not similar to any other, it not only revolutionizes science fiction, but also changes the concept of films. It was probably the first feature film in America that inspired George Lucas and many other authors and directors. <br /> <br /> In addition to visual grandeur, the film generates so much discussion and analysis, because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur Clarke, his coauthor, had a vision, but we never learned what was on their minds. Of course, what is in this “message” is that the technology of the future will capture humanity and determine the course of our life if we are not careful. The end of 2001 is one of the hopes, the version of our rebirth through the return of the star child to Earth. For many, this is meaningless, but astute movie lovers will understand. <br /> <br /> Although in 2001 there is no evil, dark humor DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his early work, such as PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel that he would have been most remembered for it. In any case, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous and artificial. It was half a decade in the making process at the time when Hollywood was still producing boring musicals and just woke up in a New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was an independent director who made great films on his own terms, at one time and for everyone else to be surprised. He will be bored.
