This film should be watched by as many people as possible because it is dedicated to human rights issues in Burma. When I first watched this movie in the mid-1990s, it completely changed my life. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or her democratic movement. It affected me, so I wanted to know more about the situation. Any film that might make you want to know more has done the right thing. Patricia Arquette is gorgeous as an American lady who, because of her personal tragedy, became reckless with her own life decisions and became involved in the ensuing conflict. This is a powerful film about a subject that deserves greater publicity. As the film itself says, the killing of activists for democracy in 1988 was not broadcast on television and therefore largely went unnoticed by the whole world. I beg everyone who reads these comments to find time to learn more about the current plight of the Burmese. <br /> <br /> It's time to release this movie on DVD. Is there anything you can do?
