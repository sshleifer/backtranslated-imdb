I saw the Gate of Heaven at their opening almost twenty years ago. The tickets were sold in advance, based on the fact that Kimino had been preparing for a long time to continue his 1978 masterpiece “The Deer Hunter”. Feedback came and critics smashed the film. An influential New York film critic led the way, and most critics followed suit, and 3 hours. 40 min The film was withdrawn from distribution. United Artists forced Cimino to cut the film in about an hour, and many months later it was reprinted with the same horrible reviews and dismal business. The film at that time cost about 40 million dollars (currently considered low-budget), which makes it one of the most expensive in history, and Cimino had free control over the project with endless repetitions, despite the fact that it was only his third film . The Deer Hunter also received a negative reaction based on an alleged political ideology that was not popular. I mention all this to present a possible bias against Cimino. At that time I thought the film was very good, and when I saw a shorter version, it was still very good, only to a lesser extent. The film reappeared in the museum in the early 1990s. They had to show a long version, but could not find an existing seal. However, after seeing the film years later, I now thought that the Gate of Heaven was a masterpiece. Finally, a long version began to appear in several select cities, I recently saw it, and it was worth it. Heaven's Gate begins with a graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the graduates, Chris Kristofferson and John Hurt, and we at an early stage revealed some of the shortcomings of their characters. Although Joseph Cotton gives graduates the opportunity to use their education to educate and improve their country, many graduates behave as if they are part of an elite country club. The film is 20 years ahead, in Johnson County in Wyoming. A cattle-breeding company called the Shareholders Association hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants, claiming they are cattle thieves. Christofferson maintains relations with immigrants, while John Hurt is a member of the Association. Although Hurt is completely against this insane act, he is too ineffective a character to do anything about it. There is a massacre, but immigrants are well protected. The United States Cavalry comes to the aid of the Association to allegedly arrest them after much of the damage was done when they actually sanctioned the massacre. Christofferson also suffers enormous personal losses, and the film ends with him several years later in the elite class of his Harvard days, when he married, missed the yacht, lived, but died inside. <br /> <br /> This is a very complex film that is great in every department, for example, in themes, structure, direction, cinematography, writing, music, editing, scenery and acting. Christofferson, Walken, Herth, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston, and Cotton — they all perfectly depict very complex characters. Some of the main complaints I read about this film point to an ugly, incoherent, too long expression, that the characters do not make sense, and the words are often illegible. In its defense, the Gate of Heaven looks like photographs of that period, as McCabe and Mrs. Miller did. Some scenes seem smoky to show an industrial revolution, and sometimes horses, carts, people passing by from all sides, creating a sense of reality. a lot.) But despite all this, the composition of each frame and cinema is impeccable. The film makes a lot of sense if you pay attention to it. For the viewer, not everything is spelled out, and you need to carefully observe in order to understand the motives of the characters or their themes. As for its length, it is a beautifully structured piece, sometimes moving, poetic, exciting or destructive, with almost one great scene following another. Sometimes some words are illegible, especially in some scenes where activity is boiling. But such a cinematic film can be understood using this language of cinema, the views between the characters or their actions. One day, this film should soon be reissued full-length so that people and critics can give it a second chance. Do not allow Michael Cimino to become another Orson Wells - underestimated during his lifetime and not capable of making those wonderful films that he is capable of.
