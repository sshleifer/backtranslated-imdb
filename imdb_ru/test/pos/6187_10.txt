For some perverse reason, best known to themselves, these IMDb boards seem reluctant to consider the great Billy Wilder to co-write scripts for at least two (this and Ninotchka) of his early classics when any amateur can find Wilder's hand at work . It so happened that this was the first time he had teamed up with Charles Brackett (who gets a loan), and it was a great start. One commenter said it was nice to see films of this type in old-fashioned cinemas, and I could not agree with that. In Paris, one of the small Houses of the Renaissance shows a more or less continuous retrospective of Lyubich in one of his salleys, and I am pleased to report that this played a very appreciative audience across the entire age range, although I doubt that any of them were alive when It was first released in 1938. The famous Wilder Joke, where cute ones meet, is especially tasty when a millionaire, but cautiously with him, Cooper tries to buy half the set of pajamas in a department store on the Riviera and meets sales resistance before Claudette Colbert appears and agrees to buy the other half. The gag is milked even more when, having exhausted the command chain in the store itself, the manager calls the owner, who is lying in bed, and leaves him to show that he, too, wears only the top half of his pajamas. The film is full of spectacles like this, balanced with verbal wit, which makes it almost perfect. Claudette Colbert is simply an amazing figure, and she receives excellent support from Edward Everett Horton as her impoverished titled father. David Niven in the fourth billing has some funny “deeds,” like Franklin Pangborn, and if Gary Cooper lacks his role, he lacks the verbal dexterity and sophisticated personality that Wilder's writers demanded at this stage of his career, you can’t everything and what you do is damn close to perfection.
