I like "Hack". Think "The Lone Ranger" reincarnated as a taxi driver of the 2000s, a decent but flawed guy in Philadelphia who tries his best to try to solve problems from a hectic past, and you get a quick overview. David Morse is almost perfect as Olshansky. He helps people, but instead of driving the Silver in the old west, he drives a taxi through the mean streets of modern Philadelphia, without handing out silver bullets. Supporting cast is first class and far above average. Sometimes a witty dialogue almost reaches the level of the 70s classic series The Rockford Files. This show deserves a return, I hope, at a better time than at 9 pm Friday (East).
