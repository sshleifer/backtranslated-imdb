I was surprised and impressed that this film was released in 1940, before the United States entered World War II. At first glance, making fun of something as solemn and terrible as Nazi Germany may be misinterpreted as ill-considered. But the brilliance of Chaplin does not boil down to a joke of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message would not have been almost as valid if it were not for the excellent use of humor in this film, along with moments of mixed dramatic drama. One drama would not have the bite and resonance that the film did. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hinkel) may be the best way to attack them, and laughing with someone (a Jewish hairdresser) may be the best way to love them. In the final speech of the Jewish hairdresser, I for a moment forgot that the war he was talking about occurred more than half a century ago. These are words that matter now and at any time of war. For this reason, I believe that the film did much more good than harm, as it still has the same profound effect today.
