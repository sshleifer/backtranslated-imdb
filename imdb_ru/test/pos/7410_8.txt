The thought provokes, humiliatingly depicts the human tragedies of war. A small but altruistic view of the interaction of one family with the enemy during the Kentucky Civil War. This film reduces the "glamor" of the war; showing that this affects not only the soldier, but also the whole family. <br /> <br /> In many contemporary films, war is shown as an opportunity to highlight “heroic” and other charming features of war, but very few attempts to show the true impact of war on society. This film is trying to retell the memories of a man of those days. It is argued that this film is a free translation of real events, whereas in reality this film probably represents the actual reality of hundreds, perhaps thousands of “real events” during the civil war. I highly recommend to anyone interested in our civil war to watch this movie.
