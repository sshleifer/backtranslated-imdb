This two-disc set is incredible! If you are like me and you have never had the opportunity to see the band live, then this is the next best thing. Jimmy Page, who, in my opinion, is the second best guitar player ever to live on the ground (second after Slowfinger himself), he has an amazing show on every episode of this film. John Paul Jones, though not as direct as Paige, arranges one hellish spectacle. Although in a lively atmosphere his rhythmic bass lines are not as defined as in studio recordings, except, of course, songs like Dazed and Confused or “What is and what should not be”), but his wide range of instrumental talents is well reflected in these dvd's. John Bonham - this is John Bonham, what can I say? There is no comparison, his hits stand out like no other, and this DVD is proof. Last but not least, Robert Plant screams like no one else can scream. If you have ever read Hammer of the Gods, you will be interested in what Page had had when he first met Robert Plant, why the hell was this guy no longer famous? And that ends my review, sorry for spelling or grammatical errors, Zeppelin swinging.
