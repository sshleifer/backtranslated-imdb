Screamers is an Italian fantasy film (L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce), bought by Roger Corman and released through "New Pictures of the World." Of course, Corman had to cut his initials on him so that one of his lackeys (Dan T. Miller) took a few extra shots before he released them in the states. <br /> <br /> L'Isola degli Uomini Pesce is a very interesting retelling of the island of Dr. Moreau. It is 1891, and Claudio Cassinelli was wrecked on a mysterious island with several recently escaped convicts. Claudio is confronted by the star Barbara Bach and Richard Johnson. Johnson plays the dastardly Edmund Rackham: a man capable of manipulating scientist Joseph Cotton, transforming the local local population into amphibious deep-sea diving creatures (they look like a cross between a Black Lagoon creature and one of the humanoids from the depths). ), having convinced Cotton that mutations are created for the highest scientific and humanitarian reasons. <br /> <br /> Having discovered the lost city of Atlantis, Rackham uses amphibious creatures to plunder his treasures. Sexy Barbara Bach plays Cotton's daughter, who has a psychic connection with these mutations. In one memorable scene, Bach swims at midnight with these mutants in a thin white cotton dress that gives little imagination. Claudio discovered that one of the prisoners with whom he had become friends turned into a gill creature, and then all of Hell was failing. <br /> <br /> Filmed at the same time and in the same place as Zombie 2, Richard Johnson did not even need to change the costumes between the films. The experiment house is the same house that Johnson uses to conduct experiments in Zombies 2. Let's talk about economic filmmaking! <br /> <br /> Additional material depicts several bloody decapitations (like Roger!) and ridiculously bad Cameron Mitchell making his best pirate imitation. What is missing is a parrot. <br /> <br /> Spanish name: Le Continent Des Hommes Poissons.
