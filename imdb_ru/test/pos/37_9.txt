This is definitely one of the best biopic films of late. I will go so far as to talk about this with Ray and Aviator. This is a story about a young, two-racial boy who lives in a boarding house run by the amazing Miss Rachel, known as the “nanny”. You will fall in love with a nanny, a woman who gives herself to others. S. Epata Merkerson revives the character perfectly, and the rest of the actors do the same. If I praised each actor for the way he played his role, I would mention everyone in the cast. <br /> <br /> The music in this film blends perfectly with the story, almost dictates how it goes. And what's more, this film is really interesting. You won't get bored at all, even for a minute! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to spend the evening at home, watching a very smart, very interesting, high-quality film.
