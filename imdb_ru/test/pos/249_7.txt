Rita Hayvort as Rusty Parker - the girl from the magazine “COVER” - she is one of the dancing girls in the club Danny McGuire, the most special in the opinion of Danny (Gene Kelly), and almost everyone who encounters her. Take, for example, Vanity magazine magnate John Kadeira (Otto Krueger): fascinated by the similarity of Rusty with her grandmother Maribel (also played by Hayworth in memoirs), whom he devotedly courted, fell in love with her, he tries to revive his youth, correct what he thinks gone wrong between him and Maribel. He does not believe that Rusty can give happiness or anything she should be entitled to - he even makes Danny believe it himself. When Grow Grows up to fame as the "Cover Girl" by Vanty, Danny drives her off into Noel Wheaton's ready and waiting hands (Lee Bowman). So what happens when Danny returns to the city with his assistant Genius (Phil Silvers) in tow, only to find out that Rusty is marrying Wheaton? <br /> <br /> Like a musical, COVER GIRL benefits from a beautiful musical score and written songs. Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, including Oscar-nominated Long Ago and Far Away (perhaps one of the most magnificent ballads ever written and beautifully sung in a duet by Hayworth and Kelly), Maribel’s Sure Thing (more Boring "Poor John" is not a Kern / Gershwin collaboration and Test Me. The dance is, of course, first-class, since Gene Kelly did not just participate in the choreography. This is shown in the simplest dances, for example, his dance with Hayworth “Test me”, or the joyfully plentiful number “Get your way to tomorrow” (played by the trio Danny, Rusty and Genius) ... which heralds the reaction of the character Jin to the policeman in the title in SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN. Kelly especially won the technological and artistic coup with the dance "Alter-Ego". Like his successors in the films Anchor AWEIGH and American in Paris (Jerry Mouse and 16-minute ballet, respectively), this dance is an example of the incredible innovations and creativity that Kelly brought to the modern cinematic musical: the desire to use the cinematic environment for the present dances that could not be demonstrated on stage, and a few years before CGI, Kelly insisted on dancing with one person who could match him in talent and style - himself. The number barely reaches five minutes, but it (and Kelly's genius) is still breathtaking, even after sixty years. That's why I watched COVER GIRL, and this dance is really worth it. <br /> <br /> You can say that a huge amount of money was spent on COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth - not that she doesn't deserve it. Look at the scene when Rusty gets on Broadway - on the big screen showing all the different girls on the cover, a stunningly large scene opens, set to enter Rusty. Hayworth is truly one of the most beautiful girls in the film, and she dances with style and grace that is almost worthy of Kelly. (Very few Kelly's colleagues have such an honor.) She is having fun in some scenes, for example, in her drunken scene, when John and Wheaton come for her from Joe. <br /> <br /> However, for some reason, her performance still lacks a spark of greatness that would help COVER GIRL overcome its general curse of mediocrity. This curse is lifted only whenever Gene Kelly appears on the screen (dancing or not), or when Eva Arden in the role of long-suffering secretary John "Stonewall" leaves with another sharp comment or clever observation. Since the film is ultimately owned by Hayworth, neither Kelly nor Arden can save him as a whole. This is not to say that a movie is bad - it is not. It's nice, with great songs and nice rooms and lots of beautiful girls to watch. But this is not really a classic. Although the dances are classic - so watch out for COVER GIRL and you will not regret it.
