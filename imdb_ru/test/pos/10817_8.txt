I found this DVD in the library and, based on the notes on the jacket, it looked as if it might be interesting: a black comedy, staged in France in 1940, just like the Germans entered the passages ?? ") But it is! It is a smart, original, intense and funny movie. I don’t remember to see something like that before? A foreigner or the USA. That a writer / director can find humor when we know part of the result (Germans will to occupy France for four years) is remarkable. The fact that he does it with such charm is part of the delight. What begins as a black comedy and does the fluff even end with a couple of serious moments ?? including the race for exhaling a cache of "heavy water" "(Which was part of the preliminary study atomic bomb) and a brief introduction to the history before the start of the Vichy collaboration government, which will govern southern France for most of the German occupation. * But do not let anything frighten you: the film itself is fun, charming and romantic, and there is a constant clip ahead. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this is a combination of actors that we have seen many times (Ajani and Depardieu) and others that we have never heard of before. Along the way there are two starry moves: Virginie Leydoyen and Gregory Deranzher. Both are impressive, but Mr. Deranger is especially. According to IMDb, was he in ten films before that ?? but he also received Cesar as the “Most Promising Actor” for this role, so obviously he was not so well known even in France. Is he a combination of a romantic hero and a comic actor ?? and it makes it all seem so easy. Can you be reminded of Cary Grant in "Raising a Child" and "Arsenic and Old Lace" ?? Comedy to act in movies is difficult, because the risk is huge, that the actor can break away, looking inept. But Grant did it charmingly, and this guy, too. I have to think that we will hear more about him in the future. <br /> <br /> Of course, not everyone will like this film? a bit of violence, although you don’t see anything on TV every day. But if you want something original, then, having seen it, you can feel that you have discovered a cinematic stone. <br /> <br /> * The so-called “spoiler” in this comment.
