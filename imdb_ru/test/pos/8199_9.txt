I admit my ignorance of the existence of this film, until I saw it in a cable outlet. I was very impressed with the film's innovative structure. The film, which is written in a language that I do not understand, illuminated me with intellect and nuances. I think it speaks of the quality of the film. It was visually stunning. The game was visually addictive. The Chinese theatrical traditions of the movement, used to enhance the dialogue, are so convincing after watching a Western film, where the actors traditionally pay more attention to the dialogue. The action in this film goes straight at you, without a lot of explosions, to get your attention. This is a human action that is so effective here. The added advantage that the film taught me stories about one of the greatest tourist attractions in the world, the funerary clay army of the First Chinese Emperor Qin, was very impressive. This seemed to give the film international relevance beyond the great ethical themes of the film. This is a film that I can comfortably recommend to a wide circle of friends and acquaintances.
