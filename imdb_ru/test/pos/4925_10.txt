You do not need to be a cartoon fan to enjoy this movie. I watched it for the first time when I was nine years old, being a fan of the T.V show, and my parents laughed as much as I did. This is done in the classic style of Bugs Bunny cartoons from yesterday, and, given today's vulgar cartoons, I would have thought that someone would appreciate a cartoon film that relies more on “wackiness” than on vulgarity to laugh a little.
