I can not believe that this film is only 7.4 points! It is certainly among the best Hitchcock films, such as VERTIGO or MARNIE. The only reason why I can think of why the bill is so low is that the person for the most part refuses violence and, of course, does not get the diploma "Sex and Crime." <br /> <br /> From what he takes his stress, this is not violence, but the reckless energy of these criminals who take the child from his parents and are ready to kill the child in case of failure of the operation. Today, having seen many hard-hitting films, such as Mel Gibson's The Redemption, this seems normal, but in the 1950s, when the whole family was in modern America, the thought of such a crime undoubtedly aroused emotions. <br /> <br /> And this tension still works for me, today. Yes, these guys are selfish, ignorant bastards, worried about how they act: for them it is a deal, and they want to be "good businessmen", ignoring the fact that business here is kidnapping children and killing politicians in the opera !! <br /> <br /> What makes a movie gorgeous is, nevertheless, these are creative aspects, Hitchcockâ€™s strange ideas, an outrageously disturbing scene in a church (which draws the viewer's attention to how lonely it is, how much nobody cares about the main characters, nobody It does not help, people in the church just go home ...), meeting with the owner of this store, stuffing and preparing dead animals (which emphasizes several "oriental" film talent from discoveries abroad), not least the role of MUSIC in this film. <br /> <br /> Here, the key principle is music, as *** SPOILER *** the killing of a targeted politician must be done at the exact moment of the loud orstra of the tutti / gong; so Hitchcock allows the camera to follow the score of the orchestra, and now it will happen in a second *** BENG *** And then, of course, DORIS DAY sing Que sera, which has become more famous than the film itself; she sings to notify the child that his parents are at the embassy ... <br /> <br /> In general, a classic!
