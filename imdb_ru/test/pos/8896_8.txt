As much as I did not want to disagree with the original poster, I found that Asterix and the Vikings are pretty good, and a HUGE step in comparison with previous attempts to revive everyone's beloved Gaul. <br /> <br /> For someone who is not familiar with the famous TV series comic, it would be difficult to follow the show, but for those of us who know, itâ€™s nice to watch. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the animation far surpasses previous comic adaptations. You can say that this time it took them time and effort to truly restore the look of the comics. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, there are elements of other Asterix titles in the film, and I see how these fans may seem confused or a little disappointed, but I was so surprised to see one of my favorite children's comics, reliably presented on the screen, and all my doubts were minor in comparison. Minor spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> Asterix and his loyal friend Obelix go north to save the nephew of the leader of their village, who was captured by the Vikings. The Vikings think that because the boy will teach them fear, they will be able to fly, thanks to some poorly worded advice from their village druid. In the process, the boy meets the daughter of Viking leader Abbu, and they fall in love, etc., etc., etc. D. ... If my explanation sounds confusing, do not worry ... The plot is easy to follow! Of course, a good buy .. You can purchase this DVD through Amazon France, but keep in mind that your DVD player probably won't be able to play it. I had to change the region settings on my computer to view it ..
