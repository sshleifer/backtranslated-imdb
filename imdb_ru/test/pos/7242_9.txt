Nemesis was the last book with Miss Marple written by Agatha Christie (the official final case of Sleeping Murder was written in the forties), and I always had a very soft spot for this. I liked the characters, and they lovingly brought to life in this superb BBC adaptation with Joan Hickson, more than ever, amazing like Miss Marple. <br /> <br /> In general, the book is very true. Several characters have been dropped, the first (new) murder is slightly different, and several new characters have been introduced. Personally, I felt that the extra character of Lionel Peel was unnecessary and rather annoying. Guide Madge was annoying differently, but often quite funny. Largely because of Lionel, I don't get 10 out of 10! The other characters are beautifully executed, especially Helen Cherry in the role of the worthy Miss Temple and all three strange sisters, but especially Margaret Tizak, who plays high roles in the role of Clotilde. She threatens to go over the edge towards the end, but just avoids it. Female bodyguards are also very valuable, and in this episode there is one of my favorite lines of Hickson ... "Archdeacon ?!" delightful nostalgia. Highly recommended.
