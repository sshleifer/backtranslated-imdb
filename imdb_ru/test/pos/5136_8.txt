I highly recommend this film to everyone. At first my son and I read a book, and then we watched a movie. Although the book was better (in my opinion), the film was still great. My son and I agree that although we like the version of the book most, we liked the final of the film more than the end of the book. The landscape is simply amazing, and the soundtrack is a must. The fact that Jimmy Buffett plays a small role and provides music is an added plus. Luke Wilson does a good job with the role of an officer Delinko, and that's exactly what I thought Delinko would look like when I read a book. I’m surprised that it didn’t work in cinemas and I’ll wait for the DVD to be released.
