It was a film that initiated a cinematic novel <br /> <br /> between the Yellow Eye team and Matthew Ferguson. His ability <br /> <br /> to portray relatively ordinary characters, such as Birkoff, in <br /> <br /> "La Femme Nikita" is balanced by his equally adroitly <br /> <br /> handling of strange characters. like "kane." I would like him to be given only <br /> <br /> more roles, larger roles and other, even more complex roles <br /> <br />, in order to expand the boundaries of their abilities. In this film there were <br /> <br /> four or five memorable scenes, and Matthew Ferguson <br /> <br /> stole two of them from more experienced actors. This movie <br /> <br /> is good in itself and worth seeing, but <br /> <br /> Ferguson makes it a little more special. His * ouevre * could eventually show <br /> <br /> what Anthony Perkins’s career could be like, <br /> <br /> if he hadn’t played Norman Bates for so long < br /> <br /> back. “Kane” is not as shocked as Norman, and far less people <br /> <br /> saw “Love and human remains” than “Psycho”, so we can hope <br /> <br /> that Ferguson will show give us some hint of what Perkins could have achieved if he were allowed to do it ...
