I have to say that I know Mr. Ornek's documentaries, and therefore I knew that I would get a very well-made piece of a documentary. I was not disappointed. Like a nerd of history, I saw hundreds of documentaries and I liked the other approach of this work. <br /> <br /> The director and his 17 consultants (historians, families of veterans) tried to gain access to the reality of Gallipoli through letters of solders from both sides. So, the story is followed by British, Australian and Turkish soldiers. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons and Sam Neill pass this document - both increase the intensity and emotionality of this documentary with their loud voices. <Br /> <br /> I saw this film in an Italian cinema in Dolby Surround. I bought a DVD last year and will wait another 3-7 years for the next work of this talented director and his very good documentaries. <br /> <br /> Summary: Well done. Intense. A story with emotions - wrapped in a military documentary with great storytellers
