Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are excellent in this image of the Vietnam veterans' home from the war, but still haunt it. Bates plays an ignorant mother who just wants the family to be a “family.” Shin is terrific as a father who tries to understand what his son is going through, but is too immersed in his principles to truly empathize. The settlement is Thanksgiving, and relatives go for lunch. Estevez, who plays the returning veterinarian, does not want to participate in family traditions and insists on wearing his combat uniform for lunch, explaining: "This is what I wore on the last Thanksgiving Day brittle peanut crisis ”, but the ending is exciting and terrifying. It needs to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> All in all, one of the best movies I've ever seen.
