Definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> Ten different directors present one of their favorite opera arias. You do not need to be an opera lover to watch this movie. (Although, of course, if you hate opera, you really will feel bad about it!) <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the segments range from brilliant to fair. It seems that most of this fuss is connected with the contribution of Godard - you think he is brilliant or pretentious, his part will not change your opinion. <br /> <br /> Some works have a clear narration; others are rather montage related images. <br /> <br /> None of the plays last more than 10 minutes or so; if you are not satisfied with what is on the screen, wait for the next segment and think about what culture you are absorbing. <br /> <br /> Watch Buck Henry, Beverly D. â€œAngelo, Elizabeth Hurley, Briquette Foundation, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt. (The Buck Henry segment alone is worth the price of admission). <br /> <br />
