It must be ccmovieman-1, because the New York Times columnist, who preferred the album “Big Brother Janis Joplin” and “The Holding Company” to the just-released Beatles album, was called evil or insane. National Velvet is a great movie. The performance of Elizabeth Taylor is simply fantastic, and I can’t see even a trace of the accent, or even less. Her performance is very natural, authentic and incredibly charming. The rest of the cast are great, especially Rooney and Revere. <br /> <br /> Since the dialogue is crazy or sentimental, I believe that cc dined on a diet of irony for too long and lost the ability to recognize true direct emotions and interaction with the person. There was a time when people really thought and spoke that way. Not that this film had a hint of magical penetration through it. This is the reason to tell a story. You can also criticize the Wizard of Oz, King Kong, Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, the Black Stallion (another great horse movie) or a thousand other movies for actions and dialogues that seem richer in real life. No, my friend, “National Velvet” tolerates because of his faith firmly in himself, with his tongue firmly in the cheek. Something that today's tortured filmmakers find it almost impossible to recreate.
