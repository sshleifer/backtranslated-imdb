Warning: there are some amazingly graphic images in this film, and children will never see it. <br /> <br /> The artist about whom this story really was was a wonderful Korean artist who rose from the lowest depths and became their greatest artist. Unfortunately, in many ways, this guy was an idiot in many ways. In part, it was an artistic temperament, and what might have seemed annoying was only his demanding character when it came to art. But sometimes he was just a drunk jerk - especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist. At the end of the film, his irritability, abrasiveness and unnecessarily cruelty seemed to diminish. Although all this did not make him a particularly good person, it is important to film him so that we understand the nature of the artist a lot. <br /> <br /> I really found the film fascinating, and I really liked how the actual works of artists were shown throughout the film (as in LUST FOR LIFE). I really would like to show this to my students (I teach at an art school), but I can't, because there is too much material for adults. Yes, there is nudity, but even more problematic for any audience (especially for young people), when he ... hmmm ... I don't think IMDb will even allow me to describe what happened, but it was very visual and includes bodily fluids . Not only a disgusting and disgusting scene that you should NOT have seen, but also a reason to prevent the younger one from watching this wonderful film. This is a real shame.
