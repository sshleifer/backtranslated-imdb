The duet of Abbott and Costello lives in this version of the classic story. Jack and the Beanstalk has everything you can see, music, magic and comedy all in one. Costello plays Jack's play after he listens to a story told by a boy once. We know that Jack was a poor boy who sold his cow "Dolly" for 5 magic beans. Well, he plants these 5 beans and they really were magical. He rises to the sky, sees a big castle there and sings a song, it is unknown that he will meet a giant (Buddy Baer). Not only he, he will dance with a woman who was also a giant. She will beat Jack elbows while dancing. That was funny! You have a playing harp that knows how easy it is to put a giant. Goose that lays golden eggs. And my favorite way Jack gets rid of the giant. He took an ax and began chopping a beanstalk. Another funny case is when the ax is stuck while fighting, and the final celebration occurs when people dance around the imprint where the giant fell. Very fun and fun for the whole family. Highly recommended! 5 stars!
