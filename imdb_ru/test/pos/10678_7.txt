One of my favorite films when he is, although I admit that I once missed him when he was at Foxtel last year. <br /> <br /> Despite the age of the film, it doesnâ€™t look that way, nor is the story, although it was done a thousand times before it still felt interesting. In this story, for me there were one or two little sensations, but I looked past them and just enjoyed the film as it was. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give him 7/10
