Hari Om talks about the impossible love between a French tourist and an auto rickshaw driver, who agrees to take her on a date with his indifferent boyfriend. This is a kind of road film about the third world, which goes back from the lush dreams to the comedy Madcap. He is distinguished by the star performance of Vijay Raaz, who became one of the busiest actors in India after his appearance as an organizer of events at Mso Nair at the Monsoon Wedding wedding. <br /> <br /> In an interview, Raaz turns out to be completely untouched by his success, rather carefully and thoughtfully answering questions. He discovered a love of acting and joined the main theater troupe when he studied at the university, but for a person with so much formal training, he is surprisingly insensitive to his craft. He speaks of honesty and purity as sources of his approach, and the seriousness of his desire to convey something genuine to the audience is obvious. On the screen, Raaz conveys emotional integrity and dramatic confidence, which raises his characterization to an extraordinary level, and the director Bharatbala played well and directed him. He has an amazingly expressive face that the camera enjoys; close-ups of this face are as irresistible as the shots of Camilla Natta, who is gorgeous as the French Isa.
