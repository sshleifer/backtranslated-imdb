It was fun to watch a new independent movie called “Half empty”. I usually go to the local cinema with my husband and feel that we were captured by the last sequel or prequel that Hollywood throws at us. Was it different and amazing ?? Much more interesting than all that Hollywood spends millions on advertising. When my husband and I go to the movies, are we going to have fun ?? and “Half empty” did just that, and the film did it in a smart way that made me feel that my trip to the cinema was worth it. This is a funny, human and sometimes amazing musical story that deftly entertains with its simplicity. I especially liked the scene with four men singing harmoniously in the bathroom. It is almost like operetta. This particular scene reminded me of a scene in The Phantom of the Opera, when the four performers were not easy, that is, they sang against each other in a friendly line. I am not a movie fan, but this film was more enjoyable than any other major studio film I have seen lately. This is silly, fun, interesting and funny. Totally enjoyable ?? This is what I expect from films, but rarely do they show as "Half Empty".
