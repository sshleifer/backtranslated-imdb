British director Christopher Nolan currently has a career in America and has a reputation as a popular and critically acclaimed film; but this little film was where he started. And this, of course, demonstrated his talent, with his amazing black and white cinematography and anchronical storytelling, which predetermines his later Momento, albeit in a less extreme form. Thematically and mechanistically, the plot reminded me of David Mamet's “Game House”, but the film still feels fresh and spicy, right up until the final turn of the final, the flavor of which was expected, but whose sharpness is surprisingly amazing. On the other hand, the acting is not quite the same class - the film has a stylized quality and, perhaps, more than the director intended. But this is still a wonderful debut, both claustrophobic and seductive.
