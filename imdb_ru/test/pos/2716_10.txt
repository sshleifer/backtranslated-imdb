I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue, despite the recommendations, discarding the film as an ordinary theme of extreme emotional dramas and incredible actions. <br /> <br /> From time to time, movies such as 15 Park Avenue appear and knock you off your feet. <br /> <br /> The film captures your attention quite early, and after that there is no time to rest. Aparna Sen did a wonderful job of sticking the audience to each line of the film. Impeccable character development, "just the right" number of emotions and a mysterious ending to match all this ... <br /> <br /> I have a new respect for Konkan Saint Sharma who convincingly plays schizophrenic Mitya. She again exceeded expectations after 3rd and Mr and Mrs. Ayer. The role of Professor Anjali is very well developed, and Shabana pays tribute to his character. Rahul Bose, Shefali Chaya, Waheeda Rehman add incredible flavor to the film. <br /> <br /> I define “moments of the soul” as thoughts about scenes from a movie that you think endlessly in the shower while your wife / girlfriend / mother knocks on the door. 15PA offers many “moments for the soul”, especially the conversation between Anjali and her mother, where the mother is careful when she talks with Anjali about her thoughts. This immediately reveals the personality of Anjali to an audience. <br /> <br /> The end is a very bold statement by the director; probably too pro-Western for an Indian audience; and yet provides elements for promoting a movie from “good” to “excellent” status.
