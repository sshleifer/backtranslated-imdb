Often, when TV shows are transferred to the big screen, they lose their appeal. Not in this case! Historical accuracy in costumes, equipment and general artistic direction, as in the series, is outstanding. A good example of comedy and farce, with excellent writers and comedians in the right parts. Based on the classic series, which stands apart in the history of the British television series.
