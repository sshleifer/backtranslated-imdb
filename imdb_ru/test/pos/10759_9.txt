This is an adaptation of the book of Dirk Wittenborn, which I did not read. Young Finn Earl lives with his mother Liz (Diane Lane) in a cramped apartment in New York. He dreams of joining his father, an anthropologist who studies a cruel tribe in South America. Liz has guys and she has a stake. when he gets caught on a Coca-Cola win for her, one of her clients (Liz is a legitimate masseuse), the wealthy Mr. Osborne, rescues her in exchange for constantly working as a masseur on his huge estate in New Jersey. They were taken there in a limousine, she was strung on the back seat, her dress was hooked up, and her panties were showing. (This and a few scenes with low-cut dresses are Miss Lane's only exploitation. Some of them may be disappointed, but I wish she had to do all these things in The Wrong to make the list. This lady has more talent in her pinky than Stripe, Roberts, and Sally Field in all their organs, and her time was given her due.) When they arrived, Finn made friends with Osborne's grandson Bryce and came of age with his new girlfriend, Maya's granddaughter. Liz, meanwhile, joins AA and meets with Dr. AA. It is miraculously cleaned instantly. Finn, however, uses a lot of drugs along with his new friends. Bryce seems like a good guy, but he becomes jealous when Osborne takes Finn in his place in a balloon race, and this leads to tragedy. <br /> <br /> The genius of the story (and the film) lies in the fact that they are from the cruel acts of the fierce, dirty, rich Blizdale tribe to the warriors-yanomano. Although it is a little implausible that when Liz finds out what happens to her son, she simply demands actions from Osborne and does not associate with the authorities, nor decide them in the style of Thelma and Louise. There are elements of the Gothic novel with the revelation of the village idiot. Also, they almost do not develop scenes or characters before moving to Blysdale. Liz, for example, as Lane Kantrovitsa's Pearl in "Walking on the Moon", had an unwanted pregnancy with Finn at the age of 18 and felt trapped. It's in the book, but not in the film. However, these are minor flaws. The film will be released in full 12/31/05 a year after the original release date, and I just could not wait. <br /> <br /> In the theater there were many moments with red carpets that I saw the film, with almost all the actors ... except Diane Lane !! $ #% # Q $ Director Dunn said she was making a movie. I know that she did not promise to be there, but I came from another city, and it would be very nice to see her in person. The film is definitely the best contender for the picture, as for acting? Sutherland was pretty good, like the boy who played Finn. Lane, as always, was gorgeous, but I remember only one or two emotional scenes when she catches Finn with drugs “let's play together, mother and son” and with Osborne “your perverted grandson ...”. She would be better if the actress nodded, but it would not work. if they don’t give her her “work”.
