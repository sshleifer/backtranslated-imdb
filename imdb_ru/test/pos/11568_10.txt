After the success of the “Little Muppets,” Warner Brothers recorded “Tiny Toons”. But instead of doing Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and all the other children from the Looney Toon gang, they created new animal characters who were children with their own distinctive features, but personalities that nevertheless reflected their predecessors. Among the main characters were Buster & Babs Bunny (no relation, which became their traveling gag or catchy phrase), Plucky Duck, Hampton Pig, Dizzy Devil, Shirley 'Loon, Elmira, Montana Max, Furball, Sweety, rats and various animals of Perfecto Prep and the original characters of Looney Toons. "Tiny Toons" lived at Acme Acres and attended Acme Looniversity, where the Looney Toon gang worked as teachers who served as mentors for the younger generation, coming in and out of the comedy. <br /> <br /> During the show, various pot shots were made in SR Bush. administration, pop culture and in combination with various other jokes and cheats. <br /> <br /> Buster & Babs, perhaps the main characters of the series, as mentioned above, were similar to Bugs Bunny in some respects, but they also had their own distinct personalities and comic styles, namely, Babs’s tendency to give out himself for everyone and everyone, while Buster, able to be self-confident, usually played a direct man (or straight rabbit) on Babs' antics. Plucky Duck was a virtual copy of Daffy Duck (not a baseball Daffy, but a selfish character Daffy), with almost as big an ego as Daffy, and the same obsessive idea to push Buster & Babs, like Daffy with Upstaging Bugs. in his attempts, but still he remained strangely attractive. Hampton was an even more shy version of Porky Pig, and he had the ungrateful task of playing Porky with Duffy Plowy. Shirley, the blond duck, was a girl from the valley of a new era in which Plukey entered and left the phases of ridicule or rivalry for her feelings. Dizzy was the purple version of the Tasmanian Devil. Furball was a quiet Sylvester, and Sweety was a pink bird Tweetie. There was also a purple skunk woman who craved a guy, and a pint-sized version of Wile Coyote and Road Runner. Evil was defined in the form of Montana Max, a rich child who always tried to make money or make people's lives miserable. There was also Elmira, the irresponsible animal lover, whom everyone feared. And there was also Godo Dodo, a strange creature that did not have a clearly defined type, except that he was from "Strange Land" or something like that. <br /> <br /> Among the mentions of pop culture was Batman. (quite often actually), Michael Jackson, Vanilla Ice, Dances with Wolves, Indiana Jones, Star Trek, Supergirl, fast food joints, Ten Commandments, Twilight zones, Saturday night live and even Simpsons, among others. <br /> <br /> Not only funny, but also managed to be warm and touching, which his successor, Animagnac, never achieved. Also follows Taz-Mania.
