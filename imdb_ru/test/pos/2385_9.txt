I am a talent manager. I have been for 15 years. I discovered a wonderful talent. They were in film, commerce, braodway and television. In my opinion, Eddie Monroe was played wonderfully. I love to see the abilities of real people. Not just a name. The actors in this film were very natural and believable. This film made me very entertained. I love the movie with a few twists and turns. I also like it when the puzzle is solved at the end of the movie. I still would like to know what happened to a large amount of money. (When you see the movie, you’ll understand what I’m saying.) Do all the gangsters look real ???? I would like to see this movie on the big screen. Frames were shot very well. The landscape of New York was New York, which I know. Happy 2006, and let this film receive awards.
