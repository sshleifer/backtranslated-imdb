What can I say? The small child inside always had strong attachments to the next ... giant robots, giant monsters and a giggling, megalomaniac villain, and this film is bearing fruit in all its articles. As an adult, itâ€™s easy to point out many of the flaws in this film and say, hey, this is actually just a series of episodes from a children's television series, joined together. Despite all this, I find the ending very moving, and the content is surprisingly adult in nature. Terrific fun, although sometimes a bit pointless.
