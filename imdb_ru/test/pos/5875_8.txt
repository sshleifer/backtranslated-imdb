This film went in and out of fashion more often than a miniskirt. Triumph in the post-war period, it was almost forgotten by the 1970s, except for the students of cinema. Recently, he began to receive recognition as perhaps the most impartial idea of ​​the integration of soldiers into the post-war life ever created (and this most definitely includes films such as Deer Hunter). I like it, but my overall rating is somewhere between these extremes. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Three completely different servicemen who gathered after the Second World War (Great!), Fly home to a city in the Midwest and try to resume or create civilian life. One is disabled, the other is waiting for him to work comfortably, while the other has nothing left but determination. <br /> <br /> There are good, but unfortunately, unequal figures. Fredrik March was named the best actor Oscar for his role as an old sergeant who returns to work at a local bank. Personally, I think that Jimmy Stewart deserved it for “This is a wonderful life,” which also deserved an award for the best picture, but, obviously, this film affected the post-war audience. As I said, it was fashionable. In March, there is one fantastic scene, a humorous speech that resembles a somewhat similar incident involving the real hero of the Second World War, Pappi Boyington, and otherwise he is solid, but not impressive. <br /> <br /> I am going against the grain, but I thought that Mirna Loy, who played the March wife, was justly ignored by the Academy. I barely noticed a hint of warmth from her. In fact, I kept thinking that she was going to hit Frederick Marsh for annoying her. She practically grimaced every time they were together. Something was definitely lacking there, in her forced smiles and in her spirit of tolerance, not joy. I think that all this nonsense that she is an “ideal wife” is correct only if you think that the housewife of the 1950s is your ideal. You may not agree with this, but the voters of the Academy, apparently, did not. She is the main problem with this film, horribly missed. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews, a former jerk who became a war hero, and then again behind the counter, is amazing. He is burdened with his wife, who apparently married him right before he went to war for all the wrong reasons, and his future looks bleak. But then he stumbled upon Martha Peggy’s daughter (Teresa Wright, in a fantastic twist), and the fireworks exploded. Both are great, but then again the unevenness that permeates this film. Some moments of pure soap opera invade, focusing on the entire time of the classic line, "I'm going to destroy that marriage!" Romance inspires and reflects the general state after the war - the return of servicemen gaining love upon return. <br /> <br /> Speaking of elevation, we approached Harold Russell. He has the naturalistic quality of his action, or it is inactive, which sounds as true today as no doubt then. Taking a pure approach to his situation, he inspires. His best scene, one of the best in the whole movie, is when he takes the girl who loves him to her bedroom to show her the truth about his condition. "I was lucky, I still have elbows, unlike some boys." Really cool stuff. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the film that take off. It also has some points that belong to the soaps of the day. Take the good with the bad and see this top score.
