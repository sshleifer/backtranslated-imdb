Starting the 1970s Blackploitation era, CONRACK (20th Century-Fox, 1974) offered the audience modest, sincere and ordinary people, a kind of drama. Offering a completely different fair for its audience (which was much more general than those of "Gansta"); being a ghostly dose of realism, which offered a lonely counterbalance to these shooting "sighs". <br /> <br /> REPLACEMENT of the main characters who were bad detectives, super-flies and mega / poppies / pimps (Choose terminology) was a lonely, modest and meek teacher. The academic we are talking about is the main character, Pat Conroy; this is the only single teacher hired to take responsibility for a kind of one-room schoolhouse on an island off the coast of South Carolina. <br /> <br /> “Conrac” (John Voight), a name that young people call him, finds conditions in school terribly backward. In addition to the physical properties of this “Little Red School House,” any systematic and gradual educational system was completely absent. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, by the way, we mentioned that further complications for any successful education. The enterprise manifested itself in two irrefutable facts. It was that Pat Conroy was also an outsider, and he was white; almost the entire population of this offshore reef was black and very poor. <br /> <br /> OVERCOMING these unacceptable and deplorable conditions were the agents of the local board of education; being a school principal, Mrs. Scott (Madge Sinclair) and superintendent, Mr. Skeffington (Mr. Hume Cronin). Between them, we are given to understand that the teacher, being a base man on the totem pole, is in many ways powerless to influence any meaningful, long-term improvements. <br /> <br /> BUT not you are telling a “young Turk”, such as Pat Conroy, that he cannot. (Nothing can be). Conrac holds a year of unorthodox classroom performances and is making real progress; but, alas, a teacher with a strong head does not give up and does not recognize the authority of his superiors. While he, by law and unbeknownst to him, serves in super pleasure; he disobeys Mr. Skeffington’s specific order and the prohibition to take his class children to the mainland of South Carolina on Halloween for some Trick or Treat; even go for the insolent act of stopping with them at Skeffington's residence. <br /> <br /> FURTHER, we see a Western Union Telegram envoy, happily singing when he crosses from the mainland of Carolina to the island; where he sends a telegram to Conroy informing him of his dismissal from this school and district. <br /> <br /> NO, so that someone could dismiss him from his bed, Pat filed a lawsuit against Mr. Skeffington, Director Mrs. Scott and the Board of Education protest against his dismissal as illegal. The judge impartially considers both the "offense" and the law, and asks Skeffington if there are any lesser punishments that could replace Conroy's separation from the school system; to which he receives a negative response. Suitably, the judge dismisses the lawsuit, knocking with a hammer, saying: “It’s very simple!” the phonograph gives us the 5th SYMPHONY of Beethoven; which played an important role in the educational program of Conroy, as well as in our history. <br /> <br /> In the humble opinion of this author, the story (which, in our opinion, was at least semi-autobiographical, even giving the Protagonist the name of its author), was much more than a story about a localized incident. And me, and friend Schulz, and me; This is a kind of image of the microcosm, which is the deplorable conditions that permeate public schools throughout the country. (Just an opinion) <br /> <br /> As regards this film, it was just one of many films telling about the shops of ordinary people; leading their lives of "quiet despair" in the great inland areas of the country that are outside of the District of Columbia and the urban business and communications centers located on the Atlantic or Pacific coast. <br /> <br /> IN OWN OWN A little way, this is an excellent film that will soon be attached to the repositories of the 20th Century-Fox film with such great works as NORMA RAE and BREAKING AWAY. (both from TCF in 1979). <br /> <br /> LOOK if you haven't done it yet. Recommended by both Schulz and his friend. * <br /> <br /> NOTE: * Of course, it's me! <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
