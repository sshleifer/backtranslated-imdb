This show is really great. This is smart. It's funny. It's great to play and write. This show is really the fastest show I've ever seen. Dialogues are really funny and well conducted. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel have excellent chemistry. You really believe that they are mother and daughter. This show really showed that the relationship between mother and daughter doesn't really have to be just mother and daughter, they can be best friends, but at the same time it shows that it is sometimes difficult to be more than just mother and daughter, especially with Lorelai and Emily. Just watch this show, I highly recommend it. This is a great and definitely the best show on the air. Season 7 stars Tuesday, September 26, 2006, 8 / 7c on the new The CW
