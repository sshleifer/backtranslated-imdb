I’m strangely attracted to this film since I saw it on Showtime somewhere in the early 80s. I say strange, because it is a rather ridiculous piece of soft fluff, a genre that does not particularly interest me. The dialogue is pompous and senselessly philosophical (it makes sense, no doubt, only for French-Italian producers) the plot is completely foreign. What he wants is a surprisingly hypnotic and completely pleasant mood. The scenery (beautiful Philippines), soft-focus nude and wonderful scores all contribute to a strange and watchable exercise in the form of film production that is rarely seen today. This is really one of my "pleasures". I was lucky to find it on the old laser disc and watch it more often than I think it’s great. Decent mood.
