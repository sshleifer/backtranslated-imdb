I just have a chance to delve into Austin's past films, and I realized this because “Persuasion” was, was and always will be my favorite work Jane Austen, and Ann Elliot my favorite heroine Austen. So I very impatiently inserted the disc into the player. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed either. I knew that there had to be some flaws, so I will set them out and try not to be too fat about them. Ann Elliot - the most closed of Austin characters; she is the least talkative and least witty. There are passages in the book in which Anna says nothing - only her feelings are described. It works great in print, but how to successfully transfer it to the big screen? Except for thoughtful behind-the-scenes comments (which will be tedious for four hours), you will have a long line of shots where the heroine says little or nothing, and you have to communicate with all your facial expressions. This may leave a feeling that the film is slow and has no purpose. If you need a more outright Austin style, then this film is definitely not for you; but if humility is more your style, and you tend to perceive unspoken “vibes”, this will meet all expectations. <br /> <br /> Ann Firbank (as Ann Elliot) is, fortunately, an actress whose face can convey a lot. She looked like I always thought Ann Elliot would look like: not by knockout — Ann shouldn’t have been elegant in the family — not in her youth — which is also sometimes emphasized by lighting and makeup. What you see is someone very similar to Austin's character: the one whose appearance you could pass on one day; but listen as she speaks and take a look, and she becomes more attractive the better you know her. This is Ann Elliot, as Ann Firbank revived her. <br /> <br /> Brian Marshall skillfully handles the image of Captain Wentworth. Bitterness is never obvious (except on the concert stage); and, yes, it was hard for me to believe that he made sure that Louise Musgrove was interesting, as she was shown. But this is another point in the book of Austin: he did not find it interesting, he tried to find it interesting and, in the end, failed (sigh of relief). So it also fits in with Austin's original story. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the image of Lady Russell, who, it seemed to me, did not look REALLY bad in the book; it also comes out in this adaptation. <br /> <br /> So this is one movie that followed the book closely; I could write a lot more about how exactly everything was reproduced, but I would not have enough space here. Charles Musgrove remained one of the most cheerful characters (very fun), Mary was the most annoying (I died when she was just shut up - but I also had the feeling when I read the book), captains and admiral, whom I thought was charming . <br /> <br /> Cinematography, it seemed to me, was a bit stiff. There was little or no fading from one screen to another — perhaps because of the fact that it was a television film. One scene - CHOP! - the next scene, the actors enter on the right, go to the left and - CHOP! - another scene where the same thing happens. It was the only part of the film that deceived me a little. I suppose a low budget should show up somewhere. <br /> <br /> And, as I said earlier, if you like to keep up with Jane Austen, don't worry about it, as you are too slow. However, I liked it very much, as there were a lot of details in it (the scenery was incredibly elegant!) For the excellent adaptation of my favorite Austin novel. I highly recommend it!
