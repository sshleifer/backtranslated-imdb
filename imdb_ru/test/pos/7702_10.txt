Excellent thriller, acting at the highest level, and the plot makes you guess. This well-played and directorial film is based on a true story and is worth it for Joe Penny to play very well, and Ann Gillian is convincing as a worried and scared sister. Joe once again proves that acting is amazing, and the finale is great. Worth a look, I hope they will repeat it soon on any channel, I will definitely write it down. For fans of Penny and Gillian, this is well worth your time. Rent it, if you can better try to buy it, I'm going. The perfect thriller of the early nineties, watch this <br /> <br /> movie, that's great.
