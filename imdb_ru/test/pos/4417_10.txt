Loved today's show !!! It was a variety, not just cooking (which would be great too). Very stimulating and fascinating, always forcing the viewer to look around the corner to see what will happen next. She is as down-to-earth and personable as you, as one of us, which made the presentation even more enjoyable. Special guests, who are also friends, were also pleasantly surprised. I really liked the “first” theme and the fact that the audience was invited to play. I have to admit that I was shocked to see that she entered her deadlines for several reasons, but she did it, and damn it, I will write these recipes down. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with the family. Those who have not yet tuned in will know which channel and at what time, I assure you, you will not be disappointed.
