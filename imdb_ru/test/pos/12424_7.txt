In the veins of the Jeepers Creepers and the Texas Massacre the Monster Man chainsaw is surprisingly well-made - albeit mindlessly - a little horror. Add a little friend comedy, sweet blood and strong fear. It's hard to say that Monster Man is really interesting. The low budget seems rather obvious, but it did not affect the presentation of the film as a whole and confused the larger budget horror films. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is somewhat common. A couple of girlfriends, Adam (Eric Jungman) and Harley (Justin Urich) ride over rough terrain to interrupt the wedding of the woman that Adam has always loved. While Adam is a more know-it-all, Harley is a self-proclaimed lady and very offensive chatter. Adding a bonus to the plot, they picked up the sexy hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Things turn into a nightmare when they are haunted by a monstrous car with a scary face. When a dead body begins to count, they must race for a time before their own life is at risk. <br /> <br /> The plot is clearly reminiscent of many previously known horror films, but Michael Davis as a writer and director succeeds in maintaining tension. Panic is built quite well, where the characteristic is never the best, but pretty good. The screenplay also abounds in comedies that work for fun moments, and they are quite enjoyable, rather than annoying, and also await a turn in the final. At the same time, it's fun and shocking, which is pretty funny. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Monster Man is amazingly interesting. This deserves more attention on the big screen. This proves that a large budget does not make an effective horror film, but the skill does! What the director showed and delivered.
