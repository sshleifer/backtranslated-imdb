This video, released by MGM in 1936, demonstrates the talents of its two young stars under contract, Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin. In a sense, these short films were commercials in which new talents appeared in front or behind the camera. Felix Feist filmed this scene, which became a way to popularize two talented stars. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty simple. An orchestra that is entertained in a public park every Sunday does not receive the attention it deserves. Introduce two music fans, Judy and Edna, who love to listen to a band playing under one of their grandfathers. The two elders of the city, who believe that there is no public in this type of entertainment, decided to cancel their Sunday concerts in favor of a more popular orchestra, which will attract a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Two girls go on their own promotional tour, which does what they only know, calls and runs errands and helps their neighbors in exchange for the promise that they will attend a concert at the park next Sunday. Well, this day is coming, and, to their surprise, hardly anyone comes when the music begins. Both girls decide to go about their business and ask the conductor to play a song for them. The result is obvious: people all over the park flock to listen to talented young singers, thus ensuring the existence of an orchestra. <br /> <br /> Of course, the only attraction of a short film is the inspired singing of two stars that are beautiful in their performance. Miss Durbin’s operatic voice blends well with Miss Garland’s natural voice, creating a beautiful duet. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it when it is shown in TCM!
