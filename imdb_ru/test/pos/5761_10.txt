This film had some very funny moments. The above sketch for beginners. <br /> <br /> Those parts where Rick is trying to act with dignity, in front of his guests, looking at them through his nose. Very finely made, especially as the guest was an adulteress with a toffee. <br /> <br /> The scene where Rick finds out that Gina has a fiance: â€œ. with his 2 candle eyes. As if she really loved him. But he believed it. That's why it was so funny. Chic moment. <br /> <br /> Gino is great too. He should have been used more like a bad person. "Where are the whores I ordered!" he roars the shiny material.
