This is a soap opera based on the idea of ​​applied ethics. A film about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good film. I didn’t get any emotions from this, the ideas are not new at all, there is no tension, it becomes tedious by the second half, but by the end I think it becomes a rather interesting burlesque way. I mean, you have a paralyzed, bald, middle-aged boy who has more women than don Juan. It seems that he does not suffer as much as one would expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years, he has no problems with God (and, probably, this can also be expected), the people around him seem to be ideal slaves ( I can’t forget about Bergman's “Cries and Whispers”, similar in many respects, which just overwhelms emotions, and not all of them are humane), etc. This film is the perfect recipe for housewives who are looking for some emotional acuity but don't expect to be torn down. This film is worth seeing in the midst of all the cynicism that we are witnessing today, for its sincere intention to present a contemporary ethical problem without any desire to awaken the viewer. Amenabar does not rub your face and does not take sides, he does not want to make us fanatics for a particular idea. However, I have no idea why this film is so highly regarded.
