This is a fantastic movie. The acting is one of the best I've ever seen. Tatyana Samoilova is obviously very beautiful, and she automatically draws you into the movie with her believable game. Cinematography was extremely ahead of its time. Watching this, I could see the parallels of cinematography used today. This is a truly innovative film. Due to cinematography and acting, viewers can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone changes in the setting of the film. This is a very touching and powerful thing. My friend told me that this is a must see, and I definitely agree with her. This is one of those films that you watch and will never forget. Everyone should see this very exciting movie. This should be included in the list of “Movies to watch before ________ (whatever)”.
