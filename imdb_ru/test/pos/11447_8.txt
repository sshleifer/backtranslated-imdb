“Night of the Demons” (1988) was another one in a long line of “teenage” horror films that were released on video and pay-t.v. during this eighties movie mecca. But unlike most of the shit that sold, it was a really decent watch. A group of bored "teenagers" decide to have a Halloween party with a pair of fancy sisters (Mimi Kincaid and Linni Quigley) in the infamous Hull House. Your usual set of stereotypical teens are invited to a party. But the usual teenage blow turns into a night of terror, when they try to survive on Halloween night, when they, the undead, the residents of Hull House, decide to have a party. Who will survive this night of bloodshed and horror? <br /> <br /> A good horror movie that is best viewed in an un-rated version. If you look R-Rated, then skip all the effects of splashes and nudity. Stay in touch with a funny epilogue! A terrible film, followed by an equally entertaining sequel. Only for horror lovers! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
