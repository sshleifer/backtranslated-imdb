I saw this short film on HBO the other day and I really enjoyed it. Eight different characters, eight different points of view. At first, I was confused by how the story moves, but then I realized that it was only one scene that was shown again and again, just to show us the different perspectives of the characters. <br /> <br /> At first you think the clerks are screaming at a teenager for theft. They speak their own language, which I (and Chris teenager, which Eleonora Hendrix convincingly played) cannot understand. The prospect of clerks dispels this view. Until the last two scenes, I did not realize how good this short film was. <br /> <br /> An excellent short film. We hope that director James Cox will be able to transform a short film into a full-length film with the same cast or conquer us with a completely new film. <br /> <br />
