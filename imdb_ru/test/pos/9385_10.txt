This is seriously one of the best low budget films I've ever seen. I'm not the one who can stand up and cheer on the film, but this one was definitely worth it. Obviously, the premise is that there is a bed that eats people, well ... eats - this is a subjective term, I suppose it really gives off acid bubbles to suck up victims in itself, and dissolves them in acid perfection. The best part of this movie is that William Russ is one of the main characters. The typical family man actually began his career with this film ... and afro. There is a lot of nudity in this movie, so obviously not for kids, but that shouldn't keep anyone from watching this movie. I am sure that at any moment in life everyone needs a small Death Bed, it is better to get it sooner rather than later.
