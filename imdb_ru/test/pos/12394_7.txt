I blow hot and cold over the carne. He really can be a mystery to me. I think that perhaps his inspiration left him a little earlier than for other directors of his generation. Of course, a man who reached maturity in the thirties with the Popular Front in the fifties feels at ease in France with its unrestrained commercialism and strong American influence. He is almost thirty years older than his young stars, and it shows. Party scenes go on much longer than they should, as if he was trying to gain time for an anemic scenario to work. The character of Rolan Lesaffre - he plays the elder brother Pascal Petit - seems to exist only to assure the director that his ideas in the old style still sound. <br /> <br /> In two hours this picture is too long. However, let me praise Pascal Petit for her gaming performance; she was a natural person who had to challenge Brigitte Bardot for superior sex sweat, but somehow lost her way. Andrea Parisi is also excellent as a girl who got pregnant and wants Charrier to marry her and make her baby legitimate (yes, they still thought so in the fifties). Laurent Terziev is the only French actor who could convincingly play the anarchist: he is great because he saves the cat from death, and then notices that he cannot tolerate cats. Jacques Charieu just reminds me how much he was a mediocre actor, with this constant little smile and empty eyes.
