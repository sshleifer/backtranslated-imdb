My sister, friend and I went to see this movie for my birthday on September 24th. We all saw the first film "Jackass" some time ago, and we all enjoyed it. We were looking forward to the second issue. <br /> <br /> We were not disappointed. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, I laughed hysterically. However, this is a shocking and funny equal part, and definitely not for those who have a weak stomach. This is obscene, but it is also innovative American cinema ... well, perhaps this is too much praise for the film, where men intentionally tie their scrotum to ice sculptures, but this is amazing in the sense that it shows us foul language whether we like it no, things that no other decent American film released across the country would dare to show us. <br /> <br /> There was only one scene, which, in my opinion, was unnecessarily obscene, and the horse was involved in it - I will not go into details. <br /> <br /> I laughed, almost shut my mouth and almost cried (due to the physical reaction to the scene with the leech and the eyeball, and not sadness). In my humble opinion, “Jackass: Number Two” is a film from '06. <br /> <br /> Does that make me a donkey? May be. But if this happens, I would not care.
