I was glad that this film didnâ€™t do with the estimated depth of too many pseudo-serious interracial films. The race was one problem, yes, but just like a class ... and loyalty ... and honesty, etc. <br /> <br /> I also liked the idea that love intrigue was not expressed solely in aspects of the appearance of any character. unless our divorce courts (on both sides of the Atlantic, I suppose!) are not filled with enough couples who think they "look good." together.' Is this all you need to make a strong marriage? in any case, the tenderness and sensuality of both characters were thick enough to crash into love scenes that would bring a rainbow on any dreary day! in other words, a frivolous film that is by no means easy!
