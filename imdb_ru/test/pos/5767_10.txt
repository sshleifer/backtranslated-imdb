This is probably the most fun thing I've ever seen - from beginning to end, it was perfect in time, atmosphere, raisins, background music, combat episodes and in all other possible aspects that you can think of. To be honest, I find this film as funny as their (Rik & Ade) sitcom "Bottom" - perhaps even funnier. I constantly laughed throughout the film and can only advise to watch this film ... However, if you watch it without knowing (or not loving?) What type of comedy Rick Mayall and Ed Edmondson did before, you might not think that that's all - but I DON'T really understand those who don't like it - IT'S HUMOR !!! (People get hit by pans, guys run around in red rubber underwear, green vomit fills the corridors, guys kick their feet on the head and get candlesticks in their eyes - HOW can this NOT be funny ???) 10/10
