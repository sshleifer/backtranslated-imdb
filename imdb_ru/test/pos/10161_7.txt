“The Man Who Knew Too Much” falls into the middle of Hitchcock, who characterized many of his films in the 1950s: not a masterpiece of obscurity in any way, but still very fun. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day play a resting couple that is bogged down in a conspiracy filled with foreign intrigue. The famous climax scene takes place at a concert of classical music, where someone will be killed during a certain collision of cymbals in the score. Angry Hitchcock, of course, lets us know what that point is, so the race to stop the killer turns into a tough race against the cymbalist. <br /> <br /> Many of this movie reminded me of the 1978 Chevy Chase. / Goldie Hawn comedy "Obscene play" that I have to believe that the film was inspired by it. No movie is important, but easy to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Rating: B +
