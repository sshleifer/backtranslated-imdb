This small, quiet, harmonious film turns into a masterpiece of human dignity. It is intellectually structured, filled with meaningful small details and important side plots. He tells the story of a single person with great humanity, who does not position himself politically, but encourages life as a precious right (not an obligation) and emphasizes the human right to choose. He enjoys the richness of various landscapes (mental and physical) and languages ​​(important detail). Outstanding play of every actor, especially the incredible Javier Bardem. His presence on the screen is so powerful that you forget that it is fiction. The film has a wonderful rhythm, it is beautifully shot and perfectly shot. It takes real talent to make a film on such a complex topic with understanding, humor and heart. Six stars out of five.
