I had no idea what I was going to experience when watching this old film from 1940. However, I always like to watch Laryn Day (Katie Lattimer), who plays the role of Jean Muir's younger sister (Helen Lattimer), as well as their mother, Billy Burke, (Mrs. Julia Lattimer). I think it will be boring for me to talk about two sisters and mothers who overly protect their daughters until they meet with Robert Cummings (Ridley Crane), who is reputed to be a millionaire playboy who has a lot of girls and is a drunkard who parties all the time. One night, Helen Lattimer goes on a date with Ridley, and he starts getting bombs out of his head and just can't drive his car. It is at this point in the film that he becomes a drama and changes the overall direction of this film, which will definitely keep your attention right up to the very end of the film.
