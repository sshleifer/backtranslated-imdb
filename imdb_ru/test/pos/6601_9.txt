Right there. A good, interesting and accurate era is felt in most scenes. Variations of personality are enough to reach real people in those days, without being distracted from exceptions. The photographs depict Peralta from Mar Vista, California, uphill from Venice and south of Malibu. I lived there in the days of the Heart Hotel, before the Beachboys, next to this surfer boy, Bob Cooper, on Wasatch Avenue, where the lane was used to burn surfboards that didn't work. Old skate wheels were used on plywood cuts to roll on pavement waves. Everything was different in each subsequent decade, when the cool innocence of the fifties broke into the freedom of the Heat of the Sun and the excitement of the electric sixties, and then in a persistently innovative game time and inventive evolutionary madness of the strange seventies. The film gives you a piece of such a magical moment in time; in a place where the imaginary wave was real .. a source of culturally significant influences. And by the way, there is another film in which American street wit is similar, and it has the same truly unique virtue with casual realism, which helps to clarify this elusively eternal feeling of coolness ... "Two Lane Blacktop" (with one of the best examples of free behavior in the history of the west coast of California .. Dennis Wilson). As Monte Hellman did with it, thank you, SP, for being right there with it. HUV
