action, with my favorite type of creatures. I will not give it up if you have not seen it, because it is worth spending time to sit down and solve the mystery of things presented in this film. From time to time it became slow, and these were moments when my mind was surprised that it was easy anyway, but the moisture from it made me quietly agitate when you kept it in your head instead of letting it out, probably, in which I was at that time. effects and sequences of actions that you could feel filled with random eruptions. Of course, there are many films like this, the film still has its own style and taste, which I respect in any case from underground independent horror films.
