If you like this movie, be sure to check out other films directed by Grebeika - a treat awaits you. This, unfortunately, is not the best, but still a million times better than the usual film from the mainstream cinema. He explores the relationship, especially offensive, has some strong and pleasant moments and an excellent game. Some discrepancies of the plot, cliché and empty moments spoil the overall effect. To the previous reviewer and his comments on the Czech psyche: an interesting approach, but I don’t see this film becoming a Czech blockbuster. These people are quite spoiled by their directors {see also material from Sverak, Gedeon}, and this one is a little behind.
