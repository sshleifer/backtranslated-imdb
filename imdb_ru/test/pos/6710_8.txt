Is this the perfect movie? Not. This is a strange adaptation of a science fiction book, which presents vampires from space, nude beauties and the effectiveness of the British army. <br /> <br /> When I saw this film for the first time, I was quite young and I could remember that feeling of fear for the film and Matilda May. In fact, if not for this magnificent lady the entire film was naked, I probably would not have rated it so highly, but, given its magnificence, now I’m really going to vote for it! <br /> <br / Luckily for me, I was reminded of the film, and I watched it again now. Imagine that the special effects of “Raiders of the Lost Ark” or “Poltergeist” turned out to be a fairly decent science fiction story, but with absolutely excellent characteristics. I still really liked the film (as well as Matilda May), but it was a mixture of nostalgia compared to the shitty films that they shoot today, and really wanted more when it ends. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: if you are a science fiction fan, you are not allowed to miss this movie. Oh, and I already said that Matilda May is young, beautiful and naked?
