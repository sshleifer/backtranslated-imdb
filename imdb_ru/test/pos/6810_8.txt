I saw this 1997 film because I'm a fan of Lorenzo Lamas (and his father, the late Fernando Lamas). In my opinion, Lorenzo looked best in this film, mainly because of his hairstyle and elegant wardrobe, which flattered him. <br /> <br /> As the story progressed, I realized that the film was not just entertainment or a reason to see a favorite actor. The story was about the ring of serial killers and the attempts of law enforcement agencies to investigate the ring and bring participants to justice. It was a sufficient expectation, and I believe that violence was necessary to tell the story to the viewer. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I was shocked to learn that the film is a true story about the terrible murders that took place in Utah. In addition, Lorenzo and his lead lady portrayed real FBI agents who uncovered the disappearances of many young women and contributed to the detention of the ring. I think that the film deserves attention, because it informs the public about the dangers and possibilities of the criminal element.
