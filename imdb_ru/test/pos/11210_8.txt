Reading some other reviews of this film, I remembered both the good and not so good aspects of this film. But overall, I must say that this is one of the best films I have seen in any number of genres or countries lately. More than anything, he avoided many of the typical traps of recent international cinema, for example, he shot beautiful landscapes or was “fashionable”, “fun” or imitated American films such as pulp fiction. The film is in many ways unique. On the one hand, this is a film about relationships in which sex plays no role (unusual, especially for foreign films). It is also a film about the relationship between two men (also unusual - not a “friendly film”, not homosexual tension, not ego / phallic competition). He uses few conversations, but reports a huge amount. This is a simple story, but full of complex details that are easy for anyone to understand and universal in their significance. I did not find the film dark or depressing (it would have looked so if you watched Hollywood films all the time with a happy ending), but rather a reflection of human emotions. For example, in the scene where Mahmut realizes that his cousin is gone, you see his relief feeling that the cousin is gone, and yet you regret that he pushed him away. Who did not feel such a duality - when he lost a friend or lover or in some other situation? It is rare to see such human emotions in a movie without clichés. As for culture, or this is a Turkish film, I feel that it sets a very difficult balance between being a “Turkish” film - about the realities that are more applicable to this place (a big struggle to make it in Turkish city ​​compared to European, greater contrast between country and city) and universal, human history, which is not necessarily necessary to put in Turkey. Nowadays, when people all over the world consume culture and fetish it, this film does not try to seduce us as “Turks”, nor does it try to present it as “harsh reality” or “that's how Turkey / Istanbul IS”. And yet there are cultural elements. I think that the comparison with “lost in translation” that someone did was pretty good. Everyone, at least in the USA, was delighted with this film. I personally thought it was mediocre at best. Someone well formulated it as a vague story that supposedly had to deal with “disorientation” that happens to people living or traveling abroad. Even if the film was supposed to be humorous, the characters and their motives or crises were never clear (even for a “lighter” film or comedy, this is necessary). And I found that they were giving me a typical "Eastern" story about an American alienated abroad. Returning to “Far”, as for the idea that this is a bad game, or it is too slow, or has no plot, I'm sorry, but people who say this do not know anything about making a film and maybe nothing about being man, don't be offended. You do not have to be a movie fan or cultural connoisseur to appreciate this movie. This movie will be two hours of your well spent time!
