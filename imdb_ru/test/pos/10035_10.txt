The film is great. One of the most remarkable things about this is that Flynn's performance is excellent. This is worth emphasizing, as he often made fun of as actor Bette Davis et al. <br /> <br /> I remember the scene when Flynn gets drunk on Arthur Kennedy to bring him to death in the Battle of Little Big Horn. Flynnâ€™s cold, calculating look on his face when he does this is extraordinary - much better than the vaunted Spencer Tracy or many other stars could have done. <br /> <br /> Another thing worth noting is the excellent performances of George P. Huntley Jr. as lieutenant of the Queen. It's amazing why he stopped making films shortly afterwards - one would have thought that he would have been created for many years after he became a character.
