I think if they are not a brother, this film will become very common. how long can they keep it? if we were a part, what should they do? so natural feelings, such simple and fruitless words. But I almost cried last night, blood relations, fraternity, love, knot, film. In other words, the elder brother is very cute. If they are not brothers, they will not have so many forbidden factors - from family, society, friends - even from their own hearts at the very beginning. The older brother doubts whether he will come out or not at the beginning. Maybe the little brother was so long with his brother and could not even get any praise from his father ， this made him very upset and even sad, perhaps it’s a key fuse that allows him to feel that there is no one in the world who loves him except his beloved brother, and I want to say that this is a feeling so natural to a person that there is nothing to be ashamed of, you can fall in love with your mother, brother and sister. Just a weak heart is looking for a spine to rely on.
