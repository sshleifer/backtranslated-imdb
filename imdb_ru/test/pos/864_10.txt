Cheerful and low-budget comedy at its best. This set of unique individual sketches with an extensive humorous humor resembles a truly rude Children in the Hall. Be prepared for some of the most casual and worthy reading of the lines filled with ethnic stains and terrible language. Sex toys included! <br /> <br /> Today there should be more similar comedies. This collection of sketches on one DVD guarantees many views and reviews to evaluate some parts. If you liked The State and / or Wet Hot American Summer, get ready for even more glory. If you even think about it for a younger audience, I would say that every child on earth should see it.
