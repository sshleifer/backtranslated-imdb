So, here is a little background on how I came to see this movie. As you probably know, this is an original French film, which was then remade (astonishing surprise) by Hollywood as Wicker Park. Well, I avoided this movie like the plague when it was first released, simply because, a) I knew that it had absolutely nothing to do with Wicker Park, and living in Chicago, I did not understand why they were so He was called - he was shot to deceive Canada to begin with! - b) it’s very hard for me to mess around with meaningless remakes made solely because Hollywood thinks that we are too idle to read a few subtitles (by the way, I’m afraid of the Hellish remake) and c) I can't stop, Josh Hartnett, said Nuff . <br /> <br /> However, I met WP on TV the other day, probably in about half an hour, and I must say, at first, that it made no sense, in about half an hour from the end when it started to gather together. By the end, I was very surprised to find myself really in it, and then the ending just seemed so good - the perfect combination of history, passion and ending, perhaps with one of the greatest musical choices I have ever seen (heard ??). <br /> <br /> Since then, I have heard a lot about the argument of L'Appartement vs. Wicker Park, and, looking at WP, I still say that all this is related to Chicago, but it seems that I liked something about it, so when it turned on again, I looked at it again - unfortunately, still missing the first piece (I still haven't seen it!), and I still thought it was pretty good. Hell, even Josh Hartnett seemed good! But I was interested to learn about L'Appartement and I wanted to see what was going on. So I waited and waited to catch an apartment somewhere. Netflix let me down, so I got a copy from some site in Ireland. And I just watched it. <br /> <br /> This is really weird, but well weird. Classic French movie. Gorgeous acting, Romana Bringer is an absolute gem - sorry, but she removes Monica Bellucci from the screen in every scene. Vincent Cassel was a strange choice for leadership, but by the end he was working. And I saw Jean-Philip Ekofffy in many films, and I just adore him - the scene in which Alice throws him into a restaurant, and he just looks like someone told him that his puppy was shot down was painful! But, I can honestly say, seeing WP and pretty much expecting it to be a scene for copying the scene (like about 75% of the rest of the movie was - perhaps in a different order, but come on, a scene with coffee in glasses ?? word for word !!), you can imagine my surprise when I watched the final of L'Appartement !! I can literally say that I was amazed - hmm, a little bit like poor old Lucien really was through the cafe window! So be prepared if you have seen Wicker Park and want to look at the original, like me, make no mistake, expecting an identical movie, because you will either be disappointed or inspired by a piece. French film history is a vivid example of how you can watch a movie. , think that you are going to watch a meaningful happy ending, and get hit from a full spin in the opposite direction right at the end. Definitely catch this movie. Yes, and while you are maybe not too close at the same time, but in the future, look at Wicker Park, it will surprise you too.
