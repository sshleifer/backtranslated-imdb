This short, animated cartoon featuring Pepe Le Pugh concerns a cat who thinks he will solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk. The trouble is that he attracts the most unwanted attention of an honest and truly skunk (our hero Pepe, who enters the scene on the left) is decidedly more attentive, let's say, what M. Kate would like. Every great plan has its flaws, but it's a traffic jam! Interestingly, Jack Warner received a call from the Hayes office about the fact that Pepe and the object of his adoration were men. In the end, Betty Boop was partly responsible for the appearance of the production code. The subsequent "conquests" were explicitly and most definitely feminine. Very good cartoon, but Pepe is a character who works better as a magician than he supports. Worth seeing. Featured.
