I just watched this movie and it made me cry. This is a beautiful drama about two brothers in love, and I think this is a good idea, especially for limited people, to watch this movie. I loved the short film genre after seeing a couple, because they must impress you so quickly, and I must say that this film really left its mark. It describes some things that I never thought about, incest for one. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I was not too worried about the ending. Just once, I would like to watch a movie on the topic of gays, not wanting to kill myself after the charges. It seems that they almost always end in tragedy. It was “cute,” though, as they were supposed to be together, even if it was in death. <br /> <br /> I gave him eight stars, and I recommend him to everyone, because I think it gives an Inside look into the world into which you will enter this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your attention, enjoy.
