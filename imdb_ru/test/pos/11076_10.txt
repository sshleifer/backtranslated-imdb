I just wanted to tell anyone who might be interested that the New Jersey Drive film was my personal favorite for all time. I admire the work that Nick Gomez and Spike Lee have put into this film masterpiece. This film made a strong impression on me with its realism and understanding of the details of life in urban New Jersey. Personally, it caused a response in me, because I grew up with friends like those in the film. This impressed me because I spent time in Tehanka several years ago, so some of the characters were “real.” Sometimes this film seemed to be documentary, because you didn’t know if these were real events, or not. Although films such as Boys in the Hood and Threat Society II attract more attention, I personally think that these films were somewhat “improved” to attract a wider audience. “New Jersey Drive” was an uncompromising reality. Lee and Gomez covered every detail in this urban drama, including music, clothing, slang, and location. Unlike some of the films I mentioned earlier, the actors played as if they were not “actors.” Nothing compromised to make a good “theater”. The only misfortune that came from this film was that many people “slept” on it. I look forward to new works of art from Nick and Spike in the hope of the near future.
