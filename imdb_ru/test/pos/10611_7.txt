I saw Marigold at the preview, shown a few days ago, and found it to be a completely exciting and enjoyable movie. The film tells about a not very successful American actress who travels to India to star in a low-budget film, and finds herself there when she finds herself there when she finds out that the film’s financing has disappeared along with the producers and investors. The occasional encounter with an Indian film, shooting nearby, causes her to be employed for the role of a little dancer in it. Since Indian films include a significant amount of singing and dancing, this is a problem for Marigold, who has two left legs, not to mention a personality so tense and thorny that she can barely hear the music, not to mention feel her, the premier, choreographer of the film, advises her to do it. <br /> <br /> But “prem” - a word, not a person - means “love”, and Prem - a person, not a word - seems to embody this emotion in how he communicates with everything around him, be then his friends production assistants, who presented Marigold on the set, narcissistic and arrogant film characters, or the shy and nervous Marigold herself. Soon, under his expert guidance and sweet address, Marigold finds her legs - in the literal and figurative sense. <br /> <br /> I must say a word to those who are not familiar with using song and dance in Indian films. In contrast to American musicals, the story develops through these dance numbers, as the plot develops, and the transformations of the characters occur in parallel with the dances. It should also be noted that Indian dance is much more than a movement. An integral part of this is the reproduction of the dancer's feelings and emotions while telling the dance story. This is the main goal of the dance and the dancer. <br /> <br /> The fact that Marigold reaches this stage of execution is demonstrated in a terrific dance number about halfway through when Marigold performs the dance from which she should dance. for the film in the film, also expresses his love for Prem. This is an amazing presentation by Ali Larter, especially considering that she was not used to dancing in her films or to imitate her character’s feelings through dance. This shows her actress skills, as well as how much work she put into the role. <br /> <br /> Of course, no romantic film can work without a trustworthy prince-enchanter. Salman Khan, who plays the role of Prem, fits the role of T. Even when it turns out that he is not a very charming prince, he does not lose the sympathy of the audience. Salman has been ruling cinema in Hindi for many years (sometimes called Bollywood), and it’s worth remembering that his first lead role was also Prem. He is absolutely charming, cute, charming, sexy and vulnerable. For those who have never encountered it on the screen before, be prepared to be amazed at mega doses of pure magnetism! He and Ali Larter make up the perfect pair and are equally good in their game and appearance. <br /> <br /> Can they solve their problems? It seems impossible when we hear the last song of the film, a wonderful combination of fact and fantasy, reality and metaphor. The end definitely took part of the audience, with which I took by surprise, but they were satisfied. The songs are used very cleverly. They are in Hindi, without subtitles, for the film's episodes in the film, and in English for other occasions. But their meaning is always clear from the context and choreography. <br /> <br /> Marigold is a very nice romantic comedy - yes, there is a bit of humor in it too. Indian locations and costumes give it a fabulous quality, corresponding to the story, which can be compared with a modern fairy tale. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in or did not like Indian cinema, but you did not dare to try it. This is a great introduction. It reflects the color and brightness of Indian films not only in costumes and jewelry (which are impressive), but also in lively world-class dance and music. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Ali Larter, you should watch her superb play in portraying a selfish, demanding, "highly professional" woman who, nonetheless, has an inner attraction that inspires the love of two men. If you are a girl, you will like to admire Ali's beautiful costumes and look at her as a male leader. If you are a boy, you can not only admire Ali in her sexy costumes, but also learn from Salman Khan what you need to bring a loving heart even from such a sharp person as Marigold.
