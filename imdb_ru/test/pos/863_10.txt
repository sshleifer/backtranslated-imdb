When I first saw Stella in a comedy, I thought: “God, this is terrible!” But I loved the Wet American hot summer. So I knew that something was meaningless. I had no choice but to look for Stella shorts, which I heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe. When I found them, my expectations were not only justified, but I found, probably, the best comedic scenes I have seen in recent years. A series of twenty strange short films put me on the edge of my chair, and water was running down my legs. I not only laughed at my ass the first time I watched them, but I continued to laugh harder when I looked at them again and again. It is unfortunate that Comedy Central had cable television restrictions for the TV series Stella. That would be much better on HBO or Showtime. Their brand of humor cannot be limited to censorship or popular culture. Considering that even if it was on HBO, I’m sure that the “masses” would have voted to cancel it in a season or less, but it would be fantastic. Needless to say, I am now in love with Stella and all of her individual members. Any Stella fan should visit David Wayne’s website with all of his short films. They are as pleasant as Stella herself. So my hat is taken off with Michael Showalter, Michael Jan Black and David Wayne for the incredible comedy they shot with Stella. I hope to see a lot more troupe in the future.
