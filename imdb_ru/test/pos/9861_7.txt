Well, if you were to judge the film on the present day, it would not come to zero. If you watched FI on stage now, and everything was pretty nice (I agree), but not all 80s films were like that (Gilligan, Wonderwoman, aso). But people born in the early to mid 70s or earlier have a cult status. Whenever the plane approached, Tatu ran up the tower, ringing the bell, and with his accent shouted: "Yes Plan", "BOSS", "Yes", and you wonder what everyone would want. I do not understand the hippe, because if you watched it now. He does not have Harry Potter, Jurassic Park. Computer animation fx. It was just a scene where you could almost even see the wire attached to a guy who would like to be able to fly. But to us during this time it was a FANTASY ISLAND.
