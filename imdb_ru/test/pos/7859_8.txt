In this super creepy melodrama in the southern gothic, Clint Eastwood plays the role of a wounded Confederate officer in the civil war, who was captured by a school of rural girls and cured. The strange collision of the sexes leads to the fact that the supposedly “dangerous” men become victims of a group of seemingly harmless women, who turn out to be as cruel as the men who are at war with each other on the battle fronts. This is a classic spider and a story about flies, but here there is one single fly and a whole bunch of spiders. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page plays the principal owner of the school, and she gives a characteristic sensational role. Paige was trained as a theater actress, and this can be seen in all her performances. No matter what role she played, she always gave herself 100% and never allowed herself to fall out of character. So it is here, with this deadly virgin, that she suppresses her sexual repression of this helpless man. Each of the other girls reacts to him in their own way. The two most famous are the depraved girl who can't wait to rush, rushes at him, and the virginal (played by someone else besides the educated Elizabeth Hartman?), Who behaves as if she would faint if someone as he said the word "penis." The scheme of the Madonna and the storyline of a whore would look domineering if the film did not leave you aside and was not so sure what would happen next. <br /> <br /> The most memorable scene in the film for me happened when a group of women performed the amputation of Eastwood's leg, which contracted gangrene. Again, the hint of a spider / fly is clear: they interfere with it, so that it is much more difficult for him to escape from their cobwebs. <br /> <br /> Classic chiller. Not a very good movie, but terribly interesting. <br /> <br /> Rating: A-
