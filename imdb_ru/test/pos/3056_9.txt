Utopia, filmed in France in 1950, was the latest film produced by Laurel and Hardy. Due to the duo's bad reputation in the 1930s, I expected this film to be terrible. Although admittedly this does not meet the standard of their “vintage” comedies, I was pleasantly surprised. It is watchable and really funny! And, of course, the plot is of the same standard as one would expect. Some intruders are derived from their early work, but when you consider that this film was their first in five years after their last Hollywood film Toreadors, the procedures are performed confidently, as one would expect from these specialists. Some scenes are not too big, but the value of this film is that some scenes are funny and, as such, absolutely priceless. I especially liked the bedtime scene. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie I felt sad. Our heroes remained on their desert island. This is such a metaphor for real life. Hollywood and the audience of that time sent the stars to an uninhabited island of memories, and this was to be the last image that they portrayed in the movie. Ollie died seven years later, and Stan fifteen years later. Stan declined the offer to appear in "This is a crazy, insane, insane, insane world" in 1963. What a shame it was - a color film, just two years before he left. However, his health was probably not that great. <br /> <br /> These guys are probably the greatest comedic performers of all time, and although the film is far from their true potential, watching them is still a great honor to appear in the film for the last time, and touch the echoes of their high talent.
