This film is George S. Scott at its best, Bernard Hughes at its best, and Diane Rigg at its most substantial, and, of course, Paddy Chaevsky, writing in the "masterpiece" warp! There are also very short fragments of future heroes, such as Susan Sarandon, Stockard Channing, etc., who have storylines that you don’t necessarily notice until your fifth or sixth preview. Nancy Marchand as a supervisor of a young and middle-aged nurse is also gorgeous, like almost every “face” in 1970 Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that gets better the more you see it. Follow the "surprise" scene ala "Wait until dark"! This is one of the few films I have ever bought on DVD. It is excellent.
