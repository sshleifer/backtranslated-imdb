Porgy and Bess is an outstanding production of George Gershwin’s masterpiece. It is tastefully done in muted tones. The voices are outstanding. Although Sydney Portier's voice is duplicated on his vocal part, he gives a very touching performance. Sammy Davis Jr. plays the role of Sportin Life. There is still no DVD available for viewing, and this piece asks for one. All clever movie lovers who enjoyed it in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece on a new carrier. The screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that competes with all other musicals, including the outstanding Rogers and Hammerstein. Be sure to ask your video provider for this. Like Walt Disney's “Songs of the South”, the assumption of racial tones may be hindering the marketing of this cinema.
