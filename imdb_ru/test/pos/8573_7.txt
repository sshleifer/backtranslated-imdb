If you watched this movie for nudity (like me), you will not be disappointed. I could do without clumsy crooks or a bear. Some bottomless nudity could be shown, but I think it was for H.O.T.S. must be the best in its genre. <br /> <br /> This is not the film that could be made today, and this is very unfortunate, because this is a film that is worth seeing in these times. <br /> On any given day, I would recklessly undress over the plot points. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the DVD has no add-ons, but since they did not have a DVD, when it was filmed, that was understandable. I would like to know more about filming, especially when they were shooting a football match at the end.
