Wow. This film is the voice of a generation of climbers. Director Sam Keith leads us into the darkest depths of the human soul, where we find love, life and peaks. Tired with the world, Telli (Leo Fitzpatrick) follows his heart and his anchors through a brainwave to find sanity in a post-apocalyptic Colorado. Instead, Telly encounters a confrontation in Don (Jason Borts), the embodiment of masculinity and the spirit of the times of human weakness. An epic film comes to the climber in a painful top-roping competition that will make even the strongest volitional spectators squeamish at dizzying heights. <br /> <br /> This film has it all: sticking out - in the gym, cropped shorts and flannel shirts without sleeves, stunning climbing shots (some are so good, you see it 2 or 3 times!) . <br /> <br /> I gave the film 8 out of 10, because I wanted the novel to evolve a little more. It seemed that the film leads to a juicy sex scene between Telly and his new lover, but, alas, he does not fit in an already crowded hour and a half thrill. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger and Mission Impossible II fans will find this film is a diamond in a diamond. In general, if you are ready to challenge your worldview about humanity and rock climbing, this film is for you !!! one
