I saw this movie three times. Returning to the VCRs in the 1980s and again on the Encor channel last night (February 11, 2010). Based on a true story that I remember was in the news, in the early 1980s I decided that I was too anxious to watch it again. Yet it is difficult to look away from a car accident. The worst character is Joshua John Miller, who plays his younger brother Keanu Reeves. <br /> <br /> (The story this film is based on can be found anywhere on the Internet - just send it to Google. This is Anthony Jacques Broussard who killed Marcy Conrad in Milpitas, California, in 1981 .) Characters depict Generation X pre-grunge, border sociopaths, with the exception of Keanu Reeves, who educates conscience. <br /> <br /> Older hippies have done a great job raising this generation. <br /> <br /> For such a young guy, I thought Joshua Miller was excellent, like a serial killer in character creation. In fact, he went to Yale University and wrote the scripts, as well as the director. His acting skills in this film were amazing. The way he treats his younger sister, drowning her doll and tearing the grave of her doll, made me shiver. It gave me nightmares. Even despite what is happening in our world today, in 2010, this is still the most degenerative film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Apathy and dysfunction of these families is enough to cause one vomiting. This thrill-killing almost makes Manson's murders pale in comparison. <br /> <br /> Crispon Glover got a little carried away by the character. He turned to David Letterman to discuss his role, and nearly hit the host on the head. Obviously, Glover had to seek psychiatric help after he portrayed his character. <br /> <br /> In addition, fight the great Dennis Hopper. You are one of the best!
