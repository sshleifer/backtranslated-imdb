"One Dark Night", also called "Mausoleum", with many names and in a strange way, is one of the best early horror rentals. Original and rather rough, we briefly meet Adam West in this film about telekinesis and games for teenagers. Meg Tilly dared to spend the night in a crypt from the Sisters, a high school girl of blue satin jackets. The initiation is interrupted by the newly captured body of a psychic wizard called Raymar. The surprisingly amazing effects of make-up and panic tastefully paint this chiller film and provide a heartbreaking climax.
