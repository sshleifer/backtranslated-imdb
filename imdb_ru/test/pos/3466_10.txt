I have some free tickets through the Times to watch this little-known Irish film called Inside I'm Dancing ... I didn't know anything about it, so I had no preconceived opinions before I entered. <br /> <The film tells about two guys who are confined to wheelchairs and live in a house. Michael (Stephen Robertson) suffers from cerebral palsy, and Rory (James McAvoy) suffers from muscular dystrophy (I apologize for any spelling mistakes!). They form a bond, since Rory seems to be the only person who can understand what Michael is saying. In the end, they leave the house to live in an apartment in Carrigmore. They immediately use the help of an attractive girl (Romola Garay) to care for them. As a result, both friends fall in love with the same woman. This is a story in a nutshell, but there are a lot of laughter and tears along the way ... in fact ... being unprepared, what I was ... I found that tears flowed too often! In fact! I don’t think I cried so much watching a movie since Elephant Man !!! This film is a HUGE leak of emotion ... in funny things and sad things. Acting is absolutely on top! James McAvoy - my advice about greatness ... he is a great Irish actor, and I think he has a great future ahead of him. Stephen Robertson, who plays Michael, was also great ... and only today I learned that he was not suffering from Cerabal's paralysis, and it was just a great game! Brenda Fricker is also in this film, and plays the role of a house manager very well. Romola Garay should have another important role, she was a wonderful love, and I think we will see more of her on the big screen in the near future! <br /> <br /> this work on the film is not only synergism between the two leading ones, but also the script ... which is so witty #### literally burning! I still cannot resist repeating some lines in my head even now. <br /> <br /> The photo is good, although very dull, but then it captures a certain type of territory in Ireland. The music in this film is great too, as in the songs ... the use of Johnny Cash's cover for the track Nine Inch Nails 'Hurt' is inspiring !! <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize this movie in one word ... it would be “emotional”. This film is very, very funny ... and then on the back of the coin is very, very sad! I still can not believe that two days after watching the movie, looking back, I laugh and almost cry! This film is awesome ... and I hope that it has gone far! Although I don’t see it, because its advertising budget is probably very small! <br /> <br /> So look! I urge you ... you will not regret it ...
