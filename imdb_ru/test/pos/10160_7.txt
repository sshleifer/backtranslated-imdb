Allegedly the story of a small child, Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. Kid kidnapped to parents were silent. They know something about the plot to assassinate the ambassador of an unnamed country while speaking at the Albert Hall in London. <br /> <br /> There are many Hitchcock incidents in the film. A friendly but non-transparent Frenchman seems to fry an innocent Stewart - doctors from Indiana - too strong to be curious. Later, the Frenchman appears in Arabic appearance with a knife in his back and whispers some information about the murder to Stewart. Stewart says to his wife - Doris Day looks very bold - but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his son's life. <br /> <br /> Instead, the couple is trying to track down the killers, buy them out and pick up their son, taking them from Morocco, where Hitchcock gave us his usual tourist look at customs, places and food in London. There is a fun chase for wild geese in which a fight takes place between Stewart and the staff of the taxidermy shop. The staff are more concerned about guarding their half-filled samples than anything else, and they shuffle around, keeping the leopard's carcass and swordfish in a protective order. During the fight, Stewart manages to save his throat from hitting the sword, but it is bitten by a tiger effigy, the action is enhanced by the terrible score of Bernard Hermann. The scene ends when Stuart runs out the door. Hitchcock ends it with a lion head shot, gaping at the slamming door. There is also a gag, well done, about some visitors waiting around the couple's hotel room in London, waiting for explanations. <br /> <br /> There are two serious problems that are slightly affected. One of them is the relationship between Stewart and Dey, which are not as rosy as they should be, they are considered a bourgeois ideal. She was the star of the music scene for several years and is known throughout the world. And she gave up all of this to marry a regular guy who turned out to be a doctor. This is understandable, for example, to a nurse or flight attendant or almost any woman other than an international star, with a promising career in her own right. This does not penetrate, but the sharpness is noticeable, as it was not in the original version. It reminds me a little of the exchange between Joe DiMaggio and his then wife Marilyn Monroe, who had just returned from having entertained the troops in Korea. “Oh, Joe,” she said, “have you ever seen ten thousand people stand up and ache?” “Seventy thousand,” murmured Joe, the former hero of the New York Yankees. <br /> <br /> The second problem is loyalty. Who has the greatest social value? Your little son? Or unknown ambassador. Are we putting ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national stability? Dey is faced with this dilemma in her harsh form at the climax at Albert Hall. Her decision favors political stability, although her motives are problematic. Is she screaming to save the ambassador's life, or is she only doing this to relieve the anxiety that overwhelms her? (See Alec Guinness falling on the detonator at the end of the Bridge over the River Kwai.) The photo is very good, and the settings can be menacing even on a quiet street in a residential area of ​​London. It is noon, and Stuart is lonely and determined, but also scared. Gulliver Street bears footsteps coming from somewhere. Is he being watched? Is his life in danger? And where the hell is everyone who lives on this street? Hitchcock pays so close attention to the details of the location that we can make out the gluing of the brick wall next to it. <br /> <br /> The director had a rare disagreement with Francois Truffaut when he was interviewed for Truffaut's eulogistic book. Truffaut argued that the earlier version of “The Man Who Knew Too Much” lacked the depth of the later version. Hitchcock replied: “I think you want me to make films for art-house viewers,” but finally agreed that the 1930s version was the work of a talented amateur, and this version was the work of a professional. There are no arguments. <br /> <br /> This is Hitchcock almost at its zenith.
