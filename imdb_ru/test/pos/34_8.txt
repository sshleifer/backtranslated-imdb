Lackawanna Blues is a touching story about a nanny, a woman who gives herself to help those in need. This is told from the point of view of a boy whom the nanny fascinated when his own mother did not quite cope with this task. <br /> <br /> I have respect for this film for three main reasons: 1) it is touching but not juicy. This is narrated in a very real way, without a lot of annoying Hollywood storytelling baggage. And the final is pretty good (tearful, but not excessive). <br /> <br /> 2) Although this is clearly an African-American film that is being filmed in the post-segregated black community of Lackawanna, New York, it does not carry its ethnicity on its sleeve. The story is based on the strength of the characters and dramas (and comedies) surrounding their lives. This is not a sermon, it's just good. <br /> <br /> 3) He has a great soundtrack (canâ€™t compare with the old R & B class and blues from Chicago). <br /> <br /> Overall, the game is strong, but not always the case. Some of the performances simply do not correspond to the characters that the actors should depict. But, considering that it was a film for television, this was to be expected. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. An imperfect but cute, good film for a rainy day.
