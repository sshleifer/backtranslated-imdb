Having recently bought Universal's Marlene Dietrich DVD collection from Universal, I reluctantly watched Golden Earrings. The idea of ​​a 40-year-old Marlene Dietrich as a gypsy in a military novel seemed unusual and implausible. I shouldn't have worried. With all the professional talents that went into these old films, it's really hard to miss. The film was a joy to watch; This is a classic. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film was Dietrich, who coped well with the role of gypsy. Make-up, lighting, photography and her performance - all this makes a truly amazing and memorable character. I had never seen Dietrich play a “good” woman convincingly before, but she plays here! She played a lot of heartless vampires in these great films of Sternberg, so it's nice to see her in a more mundane, relaxed role, playing an exotic, but very humane character. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very pleasant affair. The love story is believable, optimistic, and the happy ending is extremely pleasing.
