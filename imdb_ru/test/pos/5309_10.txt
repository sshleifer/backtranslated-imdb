this is what confuses me about critics and their opinions. I usually understand what critics say about a movie, in most cases before I watch a movie. <br /> <br /> However, I saw this film without knowing anything about it. mainly because of the cast. Kevin Spacey and Don Cheadle - the two most recognized and, in my opinion, the best actor in the living. and Ryan Gosling is also growing fast. his reality and humanity, which he radiates in most of his portraits, make the audience truly believe in the character and what is happening to him. He is really my favorite actor of my generation. I always found Jen Malone pretty cute, starting with Donnie Darko, and if she decides to keep playing similar roles, then damn it, I'm not complaining. this film really touched me. I believed in it. acting was top notch. as expected. the film itself left the audience with the ultimate goal of a good film; thinking and thinking that follows after the final cast of credits. I think I have to watch it again to decipher how this film was criticized. I know that their reviews should be taken with a pinch of salt. at least i know now.
