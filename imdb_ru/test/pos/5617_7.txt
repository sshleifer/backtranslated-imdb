A bright young man interested in "serious" music (admittedly, a disappearing breed - who will play the violin when no one can play the violin ?? "- could find this interesting fiction about homeless children and great musical stars. Heifitz was really the greatest violinist of his generation, and the film gives him a rare opportunity to show his technique on the screen. 39 th and, but for a smart family is a good way to spend a rainy day with the AMC or Video Store - good luck in Blockbuster !!!!
