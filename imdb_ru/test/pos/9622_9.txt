Although it is generally recognized that this is one of the first martial arts films played here in the West, its real influence is manifested in retrospect. "Lo Lieh" is VERY discreet, and many fight scenes, although often called innovative (as they were during the first release of the film), are a bit boring compared to what followed after (especially after Bruce Lee, who became the instant standard by which everyone else will always judge). This does not mean that the FIVE FINGERS OF DEATH / KING BOXER is nothing but a classic in itself, because it is. Like many of the leading characters in many martial arts films, the character played by Lih mostly lies at the heart of most of the film, but when he is released, he effectively cleans the house. You can not ask for more than that.
