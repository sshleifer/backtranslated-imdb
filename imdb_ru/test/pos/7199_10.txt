This film is the smartest comedy I've ever seen, many jokes are either a parody of another movie (from star wars to dragon ball, to rangers, kung fu, etc.), or somehow related with the history of something (Otis creates an elevator), many jokes are also connected with the modern world and are ridiculed because it was BC (Like wheels of a rotating carriage). Other jokes are just meaningless, but funny at the same time (for example, the famous scene with a dog running after a Roman guy with a little music). In fact, in these films they are mixed to a great extent. every kind of humor. I have watched this movie 6 times already, and every time I watch it, I find other subtle jokes. (like the scene where Waldo is part of the Egyptian crowd). This is the funniest film that I have, and finally, a funny comedy, in which there is no toilet or sexual humor. Numerobis is what makes a film, everything that comes out of these guys is funny. This film is almost perfect, with the exception of a few clichéd things, such as the fact that Asterix is ​​returning his power because he is being kissed, it’s just silly. But overall a great movie !! 9.5 out of 10
