it was a thoughtful and well shot and directed television film, in which a huge plot was made with great precision and intelligence, and he allowed to create a film that would look great on the big screen - the palette is a bit muted for TV. If you are looking for an action movie or Bosnian Light, this is not for you, but for an ordinary woman who has taken on an incredible task for humanity. If you want to know more about the conflict and how the work of one woman had a huge impact on the world, watch this film when it comes your way. I do not see many other television films dealing with the problem of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level. the story avoids the obvious demonization of the “bad guys” and instead shows denial and everyday hatred that led to the death of thousands of people. I was moved at several points, and not in some manipulative Hollywood way with driving music and a bright scene, but allowed me to discover the horror and consequences along with the characters. This is a bold enough movie to make the content speak for itself, and the visual effects were understated to support it with dignity. <br /> <br /> Actors do an incredible job of translating intense dramatic scenes. the scenes where the victims give their testimony before a military tribunal are powerful, and Wendy Crewson, Stipe Ercheg and Heino Ferch are excellent. William Hurt's British accent is terrible - no one else gave him the opportunity to play a Brit, and when he finally got it, he blew it up! - and although the body of John Corbett was born to play as a soldier / commando, it is a little too good, although it does its job well.
