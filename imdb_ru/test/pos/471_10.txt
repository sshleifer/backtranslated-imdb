It was a fantastic film about two people, one of whom was a teenage girl, and the other a middle-aged man, each of whom was looking for someone to help them fill a certain void left by their former relatives. <br /> <br /> Both actors give brilliant performances, which may include different audiences. The script, although written by Gorman Beshard, seems to have been written from the perspective of a woman. And at the same time, men can relate to male characters because of how well they were designed and described in the film. <br /> <br /> The end of the film has an unusual, but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless. I would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one. In this film, it is clear that you are not alone.
