I don't want to write too much about the film, but basically it's an action / comedy with a bit of romance added to two men who gather in unbelievable circumstances and together become people on the highway. Fantastic performance of Robert Carlisle and all the other participants. A brilliant buddy who really makes you hate him. Some great funny lines are actually laughing out loud, awesome performances and a great plot. The choice of music and atmosphere is all fantastic, mostly brilliantly directed and written with diamonds. I recommend this film to anyone who likes a good British film or a good fighter, I don’t know why the film never made a film, I thought he didn’t get as much recognition as he deserved. If not for that, watch this movie for one of the greatest finals of all time. Not to give anything away, but this one really beats, the heart beats!
