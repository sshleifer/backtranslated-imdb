To begin, I conducted further research on the film. First, Jules Dassin shot and played in this unusually original and excellent film about the crime film. Secondly, it was a very low-budget film created in the Renaissance at the most important moment of the film Noir. Thirdly, jewelers who were attempted to rob, are real jewelers. Producers Rififi asked to remove them, oddly enough, (I quote Jules Dassin in a recent interview on this topic), which is surprising, for some not very obvious reason, they were delighted with the idea that the crime film was shot in their store. ). <br /> <br /> This impeccable characters and plot fit so well into their surroundings. To add my praise, I will say this; Some may say that it was a typical Hollywood film, on the contrary, it is to establish the basis for the regular plot of a Hollywood crime film. <br /> <br /> Laslti, I would like to say that I support this fresh idea of ​​the film, where not only one side wins, but this side should not always be good. This time I can say that the film is not predictable! Ten stars!
