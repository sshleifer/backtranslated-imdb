This is one of the best dolls by Marion Davis - and one of the few that allows her to show her skills as a physical comic who is so attractive in her silent films. Well, it means that she makes an awkward drone number, but even Ruby Keelerâ€™s dances from that era cannot stand the younger generation. The problem here is in the script. The story goes into an incredible melodrama in the last video. It's pretty scenic, and obviously adapted from the game ... but not good enough. However, there is a turbulent dialogue and slaps everywhere. Worth seeing.
