I had a terrible day, but this film grabbed me, and I could not tear myself away from it until the end ... and I forgot about my terrible day. and the ending ... by the way ... where is the sequel !!! <br /> <br /> the budget is clearly extremely low ... but ... see what they did to him! it reminds me of a play ... they mainly work with a tent, a rescue capsule, several guns, a uniform, hiking gear and a scanner. This is all for props. Maybe it is even good, forcing actors and writers to come on stage and take their rightful place in the film as work centers, and not as a reason for reflection, to justify the CGI (star wars) fight. <br /> <br /> CGI is fine. This is not really "unnoticed" ... but imho is still working. What for? because there is not so much of it, and what it is is not “capture” by the army of effects, people trying to squeeze everything they can into the frame. it inspires imagination ... it's pretty simple stuff, with a decent composition (especially a heavy shot from a freighter ... there is one long shot that must be at least ten seconds ... which tracks the entire length of the ship ...) It should be a record for a sci-fi action movie filmed in the last 10 years, with a sequence of actions that lasts more than 0.75 seconds), and some relation to the plot. it may look old or not “modern”, but it does not look stupid and does not take away from history. <br /> <br /> The game is good, except that the characters die too quickly to recognize them. The captain was great, but some of his scenes could use another take. I am also confused that his character loses his composure and stomps over the corpse. I like to think that the captains are calm and balanced ... what was going on in this scene? Did the other team worry that he would lose him at that moment? did he feel that he was losing control? <br /> <br /> Now for the plot .... basically it's good ... why? Because he is not trying to explain himself. It just happened. This is called a "planet", it's a mystery, you know? No one knows why there is a statue, and they will not know either. Mysterious cult? Strange scientist with a tattoo? What do you expect to learn in less than 90 minutes? This is not war and peace. And, thank God, this is not "Star Wars." No midichlorians, no 5 minutes of boring explanatory dialogue, which has no meaning in history. Characters find themselves in a quandary and can understand only a few basic things ... this is not an episode of Star Trek, where they learn that this is Leonardo Davinchi or a child resembling a cosmic wanderer. It's mysterious, and I liked it. I don’t know why, maybe, I can identify myself with these guys anymore, as they don’t know what is going on, and I don’t either ... they don’t tell a lot of cosmic gibberish or have magic boxes telling them what is going . <br /> <br /> In fact, I would say that one of the weakest moments is when the “traitor” turns on the team and tries to “explain” the cause of the planet, the cult, etc. This is coincidentally He has a weak dialogue, imho, in the whole movie, and he interrupts the flow, and some characters look unnatural in this scene. <br /> <br /> Well, sometimes I felt that it was too mysterious. Like, why did the guy light up in front of him with lightning? It was strange. Just weird. The ending of the “village” ... again, I would like to know some of these characters better. And would it be so hard to have a 30-second escape scene at the end? This is not a series, it was a movie, and we like the closure in movies, even if they can have a sequel. Imagine Hamlet without “flying angels singing you to rest” <br /> <br /> In any case. What can I say. It was worth the dollar I paid on the machine with the “red box” in the supermarket. IMHO, this was also a better story than parts 1, 2, or 3 of Star Wars. As I said, it overwhelmed me with the desire to find out what was going on, and I could not stop looking to the end.
