My companions were amazed to discover that this film was a documentary. It was so funny, it seemed, on the script, but it gives a moving picture of real life in the life of an indie film. We felt the urge to buy a coven and wanted to meet Mark and Mike. As college students, this film gave us a much needed glimpse of real life.
