Peter O'Toole is a pleasure that can be observed in roles where his statements are good and give him the opportunity to unleash a drunken stupor. Beautiful Suzanne York provides a good foil for the dramatic presence of O'Toole. <br /> <br /> The film hints at incest - without a single explicit stage - but it is able to entertain the viewer with its rude social commentary. Despite the fact that this is not the main film, it will be remembered for its entertainment activities. <br /> <br /> Even York signing the papers at the end is a pleasure to watch, quietly exuding tragedy. A possible weakness here is Thompson's easy guide. But the film floats because of the cast and script. <br /> <br /> I saw the film twice in 20 years - in both cases called “Brotherly Love”. Country Dance is a rather ridiculous and inappropriate name for this film, wherever it is released.
