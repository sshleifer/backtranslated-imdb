This is probably the best film shot at least in the last five years. I always believed that making people cry is more difficult than making them laugh. If you want to see 400 adults crying out loud in the same room, watch this movie. It is breathtaking. Javier Bardem performs the role of his life. You will cry, you will laugh, you will smile ... The most worthy fact that in Spain everyone knows about Ram√≥n Sampedro. Personally, I knew the whole story and even the end. So, the superiority of the film is how the story is told. And in this area, Amenabar is a master. <br /> <br /> This movie is MUST.
