Well, everyone agreed which season was the best. The first. And to kill Boone was a bad decision. Also killing others was bad. The directors and writers are to blame. Bad guys. BUT. I still think this is the best series about fiction! Sorry guys, I can't help it! I see that the quality of the series has declined after the first season. However, it is easy to take Liam as the new main character if you are behind Bun. He is really ... mysterious. What shocked me the most was the fact that Lilly was written from history and how. This was something she did not deserve! And what do we get? Some blonde chick named Rene, absolutely no character! But these Taelons remain mysterious, and you are still amazed at their true plans. This Suspension. The conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant. <br /> <br /> I understand that when you jump in the episode of the 3rd, 4th or 5th season, you may not understand this show. But when you look from the beginning, you just can not break free! <br /> <br /> The game is gorgeous, the special effects are amazing, the music is beautiful, and the plot is intriguing. Gotta see it guys!
