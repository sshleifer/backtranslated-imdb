I thought it was a beautiful film. this is not my favorite of his films - the chunking express holds this place - this one is quite different from everything I've seen it. it is slow (but not annoying) - it takes time and ponders the characters .. there is minimal movement in the frame - camera work is wonderful. The acting game is gorgeous The film feels like a long warm comforting drink.
