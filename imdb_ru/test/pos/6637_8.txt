Ordinary Bergman Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann starred in the role of the rural couple Jan and Eva Rosenberg. The story began with an ordinary couple who fights and does makeup. Jan was a sensitive man, but an escapist who isolated himself from the world. Eva is a practical woman who is tired of her husband's ambitions. Since Yang is putting off repairing their radio, they are not aware of the impending war. Of course, the war came, and the film became a fascinating study of their transformation of each other and each other as a result of the invasion, as they were subjected to ill-treatment by the enemy and their own government. <br /> <br /> There was no musical accompaniment for the film, but the soundtrack was military noise. In one scene, a shot of a pulsing background weapon, the explosion and the noise of a fly were incredible. From time to time, Bergman increased his expression when another event occurred. When something cruel happened, he zoomed out so that viewers would feel violent and not see closely. Very well made movie.
