This film is about a group of teenagers from a small town who decided to rob a local bank, excellent. Brian (Justin Walker) wants to leave his little town, like Jimmy Stewart in "It's a beautiful life." However, unlike George Bailey, Brian is going to rob a bank to finance his dream of attending art school, even if his father does not support. Brian's suggestion is to act as a client and divert security. This is a tempting offer, if offered to many, I wonder what they will do. In any case, Brian does it. When the sheriff (James Remar) and his forces surround the bank, things are getting worse and worse. This confrontation, even if the feds are approaching to kill the children, if they have an accurate shot. The sheriff must prevent this and try to put an end to the confrontation peacefully. Unfortunately, tensions are growing, and the teenagers inside are turning to each other. Some out of control. The paper cutter scene is awful and hard to look at. Very intense!
