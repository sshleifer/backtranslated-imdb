A hospital is a film that was made ahead of time. The film, produced by screenwriter Paddy Chaiefsky, which gave us the film “The Network,” which won an Oscar award, talks about staff fatigue, gross incompetence and bureaucratic corruption in a large conglomerate hospital in Manhattan. George S. Scott, excellently speaking as chief physician, is prone to alcoholism and death, as he tries to recover from divorce, throwing his son out of the house and, worst of all, in a medical institution where corruption and incompetence take priority over care and healing sick and wounded. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott makes the film his own, and the audience will be shocked by what he saw at this medical facility. You can feel the “pain” (pun) of what this hospital has done to it. The vivid images of the incompetence of this hospital are so vivid and incredibly powerful that you can laugh and experience deep anxiety from scene to scene. <br /> <br /> If only the film remained with this premise in the style of the documentary style as it begins, this picture would be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is the plot of Scott, who fell in love with the daughter of an old patient. A patient kills people in a hospital. This is where the credibility of the picture becomes tense. Romantic dialogue scenes add nothing to the picture, and the mentally ill, posing as a doctor, turned out to be absolutely incredible. A simple security challenge and checking records should have prevented older patients from committing murders. In order to get the patient out of the hospital, it takes almost the entire film before the guards are invited to the film. I could not see that ONE MAN caused so much damage, even as corrupt as this hospital. <br /> <br /> Also, George S Scott's character is “overloaded” (another pun) because there are too many things in the script once. For example, within 20 minutes you could blame up to 20 different doctors and deny what they should have done or not done. With the nurses and assistants this is the same story. Someone's card was read incorrectly, someone got the wrong medicine and died, the doctor operated on the wrong patient, and the other doctor does the same, blaming the third nurse who was not called because the second nurse who was supposed to take the patient was on a coffee break. There is also a lot of subtle, dark humor with the same reports of incompetence and corruption transmitted to the viewer. <br /> <br /> This repetition of medical incompetence is unforgettable. However, the plot about the murder distracts more than helps this film. When the focus of this film is on staff incompetence and Scott’s reaction to it, you get on the screen. But conversations between Scott and the daughter of a crazy patient turn the film into the mysterious "Who did this?" The script, which seriously harms the quality of the film. When a crazy patient tells how he committed the killings, I wondered at the following: why did the producers need the plot to “find the killer” of a crazy patient? I think that the only characteristic of Scott's character, who has a relationship with the daughter of an older patient, was to give him anyone to communicate with. The hospital had to retain its offensive accusation of the medical profession, removing the scenes of love interest and the insane patient. He had to focus on incompetent B. within his walls more often. In an era when this film could be phenomenal, the plot plots make the film very good, and not the great masterpiece it could be.
