I am deeply grateful for watching this movie. The acting game is amazing, the film itself is very powerful and clear, and the issues connected with it are solved subtly and deeply. <br /> <br /> This is an important film. It can be deeply transforming. <br /> <br /> I would never pay good money, I would never see it again. Since it is * so * good and so difficult, it is extremely difficult to look at it. I admit that my taste in cinema is strongly inclined to light entertainment; The visual environment can be so powerful that I tend to avoid it for the sake of something really important. For those of you who are more resilient than I, it may be easier to handle. <br /> <br /> But I strongly recommend that people see it at least once. It is advisable with others so that you can talk to each other, and that someone nearby reminds you that there is more to the world than a movie.
