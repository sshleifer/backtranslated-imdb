You had to live in Japan for a while to enjoy the beauty of this film! I lived in Okinawa for more than 2 years, and in the north of Honshu - 4 years. Believe it or not, what you see draws a very good and accurate picture of the East / West contrasting mentality, both in terms of sports and in terms of personal relationships. A funny, funny and soulful film that deserves better than the Americans can imagine. 8+ out of 10!
