I myself am a student of physics, and I must say that this is one of the best "popular" introductions to string theory. An elegant Universe manages to make the whole topic of string theory accessible to a wide audience (although in reality it is M). <br /> <br /> Some programs of "popular science" believe that the best approach is to simply throw the audience in depth, throwing technical jargon at them without any explanation, and presenting the theory in a boring, outdated style. This program examines such concepts as general relativity and quantum mechanics, and explains the problems that need to be solved between them so that we have a consistent theory that can be applied to the universe on both a large and a small scale. <br /> <br /> I suppose that some may say that it is slow and takes too long to get to interesting things, such as extra dimensions and wormholes, but the fact is that it is not. It is almost impossible to explain string theory from the very beginning, at least, without mentioning physics as its basis, and how it is explained in the “Elegant Universe” is understandable and interesting. <br /> <br /> Would you like this program? depends on whether you want to be initially overwhelmed by some of the ideas that Green represents: extra dimensions and space-time distortion are not quite common in everyday life, are you? But if you continue to adhere to some of the more exotic concepts of this program, you will find that it will give you an idea of ​​the research that drives the world of physics today. And if you study physics, this is great fun, and you can probably follow it and appreciate it even more!
