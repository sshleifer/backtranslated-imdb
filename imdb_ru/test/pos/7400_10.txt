This is better than the first. The film begins with Sheriff Sam. Then Sam and Ann collect their things and go to Tropicana while Jack goes along. <br /> <br /> People are shot, beaten through their necks, crushed by anvils, they get stabbed icicles, broken eyes, head blasts, drowning, curtains, lobsters pushed into faces, slit throats, freezing to death, snowballs, ripped hands melted from freezing, icicles down the necks, strikes on the face pots and pans, bitten off fingers, icicles in the mouth, bitten neck, explosive people, fried snowballs and stuck in blenders. <br /> <br /> Snowballs are funny, they put them in a blender and turn it on, then it says “it was fun,” they put in a waffle piece, and it burned. <br /> <br /> This is just a great movie. Then they begin to think of other ways to kill him, and the snowball answers: "This is not good." <br /> <br /> It was worth spending ten bucks to buy it. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars.
