I made this film, but I wasn't sure what to expect from it. I was very happy to know that this is the best Brazilian film I have ever seen. The story is rather strange and simple, and, above all, extremely original. We have Antonio, a young man living in Nordestin, a city in the north and east of Brazil, who is deeply in love with Karina. The main conflict between them is that, although Antonio loves his small town and does not want to leave it, Karina wants to see the world and be offended by this place. As proof of his love for her, he decides to go himself and bring her peace. As he says, he will place the nordustine on the map. And the way he does it is incredible. This is a good movie; It may be a little stagnant for some people because of his other editing work, but I think it also improves history. It's just fun, and it makes you feel good.
