* POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I thought that Pitch Black was quite enjoyable, with some nice effects - I liked the big animals, although they are not a patch for Aliens from the Alien series. He had a pretty good atmosphere, and I felt that Vin Diesel helped her do it. <br /> <br /> One thing that puzzled me is how it rained. If the planet has three suns and almost uninterrupted daylight, where did the moisture come from, which forms clouds and, consequently, rain? <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that Fry died at the end - it reminded me of the new Hollywood films of the 1970s, in which the main character did not get to the end.
