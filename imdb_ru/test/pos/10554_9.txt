My father is a cute, cheerful and cute hero. Gerard Depardyu is awesome, like Andre, a divorced father who takes his fourteen-year-old daughter Nicole (Katherine Heigl) to the Caribbean for the holidays. There his daughter meets a guy named Ben (Dalton James). To impress him, she tells him that Andre is her lover, and that her father is in prison for armed robbery, and her mother is a prostitute, and that she escaped with her pimp. Everyone on the island soon gets the impression that Andre is a child molester. Andre is in between two relationships. One with Isabelle (Emma Thompson, who is in a cameo role at the end of the film) and Diana (Prince-Vera from Spin City). My father-hero has a lot of funny moments. For example, when he is at a talent show, and everyone says that he is playing something French. Therefore, he plays "Thank God for the little girls" from Gigi. Everyone is disgusted and quits. My Hero Father does not deserve 5.1. I think it deserves 9.0.
