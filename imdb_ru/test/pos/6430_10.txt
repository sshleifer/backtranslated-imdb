This is an obsessive job. It lasts only ten minutes, but I would rather pay ten dollars to the cinema to see it, than to see some full-length film, which is currently running in a circle. This is the simple part of human thinking. He arrived at this place as a young man and was hypnotized by the room and the music coming from her ... and now he sits here, dying in old age in this place, which he so tenderly connects his youth. the music in it is brilliant, the guitar sounds like a jazz room, like Neil Young's music in Dead Man. If you have a chance, watch this movie. It's worth it. If Rutger Hauer made more of these films, I think he will get more respect than he gets. The moment you hear that it is placed under phrases like “everyone's favorite psyche.” Im sure this is not what Rutger would like to be remembered as an actor. He also made this film, so in this show he shows that he is a very artistic actor / director. This is a change from class B films he made from the early 90s. I hope to see more of this ruger hunter, as he is one of my favorite actors.
