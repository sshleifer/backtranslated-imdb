When I first saw this film, I thought that it would be terribly upset, the director was the first director Liev Shrieber. What I saw in the next 130 minutes completely and completely changed my opinion. Based on Jonathan Safran Foeer's novel “Everything Is Illuminated” tells the story of a young Jewish-American collector (masterfully played by Elijah Wood) who is trying to find a woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in World War II. He travels around Germany and enlists the support of a 20-year-old translator and grandfather. This leads to a hard search across the country, and they are determined to find what they are looking for. Everything is lit, taken in one of the most beautiful villages in the world, creates tension between the translator and his grandfather, and also helps Jonathan find his career. There is also a lot of religious matter here, as the grandfather calls Jonathan "a Jew." In general, this is a film about finding yourself and a loving family. I give this wonderful, if not illuminated film, 10 out of 10.-Arjun
