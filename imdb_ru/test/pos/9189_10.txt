I was not sure that this film will appear on DVD, because I really have something against people who make black and white films in the 21st century, but I still bought it. I still do not understand why it should have been black and white, but this is the only flaw I see in the film, and this is certainly an excellent example to see the final growth of Brazilian cinema. Not everyone can understand a movie like this, but it is very useful to those who know. Unlike O Homem Que Copiava, surrealism approaches this film quite well, and the acting is at least as good as this one, or other successful Brazilian films such as Bicho de sete cabe√ßas, Cidade De Deus, Brava Gente Brasileira, etc. I hope that this stone will not be offended and raped by a shitty Hollywood remake. It's amazing to see how these guys spend billions of dollars and still cannot make a film that is 1% better than this, perhaps, low-budget film. <br /> <br /> Bravo to the whole team! 10/10
