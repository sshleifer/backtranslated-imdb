While in one country Spain, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali joined forces to create a reference for short cinematic surrealism, Un Chien Andalou, Walt Disney and his collaborator Ub Iwerks in America worked on Steamboat Willie, the most outstanding of the early synchronized sound cartoons ( It turned out that this was not the first, contrary to other reports). It is also one of Mickey Mouse's most simplistic and fun shorts (still in a silent form - the only sounds are the little annoyances and sounds from Mickey and animals). It also runs pretty fast for his less than ten minute run. But at this moment, you can immediately understand how disney Disney likes his characters, and how the new use of sound changes the way his creation uses animals as musical instruments. There is no story to talk about, just random things that happen and happen because of Mickey (errone Steamboat) on this boat on the river. And, like the best shorts of Mickey Mouse, lack of speech speaks about its advantages. Be sure to see if you have not seen it in childhood, but if you have it, it may still be worth a different look.
