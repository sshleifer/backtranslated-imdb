I also saw The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival in Prince George. I have to admit, the only reason I went to see this is because I'm a big fan of Callum Keith Rennie. And he did not let me down. He gave a good presentation of a rather unattractive character and told about the only comic relief in the whole film. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a common storyline “a lot of bad people caught in a blizzard together,” but he had several turns that made me guess. Characteristics were strong, and the whole cast showed itself pretty well. The only problems I had with the actors was Rose McGowan. Throughout the film, she was so cold that we did not understand the nature of her personality or her motivation. Besides her and a few small problems with continuity, it was a well-written, well-played thriller.
