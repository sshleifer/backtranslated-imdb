“2001: A Space Odyssey” takes place in 2001, and the main character is HAL. Computer. That's right, a computer that speaks and thinks completely on its own. This was done in 1968, and to think that by 2001 one could say that computers would speak - this is a joke. If it were in 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered as idiotic as this one. There is nothing in this film that evokes any emotion. This causes two reactions and one is called: sleep. It starts from scratch, but with a black shot for more than two minutes. Then the first shot that we see, which has some kind of illumination, is the “Dawn of Man” sequence. So, if it's in chronological order, blackness before, is this the birth of the world? <br /> <br /> During the sequence “Dawn of Man” a huge monolith appears out of nowhere ?? from under the earth, from heaven, we will never know where it came from, but for one reason or another it is there. Monkeys go Apesh! T, as soon as they find this monolith that only a man could make, but is this a snag ?? man has not evolved yet. So who did this and where did it come from? What is its purpose? Monkeys find the tool. Monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys. Monkeys with weapons are now the dominant group, because they used their minds to gain advantage. More advanced monkeys and, more importantly, smarter and more innovative monkeys are the dominant group, as they captured the watering place. <br /> <br /> We quickly jump into space, millions of years later, where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe, and for a film made in 1968, the visual effects are stunning, but outdated. The account is legendary. Cinematography is impressive. Editing is awful. There are countless shots of square-shaped spacecraft floating in space for an infinite amount of time. When we get on the ship, we have nothing to talk about. Over the next hour, Kubrick shows a variety of shots of life in space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very boring, and we completely get the message. The interior and exterior of the spacecraft look bulky and outdated. Remember what the first cell phone looked like? I, too, but this is what the future looks like in 2001. All characters have clothes and hairstyles that resemble the year 1968. The chairs are decorated with bright red flowers and strange shapes, because we all know that in the future we will be sitting in strange looking chairs. Computer screens look disgusting, and this is clearly in front of HDTV, because the clarity is terrible. All TVs look as if they were 1968, so not everything is so futuristic. Like all films shot in more than 20 years, they look awful and unconvincing. Just because it is Kubrick, we should not say: "Well, that's how you think it looks." No, I would not exactly as I do not think that the computer will talk to me in 2047. This will not happen, and if someone made a film right now, set it 30 years on time and had a talking, thinking computer, I would laugh at the stupidity of it. Just as I did with "2001". <br /> <br /> HAL - the most lively person, shoot ?? I just called him a man. HAL is a computer, but he has more life than any of the muffled characters in the film, and he really thinks he is alive. HAL is the only living thing, and he sees people as his helpers who take care of him while he does all the work. HAL is “lip-reading” one of the very few conversations between Dave and Frank, and he “sees” that they plan to turn it off. This is where the only dramatic part of the film comes in: the battle between the red light and the guy on a spaceship trying to get on a large spaceship. Oh, the drama. As soon as HAL thinks he has an advantage, Dave returns to the spacecraft, proving man's ingenuity. Dave proceeds to stop HAL. HAL, begs for his life, as he slowly disappears, which, like everything else, seems to take forever. <br /> <br /> The final act is as boring as the first two. Once again, the monolith that Monkeys found appears at the end. Again from nowhere. Then the baby is born in a placental shield with a view of the Earth from space. What does Kubrick say? Is it about transformation? Dave baby? Is man evolving again? Kubrick says that this is the end of man and the beginning ?? what is this alien? I may be losing my mind trying to understand what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think about the more sense at the beginning and end. There are so many unanswered questions, especially for monolithic purposes. If you can do this through a movie, this should trigger some thought. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film fights what it wants. The first act and the third act are strong, but the second act wanders around, hovering in one place, which seems like an eternity. There are some intriguing things in the film that can trigger some thoughts if you give it a chance. As soon as the beginning of the movie becomes clear, the ending works much better, even if you still don’t understand what Kubrick is trying to say, but I don’t.
