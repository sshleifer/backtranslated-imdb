This is definitely my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not Renny Harlin's carefully thought-out explosions and gunfights. This is the script of Shane Black and his deft delivery by Gina Davis and Samuel L. Jackson. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between the two leaders deserves to be continued. Thank God, this has never been done. Too much danger of marriage with the original. <br /> <br /> Chess boards “Long Kiss” - from the scene with quotations to the scene of action films, the scene with quotations and back. Not a moment of peace. <br /> <br /> This must have been Jackson’s funniest role, and it’s surprising that he plays one of the most ordinary characters in his career. No dodgy Tarantinsky assassin, super-cool shaft or border psycho-soldier. In TLKG, Jackson is the one with whom we identify. The poor smack is dragged on this crazy woman's odyssey to reveal the dangerous secret of her past. <br /> <br /> Although the story claims that Davis's character Samantha Kane suffers from amnesia, the writer and director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder. <br /> <br /> Samantha Kane - not just a new person taken by amnesian Charlie Baltimore, is a separate, fully developed person. The injuries suffered by Samantha in the first half hour of the film help to resurface Charlie’s sharpened and dissociated personality. <br /> <br /> The materials of her past life, excavated by detective Jackson Mitchum Hennessey, contribute to the restoration of Charlie's surface. Good time, too, given the goal that Samantha sets for herself. <br /> <br /> But Charlie must fight with herself in order to remain the dominant person. We can recall several dialogues that developed the identity of a warrior (Charlie) after her father died, and she was recruited by the “Head”. <br /> <br /> For eight years, Charlie was buried in the shower, although her Samantha identity has become a dominant personality. (She is even funnier than Charlie.) This was probably because she became a mother because reuniting with her daughter interrupts Charlie’s fight to suppress Samantha, leading to their obvious integration by the end of the film. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to choose the “best quote” from this movie: <br /> <br /> “Now are you a sniper?” <br /> <br /> “I saved your ass. It was great! ”<br /> <br />“ Continue to die. Go away. " <br /> <br /> “I thrust them into my jaw and shout:“ Pop goes to affection. ” <br /> <br /> And a couple of a dozen others, many too gross to quote here. <br /> <br /> Gina Davis looks great and looks like an action movie hero, not hiding the fact that she turns forty. (Listen to the story of Charlie, do the math). <br /> <br /> Fantastic soundtrack too. Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle, Marvin Gay. <br /> <br /> I give “The Long Kiss of a Good Night” 9 points just because I don’t believe in the perfect 10. I watch it dozens of times, and it still remains fresh. A good twisted film to put it on the shelf next to the inscription "This is a wonderful life."
