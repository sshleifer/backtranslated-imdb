Anyone who is interested, I managed to get it on DVD from Ebay (I havenâ€™t received it yet - any day). <br /> <br /> I desperately tried to get it, even if it was VHS Quality, delivered on DVD, I do not mind. So for anyone interested, contact me, and maybe I can help you. <br /> <br /> Honestly, it's funny that I had to wait almost 7 years to see it again, but, man, it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> All of my workmates are desperate to see this. <br /> <br /> In any case, I will write later about quality. <br /> <br /> Just do a search on ebay if you want guys. it's there to buy
