The “cage” is a journey into the mind of a serial killer, and I mean it literally. A film about the journey, about the world, which he shows during this journey, the destination does not matter much. In my opinion, this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images, other things do not matter if they do not distract. In fact, the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> We start with Catherine Dean (Jennifer Lopez) in the thoughts of a catatonic boy. How exactly this works, in fact, does not matter, but is very similar to virtual reality. She and other scientists, including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), believe that this method may work. Catherine enters the boy's mind and speaks to him there, in a world that is completely created by a boy. She hopes to be able to allow him to do what ultimately will produce results. <br /> <br /> The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) has just dropped the body of one of his victims. In this case are the agents of the FBI Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Nowak (Vince Vaughn). The other girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears, and at that time, after a forensic examination of Karl’s discarded body, one can find and catch him. There are two problems. 1. Karl just fell into a coma; he was sick for a long time. 2. His house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not in the same place. In a sense, this part of the story is pretty standard. <br /> <br /> Everything will be interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Katherine should come to Karl's mind. This is dangerous for many reasons. In short: Karl is an unknown territory, a schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine starts to believe that Karl's mind is the real world, then her mind can convince her body; she could die in the mind of Karl. The tape on how the last victim was killed, the fate that this girl will comprehend in about twenty hours, ensures that Catherine tries to find out the whereabouts of Karl. <br /> <br /> This is a journey through this patient objection, which makes this film more than worthy of attention. Directed by Tarsem Singh, who made music videos before, in some ways returns to these music videos. Each room in the creative world is another short clip that exists from beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me, the visual style was completely new, since the Three Kings had a new visual style a year earlier. If something like this can make you look like a movie, “The Cell” will not disappoint. But fans of thriller and horror genre still can like this film. The story itself without a big fantasy world is good enough for this. I think you should be a little open-minded, of course, events are (so far) impossible in our real world. However, a very interesting movie with good ideas that looks amazing.
