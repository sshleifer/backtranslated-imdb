It was the second performance of Cinemascop, which Fox took off after The Mantle. Notice how some of the Roman sets are fixed to pass for the Egyptian sets. The film was shot with all the first-class elements, beautiful photography, exciting soundtrack (Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann - see if you can tell which composer was shooting specific scenes) However, the lead role is a bit weak. Edmund Purd seems to have a limited range of emotions and itâ€™s not interesting to watch. The best performances come from Pyotr Ustinov as a one-eyed slave and Polish actress Bella Darvi as the Babylonian seductress Nefer. I find this film as a whole strong on the plot, which rarely happens for these big points created at that time. In general, the film makes an interesting and interesting work of social commentaries on how Egyptian society might look.
