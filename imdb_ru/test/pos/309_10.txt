Of all the films about the Vietnam War, this is perhaps the most frightening and alarming, and it really says a lot about the fact that so many exciting films have come out. This is a strange feeling. In the film, everything is so chaotic that it scares you. This is not something that shows a lot of different things compared to other war films in Vietnam. What pushes to such a high level is: <br /> <br /> The direction was impressive. Francis Ford Coppola shows his talent in his latest epic film. Unlike other directors, it makes you feel as if you were at war. Most others simply show and show you the horrors of war. Coppola, however, makes you feel embarrassed, shocked and scared. These feelings of war usually tell us from a movie or a story. This is what I experienced very few times when watching a movie. The letter was, of course, also amazing. It brought you to write in the middle of the film. It never made me bored, and this film is three hours. Cinematography goes hand in hand with directing, which has greatly added to the strange experience of watching this film, showing all the chaos around you, even when everything seems calm. <br /> <br /> Shooting was awesome. Just look at Marlon Brando, who also gave his last great performance in the role of a deceived colonel. When I think of the insane soldier who’s gone, I think of Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. With Brando in this movie, you don't want to look him in the eye. Like the movie, it was strange. For me, this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Shin gave a very deep speech and is probably the best in his career, making you see everything with his eyes, all the craziness he experiences, and still wanting him to achieve his goal. It's amazing why these two didn't get an Oscar nomination. Robert Duval was able to show part of this madness with his ridiculous battle strategies among those who play music to tell the enemy that he is coming. Also Duval's character, asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle, was simply shocking, but believable. Other excellent performances were given by young Lawrence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederick Forest, who summed up the attitudes of many soldiers at the time without becoming clichés. In addition, this time came the well-used cameos with Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford, which I love. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend that people watch this movie. It has a message, and everyone involved in making it at its best. I can’t ask anything more about this movie with its great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and a great ending. Take a look, and you will understand why it corresponds to the name Apocalpyse Now.
