I had the honor of watching Mar Adentro last Friday, and I am still shocked by his beauty, the powerful work of every actor and actress, and Amenabar’s incredible ability to tell the story of Ramón Sampedro, who was well known in Spain when he asked for legal euthanasia, lost the case. and eventually died in front of a camera drinking a glass of poison, freezing all our hearts with his determination not to live forever immobilized due to an accident. <br /> <br /> Before watching the film, I was already hypnotized by strong symbolism in its title, which I would translate as “To the Sea”, and not as some suggest “To the Sea”, and which is taken from the original poem, written by the man about whom this story. Then I watched the movie. Oh my friends. This is a Cinema with a capital letter C. The narration flows to take you to the heart of each character: Sampedro, reincarnated in Bardem, which you forgot from the very beginning, is in the center, as a person full of humor and full of hope, and his hope is to die, because for him the life that he lives is not worthy of living. The rest of the characters, except for one, dance around him and respect his decision, because they consider him an independent person (forgetting that he depends on others in everything), even if they love him so much. And this is what the film is about: love. You can feel it, you can breathe it into the skin of each character. You become witnesses of the growing feelings of three women who meet him in the film: Wife, a member of the association that protects his right to a worthy death, his friend, her story in the film is a hope for us, the lucky ones, who can live a normal life. the world; Rosa, a woman who meets a good man in the middle of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who used her and despised her; Julia, a woman who shares a tragic fate with Ramon and ultimately acts the way we cannot, but can only understand. <br /> <br /> However, before meeting these women, Ramon knew what love is, because you cannot meet him without love for him, and he is deeply in love with his backward family: four characters, unique in their modesty and bravery, each with their own thoughts about their decision, each thought respectfully in their own way, because what is terrible in this story is that no one is to blame for what happened. Unfortunately, life is sometimes so terrible. From this familiar quartet, I especially liked the work of Mabel Rivera in the role of the daughter-in-law of Ramón Manuela: an amazing presentation. <br /> <br /> I would like to draw attention to the three episodes that are for me the best culminating moments that I have seen for a long time, and if you have not seen the movie yet, do not read it, skip this paragraph and reread the next one, starting with Mar Adentro, let the movie show you its secrets. The episodes I loved were as follows: 3. The best love scene I saw in the movie when I really felt love invading the screen was when Ramon had a dream that he was flying towards Julia on the beach and they were kissing each other friend 2. Jena is on the phone with Ramon the day before he is going to do it, and he tells her that it is better that they say goodbye at that very moment so as not to cause her any trouble with the authorities. And then she knows that they are talking for the last time, and she fought for his right to die ... but she does not want to lose him because she loves him as a true friend, and although she respects his decision at any cost. 1. the best. Young Ramon on the beach, looking at his girlfriend under the sun, jumps across the water from the rocks into the retreating sea. We see an accident, we hear his voice recall what happened, and he claims that he had to die at that very moment. The face of Bardem, face down, is shown below. And the hand of a friend who pulls him from his forehead and brings him back to life, which will become hell for him in the next 30 years. There are many others, like an impressive finale, despite the fact that in Spain we know too well what Ramon did. <br /> <br /> Mar Adentro did not deceive me, Amenabar never deceives, but this time he thanks the actors who took part in the project and who may have taken him personally, because this is not just a film, this an elegy for a man who died alone when he asked to die "legally", which meant for him. As noted by Bardem, dying with people he loved and who loved him around.
