I honestly would give this movie a solid 7.5, but I pressed 10 to try to compensate for 5 pages of inappropriate, unwarranted 1-star reviews. This is an interesting story, all the actions from good to very good (even Ms. Diaz, who completely fails to fulfill her usual role of “grinning”, but still plays her well.) The shooting is perfect, and the cinema consistently corresponds terribly. This is a good moral game, and there is no reason to explain the origin of God / supernatural being / alien / anything that "drives the show", so I'm glad the movie did not try. This is really irrelevant to the story, which is relatively long, but rather convincing and fairly satisfactory summarized in the final. <br /> <br /> Before you decide that this movie is terrible (or indeed, something below ~ 7.5), read a few dozen 1-star “hated” reviews, full of spelling errors, lack of punctuation and capital letters and juvenile criticism. Perhaps the trailer was misleading or something - I did not see it - but some of these reviewers obviously expected Terminator 4 or Saw 5 (one reviewer actually compared this film with Saw! How totally inappropriate and unrelated!) <Br /> <br /> Seriously, most of these reviews are read as comments to you - according to these “critics”, this film is too confusing, but too predictable, not enough action, but too much happening, too clever, but too stupid, explains too much but leaves too much unexplainable ... oh - and this is obviously "waist (sic) of time." Consider the quality and source of reviews before taking them to heart. I fear that these 1-star children could not understand the phrase “coefficient of altruism” and therefore were completely unable to understand the premise of the film (despite the fact that they categorically argued that they “understood everything” before explaining how confusing it was !) If you know what these two words mean, you will not have problems with understanding (and enjoying) this film. <br /> <br /> I would really like to have a reviewer's reputation system here, so I can be sure that I will ignore the rating of everyone who gave this film. movie 1 star forever. <br /> <br /> See for yourself and enjoy the beautiful presentation of an interesting couple, passing an interesting moral “test” and facing the consequences. This is a good time in my opinion.
