Barbara Stenvik probably didn’t think about it, but it is gratifying to see her in a darker hairstyle (if it’s not a wig) than the one she was supposed to wear in “Double Compensation” a year earlier. This film, while the premiere of the film “Noir” and a comprehensive gorgeous film, gave her an excellent role, but, oh, that hair. Here she is more chic and, of course, not a femme fatale, but she is definitely a woman of 40 years old. She has become accustomed to a life without men, since most of them are in a war, and as a successful commentator, like Martha Stewart, she writes a home column in which she describes her country house when the camera shows that it is. We meet with her boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea that she lives in a lie, and when he goes to Christmas at her supposed home in Connecticut, she must find a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and a child before we can say "Jingle Bells ". Hungarian chef SZ Sakall intervenes to help and ends up in a one-on-one hooded pie with Irish Una O'Connor. "This is not goulash, this is Irish stew." Sakull just takes a paprika, pours most of it and says: “Now it's goulash,” completely changing what she prepared for dinner. Then, when it comes to pancakes, he rolls over and she rakes. For years, several of my friends, and I will use this line every time pancakes appear in conversation. “I do not turn over. I'm a scoop! She would not even turn one for Greenstreet, saying: "I have never turned over in my life." O'Connor can get on her nerves when she screams again and again in some films, but here she is delightfully attractive, and her couple with Sakal is very charming. <br /> <br /> This is evident in the novels section that Reginald Gardiner is not a cup of Barbara Stanwick's tea, especially when she meets the handsome Dennis Morgan, who is a little embarrassed when she bathes a child who eats soap, which is a little worry . He should suspect something instantly, but does not. But it is not important. The film is so charming that the situation in the village is filled with snow, an abundance of rocking chairs and a dog running towards them when the sleigh arrives. Living in New York after 25 years in Los Angeles, after I grew up in a small town on the west side of New York, made me miss this kind of Christmas. While Central Park is beautiful after the first snow, and the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is also elegant, there is something about looking at a snowy field of trees and a casual look at deer, rabbits or other wild inhabitants. <br /> <br /> This is a great festive film that can also bring the Christmas spirit out of season and creates a great combination with Barbara Stanwick's other Christmas movie, Remember the Night, an undervalued piece of jewelry. Add “Meet John Doe” to your big city, and you will probably find one of the busiest stars of holiday movies around.
