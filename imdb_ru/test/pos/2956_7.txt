The Lone Ranger was one of the heroes of my childhood, and I never missed a chance to catch his adventures on Saturday morning repeats in the mid-1950s. However, somehow I got this movie until I had the opportunity to catch it today thanks to my local library. During this story, I was struck by many elements, since from the very beginning you have a new song, the Lone Ranger, before you hear the traditional discovery used in the television show. The adventure uses Tonto (Jay Silverheads) in a beautifully expanded role, even though he hits his share of the lumps everywhere, he is beaten and shot more than once. Perhaps the most interesting of all, the Ranger really shoots to kill in several situations, which puts his character at odds with the vision created for the series that he will never use his weapon to kill, only to injure or protect himself and others <br /> <br /> In addition, you have a rather traditional western adventure. Ranger and Tonto come to the aid of an Indian tribe, whose members are killed by hijacked hijackers, trying to find five medallions that together form the key to a fabulous treasure. Interestingly, the leader of the bad guys is an already rich woman, disarmingly portrayed by Norin Nash. Her main assistant plays Douglas Kennedy, and it is not surprising that Lane Bradford is one of the villains. Bradford's character was one of the men shot by the Lone Ranger, which made me wonder how many times this could have happened on the show. A quick check revealed that he appeared on the Lone Ranger show fifteen times, while Kennedy appeared a total of six times. <br /> <br /> What may be the most interesting of this picture is her attempt to portray the Indians in a revisionist light at a time when westerns on television and in movies still mostly portrayed the red man as an illiterate savage. The character of Dr. James Rolfe (Norman Fredrik) is most revealing in this regard; he is an Indian who was educated and became a doctor, returning to the land of his tribe to take care of the needs of all its citizens. For the purposes of the story, he had to impersonate a white man in order to be accepted by the local ranchers. In fact, it was the hardest thing for me to come to terms with the storyline, since Dr. Rolfe was the grandson of an elderly leader Tomach (John Millian). The fact that no one in the history, except Paviva (Liza Montell), knew that he really was an Indian, was something strained for me. I guess it was possible that he left the tribe at an early age, but without this story being revealed, it didn’t make sense for me that none of the tribe would know who he was. <br /> <br /> I don’t know why I’m so intrigued by this, but after watching and watching over two hundred westerns on this site, I unexpectedly came across three films last month that use a common trick, such as one performed by the scout horse Tonto in this picture. Roy Rogers’s trigger did a similar trick in The Son of a Pale Face in 1952, and I caught him again in the Big Country of 1958 from a horse named Old Thunder in this film. This is done as a comic relief in a situation that is usually not suitable for a horse, and now I wonder when the bit could have been made first. I will have to keep looking more westerns old time. In order not to transcend himself, Silver also had the opportunity to prove himself in the picture, rescuing an Indian child whom Brady, the bad guy, was going to use as a hostage. <br /> <br /> Speaking of stunts, Clayton Moore borrowed tactics from the series when he put on a disguise as a gentleman from South America to smoke the villains, posing as hooded riders. Whenever he did it in the half hour format, he was always smart enough to hide his real traits, usually with a beard, like here. One of the most interesting episodes that I remember was that the Ranger was impersonating an actor in the guise of Abraham Lincoln. <br /> <br /> Do not miss a couple of the nonsense that I noticed along the way. In an early opening scene, one Indian was shot by one of the hooded raiders, and a close-up on his shirt was bleeding, but there was no bullet hole. Later in the story, Ross Brady and Wilson ride the Indians after they kidnapped one of the villains from prison. Brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from identifying the raiders, but it is immediately clear that he is going to run away with Wilson.
