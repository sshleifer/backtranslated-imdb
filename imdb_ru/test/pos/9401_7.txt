I recently filmed the movie Twister, which I saw on TV several years ago, and it has aged well; I found that I laughed out loud at this several times, and, oddly enough, like all these people, by the end I was deeply concerned about them. This is a kind of small film created for a cult audience, because, like gazpacho Howdy (well, I think this is what it is), this is an acquired taste: you must be tuned to its particular wavelength. Production values ​​might be softly called inexpensive, and the pace and atmosphere take time to calm down, but the film has an “appearance”, especially in some wonderful shots that contrast the dry evenness of the earth with the chaotic nouveau riche of wealth Mansion’s interior: Michael Almereid had a good eye even then. Living with sodapop mogul Eugene Cleveland (Harry Dean Stanton) and his household (two grown children, a grandson and a housewife) seems so disconnected from life outside that we could end up in Gormengast. Everyone in this film is wonderful (especially Suzy Amis and Crispin Glover as meaningless genius brothers and sisters Maureen and Howdy) who after a while populate their roles so comfortably that you just buy a strange prerequisite that somehow survived a tornado and obviously not capable of happiness, these people are lucky, and yet do not know what to do with their luck. There are some really wonderful scenes: Eugene's sudden encounters, first with his girlfriend, TV presenter Virginia, who is mining gold, and her children; William S. Burrows takes on targeted practice in the barn and tells the story of the mysterious Jim; Boyfriend Maureen, Chris, showed himself fighting a barn full of wasps disguised in a tablecloth, napkin and old Fedor; Hi, Violet, Maureen and Chris are sitting on the sofa (the last three in light summer clothes, wearing a red jacket and black leather clothes in rock and roll style), looking at the images of deserts on a huge TV and contemplating the future (the images were made Bill Viola, who made the background video installation for the last tour of Nine Inch Nails). Crispin Glover is predictably magnificent, like Howdy: as always, he remains perfect in character. Hi made the cult of his suffering and brilliance; he looks like Oscar Wilde from Kansas, seeking to match his red velvet suit. Whether he silently beats up, but plays the electric guitar loudly, cracks a full-sized whip, donning a completely black cowboy outfit, demolishing a room, or even doing simple things, such as driving or pouring the above-mentioned soup from a blender jar, it is fascinating. If you like his work, you will like it.
