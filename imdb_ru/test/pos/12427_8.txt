I saw it in the Horror Zone and fully expected that it would be complete nonsense, like most of the films that they play, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film revolves around two friends and a maniac in a monster truck who stalks them (I know it sounds shitty, but in fact it's very good), the film is creepy when it is going to be, and laughs out loud in some parts (and inadvertently, it also unfolds well and gives a lot of pleasure and is very funny, some very funny black humor is added to it. This is not the most original film, but so what? If you are after Shakespeare, then is it not true if you are after a funny movie then this should be good
