An excellent silent version of the story of Francois Villon. Although this version was remade in the thirties, as if I were the king, with director Frank Lloyd, screenwriters Preston Sturges and Ronald Coleman starring, this version is even better. Barrymore, with a group of comedians, plays the comic fool and Villon, depressed by wine, with an enthusiasm with which Coleman could not match. Photography is striking in its beauty and innovation, and the cast, in particular Conrad Weidt in his American premiere, the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day and the comics of Slim Summerville and Hank Mann, steals all the scenes in which they are located. <br /> It's a shame that Barrymore made so few first-class comedies. Among his sound films, only his leadership in the twentieth century and his supporting role in MIDNIGHT can be compared with this, and they come out only because of his excellent voice. In this silent film, Barrymore has to tell his story without words, and he does it, alternately ridiculously unrecognizable as the King of Fools and dearly like Villon in love. He even convincingly jumps in Fairbanks's chepuhovy style. He also allows his actors to play their glory, capturing in this ensemble piece, like any talented comic of the era. <br /> <br /> Finally, a short word about Alan Krosland, the director, known today only through directing. The first talking feature of THE JAZZ SINGER was released the same year. Crosland was a cautious, innovative, delightfully original director, and sad that his works are no longer known. Perhaps this film, much more interesting as a film than its most famous work, will become your acquaintance with his other talents. If so, you could do much worse.
