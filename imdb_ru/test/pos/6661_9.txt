In the cold mountain, Northern Colorado, near the period of the US civil war, Rev. Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in a small town with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) for health reasons. Ada also meets the shy Inman (Jude Law), and they fall in love with each other. With the outbreak of war, Inman becomes a soldier, and his support in staying alive is the desire to see Hell in Cold Mountain again. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Tews (Renee Zellweger), a survivor of the war, who helps her on the farm and becomes her best friend. The story alternates between present and past situations, revealing a beautiful novel. I really liked this movie. With such names as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Nathalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi as a supporting role, Anthony Minghella’s superb leadership and seven directions to Oscar, this film does not disappoint. My point is that there are several very important scenes in the story that have been deleted and presented on DVD. At least one of them, which shows what happens to Sarah, her child, and the three corpses on her farm, should not be removed, as it were. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Cold Mountain”
