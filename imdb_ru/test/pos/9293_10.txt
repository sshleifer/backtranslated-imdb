This is a show with the best Comedys made in Australia, as it makes fun of almost everything many of our viewers want. One of the best things about this show is testing advertisements that test how ads will work in real life. What is really great about the series is how original it is and the fact that there are people in it (persecutors) who like to do what they do and who don't. In this show there are a lot of bits that can crack anyone, for example, a road test for advertising, which I have already mentioned, Mr. Ten questions, where he very quickly asks 10 questions before famous celebrities such as Hugh Jackman and the boys from Beach , temporarily as The Chasers Emmys and those that were there from the very beginning, like what we learned from current events this week. In general, I rate a bad show at 98%.
