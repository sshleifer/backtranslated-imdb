I first saw this film in 1953 with my elder brother. It was one of the great 3-dimensional films released in that era. We saw it at least thirteen times and were proud of it. Scott performs typical western shooting, surrounded by Indian arrows, not surround sound. Oh, for these polaroid lenses again.
