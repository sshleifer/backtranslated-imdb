and I think it is good. I just never was a fan of Rosalind Russell, although the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bette and was glad to hear that she was doing this. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the production, I think it was a little less than in the original film. One of my favorite minor characters in the original was Mazepa, with her clumsy voice on the board, who shouted, “HEY! To become a stripper you need more than no talent! ”And although I missed it, I was glad to see that the producers had the courage to not make an exact copy. <br /> <br /> I also liked the fact that there are large parts of this film that were shot, as if you were watching the stage, it seems that you are in the theater, not just in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I think another thing that I liked about this performance was that it seemed to have a little less repetition of the song “Let me entertain you,” which becomes very annoying after about 5 th time when you hear it.
