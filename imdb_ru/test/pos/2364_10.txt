The funniest British film I've ever seen, Supergrass, is a story about sex, drugs, creams and murders by the sea. Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmonson), the average moron, wants to impress his so-called girlfriend, Andrea (Dawn French), because she thinks he is too law-abiding. Therefore, in order to make her go along with him on a romantic holiday, he came up with a scheme that might hit her and tempt her to spend some time with him. The problem is that Dennis’s lie lies in the fact that he somehow got involved in the international ring of drugs, and, telling her, a pair of policemen overhear his boasting and cut him. And here begins this witty film, full of cunning comedy and rough jokes. Dennis crashed into a local nickname, and, to the great satisfaction of the arresting officers, there seems to be no way out (Andrea’s earlier attempts to explain that all this was a lie were rejected by a funny tune “Stay with Your Man” by two officers). Then comes the commander Robertson (Ronald Allen), chief of intelligence at Scotland Yard. He makes a deal with Dennis that if he helps him catch the drug smugglers, he will be released and he will be allowed to do whatever he wants. Dennis agrees and teams up with Harvey Duncan (Peter Richardson) and Leslie Reynolds (Jennifer Saunders). Everything else - an unforgettable, delicate impression of the ribs: Robbie Coltrane as a sergeant Troy adds a humorous tint to the film. His walk on dry dock against Frankie Goes to Two Hollywood Tribes is gorgeous and probably the best scene in cinema history. Two officers, whose name is Dennis, play well Michael Elfik and Patrick Durkin, and Alexey Sayle as a police motorcycle - laughter! If you want to see something nice on a Saturday night, then I suggest you rent it. You will not forget it!
