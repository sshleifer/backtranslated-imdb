I can not imagine why this has not yet been released in a theatrical production. He has a great cast, in which Sutherland, Lane and especially Chris Evans do an amazing job. Wake up studio execs! <br /> <br /> The story is based on the experience of the author / screenwriter who grew up as a “poor child” in an extremely rich community where class is everything and matters in all aspects of life, from clothes to justice. <br /> <br /> During questions and answers to the film, the author was asked about his experience, and especially about what we do not know about the super rich. He said that they are not stupid, they are very smart (as opposed to how they can portray themselves), they have plans, and they represent a threat! <br /> <br /> In many ways, this film is very timely.
