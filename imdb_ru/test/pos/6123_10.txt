I grew up in Baltimore, so I was familiar with the John Waters films, since I was too young to watch them. And if you know that John Waters is limited to Hairspray, Cry-Baby or other family-friendly films, then you need to prepare for pink flamingos. <br /> <br /> Explicit sexual acts, incest, an old woman who eats only eggs, and unsanitary actions with chickens are just part of the depravity in this film. The film ends with "Divine, Water," 300 pounds. a dressing star eats dog excrement. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that there are two families: one pair of inbred trailers, in which the Divine and Edith Massey as a lady egg; and the other is a rich, swinging couple. Both families are competing for the title of the “Dirtiest Human Being Alive”. Enjoy the best movie of John Waters, but watch it only if you are an open-minded person with a strong stomach, because some scenes in this film will be unpleasant to you.
