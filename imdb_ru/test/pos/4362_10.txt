Little Dieter Needs to Fly was my first film at the 1999 Gothenburg Film Festival. Since I was very tired that evening, I did not dare to see it, but the total score of 9 here in IMDB made me go there. <br /> <br /> These were 80 minutes of pure vitality! The experience of Dieter Denglersâ€™s life through his own stories was fascinating. <br /> <br /> WATCH! And if possible ... look in the cinema!
