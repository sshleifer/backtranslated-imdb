I really liked "Random Hearts." It was shocking to see such a low rating on IMDB, but Chakan is the son of gout and all that. I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I have to admit that he was not played well in this film, and the reason I gave him 9 instead of 10. Christine Scott Thomas, however, was just wonderful. She was believable and beautiful, despite the fact that she was half shot, as if she had been crying for several days. Could “Random Hearts” be better? Of course, but it is very worth seeing as it is.
