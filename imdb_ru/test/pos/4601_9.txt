This film was quite a pleasant surprise. I had been expecting this for a long time and was afraid that it would not be able to meet my expectations. <br /> <br /> It surpassed them. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> Hilarious from beginning to end (stay until the end after the captions!), it is absolutely amazing how a movie about dumb and annoying characters can be so clever, witty and attractive. <br /> <br /> Possessing obvious matte pictures, the future Land of the film resembles the Planet of the Apes series and other science fiction films of that era. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is essentially the “Planet of the Apes”. but with people who are the mental equivalent of great apes. <br /> <br /> He is moving at a rather lively pace, and Luke Wilson does a good job with a film whose character resembles the one he played in Bottle Rocket. ". (In the early scene, they don’t even so subtly nod at Bottle Rocket.) <br /> <br /> Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good, as was the former “artist” who also froze. <Br /> <br /> Despite all its strengths, Idiocracy has a clear sense of the film that was taken away from the director / editor before it could be customized. <br /> <br /> I can't for life I understand why this funny movie would just be thrown into several cinemas without advanced shows, without trailers, without advertising at all. <br /> <br /> As if the studio decided that it was no longer going to spend on it and just left. <br /> <br /> Or maybe they thought there was a cult classic in the film, and the only way to become a real cult classic is to make it fail? <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a shame, because Mike Judge and this film, in particular, deserve better. <br /> <br /> I predict that this film will have real legs on a DVD, and word of mouth will lead him to the success he deserves. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the Fox executives saw themselves in the characters, were confused and thought it was a documentary?
