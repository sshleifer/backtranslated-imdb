After three outstanding BBC television series and a Christmas special edition, the strange and grotesque (but perversely attractive) characters of the gloomy fictional town of Royston Vasya make a leap into celluloid with their creators, the Gentlemen's League. <br /> <br /> Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Rhys Sheersmit are the more familiar three-quarters of the four, with central roles divided between the trios. In the added twist, the final team member, Jeremy Dyson, is depicted by actor Michael Sheen. <br /> <br /> How to start? Dyson (Shin) talks with his writers, when - the horror of horror - he is visited by his two most terrible characters. Both Tubbs (Pemberton) and Edward Tattsyrup (Shirmsmit) are unhappy with the League’s decision to kill Vasya’s inhabitants. "You are not real!" - Dyson shouts in vain, because local shopkeepers from hell are demanding revenge. Chaos appears when reality and Vasya come together with a huge number of characters who enter our world to save their world. <br /> <br /> Confused? Like a camp, you will be an incredulous Teutonic, Herr Lipp (Pemberton) is forced to take on the appearance of Pemberton (Pemberton) every day, and Pemberton (Pemberton) is abducted by the cannibal butcher Hillary Briss (Gatiss) and Jeff Tipps (Shearsmith). <br /> <br /> With an even crazier misfortune, Briss is trying to get Pemberton to rewrite the film - thus continuing his life - but keeping Jeff in the lead will never be a good idea. The former comedian finds himself drawn into the latest post-vazeysky adventure of the League - The King's Evil - entering the typically distorted England of the 17th century, complete with cameos from Victoria Wood, Peter Kay and David Warner. Known as George Asda (because of his chosen line of clothing), Jeff saves the day and is considered a hero, but for the outcome of the film he joins old and new characters in Washi Royston church to meet with their producers. <br /> <br /> For fans of the series, this film is a must. And yes, there is Papa Lazaro in him (albeit a bit fleetingly). Pauline, Mickey, Barbara and the damned vet Matthew Chinnery are some of the other favorites on the show, and the league image itself (plus Sheena as Dyson) is also a fascinating insight. <br /> <br /> “The League of Gentlemen” is the head of the British comedy “Radiohead” - they are ambitious, innovative (testify to an excellent third series) and are not happy to rest on their laurels. They also share the opinion accordingly. <br /> <br /> Of course, their dark sense of humor is not for every taste, and although not written solely for “fans,” understanding the plot will benefit those who have previously watched the series. Nevertheless, the Apocalypse is in itself a film, and the League, no doubt, will be able to attract new fans, as well as to please and delight existing ones.
