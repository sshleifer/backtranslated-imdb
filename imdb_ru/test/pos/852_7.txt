I can not criticize this film. This is literally the first film I ever remember, which led to a lifelong love of fiction, horror films and prehistoric animals. Fortunately, after seeing it again after years, he endured quite well. Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was destroyed by mammoths. No one believes him, including his best friend, played by Cesar Romero, whose brother was among those killed. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film is made in India and has good scenery. The game is at a high level. I do not believe that Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero and Marie Winsor have ever performed poorly. Mammoths, when they finally arrive, are quite effective. The ending also has an unusual twist, especially for a science fiction film from the 1950s. Definitely worth a look.
