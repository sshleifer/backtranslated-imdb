I was never sure if I liked this documentary or not. It was shown on channel 4 in front of a cut-down version of Revelations and is on the video tape of the Revelation in front of an uncut show. The documentary is basically Bill's friends, telling how great he was for an hour with mixed video clips of the show, a bit like a movie trailer that you are going to watch. It also shows that David Letterman is humiliated like a worm for throwing Bill out of his show before dying, reason? Bill joked about how Pro-Life people should picket a funeral, and Letterman had a Pro-life ad. In any case, pay attention to the video, as Revelations - Bill is at his best :)
