In this film, almost everything is there. The action is cool, funny, 2 great leading people and a really nasty villain, which I REALLY hated. Not many movies have bad guys. Just mostly comics villains. He really deserves to be hit. <br /> <br /> Jake Scott really has a father’s talent for making great visual effects. The direction is unmistakable and has an irresistible frivolous feeling. I usually don't like movies made in the old days, but I really liked it because it's boring, like in many other films of that period (“Feeling and Sensitivity”, “Epoch of Innocence” and the absolute worst ... “Lady and Duke ). This will restore your faith. Thanks mainly for Craig Armstrong's terrific score. The music is atmospheric and ethereal, and in the action scenes it is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Dolby 5.1 DVD with 2.35: 1 very grainy and dirty anamorphic image.
