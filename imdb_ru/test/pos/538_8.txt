Susan Sarandon She made this film for me. I have never appreciated it more than in this film. She really acted like she was Adele August. I can appreciate the actors and actresses who leave their individuality and create a truly believable character. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman in the role of Ann August helped create the perfect antagonist as their characters developed in the film. The film was about them, so the other characters were secondary. <br /> <br /> I gave this film eight ratings, but Susan received ten from me because of her work. As for relationship films, “Beaches” and “Tenderness Conditions” have had a greater influence on me than this film, but I highly recommend it.
