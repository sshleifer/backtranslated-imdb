Captain Corelli's Mandolin does not claim to be an Oscar, but it was pretty good. I must admit that Miss Cruise can really act. She puts a very good job. In fact, she does our boyfriend Tom in a drama. John Hurt was great as usual. Nicolas Cage seemed to enjoy. I bet he felt that he was returning to his roots like an Italian. However, I learned something. Another chapter in “The Horrors of Nazi Germany”: many Italian soldiers killed in the period there surrender to the allies and Germany’s possible surrender.
