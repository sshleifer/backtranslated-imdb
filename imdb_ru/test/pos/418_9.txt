This is NOT your ordinary police story, where the characters were secondary to the shootings and car chases. So far, these episodes are more realistic and intelligent. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something with a Rambo cop story, you will not find it here. <br /> <br /> I gave him 9. I wish this series lived a long time. Morse is great!
