I saw the film in Izmir as the final film of the Izmir Film Festival. I did not know anything about this, but now I am glad that I did not refuse to see Ding-a-ling-less! This is one of the funniest movies I've ever watched, and believe me, I've seen millions of movies !! (I'm a film critic!) Smart script and dialogue ... Smart details ... What else can I say? Indie masterpiece with a completely unique style of humor ... You can not wonder what he is capable of right now. Ding-a-ling less was shot five years ago, and Iâ€™m sure that director Onur Tukel is more mature now. I heard that his next feature would be political satire, and I really can't wait to see it among his previous works, such as The House of Pancakes.
