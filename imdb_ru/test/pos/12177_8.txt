Aaliyah throws all the actors out of the water, including the official love interest of Marguerite Moreau. <br /> <br /> I would really like this film to play out as an Akashic energetic journey. Aliya is just electrified when she is on the screen. She makes a sensual, beautiful, and threatening force. 10. Watching her look at a bar full of vampires is a sight. <br /> <br /> Lena Olin played the ungrateful role of an “old woman”, which is extremely unjustified. It looks fantastic, and at 46 years old (according to IMDb) it still looks amazing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the plot is very limited, we have already seen all this, and so on. <br /> <br /> The most heartbreaking is the scene of Akasha’s death, especially considering what happened to Aliya filming. <br /> <br /> In general, a wonderful film about vampires.
