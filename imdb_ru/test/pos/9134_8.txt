Although it is not a masterpiece that was “Le Samourai” (I already recognized that Jean-Pierre Melville was never able to surpass this classic), I believe that “Le Cercle Rouge” is much better than “Bob le flambeur”. I felt that “Bob le flambeur” was above average and influential b-film, but still b-film. Le Cercle Rouge proves that, as a director, Melville improved, continuing. John Woo is a big Melville fan, although their style of shooting is different. While Wu uses fast movement for shootings and an operatic sense of violence, Melville has a minimalist style that suits him very much. He was not interested in creating fast-paced action films, but in more meditative criminal thrillers. In this department he was one of the best. <br /> <br /> Samurai is still his best work, mainly because he has a more developed character than this one, but at the technical level they are probably equal. In addition, while “Le Samourai” had one big lead, it has four. Alain Delon is once again the ultra-cool gangster on the hunt - the man’s silence is fascinating. Burwil is great as a robber police inspector and a crook escaped. He steals every scene he is in and proves that he was a skilled dramatic actor (in France he is best known as a comedian in Buster Keaton mode). Yves Montand is also great as a wobbly and paranoid weapon specialist. Jan Maria Volonte (a regular participant in spaghetti westerns) is clouded by her three colleagues, but she still does her job. <br /> <br /> Once again, Melville's direction is superb. Receiving equal influence from both American crime thrillers and the French new wave, this man seems to always know the best shots and views. This is slower than most capers, but by the end it really pays off. Le Cercle Rouge is not an absolute classic, but is still one of the best robberies. Tarantino must have seen it before he made Mad Dogs. (8/10)
