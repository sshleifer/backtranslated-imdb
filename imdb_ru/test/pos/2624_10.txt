This film has remained in my memory for many years as one of the best mysteries created for television that I have ever seen. The game is great. I saw it twice and still puzzled by some moments. I would like to have a copy so that I can play certain games over and over again. I am interested in buying a copy of this film, but I cannot find it anywhere. I wonder if anyone has any suggestions how to find it? I tried e-bay, amazon.com, internet searches and was completely disappointed. I did not see him either in Turner's Classic Films or American Classic Films, but I even posted flyers in our community asking if anyone had a copy.
