Things I love. Steve Zahn, who plays the role of Gus, copies the party, copies the manners of Robert Duvals, which make him feel comfortable for Gus fans. (some other actors also copy the style of their predecessors in this series). Karl Urban looks gloomy and tough, but he can joke and smile, which T. Jones did in the original series. Equipment, weapons, clothing - all accurate or very accurate. I will never forgive Kostner and Duvalue for having a nylon lariat in their farm on the Open Site. Comanches, they are actually riding bareback, not hiding a modern saddle under a Navajo blanket. And they are not portrayed as politically correct, peace-loving pastoralists, but as proud warriors. There are a few silly scenes, but it surpasses another variation on something silly so as not to win a million dollar reality show.
