In this story about a tightly dilapidated Christian family, in which three out of four of its members were “born again” after a car accident caused by a cake, it really highlights how reasonable most of them are, where there are so many opportunities to overcome the upper hand, and how - this is what inspires most acting skills. Where most of the film’s moments, especially its frank and “innocent” discussions about sexuality, after three out of four family members have removed their guilt and shame, are ridiculous, it also makes you wonder, and the characters stay with you. <Br /> <br /> How often, for example, does a comedy character rotate from an almost caricature to a saturated emotional being during a single scene? How often do we see a cast that can retreat from the middle of a sentence to show a little humanity under the character's skin? Even many “bad guys” in this film have moments of heart-breaking honesty, even though most of what they do can be completely ridiculous and terrifying. In this film, there is some truth and history behind the most dubious actions, which is a difficult task in satire. <br /> <br /> How nice to see a dark comedy that can dare to be humanistic. How nice to see actors so committed to their character that they can allow themselves to be funny and sublime. <br /> <br /> And as gay, I don’t think that I was ever touched by heterosexuals. Sex scene, as I was at the first sexual meeting of the parents of this family after the accident. <br /> <br /> Bravo. Bravo. One of my favorites at Outfest this year.
