I was lucky enough to catch this film at the Phoenix Film Festival, and I must say that I really liked it. When I asked the director if he attended film school, I was very impressed that he did not. Such films do not come from people without talent. To start commercials, and then create a family comedy full of soul, such as this, shows the real range. Of course, I will follow what he does next. Like a good indie movie, the movie is very character oriented. Unlike your usual Hollywood movie, which is mainly based on the plot. The film tells about the Jewish family in New York, the Appelbaum family, who were all invited to the "suicide" party of their fathers. The film is filled with a witty, quick, chatty dialogue. The fact that a small Jewish family is obsessed with being Jewish, and anyone who is Jewish, explains the unrealistic situation of a “suicide” party in reality. Directed by Jeff Hare copes with the role, pulling characters out of the actors and bringing them to life on the screen. Serial design embodies the scenery, paying great attention to small details, so that the situation resembles the house in which they lived for 40 years. Editing keeps pace with the dialogue in such a way that it makes you sit where you are, wondering who will slaughter someone with the next clever phrase or zest. And when appropriate, the film slows down to allow viewers to dive a little deeper into the meanings and motifs hidden in these attractive characters. If you're a fan of Woody Allen or movies like “How Good, How It Comes”, watch this movie.
