A fascinating fragment of a documentary film about the life of a husband and wife and their marriage, told by the eyes of a son. We all like to think that our parents lived a happy life, that their marriages were full of satisfaction, love and happy memories. Unfortunately, many of us know that this does not apply to their own families and the families of their parents. This wonderful little documentary is told through the camera lens and the emotional perspective of the son of a family who has just experienced the death of his mother. The son, being a director of documentaries, shot his elder family for many years, as he claims, “offspring”. Three months after the death of his mother, his father again marries his old secretary. The suddenness of this incident stuns the family and makes the son delve into the past lives of his mother and father. He reveals a fascinating look at the lives of two fairly simple people who, like many of their generation, married early for the wrong reasons and ended up in family life when they just needed to “get along”. A wife who sometimes found herself bitterly lonely and unloved, and a husband who was burying himself in his work. She is intelligent and intelligent, he is a much more simple person who seems to find most of his pleasures in quiet seclusion at work. They are clearly not suitable for each other, it is clear. However, they stick out for what? Well, this is part of the mystery, they clearly show love for each other from time to time, if not ever a lot of love. You will not find here really shocking revelations, except for infidelity on both sides, which largely makes this stone so precious. You really feel that it could be your own parents, if the circumstances were different and really made you doubt the lives of your own parents.
