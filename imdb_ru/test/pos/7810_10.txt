In the history of Hindi Cinema there were very few remarkable comedy films. Andas Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young people (Aamir and Salman), who dream of getting rich by marrying the daughter of a millionaire (Ravina). Aamir and Salman Khan try their best to outwit each other and achieve Ravina. The plot thickens when Paresh Rawal & Co. plans to seize all the wealth. The film is very dynamic and very funny. It is rare to see a Hindi comedy that is both fun and intelligent. This is one of the few films with Amir and Salman (probably the only film!). Unfortunately, at the box office this failed, and we will never see a film of this magnitude. Amir Khan is great in the film and proved his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good fool performance. Ravina plays the convincing role of a bewildered rich girl, and Karisma, who is Ravina's assistant / girlfriend, is also fun. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajit, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdip and Talsania Tika simply add to the taste of the film! In general, the best comedy in Hindi that I have ever done, and I would like them to make more quality films like this one. You will want to watch this movie again and again. <br /> <br /> ps. For those who have watched this film, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupka Chupka, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Feary (old and new), etc.
