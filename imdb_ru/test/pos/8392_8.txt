Not your everyday Tom and Jerry are short for many reasons. First, Jerry's offscreen story, which is strange because Tom and Jerry rarely speak. Secondly, two are friends, which was also rare and rarely works, as more competitive shorts do. Third, and most importantly, the cartoon is rarely playful (by design), and the jokes here are a dry chuckle with a slight cough and a blood bubble at the end. Remember the cartoon Tom and Jerry, filmed by Tim Burton. Not entirely successful, but mostly it works. The most terrible ending for a short MGM that I can remember. Not for everyone and proof that these shorts were never intended solely for children as a target audience. Worth seeing. Recommended with reservations above.
