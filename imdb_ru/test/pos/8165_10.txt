The very first time I heard about the last days was when I rented a DVD, and I was interested, since I am a member of the LDS Church. I found this film very emotional, and in some places it made me cry. The reason for this is that too many years ago I knew a young man who survived what Aaron (played by Steve Sandvoss) is doing in recent days, but unlike Aaron, this dear young man did not survive the ordeal. He ended up taking a life after his church, his friends, and his family denied him because he was gay. There were a lot of people who do not think that what is shown in the film really happens these days, but the sad and sad thing they do. For those of you who are gay and young, you need to watch this movie, and if you are a gay Mormon, you really need to watch this movie. In addition, if you get a DVD, you have the help listed on the DVD. Teenage suicide in the gay world is very disturbing, and this film concerns him, but this part is to some extent hidden. The game and the music are excellent. This film sold out every movie theater that was shown, but it only showed in major cities and had a very limited release, so for those who would like to watch this movie, I would recommend the release of a DVD. The only people I know who did not like the film were members of my own church, and they did not watch the film because of the gays and the LDS Church. Watch the film, feel the story and feel the emotions that are shown in this film, and you will not be disappointed.
