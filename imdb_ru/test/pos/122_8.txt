Overall, a well-made movie. There were parts that made me flinch, and there are parts that I threw up my hands, but I left with something more than what I did. <br /> <br /> I think the film suffers from some serious excessive ambitions. Without spoiling this, let me say that the obvious references to the trial of the Ramayana fire are far superior to what is behind this film. Ramayana is an epic. Not a 200-page book that suppresses women in India. A film about two girls who are married in a very peculiar Indian family. Although the basic principles of the “unwritten laws of family tradition” seem to be the principles of conservative India, let me assure my reader that I (having lived in Delhi for 12 years) found whole pieces that simply did not ring in these bells. I mean that some things and some actions are very true, but some other things just go off-scale. Especially today. <br /> <br /> With Delhi everything is complicated. India is complicated. The director is trying to simplify both. And while quite unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Why in English? Can you submit a film about American Indians in English. Or the French speaking English. Seriously rattling. Even the servant spoke fluent English with an accent (albeit with hints of a spoken language for "believability"). <br /> <br /> But the chemistry between the leads is palpable. If you like it hot, this is the movie for you. I think this is the greatest saving grace - the development of a true love story in real life. <br /> <br /> If this film were about Radhe and Sita, he would receive a full rating from me. And, being about them, he could make a subtle statement. But this film says that this is what India is, and this is what Indian society looks like. And in this respect, he achieves as much as failures. Just take everything you see with a pinch of salt. India’s dark secrets are not revealed. Just two girls fall in love. Just like it happens everywhere.
