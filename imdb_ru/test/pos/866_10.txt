Honestly, I don’t know what IMDB words will allow me to use in this review, as a result it’s hard for me to describe these shorts. Let's just say that there is a lot of gay sex, necrophilia, incest, a lot of masturbation and a few artificial ... members. And I liked every minute. <br /> <br /> Not that it was ALL rude humor. This is not true. For the most part, they deviate from the plump jokes, except for one sketch called “Pizza”, in which they are very well used. "They" - 3 / 11th of a short comedy comedy that aired on MTV under the name The State, namely David Wayne, Michael Showalter and Michael Ian Black. <br /> <br /> The trio embark on an adventure, usually playing themselves and meeting strange and unusual people, people who are often actually more normal than they are. The cast is also fantastic. Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen, Bradley Cooper, Zach Halifianakis and Sam Rockwell all appear in various sketches. They are also joined by other state graduates, such as Joe Lo Trullo and Todd Holubek. Music selections are also very well placed. <br /> <br /> I liked these sketches over and over again, but they are not for everyone, as in most cases they are rather vulgar. If you like smart humor that is not afraid to push the boundaries of good taste, then I highly recommend it. If you like Wet Hot American Summer (director and author Wain and Showalter) or The State, you will really like it. <br /> <br /> I think that currently it can only be ordered online. Visit their website and make a couple of sketches to see if you really want to, and then learn how to buy a DVD.
