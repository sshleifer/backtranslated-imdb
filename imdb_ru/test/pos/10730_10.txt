Of course, when I watched this movie on HBO, I followed the plot a little erroneously, but it caught my attention when I saw Dustin Hoffman in it. Honestly, I am not happy with watching old films, but in the end it changes my point of view. Seeing this exciting film, I again felt like I was sitting in my seat, not noticing that my tears suddenly rolled down my cheek, and then, sighed heavily, I realized that I had just witnessed. Kramer vs Kramer really was one of the best classic drama films that I have seen for a long time, which even I myself could not imagine how it affected me. The story was very emotional, but not so intense. The characters were not unrealistic for their roles; they have qualities that make viewers the same as they take any position in the film, for example, the role of Meryl Streep, she was a mother who honestly admits her mistakes in the past, but then she is sure that she can defend her emotional motives to get what she wants in a fair and honest battle. Dustin Hoffman was too outstanding, I can not even imagine how this guy could play serious difficult roles and suddenly move to another role that was completely different, and then played it well. Despite the fact that I have already seen films many times when I sit down and stay at home, scanning films to watch and buy time for them, a passing glance at Kramer vs. Kramer will make my experience one more worthwhile moment.
