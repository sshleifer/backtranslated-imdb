Blade is a dark, gloomy, but significant film about vampires, one of the best. A little blood, but nothing terrible. Wesley Snipes played a strong role because he eliminates vampires. Not quite like Buffy, because it's too modest, but Blade offers a nice plot, and this is the movie that you probably would like to see on a dark stormy night ... it's best to watch! 87%
