As Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) secretly observes how her tyrannical husband Del (Aaron Eckhart) is murdered by the vengeful assassins Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), her humiliated sense of reality completely immerses into the world of fantasies of her favorite soap opera. In a state of complete denial and delusion, Betty is saved both physically and mentally from her dissatisfied life in a small town in order to find "Dr. David Ravel" (Greg Kinner), the beautiful and loving hero of "The Cause of Love", a soap opera is installed in the hospital and is made in Los Angeles. Insensitive to reality, Betty arrives in Los Angeles and becomes "Nurse Betty" as she tries to belong to the hospital world of her dream lover. Meanwhile, angry Charlie and Wesley track down Betty, convinced that she is a dangerous witness, who also knows about their compromising relationship with the Cause. <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty creates comedy and anxiety by contrasting the extreme innocence and optimism of the protagonist. with sheer hypocrisy and violence that surround her. Having clearly defined the difficult life of the protagonist, nurse Betty justifies the tendency of her character to turn away from reality. Thus, by offering a commentary on the popularity of the soap opera in the film, Nurse Betty also comments on the widespread dependence on television and its celebrities. In addition, nurse Betty benefits from effectively manipulating the mental state of her protagonist, especially in those scenes where she cannot distinguish between “Dr. David Ravel,” the character, and George McCord (Greg Kinnear), the actor who plays him. Betty's inability to recognize George as an actor leads to ridiculous misunderstandings that emphasize the extent of her delusional state. However, despite these successes, nurse Betty suffers from the disturbing characteristics that the narrative develops. For example, while Charlie and Wesley are consistently portrayed as a comic couple, the cruelty of their actions undermines any sense of appreciation or acceptance that the viewer may have originally experienced. Likewise, although in the first scenes Del is considered a disgusting man, the humiliation and violence he experiences with his murderers outweigh all the humiliations and violence he inflicted on his wife Betty. <br /> <br /> Finally, by the end of the film, Charlie is undergoing awkward changes as he develops Betty's obsession; an obsession that leads to a noble feeling of love and which ultimately destroys it. Therefore, since the roles of the characters as victims do not correspond to each other, the processes of victimization in history seem random and irrelevant. In general, Nurse Betty's uncertainty — not creating uncertainty — weakens her characters and pollutes her plot. <br /> <br />
