Perhaps the deepest cartoon created in the USA, "Duck", ends in 70 episodes for four seasons. <br /> <br /> Unlike the often innocuous criticism found in The Simpsons (a pretty good show by itself) and rude humor in the South Park for the sake of rudeness, every bit of this series follows a plan. Criticism of American society, from its mercantilism to selfishness, bears much more bite than any other animated series. <br /> <br /> Cultural links in Duck are also sometimes unclear (anyone viewing fan sites will realize that most are not even caught). This is different from the Simpsons, in which pop culture is commonly used, rather than the high eyebrows often hidden in Duckman. Like other people writing about this, character growth is noted (Bernice, Dakman and Kornfed). In addition, making the main character not just an insulting neurotic, but in fact those who are experiencing personal tragedy (as clearly shown in episodes such as “Once and the future duck” (“You will love her until the end of your days”) ... “) and in“ Bev takes a vacation ”(when he risks to tell Beverly all those things that he could not say to Beatrice), the series is anchored in the deepest sense of reality. <br /> <br /> It is impossible not to feel sorry for him and his clear madness. <br /> <br /> In general, in my opinion, the best cartoon ever created in the USA, and one of the best TV shows ever created. I doubt it will ever be on DVD. Too many things that, as Duck said, make more sense today.
