2005 was one of the best for cinema. We had so many great movies like Batman Begins, Sin City, Bride's Corpse, History of Violence ... As a result, we also received "Brokeback Mountain", King Kong ... If everything was lit, we would not have missed the whole of this year. The first film by the talented director, Liev Schreiber, is a delightful, touching, touching drama, which also features one of Elijah Wood's best roles. He is perfect as Jonathan, a curious man who is heading to Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather in World War II. Liev Schreiber, who also writes the film, holds a masterpiece with memorable scenes and (many) funny quotes. This is a real mix of comedy with drama, in which there is a film that will be commented on over the years. A serious contender for an Oscar, "Everything is lit" is a powerful, original and, if not to say, backlit film. But there is one thing you need to remember when entering a movie: leave the normal behind. This is special .------ 9/10
