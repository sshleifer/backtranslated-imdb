Flowers! If this is one thing you remove from this film, it will be flowers. They play such a prominent role and are used as plot devices. You will become an expert in identifying daisies and black tulips by the end of the film. <br /> <br /> In Amsterdam, Daisy tells the frustrating story of a love triangle. between 1 girl and 2 men in her life. One professional killer makes a living, another Interpol agent. Thanks to the pan-Asian composition (Korean, Hong Kong) and the film crew (directed by Andrew Lau from Hong Kong, a Korean writer and a Thai post-production team), I could imagine coordination headaches. <br /> <br /> Pak Yi (Jung Wu Sung) is a hired killer who found a soft spot for the artist He-Jung (played by the pretty Jong Ji Hyun). This is love at first sight in the daisy meadows, where her clumsiness attracted his attention. However, being shy and constantly remembering the dangers of his professional career, he can only admire her from afar, anonymously do small (or possibly large) things for her, but whoever takes the cake sends her potted chamomiles every day at 16 :15. He becomes her guardian angel from afar, protecting her and protecting her from harm. <br /> <br /> He-Yang is in love with this mysterious stranger. She is constantly waiting for his appearance, but I really wonder how difficult it is to do with the almost punctual delivery of daisies. However, she is terribly touched and touched by this single act. However, as it would be with the stars, Detective Interpol Jong Woo (Lee Sung-jae) accidentally met Heh-young in the town square during one of his secret missions, and he, too, was fascinated by her. Similarly, because of his profession, he doubts whether he should take the first step. <br /> <br /> This is where the public can get upset. This lady would obviously have fallen in love with the wrong guy (again, this is a “good” guy), Park Yi was furious with Jong Woo's persecution, but still refused to go out and identify himself, and Jeong Wu was an opportunist in capturing . It’s like if you wanted to slap each of them to wake them all up. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is this tension that makes you intrigued. And it's very fun to watch two men who find it difficult to fall in love without jeopardizing their career or their loved one. But do not worry, action fans, there are enough cat-and-mouse revelations and an unsaid camaraderie in the form of Infernal Affairs, as well as extensive skirmishes, although I felt that the final could be tougher. <br /> <br /> What rocks this clever editing. Telling a story in a non-linear graphic (don't worry, it's not so bad, you can still follow the narration) in terms of all the possibilities, keeping you on your toes and reaching a climax. a three-sided split screen showing all their emotions in a single converging event, which, it seemed to me, was very well done. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film in terms of landscapes with lush meadows and lively city squares, with a lot of classical music to soothe the soul. As in the romantic films, all the heroic videos are a pleasant surprise - the girls will have a field day with two beautiful male roles, while the guys will have to put up with a somewhat plump face (aaaaaaaa! Ji-hyun. <br /> <br /> If you are in a romantic movie with an equal balance in the action / tension department, then Daisy will be your choice. If you prefer a more familiar cry, then another Korean movie debuting here at the same time, “You are my sun,” will be your alternative. And yes, I completely dig the final scene. which, I thought, only Koreans do it best? Kinda reminded me of JSA.
