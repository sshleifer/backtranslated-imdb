The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghost and horror films from the East was grim. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or a similar one. <br /> <br /> It is well photographed, and the sound is great. It is recommended to view on a good screen and with a good sound system with support for 5.1 or DTS. Obviously, this is with subtitles, so if it repels you, I would not do it. Duplication rarely works and would simply not work here. <br /> <br /> This is also truly scary, with great performances by actors who will be unfamiliar to western audiences. I would especially single out the stepmother, who was absolutely brilliant. In the finals you will want to watch it again if you can handle it. The plot is ruthless and offers no comforting moments of release along the way. <br /> <br /> If I have a little criticism, it is possible that in some scenes the influence of the Japanese version of The Ring is revealed. However, for years we have taken direct copies of the ideas of other peoples for Western films, and therefore my point of view is limited, which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10. I believe that most fans of this genre will get great "pleasure" from this film, which, I hope, is considered a classic.
