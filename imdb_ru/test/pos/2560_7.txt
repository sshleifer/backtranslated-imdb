Better than I expected from a movie selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and interracial slavery. The music is great, and the cinematography pretty much focuses on turning Ricci into Betty Page's trailer, and it works. Samuel L. is forced to shout a lot, what he is good at, and also play a lot of blues guitar that he looks cool. Even Justin Timberlake was a decent guy with mental disorders. I have the feeling that this material for someone else would have been finished with *% #, but instead he managed to isolate his strange little transgressive cellulose niche, while remaining an effective drama.
