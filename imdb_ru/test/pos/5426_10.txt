This film is all about people. This film has been my favorite short animated film for many years. <br /> <br /> Isn’t the simplest thing that makes life so much more interesting ?! We, people, so soft, compassionate, funny, caring about each other in an instant - we invent the most beautiful and amazing machines to kill as many people as possible with minimal effort the next. In our short life, we destroy our world, each other, and often our own lives, than we spend the rest of our lives trying to correct what we have destroyed. Sometimes there is nothing that can be fixed! <br /> <br /> This film can entertain, educate and even help us understand what’s wrong in our lives! Life is short and maybe even shorter! I'm afraid the final is too optimistic. <br /> <br /> I like Richard Condi's mind and what he does with it! <br /> <br /> Enjoy <br /> <br /> H.K.
