Great combination: - Shabat humor - the world and the characters of Uderzo / Goscinny - Christian Clavier's limited presence <br /> <br /> The original comics were great - one of the best in the whole great TV series - and Alain Shabbat, one of the funniest member of the famous French Les Nuls groups, was able to film, reproduce and supplement the magnificent work done by Goscinni and Uderzo, skillfully imposing the plot, giving Jamel Debus the best role (finally, a little far from his usual repeatable part), collecting a bunch of great actors (Gerard Darmon are wonderful As he often Chabat - great Cesar). <br /> <br /> In addition, being obliged to support Christian Clavier in the role of Asterix, Chabat deftly tuned his role in the film to emphasize the role of Darmon and Debus ... which is always a good idea! <br /> <br /> => Great atmosphere, great script, great director, great actors, great humor, beautiful Cleopatra ... This film would have deserved 10 if Clavier werenâ€™t N bee involved.
