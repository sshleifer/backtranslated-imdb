Mark Wahlberg in a great role idolizes a rock star to such an extent that he knows all his songs, imitates him perfectly and dresses like him. When the opportunity arises for him to take on the role of his “idol” in the group, he does not miss the opportunity. However, the role of a rock star may not be the same as it was invented ... and the relationship may change ... This film, of course, struck me that the theme of what you achieve may not be what you think. as soon as you get it. In general, a really good film with excellent performances of all the actors, as well as the two main characters, Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston. I was very sad, especially when Emily (Jennifer Aniston) met Chris in Seattle and saw the depth of what he drowned. If someone has ever dreamed of becoming a rock star or a fan, he should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although charming for some time, is very lonely and, ultimately, not one that you may need.
