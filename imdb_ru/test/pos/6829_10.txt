The second episode of the new "Lost" gives you only what its fans lacked - a fair amount of exciting action. From the very first scene, you continue to see completely new features that you did not expect to encounter. This is the best proof that the series, which begins in the 4th season, is still alive and energetic. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the producers this time did not surprise us with new flashes, the return to the memories is more than satisfying, as it brings some shocking facts. In the memoirs, there are several fresh characters, and acquaintances are surprisingly connected. <br /> <br /> Fresh characters dominate the entire episode, and I cannot say that it does any harm. Their parts of the script and their actors do an excellent job, giving us a feeling of cheerfulness - right after the episode you will understand that such people are really needed for the show. And here they are. <br /> <br /> “Confirmed Dead” are full of exciting actions and beautifully written dialogues. I am sure that I will quote the best scenes of this episode for a long time - they are so good that they remain in the mind of the viewer. The episode is interesting, smart and funny. You like "Lost", you should watch it. My voice is ten.
