I watched this film, thinking that it would be absolutely terrible and ready for all things, bad special effects, etc. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not to say that this is the best vampire movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the worst. I liked the whole alternate reality / dream state that played in the film. The graphics were pretty good for the movie right on the DVD, and I liked the overall look of the movie. I liked the protagonist of Sai. I usually end up hating women's reasons, but there was something about her that interested me. Yes, she makes some bad decisions, but that was to be expected. Yes, other characters were stereotypical, but I also expected it. I do not know if I recommend this film, but give it a chance, and you may be pleasantly surprised. I put it on my pleasure list.
