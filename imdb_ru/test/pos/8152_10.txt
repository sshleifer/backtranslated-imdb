For an independent film, this is good, with a fairly high production performance and an excellent cast. The game is uneven, but the plot is convincing. We could use a bit more of Wes Ramsey's character development, but, nevertheless, it's fun to watch the guy! Mary Kay Place and Jacqueline Bisset are like icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> No wonder that after its release it caused controversy. It is a less flattering depiction of the Morman Church and its relations with gays. Although, like Brokeback Mountain, it is about tolerance and accepting oneâ€™s own life, I found that it more successfully conveys a positive message. It was more touching, too.
