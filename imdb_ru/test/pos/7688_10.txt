Porgy and Bess was the very first movie my parents ever took to watch. Even at the tender age of 5, I was so moved by the drama that I shouted loudly on the screen: “Crown, PLEASE do not take Bess!” I was lucky to see one television broadcast of Porgy and Bess I have it, these are wonderful memories (and a record album) to remember this wonderful, wonderful film. I waited, wished and hoped that one day I would have a copy of “Porgy and Bess” - but this does not seem to happen. What is the delay? Obviously, this film is enough to interest the public. After all these years, I remember it, and it seems that I am not alone. This film is full of human emotions - jealousy, lust, anger, courage, determination. Porgy & Bess is a hidden gem that deserves to be brought to light by a new audience to admire and an old audience to enjoy.
