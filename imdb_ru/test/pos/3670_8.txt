Yes, sometimes “Unconditional love” is stunning when it jumps - no, it ricochets - from one element of the story to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it was only when I watched the movie a second time that I began to realize that, in my opinion, PJ Hogan may have tried to do with this bizarre, unconventional film. Perhaps the whole film itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love that Grace (Kathy Bates) craves and describes in the later part of the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is simply without conditions and without qualification. So I looked again at Unconditional Love, remembering that. I laughed much more than the first time, I began to interact more with the characters, I began to understand, sometimes, the absurd turns of the story. Performances are often unsurpassed, but no more than they should be to match Hogan’s strange and foolish vision, a vision that moved me to tears, longing and outbursts of laughter. Yes, Hogan asks most of his audience. But, for example, I really loved his film - unconditionally.
