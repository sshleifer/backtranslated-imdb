I saw The Stand of One Life when it took place at the 2000 premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, and I was shocked by this. Made on a microbudget, this black and white digital film is very similar to a European film and copes brilliantly with difficulties, despite the limitations of DV. The film works because it is in the Indian tradition - it deals with complex issues, but moves and is facilitated by the touches of an understated humor. One Life Stand avoids being trapped by other British realistic films, where ordinary working people are portrayed as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes. The performances are strong, especially Maureen Carr, like Tris's mother. I understand that the film was recently released on DVD, and I definitely recommend it. The rating on this site is misleading, so I gave him a high score, because director Mail Miles Thomas obviously puts his soul into it and deserves better than 2.8 for its amazing achievement.
