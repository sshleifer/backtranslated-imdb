A commentator before me stated that this film is the worst that was ever imposed on him / her as a child. I have to say that I liked this film when it was small, and I still love it today. The film has the best running theme of the unity of the whole family. Considering the period of time when the film was released, I thought the film was well played out. I would just like to find a copy somewhere !! Of all the films of the 1980s that I watched as a child, it was one of my favorites. I know that I probably watched it at least once a week with my brother and mother. I would definitely recommend it to anyone I know â€” or don't know. So, if you find a copy, I advise you to look! It is beautiful and soulful.
