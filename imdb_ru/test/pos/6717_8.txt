LIFEFORCE was one of the biggest failures of Cannon Films. He received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help the career of director Tobe Hooper after the controversy between Spielberg and POLTERGEIST. All this is regrettable, because LIFEFORCE is actually a very good movie. He is incredibly fascinating, moving at a fast pace and demonstrating some of the most incredible excess directions, production, performances and special effects that have ever exploded on the screen! It must have looked strange on paper: the producers of DELTA FORCE, the screenwriter of The Alien, the director of The Texas Villain, the composer BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, the wizards of the special effects STAR WARS ... The audience was not ready for this crazy exercise in a strange thing. <br /> <br /> What else do you want ??? We got an alien spaceship full of giant bats! We got a sexy, naked space vampire sucking people's souls! We have exploding bodies! We have zombies! We got possession! We got the S & M interrogation! We set fire to all of London! This Dracula meets the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD meets the APARTMENT, and the PIT meets EARTHQUAKE. It is possible that this is the only most outrageous horror / sci-fi / comedy / action / catastrophe / erotic / apocalyptic epic ever released, that is, if there are any others. <br /> <br /> Try to watch this movie while chemically modified. Perhaps then you will understand. Genuinely impressed experience and one of the most underrated films directed by Tob Hooper. Maybe one day he will find his audience.
