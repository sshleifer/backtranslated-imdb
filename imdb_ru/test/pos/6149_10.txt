I disagree with the short review of imdb.com that this is a bisexual guy preparing to get married. This is the most crap we go through - on our own initiative and because of our parents - that we have to “overcome” when we grow up. As the poem by Linda McCarriston says: "Childhood is a barrel into which you are thrown through a waterfall." This film is much more like a narrative poem. It's about life and the mistakes we make and hurt, which we inflict and experience over the years, and how, after all, it's all about love (I'm not trying to be hypersensitive or sensitive) and finding and being with a special person
