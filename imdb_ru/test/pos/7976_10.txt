If you like shooting westerns, this is a keeper. I thought the film was interesting to watch and see people whom I hadnâ€™t seen for a long time. I'm not an expert, but I liked the game. City, props, etc., seemed to correspond to the period and type of city that you find on the border. This is not Western, not enough people and budget. The costumes and firearms were right for the time! I expect to see young actors in the film again in the future. Rachel, Chance, Rebekah and Kirby were great. The members of the SASS (Unified Action Society) who contributed to this effort are pretty darn good. Hope to see more.
