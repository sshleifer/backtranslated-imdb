I have seen this movie more than once. In fact, “El Padrino” was one of the best feature films that I have seen many times. <br /> <br /> There was a big cast of Jennifer Tilly, Fei Duanway, Brad Dourif and Damian Chapa who really shone like a real star in this part of Kilo. <br /> <br /> I heard that this film was shot for less than two million dollars. I saw films made for 33 million, which can not be compared with the quality and production value. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa, why you do not receive offers and work more with movies !!! GREAT WORK !!!!!!!!!! I can't wait to see the sequel, and I hope that he has the same effect. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Tilly made the iconic classic character with Sabeva. <br /> <br /> Damien Chapa moves in cold blood in every Scene very similar to the movie stars of the 40s and 50s. So tired of seeing that these non-charismatic actors, such as Ben Stiller, get all these films when there are talents who have something to show. a great movie. <br /> <br /> GO, GO, SEVERAL BUT FOR SALES EL PADRINO !!!
