this is the best movie i have ever seen !!!!!! I just adore them !! I watch it every day! I have episodes from the Internet! here in Romania 6 season is broadcast! I am happy that I saw the show from the very beginning, and I am glad that through the Internet I can see season 7. so far the fifth season is my favorite. I love him because Logan appears, and the scene in which they jump is my favorite. I also liked Dean, but Logan is the best. I would like Lorelai to stay with Christopher because he is beautiful. This show is good for all ages and worth seeing. I really want a DVD, but I think that here in Romania, it will never appear, because I think they donâ€™t even know that they have fans here. but in spite of everything, I will watch it. goodbye!!
