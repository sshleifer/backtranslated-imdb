Imagine that you have the opportunity to see yourself again as a child. Now think what happens if you had the opportunity to talk to yourself or even change him / you. Will you try to influence or try to change the beliefs of your young self in the light of your future experience? Or maybe the meeting will change your perception of life and reality of your older "I"? <br /> <br /> Walt Disney's Toddler is trying to develop this complex thought by putting the "older self" Bruce Willis on a collision course with the "younger me" Spencer Breslin (from "Santa Claus 2" and "The Cat in the Hat" glory ") The result is a funny, sometimes touching, meeting that makes you think about your past, present, and future, and sincerely believe that it is never too late to change your course.
