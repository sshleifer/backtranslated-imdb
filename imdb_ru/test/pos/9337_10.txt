The video opens with a scene from a horror movie in which a man makes a proposal to his girlfriend. He begins to tell her that he is "different." When the full moon rises, it turns into a werewolf. Then he pursues her through the forest, and just before the attack, we are taken inside the cinema. Inside the theater is Michael and his girlfriend. She is too scared to look further, so they leave. When they leave the theater, he begins to tease her. (“Closer to midnight, something evil is hiding in the dark ...”) Then Michael sings and dances with his girlfriend down the street. This scene shows Michael's skill with the camera. He never acts "realizing" his presence, as many other artists do. When they pass by the cemetery, the graves begin to open ... As soon as they reach the alley, they face a horde of undead. Then we see the horrified face of the girl Michael. Who wouldn’t have a horrible look if their date turned into a zombie? Yes, he becomes one of the undead. (Very bright and brilliant, though.) Then he and his zombie colleagues begin what may be the most famous dance choreography of any music video. I will tell you more, it will give an end. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite music video of all time! You do not want to miss it! I put it on 10/10. (Yes, I know that you can see the curtains in the back of the sound stage, and the werewolf looks modern silly).
