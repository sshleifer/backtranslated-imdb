I loved it. It begins as a rather normal, slightly bulky French feature film, and then suddenly, halfway through, it is turned to the head. This part is great because you understand that you watched 2 stories, not just one. Unfortunately, the ending does not make much sense, which is a great shame. Oh yes, and it is brilliantly filmed.
