Lady and the tramp ii: a scammer's adventure, I think this is a good movie, but I think the first lady and the Tramp's movie is better because this is the original, and I think the original movies are better than the scripts. The ladies and the tramp ii fly up after the original, but this time the younger one's turn, the Lady and the Tramp always hate what to do with him, following the rules in the house, taking all the bath time and having a good time, the fraudster is angry and runs off with the pack dogs that remained free. Scamp meets another dog named Angel, they both get along fine and do what Sampaâ€™s mom and dad had an Italian meal (Spagetthi, Meatballs, etc.), the child, the scammer returns, and Angel joins the family. I give this film 10 out of 10.
