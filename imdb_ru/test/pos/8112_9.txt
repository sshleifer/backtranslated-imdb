This film went into production before the beginning of World War II, but was not released until it began. With great fascist sympathy in the United States, and Chaplin himself was suspected of sympathizing with the communists, the Great Dictator was a very bold affair. Such risks in filmmaking — subtly veiled political statements — would be almost unthinkable today. Imagine the consequences if someone makes the same satirical film today that criticizes US foreign policy? <br /> <br /> This movie is hilarious, sharp and tragic. The tragedy is that Chaplin asks for the cessation of insanity, but it's too late - for him and for us. Be sure to see if you have any interest in history, filmmaking, politics or satire as a form of art.
