This film is so different from everything you've seen before. This is an honest and frightening story about the battle of the whole family with an incurable disease. <br /> <br /> The Closer She Gets was shot in a unique style. Craig Ulette shoots completely differently ... using different angles and points of view, which I find attracts attention (perhaps because of his experience with photos) <br /> <br /> His style gives such a clear the idea is not only about what the patient herself faces, but also about what her close relatives have to deal with. <br /> <br /> Very sad, but extremely interesting and unique film. One I would definitely suggest to see.
