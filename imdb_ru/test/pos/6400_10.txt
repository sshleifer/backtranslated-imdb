I think Key West might work well as a DVD. There are probably many unfortunate Star Treks who simply had no chance of success. We will never know if this could be a great series. I would like to know if there is a way to see older shows like this, or is this just another Hollywood footnote? Is it possible to find copies of these shows so that we, loyal geeks, can enjoy them again? The show had an excellent writing talent, and in some, if not all, episodes, you had a feeling of characters that are often lacking in today's hit shows. I often felt that I had learned something from the plot lines, and I was very entertained by very unique characters. Thank you.
