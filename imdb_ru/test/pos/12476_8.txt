A pretty good film about a man and his wife who were involved in the murder and the policeman investigating this matter. It starts wonderfully, but at some point it hits the wall. We are sure that we know what happened, then a tiny thread of the plot appears, which at first seems like a red herring, and disappoints. However, the Clouzot guide is excellent, and the game is pretty good. Louis Jouvets, who also played a major role in Marcel Carne’s film "Drôle de Drame", proved to be a clever detective story. I wonder if the Coens were influenced by this film when they wrote Fargo? As in this film, the cop does not appear almost halfway, and then he becomes almost the focus of the film. There are also many funny comedies around him (although sometimes his methods seem fascist).
