A wide drama with gorgeous decorations, costumes and performances although some people direct Rett, Scarlett, Melanie and even Lady Macbeth. Patrick Swayze and James Reed are excellent as two men trying to maintain friendship, despite family ties and location. Gorgeous villains ?? You want them all to come to a very bad end. Many strong female characters in this ?? and good and bad. Secondary storylines are also well developed. Several cameos of the main stars of past eras. A good representation of history and conflict for those who find themselves between friendship and politics. <br /> <br /> Curl up on a rainy day with your DVD or VHS player and enjoy this drink. The rug and cat are optional.
