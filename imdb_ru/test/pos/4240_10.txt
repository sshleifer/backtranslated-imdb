This is a good movie for fans of Chucky. Well, I'm sure it's not as good as what the “Children's Game” movie looked like, but it can be really fun and enjoyable, Chucky’s laughter is hilarious. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Now not one doll, but two, which means doubling the effect, Jennifer Tilly played the role very well and definitely coped with the best film. <br /> <br /> If you’ve seen Children’s Game films, it’s a worthy movie in your Chucky collection, but if you’ve never seen Kid’s play movies before, it’s a new beginning. Of course, you will not have a clue about how Chucky got into his current state (because I don’t tell you), but you will understand why Chucky is very popular. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very nice movie.
