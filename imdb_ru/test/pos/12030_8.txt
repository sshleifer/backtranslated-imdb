A guest from the future tells a fascinating story of time travel, friendship, the battle of good and evil - all with a small budget, childish actors and several special effects. Spielberg and Lucas have a lot to learn. ;) Sixth grader Kolya "Nika" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a dilapidated building and travels 100 years ahead. It opens up an almost perfect utopian society, where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other, and people enjoy everything that technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a famous scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows you to read the thoughts of people and animals. The device can be used both well and poorly, depending on which hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn, who want to control the universe, try to steal a mylophone, it falls into the hands of a 20th century schoolboy Nick. With hot pirates on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by pirates and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow the hapless pirates trying to mix with earthlings. Alice goes to the same school where Nick is going and demonstrates superhuman abilities in a gym class. The catch is that Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like while the pirates know. Also, pirates can change their appearance and turn into literally anyone. (Hmm, I wonder, this is where James Cameron got the idea of ​​the Terminator ...) Who gets to Nick and Melophone first? Great story, nonstop adventures and great soundtrack. I would like Hollywood to make children's films like this one ...
