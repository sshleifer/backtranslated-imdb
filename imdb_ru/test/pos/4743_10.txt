Things that are just now "news" were taken as a given in this shocking documentary. I am afraid that as the investigation continues, the producers of this film will be justified by peaks. <br /> <br /> Producers show us devids, government agents, investigators with all their flaws and all their humanity. Nothing that any reviewer can say can approach the effect of observing and listening to oneself. Pieces of evidence - the testimony of Congress, 911 tapes, videos, expert comments, interviews, photos and home videos - are inextricably linked and tell a disturbing story. <br /> <br /> Don't wait. Watch this movie and tell your friends.
