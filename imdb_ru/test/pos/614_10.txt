I expected it to be good after I saw great moments with other ozone and read a lot about it ... but this film is brilliant - smart, very bright (emotionally and visually), perfect at all moments. every movement has a reason, everything fits so closely and initially is true and honest. this is a film about beauty and innocence; about simplicity
