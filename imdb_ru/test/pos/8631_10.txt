Although copies of this film are hard to find, if you can find it, get it !! !!! I believe it was, apart from In The Navy, the only musical by Abbott and Costello. Although they have changed the plot a bit (I have never heard the version in which the butcher approaches it), you still enjoy the antics of the slightly idiotic but sweet Jack and the greedy butcher, Mr. Dinklepus. Slightly reminiscent of "Du Barry was a lady," this scandalous film will force you to roll on the floor - just to get up and dance as Lou Costello sings. (I do not know why they did not do this in other films.)
