Woaww Just now did you notice the connection between all the characters ?? Of course this is Libby! And for the guy in the hatch with Desmond some kind of deja vu ??? Yeah !! He was the “same” guy who gave money to Said after he killed or tortured another soldier in the episode of the 14th season of the 2nd: “One of them”. Well, actually this is not exactly the same guy, his name is Joe in the 14th episode and Kelvin in the last 2 episodes. Gemini :) Who knows ?? JJ Abrams ... mmmm, I'm not even sure about this :) There are hundreds of similar links between all the characters. <br /> <br /> But it was just in response to Libby’s comment. <Br /> <br /> It seemed to me that these 2 episodes are much more interesting than the entire 2nd season. Throughout this season, I felt that I had missed a lot of things and had learned little. Especially at the very beginning, the 1st episode of the 2nd season is excellent, and then the 2nd one is a kind of memory of the 1st ... I found it disappointing, even if I am almost sure that everything in Lost tends to make sense . It was just an example of how disappointed I was of watching these episodes. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the last 2 episodes. I think we learned more new things in these 2 episodes than in the whole season. But all that we learn is small pieces for the next puzzle, for example, engaging Desmond's “relatives” (sorry if I dabble too much, believe me or not, I try not to do that). So many things caused in the last 2 seasons are still unclear or were once developed. And yet, a new material appeared, as if all the holes in the picture were insufficient. We all want to see the big picture of all this, of course, but I think we have to be very very patient. I hope there will be only 3 seasons. I'm not sure I will watch more than 3 seasons anyway. There was also a lot of action in the most recent episode. And a good climber at the very end. <br /> <br /> In general, yes, I liked the last episode ... and yes, I want to see the third season.
