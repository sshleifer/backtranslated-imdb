Remember - before Sydney appeared, there was Dudley. <br /> <br /> Dudley Diggs is barely remembered today - because his heyday as a lighting device in sound films was in the late 1920s and 1930s. With the exception of one major performance: a good-natured ship, if the drunken doctor in 1935 in the movie “Uprising over the Rabbit”, most of his films almost never revive. More pity because he was a wonderful actor. In 1931, he played Casper Gutman (the actor who played this villain) along with Sam Spade Ricardo Cortes in the first Maltese Folkone. Similarly, at about the same time, he played a recording angel in the OUTWARD BOUND version of Leslie Howard — the same role that Sydney Greenstreet played in “BETWEEN TWO WORLD” a decade later. the doctor of this ship is again, or disgusting (in the CHINESE SEA, as a condemning First Aide, mocking poor Lewis Stone, but then proving that he is just as big a coward at the time of crisis). He held out against Paul Robson in "EMPEROR JONES." He is a Chinese freedom fighter who works with Gary Cooper in the film “GENERAL DIEDS IN DAIRY”. Diggs could do anything. <br /> <br /> Here he is Mr. Thompson, the hypocritical and thieves' supervisor of the reform school, where Frankie Darro and his friends are sent for committing robbery and harming the Greek-American shop owner (this is the last incident for most of them). Diggs is just as bad here as in the CHINESE SEA, but he doesn’t like it at all. He can somehow transcend his roles ... more on that. <br /> <br /> Darro has a gang of urban criminals (including a Jewish boy and Farina from OUR GANG). As stated in another review, this is a prototype of the Bowery Boys. We see how they shake car owners, so that they pay to ensure that they “watch and protect” their cars. When one guy doesn't do this, they calmly destroy his car. The robbery of jerks and seizures in the store of Greek-Americans is also quite graphically shown - his skull breaks down when shoved. <br /> <br /> The boys are surrounded and lead to a harsh but decent judge, Arthur Byron, who understands that he cannot leave the children with his parents: the parents cannot observe them or are incompetent. Unfortunately, there are three racial stereotypes in this sequence: the Jewish father who cares more about his business than his son, the stereotypical father of Farina Yassum and the Italian father, whose willingness to cooperate forces his son to go to school reform. <br /> <br /> Once there, the boys find the regime despotic. Sometimes one of the guards or a nurse (Madge Evans) tries to speak for them. But Diggs has no time to indulge. His regime is determined to break the boys so that they behave well. Unfortunately, Diggs and his accounting partner are greedy. They served the boys low food and made a profit. <br /> <br /> One day a new official comes from the state to inspect the school of reforms. This is Jimmy Cagney, the healer from the hacker squad, whose gang got the right to vote for Edward Maxwell. As a reward (he could not get the position of park commissioner), Cagney was appointed assistant school inspector. He is supported by his coat buddy and Factotum Allan Jenkins (in his first film, Warner Brother). <br /> <br /> The irony is that if Diggs were a bit more careful, Cagney would probably let him continue to manage things. But Cagney arrives to see how Darro was brought to Diggs for a fight. Guardian and Darrow had problems with respect before, and now Diggs intends to punish Darro, who runs, but is seriously injured because of Diggs barbed wire and his free use. whip. Cagney stops Diggs and allows Evans to heal Darro's injuries. And she explains the reality of Cagney’s situation and her own idea of ​​the reform reform of the boys, strengthening her credibility with responsibility. <br /> <br /> The film tells about it to the end, showing that Cagney and Evans are on the right path, turning the reformer into a “republic” so that the boys can run correctly. This leads to a conflict with Diggs, whose profit decreases as he no longer receives supplies. But the scheme collapsed when Cagney himself discovered that he might have serious problems with the law. Diggs sees his opportunity and makes full use of it. But then he goes too far ... much more than he ever expected. <br /> <br /> In the 1930s there were a lot of films in which children took steps to correct mistakes and change something. Darro appeared in the film “Wild Boys of the Road”. Cecil B. DeMille made THIS DAY AND AGE where children teach a lesson to the gangster played by Charles Bickford, who scared the hell out of him. This continued in the 1930s. The mayor of Hell achieves the same intensity of revenge and juvenile justice. But this is one of the problems of the film. Diggs' character is a crook and a hypocrite, so we never support him, but if he was not a thief, we could agree with his opinion (even if it is counterproductive). The scenes at the beginning of Darro and his gangs that hunt for people actually do the severity with which Diggi follow, seem quite understandable (even if his methods of theft are not that). In addition, he has one moment when he is justly angry with Cagney — the moment he hides from his own confrontation with the law — by giving orders by phone from a long distance to the stupefied Diggs. When Diggs finds out what really happened, he is rightly angry with Cagney, who tells him about the right behavior. This is the closest thing to get Mr. Thompson to sympathize with this beautiful film.
