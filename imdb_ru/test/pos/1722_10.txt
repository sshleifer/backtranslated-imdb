I love the doctor who so much! I think David Tennant is the best doctor ever in the show, and Billie Piper is the best companion! I liked how the doctor and Rose had such a connection and a great relationship, and the doctor came up several times to express his love for Rose! Unfortunately, he came to an end only after 2 seasons. I will miss watching the pile of roses and I think the show won't be the same without Rose! But David is still here to make me laugh and make me happy when he plays this fantastic role! I rate this show 110% is fantastic! The graphics and monsters in this show are beautiful, and each story is different, but to some extent related, and I really learned something about love, peace, and the relationship from this show. Therefore, it must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time!
