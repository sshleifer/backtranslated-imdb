In some scenes from the film “People of the Rain”, the predecessor of Francis Ford Coppola to its heyday of the seventies, there is a situation similar to the Easy Rider of 1969, but not quite in the same frame of reference. Here we have a drama about separated people from society, in some sense alienated from choices or restrictions imposed in one way or another. This is one of those rare original dramas where some scenes stand alone like total knockouts. Even with such a modest budget and a very free, so to speak, attitude to filming, Coppola can catch everything that needs to be said with the help of these well-defined characters and curved, unexpected degrees of one character compared to the helplessness of another, or vice versa, or both . And, as one might be inclined to understand that this is a cut-out of the suburban life of the 1960s, he has the escape from the film mentioned earlier, but of a more concrete, almost timeless quality with drama and major problems. In a sense, if Bergman were in the role of a quasi-guerrilla 20-year-old director, to find out the strange truths of everyday outsiders, this could be so. <br /> <br /> But along with all very straightforward and sometimes shy photography (although sometimes with a more documented approach, akin to her undefined characters), all the actors are in their place. Shirley Knight, an actress with whom I am not too familiar, plays the complex, divergent role of a pregnant wife, fleeing in a kind of existentialist puzzle about what kind of life exists. She has moments when she plays in admiration, and one of my favorites (if not my favorite) is when she talks on the phone with her husband for the first time. Such a tense scene at both ends, and in every little gesture and bend of the word, she speaks so much about her with so few words. It is extraordinary in what others reflect in Coppola films. Then a "killer" character appears, played by James Caan. This is also a dangerous character, because it is a mixture of childish perplexity and fun with scar memories. Think Forrest Gump, if he hasn't gone through football and wit. In fact, he is one of the best, being the most minimalist - for the guy who usually plays the coolest guys in the movies, this one that is also part of the essence of the story and the character of Knight. Also very good in the supporting role is Robert Duvall as a cop with a rough side and a rather shaky past; a kind of early example of other spoiled characters he will play later in his career. <br /> <br /> Thus, the characters and the fact that Coppola risks getting anxiety in them really make up the film, whatever the story, it is definitely not solved in the usual way, as you might think or expect. The last ten or so minutes are similar to others in the work of Coppola, where concrete tragedies are undermined from all sides by the emotional and psychological consequences that this leaves for principles that are strengthened to the sublime and the sad. For its time, it is bold on the part of what is trying to be represented (both in freedom and in deficiencies and ambiguities) in the subject. And the style of the image adds a fragmented look of it all with quick memories that are graphical and self-contained unlike longer frames in some important scenes. This is a road film of his period, but he also got a lot more work than a different director with fewer chances to understand the nature of these rogue characters. One of the best films of 1969.
