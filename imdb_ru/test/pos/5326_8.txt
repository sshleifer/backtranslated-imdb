Before I saw this movie, I read the comment of someone who didnâ€™t really like it. I have to admit that it made me wary of devoting 1 hour 48 minutes of my life to this, but I am glad that I did. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor, I especially loved the Believer. Don Cheadle was fantastic too. The film presents an interesting look at life and death. It was very touching and very sad, but I was interested in what the most touching stories could not do. This is a movie that you recklessly like or not, but you have to see it. It was unique, and I don't think anyone will ever be able to copy it. All the young actors handled surprisingly well, given the plot and the emotions that were supposed to go into it. I was pleasantly surprised.
