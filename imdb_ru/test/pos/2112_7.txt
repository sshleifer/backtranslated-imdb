I watched the Grand Champion all the time, at least twice. I liked the story of the film, the characters and the actors were quite good. Nice to watch a movie rated G. This is a good movie. The story is mostly from the point of view of children. The interaction between children and adults makes the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a family movie. If you like Little Scammers, you will probably like it. I watched this movie on cable. Either encore or showtime family. This is not a film that I would go to see in the theater. But I only go to the theater for the effects of the big screen, so in most comedies, romantic films or dramas I don’t go to the big screen - I’m waiting for a TV / cable edition. Gather your kids popcorn and enjoy!
