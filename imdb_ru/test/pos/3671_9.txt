This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, heterosexuals, gnomes, British tea and pubs, the American culture of weapons, divorce and marriage; yet he manages to be sensitive to the problems surrounding everyone. Kathy Bates - “Amazing” Grace Beazley, and, as a characteristic actor of a stunning range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to substantiate this somewhat unusual film, like in the movie “Fried Green Tomatoes”. With the help of other comedic talents, such as Dan Aroyd in the role of Max, her former husband-lawyer, as well as in the center of Chicago and rural England, the story is intriguing enough to entertain. Jonathan Price plays Victor Fox, the secret gay singer killed by a bow killer in Chicago. His valet lover Dirk Simpson, played by the terrific Rupert Everett, must defeat Victor’s brothers and sisters, including Lynn Redgrave, who wants to turn his house into a tribute museum, and the team with Bates and her dwarf Modi Beesley, to find the killer among Chicago . <br /> <br /> The whole cast is sung at various points in the chase and excellent, especially. Talented Price and Bates. This implausible storyline, funny and whimsical, is one of the most unusual films. Cameos Julie Andrews, Barry Manlow and Sally Jesse Raphael should tell you how strange this film is. Strange, funny and not centered, but with a good look at people with all the differences.
