Dr. Franz Tobel, a Swiss scientist, smuggles out of his country by Sherlock Holmes so that the Nazi agents who are spying on him will not get their invention of a new bomb sight. Arriving in London, he settles with Holmes and Watson, but he goes to visit his girlfriend Charlotte Eberle, where he makes Holmes understand where his scope is, which he divided into four parts, but the eternal sworn enemy of Holmes, Professor Moriarty, is also looking for a bomb sight , in order to sell it to the Nazis, and kidnaps Dr. Tobel and the key left by Charlotte, a series of dancing men whom Holmes and Moriaret cannot fully decipher. , Holmes eventually discovers the key to the code and locates the fourth piece of sight, but Moriarity has three others, and an autopsy is inevitable. A very good entry in the Holmes series with many riddles and conjectures. The image of Moriarity in Atville is more sadistic than the cunning look described in the Doyle stories (or the play by George Zucco in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes), but the skills of the actress as an actor make his Moriarity a very friendly person. Both the script and the direction make this record more like a cat-and-mouse game between two characters, and this is one of the reasons why this record is so successful. Excellent work in cinema. Rating, 8.
