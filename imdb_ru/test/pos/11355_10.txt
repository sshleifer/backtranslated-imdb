It is easy to understand why many consider The Mood for Love the best Wong Kar-Wai film. The reduced attractiveness of the film, based on the studied view of the relationship imposed on the emotional call, is a re-transition to Happy Together, but without the hyperkinetic confusion of film shaking and oversaturated episodes that have become the brand of Kar-Wai films since Chungkin Express. Like Soderberg's Limey, this is a different type of curiosity for Kar-Wai; where dialogue and plot are abandoned in mood and composition to create a story about two delicate lives in seemingly closed emotional stasis. <br /> <br /> This is evidence of the genius of Kar-Wai, which he is capable of making such a simple story so resonant. Chau Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Lee-chzhen (Maggie Cheung) move next door to each other within the same apartment building. He is a journalist who dreams of publishing martial arts novels, and she is the secretary of the shipping company. Their possible connection is obvious from the very beginning, but the pleasure of the fact that Kar-Wai ambiguously draws such a journey with his great workshops blows. <br /> <br /> The key to film success is the use of Kar-Wai. interior space, playing with foreground and background in ways similar to the works of Polanski. During the inspiring sensual first half of the film, Kar-Wai isolates Lyung and Cheng in frames in such a way that the second person is never seen in conversation. Here Kar-Wai takes care of the environment and space, creating a close emotional dynamic between his characters. It also suggests that Kar-Wai never decides to focus on the physicality of the spouses Mo-Wan and Li-cheng. Their faceless partners are noticeably absent from the film, as they are prone to their own love relationships with each other. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that “The mood for love” is a limiting experience, because Kar-Wai manages to flood his film with wide bursts of hypnotic movement of the camera and sound. There is one shot, where Cheng’s slow, sensual ascent of the metaphorical ladder turns into Leng’s descent along the same staircase; their movements perfectly complement each other, intensifying the shot and creating a feeling of erotic duality between two figures. Their souls are united, but they have yet to physically unite. The erotic bias of these scenes is both exciting and frustrating, since two lovers in stars cross the rejection of physical perfection because of their modest loyalty. <br /> <br /> Other scenes in the film are interspersed with short slow frames of Cheung erotically moving around her inner environment, put on Mike Galasso's amazingly beautiful score. Chung's dresses perfectly complement her outer space as she slowly moves around her surroundings. Her movements are slowly growing to what may seem an inevitable merger between Li-shen and her dream lover, although the process of seduction seems completely subconscious. <br /> <br /> If I make it seem like these two characters are more like two birds releasing pheromones from each other, it’s probably not so implausible. The close relationship of these two characters with their inner space is almost as intense as their relationship with the exteriors. A film rarely moves into outer space, and when the camera does it, it usually passes through oval windows and symbolic stripes, which always remind us that these characters look like closed animals. Kar-wai continues to tease us, even when the lovers are close enough to touch, destroying the couple's proximity to each other, shooting at them through the mirrors or through the cracks in the garments located inside the closet. Mother Nature even seems to react to their passion for love, often releasing soft rain from the clouds over the characters after their bodies slide alongside each other. <br /> <br /> Kar-Wai's atmospheric blows to the waterfall allowed Leng Lai Yu-Fai to experience a cathartic release in Happy Together, even if Ho Po Wing Leslie Chung was not there to enjoy it. By the end of this film, love was so inextricably linked with the act of war that the muffled love confessions of a third person signaled that Yu-Fay realized that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if he did not bring it back. lover. Mo-Wan's journey ends within a collapsing temple. His own emotional exhaustion fits perfectly with the political climate in his country, and the absence of Li-shen becomes tolerable only due to the fact that Kar-Wai allows Mo-Wan to experience a kind of liberation. Mo-Wan caters to the ancient myth, and his secretive release into a crack in the temple leaves him able to live his days in the hope that all his loss and suffering will somehow serve a higher purpose.
