A slice of chicken egg, this one. I began to hate him, with his predictable installation of the “Old Dark House”, the constant references to recent American horrors and regular trips up and down the dimly lit corridors. <br /> <br /> But it really happens and it has moments of originality. <br /> <br /> I started wondering how the murder would start, how it would last with only six actors, but then we remember the previous visit to the building and see a number of bloody murders that are quite effective. <br /> <br /> Ours is doing well, and in the end it was quite a nice movie. He just does not jump up and grabs him, hard enough.
