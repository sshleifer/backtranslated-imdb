Two Soldiers is a great example of good filmmaking. The director and producer took the heartbreaking story and brought it to life with the help of a very skilled and dedicated cast, excellent cinema and very creative craftsmanship. <br /> <br /> The brothers had a relaxed way of life in the back with great details, and contrasted sharply with the militaristic way of life in which they were involved. The interaction between the brothers caused laughter and tears, as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the deep forests of North Carolina and an even more difficult war. <br /> <br /> The game was great, especially from the younger brother who is new to the big screen (played by Jonathan Furr), with the older brother (played by Ben Ellison) and the powerful performance of the colonel (played by Ron Perlman). The performance was very successful. <br /> <br /> It was nice to enjoy the magic of two soldiers, and I sincerely recommend it to viewers of all ages.
