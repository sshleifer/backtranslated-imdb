This time, Tobe Hooper (a new success in the mainstream with Poltergeist) aspires to heaven. “Vital Force” is an adaptation of Colin Wilson's “Cosmic Vampires”. I was told that the script for Alien Dan O (Bannon and Don Jacobi) is a little different: I am told that the futuristic storyline was made modern, and Comet Haley was added to coincide with its actual passage by the Earth a few weeks after the films were released ( so I "read). <br /> <br /> This story concerns the shuttle mission (commander Steve Reilsbek), directed to explore comet Haley as she passes the Earth. Everything goes without a knot, but, having reached the comet, it turns out that the alien ship is hidden in a comet's coma. The team explores a massive structure and detects bat-like creatures. If you look deeper into the ship, you will find a camera in which there are three humanoids (two naked males and one rather attractive naked lady) in odd stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with humanoids and a flying creature in tow. <br /> <br /> A little later, the ship returns to Earth, but NASA cannot establish a connection, and another shuttle is launched to determine the status of the Mission. When docked with Churchill, it is discovered that a strong fire appears to have killed the crew and all data relating to the flight. But three humanoids remain. However, it became known that the rescue capsule was launched, but its whereabouts are unknown. <br /> <br /> Soon they will learn about the alien's origin when a very attractive queen of cosmic vampires emerges from her dream and easily seduces her life force. from men around her. If you suck her face with her, she will make you love them, and if you do not feed in two hours, you will dry out and become dust. The purpose of these three is to deplete enough of the essence of the population, to put it into action and support him and his ship for the trip to the next planet, in order also to empty them. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the Commander survived the entrance to the pod (no less than in Texas lands), and now he has a psychic connection with her royal zharkost, the queen and can use her to find the hidden queen when she and the surviving man are trying to exhaust London with their souls. . <br /> <br /> Tob Hooper (from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)) does a wonderful job in what should be his biggest production to date. The production has gathered a lot of fine technicians from the entire film industry. Art director John Gracemark (just released from Bounty (1984)) uses all four stages in the Elsree studio to create spacious interiors of the ship and the like. Filmmaker Alan Hume returns to science fiction after working on Star Wars VI: The Return of the Jedi (1983) and three consecutive episodes about James Bond. Hume uses every bit of widescreen frame with great effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra, an innovator in the revolutionary effects of the original Star Wars (1977), once again managed to push the envelope apart, creating several very creative and impressive effects using lasers. Hell, even maestro Henry Mancini comes in to give the film a very memorable title theme, which gives this hybrid of science fiction and horror a sense of adventurousness. In the acting department, this largely falls on the shoulders of Steve Reilsbek and rookie Matilda May (queen of the vampires). Railsback always gives an advantage to the characters it plays and can play as crazy as anyone’s affairs. This comes to mind as his mind deteriorates when the power of the queen tightens his grip on his soul. Gorgeous French actress May has a hell of a lot of lines (there were more than ten of them?), But her often naked presence never gets old, and you have to give her due to ring the bells. Virtually all the queen needs to do is feed, and for this she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. The job is done, and where can I register to become a victim? I really liked how they tweaked the old vampire clichés, and I still managed to make him seem fresh, but still easily recognizable. Almost everything is taken into account here: bats (their true form resembles a big bat), coffins (stasis fields resemble them), transformations (they scan your mind and can be anything), massive sexual attractiveness (Miss May. Spirit) not to mention that they even include an old backup blow through the heart (this time a little lead dagger to the energy center just below the heart). The only thing they didn’t touch was religion, but I think that vampires who use the cathedral at the end as a home base can be just a wink and a nod. <br /> <br /> In short (yes, the correct 800 words later) Lifeforce is a great combination of science fiction and horror that pays homage to the subject of the vampire, while adding several neat different wrinkles. The effects and scale of production is enough to get involved in summer types of films (at least at the time) and horror and science fiction fans. 4 out of 5
