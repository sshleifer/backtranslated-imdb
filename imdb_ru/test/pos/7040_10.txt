Meatballs - is a classic comedy with so many laughter that it is impossible to count. <br /> <br /> Murray controls the screen in what could only be predicted as comic prowess. Tripper Harrison is one of the greatest comedic characters in the last 50 years. Sarcastic all the time, smart when he should be, strict when he should be, and caring when it suits him, Murray infuses the Tripper with this SNL sheen in the eye. <br /> <br /> CIT is ecstatic when they are hiding under the comic genius Mr. Murray is. <br /> <br /> Summer is not summer without watching Meatballs. One of the best comedies that ever decorated the screen.
