great drama. very dark. I never saw California take a picture of it that way. Bridget Fonda as a deaf wife, beaten by her husband, is excellent. the film embraced me from start to finish. a very understated performance of sutherland. The direction was very European. It's amazing to get such an idea from the Foundation.
