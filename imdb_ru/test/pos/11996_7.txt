Caddyshack 2 has a terrible reputation, only because it is a continuation of the classic classics. People criticized the film for many reasons, but they all end up returning to the fact that this is not Caddyshack. <br /> <br /> I would like to start by saying that we should just take Caddyshack out of the equation and see this movie essentially, but I think it would be unfair. The film has much in common with its predecessor. Class related themes “snobs against saliva” and the desire to fit into a class above yours are just as common here as in the first movie. Two things are really missing here: Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, replaced by Dan Aroyd and Jackie Mason, respectively. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not going to say that Aroyd is close to Murray in the movie, but Jackie Mason is Dangerfield's wonderful successor. He looks like a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but he doesn't bite too much. I would not say that he is so close to being as funny as Dangerfield in Caddyshack, but there is much more sense in his character and his dilemma in the film. <br /> <br /> Chevy Chase only appears several times in the film, which is another common complaint. Perhaps these skeptics did not notice that he appeared in the first film only a few times. For my money, his scenes are much funnier here, although they are somewhat overstrained. <br /> <br /> Although I’m on this topic, this is really an excessive direction of this film, which brings him down. It seems much more shy in his attempts to laugh. Many jokes are inflated, and too much of a gopher, who seems to have acquired a much more anthropomorphic personality and voice, in case we did not understand that this should be funny. <Br /> <br /> Characters also slaughtered at home, especially smart kids. Jackie Mason rarely misses the rhythm, is always pleasant and very funny, but we do not need a tango sequence at all! The director is clearly not from the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Not to suggest that Caddyshack was subtle, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily decorated with a fancy replica of music. <br /> <br /> Considering all the circumstances, this is a funny, dumb movie with something that can be said about class and identity, which very few films talked about at the time. Do not put off on a terribly low IMDb rating, check it out yourself.
