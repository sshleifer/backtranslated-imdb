As a Czech, I am very pleased when I read these comments here. I am absolutely sure that this film is great. And what you may not know is that this story was specially written for Mr. Brodsky. The person you see is him and his typical attitude - to live and resist death. He was one of the great actors, and we were very lucky that we shot so many great films in our lives. You're lucky you could see at least one of them. Enjoy.
