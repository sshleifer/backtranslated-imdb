I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Hauer at the Sarasota Film Festival in 2005 for the premiere of this film in the USA. Not only was he kind enough to autograph my copy of “BLADE RUNNER,” he took the time to answer a few questions about the film before showing “ROOM” for a crowded theater. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed with the film that I used it as a criterion with which to compare all the other films that I saw at the festival. It was powerful and touching, but subtle and brief. The film tells how a young man (the older version played by Rutger) once finds himself fascinated by the seemingly ordinary room in an unremarkable building next to the street. Passing by, he notices one always open window from which you can hear an obsessive melody. Every day he passes by the room, sometimes standing for hours on the street, watching her through the silk curtains fluttering in the light wind, hoping to make out its inhabitants. At the end of the film we will find out how significant this room is and what attracted our protagonist to it. <br /> <br /> The film was beautifully cut out. Not a single second of screen time was spent on an uninteresting snapshot. Any single shot from the film can stand alone in an art gallery. Rutger is awesome. He is mysterious, but affordable. His dialogue includes a series of thoughts about life, which went on as usual, for better or for worse. His words conjure up familiar feelings and thoughts of the audience. I was particularly moved by the scene in which he looks at old photos, remembering his beloved dog, his beloved horse and his first love. You have the feeling that you are in his presence, as he allows you to look into his world to see precious memories of a life that is nearing its end. <br /> <br /> I liked this film, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for something fresh, clever and touching. Must be required to view all the specialties of the film.
