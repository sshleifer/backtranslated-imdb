As a fan of the book, this work is fantastically adapted; remaining faithful to the source materials and demonstrating honest respect for the literary work. The intrigues are well translated into the film thanks to the kind attention to detail and firm devotion to authenticity by Ron Howard. <br /> <br /> I like Hanks as Robert Langdon. His image is genuine and mundane, with only one bright glitter of Kip, which we all knew and loved even on that day. He is a good dramatic actor, and although I miss his comedy films, I really like his more serious performances. <br /> <br /> The topic is no less controversial than the Da Vinci Code, and the Vatican never seems to learn their lesson. As in the case of the aforementioned film, the Holy See made a sharp rebuke and called for a global Catholic boycott of the film, which, of course, brought millions of ticket sales. <br /> <br /> Although the story of “The Particles of God” was drastically underestimated, and science was written from this science fiction, the fiction that was left was interesting and extremely well done. And, to tell the truth, people who have not read the book will not notice the missing or less significant element of the story, since the on-screen version carries the main story well. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is no need to see the first part of this franchise to enjoy this second one was to be a prequel of all honesty, although this does not diminish efficiency and does not interfere with continuity or the flow is the second job. <br /> <br /> In general, this is good for viewing on Friday / Saturday evening, although the performance may be a little rough for small ones. <br /> br /> This estimates 8.8 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The monster :.
