Why this film was released only in 4 states, I do not understand. I thought this film was a divine story. The name says it all: seeing other people. There’s more logic than laughter in this film, and I think that’s why it works so well. Common sense also appears in what may seem like another children's comedy. Alice freezes from the cold when she irrationally thinks about how she can act for her fiance, not only sexually, but also as a partner, and a friend, and so on. D. of them. One shot after another leads to trouble, as if it was not a bad idea from the very beginning. Witty dialogues and comic decorations make this movie so damn fun! Early on, Nicholson and Moore set the tone for the film and fulfill the promise they expect. Other highlights are Lauren Graham, Andy Richter and Helen Slater (in her first theater film in 10 years!). Climax begins to take a crazy turn, but a simple ending makes this film much more enjoyable than most modern films. Mohr's fans will see something different in his Ed character, and Helen Slater fans will enjoy her brilliant moments of quick but excellent return. Any Richter takes home a reward for the most moralistic nature. Romantic and funny, or just plain fun. Seeing other people is a gem to watch.
