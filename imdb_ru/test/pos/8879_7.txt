“Throw your mom out of the train” was not a good comedy, but it is a lot of fun and makes you laugh. The name may seem a little strange, but the whole movie is not about it literally, although it’s about something as sinister. <br /> <br /> Danny DeVito basically wants to kill his domineering mother and rewind forward some random and funny events. The premise is pretty funny, and the things that Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito fall into were great. Some scenes didn't seem to suit me, but that didn't make him a bad movie. <br /> <br /> What a stupid comedy it is, it copes well and needs to be seen once just to say you saw it.
