Forget everything you've ever read about the Snakes in the Train video of the Mallahi brothers, especially if it was a negative review. This film is much more fun than the film, which he clearly tears off: "Snakes on the plane." Honestly, I am surprised that more and more people are not re-singing this low-budget seeker release. Instead, most of the reviews I read have nothing good or critical to say, other than the usual idiocy of an idiotic herd mentality, such as the action was amateur, the action numerically did not correspond to advertising, and all of this was a disgusting waste of time. Of course, it does not help that the title is a hint to the apparent robbery nature of this film. In fact, I felt that “Snakes on the train” outperform “Snakes on an airplane” for a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> First, the producers used real, real snakes until the last fifteen minutes, until they replaced giant fake snake heads or a computer spawned a super-giant snake that swallowed the entire train, similar to Amtrak. How many films does a snake devour a train? As a result, the movie "Snakes in the train" is considered the first film, scaling this height. <br /> <br /> Secondly, in this low-budget film, some terrible effects are used. The woman who coughs from the little snakes — the real ones — was fantastic! The special effects of her forearms, torn later in the film, were visually seductive! In addition, you will see how a little white girl is eaten alive from a snake. She was as cute as she could be, no more than 10 years or so, and she died screaming all the way when the vile ole-giant head of the serpent's master swallows her. Not only children are in danger, but the child has eaten! This is exactly the graphic material that you will not find in 99% of all theatrical Hollywood releases. Of course, she was not eaten by a real snake, but it is a disruptive thought that matters. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, this is one of those damned films in which Alma (Julia Ruiz from “This Guy”) is the female protagonist - not the heroine - her parents cursed her because she didn’t married the man they recommended. As a result, it fills with snakes, coughs up the amount of green fluid in the radiator, and then takes the snake of the child. Imagine Medusa, mythical characters who had snakes for their hair, only with snakes in their stomachs. Her boyfriend, like a psycho shaman, collects all the snakes that come out of her, because they are sent to LA on the train to see his relative, who can put all the snakes back into her and bring her back to normal. Talk about a crazy character doing exercises to collect the stomach. Get ready for a lot of mucus, blood and blood. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the train had only about twenty passengers, not hundreds. However, it looked as if the Mallachi brothers made this awful movie above average on board a real train with real snakes, and they played the train's oscillating motion on the rails. <br /> <br /> Fifth, snakes glide for the first hour, quietly entering the train before they turn strange and attack everyone. In other words, it is waiting, waiting, waiting before people start dying from snake bites. <br /> <br /> Up until the last five minutes, when the snake gets bigger than the runaway train and swallows it, Snakes on the Train is distorted, wonderful and well-groomed. It does not have the attention deficit editing in a major league Hollywood movie. fantasy about an unhappy Latin American woman who fell victim to her feminist relationship with society. <br /> <br /> In general, you have bloody fantasy-like things; disturbing snakes skimming around the train, and I'm a giant snake at the end. By the way, they get on the train because a bunch of other Mexicans were bribed by a slave from the train, and the Mexicans on board think that the girl is so cute that they let her and her boyfriend free. <br /> <br /> I think it's better than “Snakes on an airplane” if you need a hard, small independently created horror movie.
