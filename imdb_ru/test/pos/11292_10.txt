The visual effectiveness of this film is unmatched in everything I've seen. And the work needed to achieve it had to be incredibly long and tedious (you are not just putting “Kodak grain film” into your camera to get this view). Do not watch this film for entertainment, watch it for visual stimulation, see it challenged and evoked in your thoughts about the film and any other topic that comes to mind, religion is likely to be one thought. <br /> br />
