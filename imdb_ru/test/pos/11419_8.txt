With all these shots, bloody horror movies that have appeared on our way lately, when "Saw, Hostal, 2, Hills have eyes" Yes, they have their place, don't get me wrong! I went to see "When a stranger calls" with my buddy that night! What for? Because this is a remake of the classics of 1979, which at the time was excellent and frightening that you know that of all! I did not know what to expect. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It was a film of mood, atmosphere, expectations! Because remembering people, what you do not see, what you think, what you see, what you cannot hear, or what you think you hear, is much more terrible than what you do! If you like movies with mood, eeriness, tension and atmosphere !! You will love it! This brought him back to the roots of the original Halloween. Thumbs up, 8.5 out of 10 Remember, guys, it's well done! not ideal! Creepy, not bloody, Creepy, not bloody! It was nice to see that the film was so long. Our minds were conditioned and twisted by the brilliance and shock of modern day horror films, we forget what is really scary.
