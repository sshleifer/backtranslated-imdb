This is a wonderful movie. Scenes are well drawn. Ann River's conversations are really well written and inspiring, the philosophy and thoughts that this film gives, and what it teaches, make it magnificent and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney is great in the film, and his role goes through a lot of emotional turmoil as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor looks very cute, her scenes in the film are inherently poetic, the way the camera follows her and the music makes you feel that every scene on her air is beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film has a great spirit and favorite classic. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is quite funny in her role, albeit unrecognizable, if you saw her as “m” in the Manchurian Candidate. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp completely fulfilled the role of his father, and the script provides him with enough material to justify his role. <br /> <br /> This is a very good film, and it should be an evergreen Christmas favorite for the family and children.
