Two years later, Plane! Starring Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker played one of their stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television series, the magnificent capture of old American detective shows such as Dragnet. Nielsen played Frank Drebin, Americaâ€™s response to Inspector Clouseau. He had the same style of humor as Plane! smart visual jokes in the background, inconspicuous absurdities and repetitive characters, such as Johnny, a shoe-cleaning boy who seems to know everything about everything. Guest stars (including William Shatner!) Were killed in the opening credits. Police Squad was the first American sitcom since Batman, which lacked a track of laughter. Many complain that only six episodes were made, but I think it was right. The concept could never stand the full cycle of 24 episodes. Five years later, the Police Squad successfully switched to the big screen when the first of the Naked Gun trilogy was released. Jim, Jerry, David and Leslie were the last to laugh.
