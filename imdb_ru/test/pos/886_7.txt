After watching the preview of this film in my local mall, where there is a booth for buying foreign films, I thought it looked very interesting. Before watching the movie, I went to IMDb to see what ratings and comments he received. I was worried when I noticed low numbers and negative ratings. Despite the hype, I watched the movie and, to my surprise, found it incredible. <br /> <br /> The story was great (just notice), and the characters and their relationship in the film are amazing. I have not seen such a good combination of leading characters for a long time. I really felt for both characters and felt a strong connection. Since reading previous posts about the fact that this film is not enough epic, or about the lack of martial arts, I could not agree. This film is not the same as "Braveheart" and not "War with the Dragon", but still it is a wonderful film that perfectly combines history and action. <br /> <br /> Although “The Sword in the Moon” is not perfect (which movie?) is it still wonderful and touching. Just wait until the scene with music and cinematography ends, breathtaking. I only hope that more people will be able to see this film in order to give it an honest vote.
