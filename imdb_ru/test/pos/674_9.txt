The subject of the Second World War, and Robert Ryan - a rejected soldier, whom Lupino hires as a laborer. She is a military widow. <br /> <br /> Recruitment is limited, but acting is offset by this. Robert Ryan is in conflict: one day he seems nice, and then he is confused about where he lives. First, Lupino tries to help him. He seems worried, but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? Waiting builds. I really like movies that rely on the human factor in anticipation. What is this man capable of? There are several scenes from O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees that something is wrong. We continue to think that they will help her, then Ryan's personality will turn around again. He becomes like a Jekyll / Hyde character and eventually chases Lupino with a knife. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking out for these two great actors. 9/10.
