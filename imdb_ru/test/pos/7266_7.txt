A very watchable movie, and one that was eagerly awaited after seeing the trailer several times. <br /> <br /> It all looks great - from the ridiculous efforts of the erotic upper class to move away from mediocrity, for the scum of the lower class, just trying to keep their heads above the mud, the film perfectly conveys the spirit of the 18th century. <br /> <br /> Johnny Lee Miller plays Maclean very well, although the role doesn’t quite stretch him and Robert Carlyle seems to have been wasted a little on Plunkett, Miller’s highway colleague. <br /> <br /> The real star of the show was undoubtedly Ken Stott, who plays Mr. Chance (a kind of police chief of the 1740s) with an evil rejoicing that distinguishes him from the rest of the lineup. <br /> <br /> A great movie, and anyone who enjoys the color and style of Peter Greenaway’s films will love this look, although the subtlety of the plot becomes obvious until 2 hours have passed. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
