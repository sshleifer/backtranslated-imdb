I absolutely adored this movie in my childhood and still do it as an adult. To say that this is even an understatement. My sister, brother and I watched this one year at our grandparents' house during the Christmas holidays. They recorded it from the TV. Our parents were glad that it took us one night, but they thought that we would get tired of it and be ready for active rest the next day. Not this way! We are mesmerized. They could not stick us if they tried. This has become a cherished annual tradition. We liked everything about it: time, romance, battle scenes, villains, etc. <br /> <br /> C'mon, who can resist the hate of this psycho Bent with his permanent sir !? Classical! Besides, who can resist a round of applause when Justin falls from the balcony ?! What a triumphant moment! I have always had a special place in my heart for Orri and Madeleine. They were so romantic. The theme of the song alone can make me break a little. This film is incredibly touching, and I urge everyone to stick to it until the very end. It's worth it!!
