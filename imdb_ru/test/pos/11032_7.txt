I remember this film, it was the first film I watched in the cinema where it was dark in places, I was very nervous, it was in 74/75 when my dad took me with my brother and sister to the Newbury cinema in Newbury, Berkshire England I remember tigers and a lot of snow in the film, as well as the appearance of actor Grizzly Adams Dan Haggeri, I think one of the tigers was shot. If anyone knows where to find it on a DVD, etc., please let me know. Now the cinema has been turned into a fitness club, which is very unfortunate, since it is 20 miles to the nearest cinema, I would like to hear from others who have seen this film or like any other.
