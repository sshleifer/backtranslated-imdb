Jacques Audiard's directorial debut, "How They Fall" or "Regarde les Hommes" Tombert is our old friend, a film with two different stories that gradually converge and end up being the same story, just told from different sides. This is a story about a shaggy dog: prostitute Matthew Cassowitz, who followed the hapless stray Jean-Louis Trintiannt, who looks like a dog's devotion, even extends to murder when he is asked to repay his gambling debts in kind. Meanwhile, in a slightly different period of time, traveling agent Jean Yann, who is outside the hill, is becoming increasingly obsessed with finding an assassin who puts his police friend on the brainless coma, his life, income and relationships gradually disappear as he gets closer to its prey. Nevertheless, although he may offer an ideal setting for a modern neo-noir, the film is often more surprisingly playful, he is more interested in the quirks of character and a slightly distorted sense of humor (usually, sometimes due to occasional ironic inscriptions and half of Alexander Dresplat). funny, half-dissonant score) than traditional thrillers and plot mechanics. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film does not serve well one of the worst DVDs of Region 1 released in recent years: image quality on Synkronized. the disc is sometimes so bad that you always expect to see the heads of the audience in front of the picture, like a pirate disc.
