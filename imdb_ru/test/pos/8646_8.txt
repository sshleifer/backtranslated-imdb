After two short scenes, which at first glance seem unrelated to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired, clearly rich beauty in the back of a limousine. Her driver stops in a strange place on Mulholland Drive, along a winding, dense forest road with two lanes, full of mansions overlooking Los Angeles. While her driver and another person in the passenger seat turn around to kill her, two racing cars crash into the limousine from the opposite side. Survives only a dark-haired woman. She goes down the ridge to Sunset Boulevard and hides in the apartment of a resting woman. Shortly thereafter, Betty (Naomi Watts), the resting niece of the woman, appears in the apartment and faces a dark-haired woman who now has amnesia. Most of the first part of the film is Betty and a dark-haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people tried to kill her, and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. This is interspersed with strange surrealistic speculations about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays into the country of hooligans and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> Above may seem a bit complicated and fragmented, but this is not half. The film is designed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation. Mostly guaranteed that you do not understand this film, and you will not have much confidence that you will get your own interpretation from the first time. Even if you have a lot of experience working with like-minded films such as Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), I Am Inside (2003) and Butterfly Effect (2004), you can’t understand this on second viewing, either. The studio knew about it to such an extent that director David Lynch wrote “10 Tips to Unlock this Thriller,” and they put it on the back of the insert with a list of chapters on the DVD. Lynch has a special character, these tips are almost as mysterious as the film itself. If you try to understand in the early stages, that the structure is extremely complex does not help. It takes a very long time to figure out which parts should be “real”, and in some sections there is a complex investment of memories, and only contextual clues that they are memories. <br /> <br /> But is this movie worth seeing or is it worth trying to figure out? It depends on your tastes, obviously. On a superficial level, the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, although to some viewers it will seem a bit slow and overly scattered. But these qualities and many other surrealistic aspects of the film are typical of Lynch. The main point of Lynch - an old couple at first strangely smiling, as if they were alien people trying to put on the front. If you are familiar with this style and love it, you will find a lot to love here, although in many respects Mulholland Drive is quite understated for Lynch. In addition, for viewers who are primarily interested in this, or who like them as well as other aspects, Mulholland Drive has a rather wooded scene. This is not useless, although I have no problems with causelessness, but instead I play an important role in the film. <br /> <br /> As with all Lynch films, it’s easy to admire his unique approach to all aspects of cinematography. art and its attention to detail. Any serious student of the film (including "students of the chair" / "film fans") should study Mulholland Drive; many will like it. Lynch does not miss anything unmanageable. It includes brilliant color schemes (such as a variety of red and pink) with important symbolism. He unusually uses sound, such as a ringing phone, which is transferred to the next section of the score (when Betty first arrives at the airport). He directs his actors to deliver their lines in abundant bizarre ways, such as his characteristic weird pauses. He misses his strange and surprising sense of humor, such as the name "Winkie's" and the sign "Hot Dogs - Made for Pinks", which gives the key to some color symbolism. <br /> <br /> Lynch’s attention to detail in production design provides important, subtle clues throughout the film to help uncover the meaning. It is interesting to note that Lynch even explicitly requires that DVD programming be unusual - there are no chapters on the disc; You must either watch the movie in real time, or rewind it forward or backward to get back to certain points. <br /> <br /> If you like the surrealism and the veiled meaning of the film, or if you just love from the “riddles”, then Mulholland Drive is worth it to look at this aspect. There is a fairly acceptable interpretation of the film, at least at a broad, generalized level. I will not describe here the standard interpretation - it is worth studying, but only after you watched the movie a couple of times and came to your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs were written on film and interpretation; There are even sites dedicated to this. <br /> <br /> However, for my money, although I generally love Lynch and find many things about Mulholland Drive attractive, for me it’s not quite 10, at least for now (I have a feeling that my result can still increase with subsequent views). For me, however, the “twisting” aspect of the film is made much better in other works, such as “I am inside” and “Butterfly effect”. Mulholland Drive is more attractive to me for its surrealistic surface touches, but the plot does not carry them just like some other Lynch films. <br /> <br /> However, Mulholland Drive is definitely recommended for the right crowd. If you are serious about the film and do not mind thinking about what you are watching (as if the two are not necessarily the same), you should not miss it.
