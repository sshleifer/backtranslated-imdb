The A-Team still repeats every day on Dutch television (RTL7, around 6:00 pm), and I still watch it! I do not like the A-Team ... I absolutely adore them !! It's just great to see Justin stalking former members of the A-Team. Brings back memories from old days when I was young sweet. I would give you 10 points for excellent, but Justin looks like he is chasing former members of the A-Team. Of course, this is the only bad thing in this documentary. It is a pity that Justin is not looking for Melinda Kulea ("Amy A. Allen"). But it's nice to see Mr. T. back in business. It is a pity that he does not appear at the party at the end. But this party is too short to laugh again and see everyone in action again.
