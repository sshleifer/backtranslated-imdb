This movie is a great movie. The film shows so many topics in one amazing movie. Driving lessons centered around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17-year-old who comes of age. The film continues on how Ben is fed up with his dominant mother, and how he wants to be himself. Then Ben meets Evie, with whom he creates a special connection. These two go on a journey, and in the process Ben discovers himself and what is the relationship between him and Evie. This is a movie that you watch yourself or with someone else. It doesn't matter how you feel what Ben goes through in the film. This is a very emotional movie that makes you wonder if your driving lessons were as emotional or as exciting as Benâ€™s.
