John Osbourne's playwright (Look Back in Anger, The Entertainer) of Oscar Wilde's only novel positively enjoys the homosexual overtones of the original, perhaps too much. However, the dialogue, the cast with the cast, led by Sir John Gilgud and Jeremy Brett, and the brilliantly cerebral production (darkened only by a “too quick” ending) make it worthy of the attention of any theater lover with a capital “T”.
