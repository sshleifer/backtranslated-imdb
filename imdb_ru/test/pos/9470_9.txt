She is a Man, was everything I wanted, and maybe even a bit more. I like teen movies like “Chick Flick,” and I knew it would be great !! In the same spirit as “10 things that I hate in you” (one of my favorites for all time), “This is a man” is a unique, well-written, very well-played comedy with some of the funniest lines and physical a comedy I've seen in a long time. This is probably the funniest film I've ever seen this year (with the exception of the cheerful Pink Panther). But “She is a Man” is actually more intellectual, amusing, and most of the humor is based on a witty scenario, a plot in the style of “Three Companies”. erroneous names, mixed messages and actors. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is a star !! Even from the time of the terrible camp (but the strangely interesting “Amanda Show”) she showed a brilliant talent for comedy. She is probably one of the most talented comedians in the world. Her style of physical comedy, imitation and witty dialect makes her cheerful. Previously, her big screen debut (where she was a star) was pretty funny and well done “What A Girl Wants.” If it wasn’t her breakthrough car than she, The Man will take hands down. Bynes is really a real girl next door. It is a pity that she does not do a lot of work on the screen, because she may be the next girl "This." She is all American, nice, down-to-earth, sparkling girl (although she is now twenty years old)) and whether she can transfer her talent and style to the role of an adult actor is still unknown. But for the purposes of this film, it is perfect !! She actually legally shoots a rather outlandish plot. She pretends to be her twin brother and makes it believable. Not really ... but plausibly enough. Much of the script is based on the comedy about her mistakes, trying to be a boyfriend, but it’s just fun, laughing all the time. Channing Tatum frees himself from his dismal performance in the 2005 Havoc based on the plays of the Duke. He is jock, the captain of the football team and, ultimately, the object of affection for Bynes, unfortunately, he is also Sebastien’s roommate (who is Bains). He is a good lead man, and the chemistry between them is perfect. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who seems to be attracted to Sebastian (who is again Bynes). She does a good job too, although her role is small and she doesn’t influence the rest of the actors in any way. James Kirk is great in his little role as a real Sebastian. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is surprising ... they are absolutely believable as twins and even more, from a distance one could understand that someone believes that Bynes is Sebastian. All other actors fit somewhere, and their roles range from brief to more auxiliary, but in fact they all support the story between Bains and Tatum, but each more or less supports Baines' amazing performance. It easily carries the film without hesitation and makes it worthwhile. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that show so much in the trailer, and yet it is not one of those films that, when this part appears, is no longer funny Parts in the trailer that make you laugh, even more funny in a real movie. Relatively new director Andy Fickman does such an incredible work on this film. It weaves together a potentially complex storyline, causes it to flow naturally and everything collapses. A story that is largely based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, but it's amazing how much they managed to translate into this modern day movie. It would seem perfectly outside the wall, but more accurately for a classic comedy than you think. There is nothing much to say about the downside, except for the fact that the last half hour is a little delayed, and also becomes predictable, but this does not change the gaiety of the first half of the film. However, you'll laugh to tears, and this is one of the funniest films in the theater right now! 9/10
