This film is the funniest Danish film I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The plot is funny, amazing and exceptional. Danish humor is unlike any other, and every time he turns you on. The whole audience laughed 90% of the time .... it was incredible. The characters are so well played, and the two actors, Mads Mikkelsen and Nikolay Li Kaas, play at their best! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this movie, you will not regret it, believe me :)
