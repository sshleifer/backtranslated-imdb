This is, unfortunately, an unrecognized classic. <br /> <br /> The appearance is gorgeous, the designs, costumes, etc. are impeccable, the scenes after the battle and the cavalry attack are frightening and exciting. <br /> <br /> Characters are bright and truly human. Ardent is right, and Fabrice Lucini, as a lawyer for Dervill, steals the film with its clever pedantic rodent-like performance, rejoicing at the rise and fall of other people's misfortunes. Depardieu is good, but perhaps too big for this role. <br /> <br /> The film really distinguishes history, as well as its differences from Balzac's short story. These changes are editorial in nature, as Balzac discusses society a lot, and this film is breathing in characters. Nevertheless, Yves Angelo retained a key component: not only the missing person trying to regain his place in society, but each character must find his place in society: Count Ferro is trying to buy a peer, his wife (Ardent) is born in when she married Colonel Chaber, they achieved their position in the turbulence of post-revolutionary France. Everyone has something to lose in terms of status, and this creates a good drama, because his goals are at odds with each other. <br /> <br /> It also seems very modern: money is crucial for purchasing status in order to achieve power, but someone can sink as fast as they can. Derville likes strategy; he has seen the worst people he tells Chaber when he gets down to business. The original place of this speech is at the end of the story, because Balzac sums up the human comedy with great irony.
