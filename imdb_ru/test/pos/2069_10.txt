I watched every version of this play that I can come up with, including several on stage, and Sir Derek Jacobi is absolutely the best Hamlet I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> He has the most wonderful voice for acting, and his expressive face will give you emotions throughout the game. The way he says his lines takes you on a journey of insanity. He (like Hamlet) can in one moment be loving, soft and gentle, and in another moment storming against hell, which is his life. You believe that it hurts him, you believe that he is angry, you believe that he is not a little crazy. You believe that he is Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Of course, a certain gratitude certainly belongs to Shakespeare :), but without a great actor who will deliver the words from the page to the stage, it doesnâ€™t matter how well the play is written. <br /> <br /> If you like Shakespeare, you should definitely see this version. If you don't like Shakespeare, you should definitely see this version. If you do, you will come with a new assessment of Shakespeare. The nuanced rendition that Sir Derek gives you will hold your breath.
