I really liked this film, although this film seems so hated, and I think it is even better than “The Deer Hunter”, which was overrated. Both this film and the Year of the Dragon are very undervalued, although I could understand why someone would not like this film. At three and a half hours the film just goes on too long, and the second half of the film is much better than the first. Chris Christopherson and Christopher Walken are fighting for Isabel Huppert, but she cannot decide who to be with. Sam Waterston is a villain who has a list of 125 people who must be killed, who says they are anarchists and thieves. There is a great cast, which also has Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif and young Mickey Rourke.
