<br /> <br /> This is the best mocking documentary about a dog show that I have seen in a long time. Very long time. Well, let's face it, ever. Isn't that part of the charm? The idea of ​​really getting into trouble is to make a movie that mocks a documentary about an event that most people would find odd in the first place. Even if there wasn’t much laughter, you would still smile at this thought. Any film that tries something new is highly appreciated in my notorious book. I also loved dogs!
