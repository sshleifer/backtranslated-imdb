I saw this movie last night, and it was one of the best films I have seen. It was very well directed, and the action was excellent, very convincing. The music was good, and the cinema was beautifully filmed. Remove hopelessness from Requiem for a dream and you will be lost. An excellent description of the world of addiction and its consequences, presented in a very open way, to which anyone can relate. Thanks to MTV for giving us a good click for a change! * $ *% like Crossroads.
