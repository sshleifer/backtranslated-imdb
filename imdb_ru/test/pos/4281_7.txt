I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has something to blame, every real one. No cardboard characters or cool, all-powerful, all-knowing characters. <br /> <br /> I read a lot of other viewers here complaining about Anna’s morality and about James’s desire to save her love for her, despite the fact that she cheated on him, but I don’t agree. <br /> <br /> Ann (Emily Watson) seemed completely wonderful to me, and I felt love for her. <br /> <br /> She was a very depressed woman, her actions were not planned: as soon as she began to break free, she was confused and made many mistakes. But in real life, when you get freedom, you will most likely make mistakes (especially at the starting point). <br /> <br /> She was too ungrateful? May be. But we have to remember that she runs her legs for the first time. She knows that James is, after all, a good person, perhaps too harsh, serious and focused on work; but she also feels the desire to live like herself. <br /> <br /> Is she more to blame than him? I think not. <br /> <br /> But the turn in their lives brings about some changes. <br /> <br /> James, instead of letting his wife out of his life (as other viewers think is right), bites the bullet and waits, hoping for the best. He begins to realize that the fact that he was superficial, although everything was in order (his marriage), was in fact a control game that he played with his wife. <br /> <br /> This is not a story with characters that are overly emotional and unreliable (i.e., the usual cliches of Latin American or Italian jealous guys), this is a story about men and women who use the heart and brain. <br /> <br /> It can be very painful, but if you really love a person (women or man) and if you are not terribly unstable, you will probably forgive his / her betrayal and release him / her. Unless you are a jealous, prehistoric, crime-prone, passionate and mentally unstable person. <br /> <br /> A really good movie. The last scene, when James - despite all the things that had happened before - goes to Anna's station, is really moving: she is free, and he understood what freedom means for a person. <br /> <br /> Guido
