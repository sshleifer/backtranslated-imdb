What is the point in these messages if you don’t discuss and share your thoughts about the next season ... Here’s my prediction: 1. Luke really exploded, but somehow everyone inside survived. But let's look at that. 2. The episode at the end of the tent is a group of observers that monitors the tracking device mounted on the Desmonds Penny boat. Now that the magnetic shield around the island has been removed, the observation post has received a signal, and they are about to send a rescue mission. 3. After the destruction of the manhole, the island is no longer isolated, and other ships / aircraft are about to arrive. 4. The rest will finally share their secret with us poor observers. <br /> <br /> Was it really confirmed that there will be 4 LOST seasons? <br /> <br /> cheers, mike
