Despite all its attributes of style and cinematic invention, is it, in fact, another serial thriller killer, following the same storyline that such old favorites like Silence of the Lambs prefer? A team of policemen follow the trail of (especially dirty) murders, take someone else, and they somehow need to find out where they are before it is too late. Only in this case, the only person who knows, the killer himself (powerfully played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is in a coma, and we need the scientific machine of the psychologist Jennifer Lopez to penetrate his head and make him tell everything. This is the place where the film becomes new and unusual when we enter (through the 21st century CGI update in Dr. Who's Kaleidoscopic Favorite, fashionable time tunnel), into some strange world of HellRaisers of terrible insane things. occurring all over the place controlled by D'Onofrio, is now a kind of supernatural lord of his twisted mental world, inside his comatose body. The “in mind” sequences are well implemented and often quite daunting, all leads work adequately, terribly, if you like such things, to the maximum, but the hype around it all led to disappointment for me, since I was expecting something completely new and different anything else besides this rather successful combination of the main genres of the serial killer and the special effects of horror. Sometimes a terrifying, often pretty, quite exciting story told by talented filmmakers with care and attention, but not a big leap into the unknown, how it was sold.
