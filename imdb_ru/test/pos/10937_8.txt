This mix of SEARCHERS is one of the strangest films I've ever seen, shot by a Brit in a strange, unfamiliar Mexico. It is often said that the best films about America are made by foreigners who may come close to a friend with a prying eye. But this crazy movie is something else. Despite the fact that this happened in America after the Civil War, this is not America, recognizable by myths, movies, television, etc. In the film, there is a kind of eternal legend that deals specifically with Western mythology. > Director Harvey uses the title horse as a focal point for interrelated stories dealing with the traditional western clash of primitive and civilization. The first seems to have the upper hand. A huge shrub and desert landscape of the film is not broken, ripe for the allegories of the mind. The only brief places of civilization are the stagecoach of missionaries and landowners, as well as their haciends, of which both behave uncivilized. <br /> <br /> The main story interrupts three stories. In one of them, the aimless deserter, Pike, having lost his trading partner, steals a wonderful horse, the Eagle's Wing, the so-called because of its grace and speed. In the second - Indian White Bull, the owner of this horse, spurs the stagecoach and steals one of its inhabitants. Thirdly, the Spanish men sent to find her ignore this quest in favor of murderous robbery. <br /> <br /> Although a Western revisionist, handling an Indian is problematic. Unlike Pike, his character is never explained, forever incomprehensible, devoid of voice, with the exception of the painful passage of a song. When he is not strange to the Other, he is a symbol whose role is not fully worked out - on the one hand he is wild cattle, on the other he personifies nature and freedom. <br /> <br /> But at the beginning Pike notes that the film will be devoted to the period of primitivism before civilization. In many ways, the film resembles 2001 - COSMIC ODYSSEY, especially its debut sequence. Part of the film’s strength lies in the connections between three different characters, forcing us to look at mythical struggles and quests in a different light. Indian culture and Catholicism are bound by superstition, ritual, greed, and murder. Both Pike and White Bull are musical and alcoholic. Pike and the kidnapped demonize White Bull as a “bastard”, unwittingly revealing the tactics of illegitimacy used by the colonization of whites, who infect the natives and themselves become “necessary” fathers. <br /> <br /> Unlike traditional western This film, dedicated to history, civilization and progress, is a double detective story, interrogating the past, traces, remains. <br /> <br /> What gives this film an amazing uniqueness, I think, despite the fact that Maltin wrote racism, his Britishness. Climate confrontation is more like an artursky battle. The film itself boldly avoids dialogue for the most part, creating the look of a visual and aural tapestry missed by Malik in The Thin Red Line, and something that few Hollywood directors could have argued for boldly. The existential motives for doubling and quests are more European myth than American (reminds Harvey Keitel's other British film, DUELLISTS). <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is the use of nature. Most westerns use the landscape as an awe inspiring background: there is little point in living in the West. In many respects, EAGLE'S WING is similar to the film Powell and Pressberger, with nature in its own way a powerful, pantheistic character - alive, dangerous, hostile, beautiful. There is a sublime scene reminiscent of the Canterbury tale, when the jewels left by the White Bull as a trap in the trees are suddenly blown away in the wind: a haunting, tingling, magical, spectacular effect more like Arabian nights than an opera horse. Heartstopping.
