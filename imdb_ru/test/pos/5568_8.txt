When I first saw the Premiere Episode of Farscape, I had no idea what to expect. I was very impressed and pleased with the Premiere. However, subsequent follow-up observations made obvious to me the many flaws that I missed initially. The Premiere is not a very good episode with Farscape, but it deserves praise for the successful and effective setting up of the plot and the provision of basic stories to many regular characters. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with John Crichton Ben Browder), an astronaut and scientist preparing to launch into space in the Farscape module, a small spacecraft enhanced by Crayton and his friend DK Crichton has a frank conversation with his father, Jack Crichton, and then begins his test flight in space. Of course, everything goes wrong, and Crichton "shoots a wormhole" and ends up in a "distant part of the galaxy." <br /> <br /> After getting out of the wormhole, the module of Krichton is pulled out on board the living quarters. ship. From here, the characters and storyline for the Farscape series are introduced in an entertaining, albeit hasty manner. <br /> <br /> Regular characters are correctly represented in the first half of the episode. Of course, there is Creighton, well played by Ben Browder. He offers the viewer a sympathetic character for identification. He is lost and does not know how to do much. In Premiere, Krayton has to choose between joining prisoners or peacekeepers. He does not know anything about any of the parties, but by helping Aireen (captured by the peacekeeping pilot), it becomes clear that he intends to help the peacekeepers. Most likely, he would not side with the prisoners if it were not for Cruce, the peacekeeping captain, who declared Crichton the murderer of his brother. This puts Crichton in an interesting situation: he is stuck with bizarre, violently escaped prisoners in a distant galaxy of which he knows nothing at all. Crichton’s complete lack of knowledge about the Farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during the first Farscape season. <br /> <br /> The cast is equally compelling. This is Zhaan, blue Delvian and former prisoner. She is peaceful and reasonable, unlike cellmate Ca D'Argo, a strong and stubborn warrior. Virginia Hey is completely covered with blue makeup, which allows her character Zhaan to look cool and convincing. D'Argo's mega-makeup, on the contrary, is lower than the nominal one. He looks a little silly with his giant tentacles and a strange nose, and there is something strange in his eyes. They look as if they had some kind of allergic reaction to his makeup. Farscape will make some improvements in its cosmetics in season 1, but the overall costume, at least for me, will remain a problem until season 2. <br /> <br /> Puppet / digital characters Rygel and Pilot, Simply put, excellent. Rigel is a tiny Ginersky Dominar that flies on some kind of hovercraft. In the "Premiere" he is given a good dialogue, but nothing more. The pilot almost steals the show as a link between the living ship, Moya and Moya's passengers. Even in the first episode, the Pilot looks like a real, living alien; he never in the show seemed like a gigantic expensive car. <br /> <br /> These peacekeeping characters are also quite interesting. Peacekeepers are made up of a race of sibassians who resemble humans. The main antagonist is represented in the "Premiere" as Captain Kreis, who believes that Crichton killed his brother. In fact, the death of Brother Kreis was just an accident as a result of an accidental collision with the ship of Crichton. Erin Sun, the pilot, whom Crichton helps to escape, tries to explain that death was an accident, but Cruce simply claims that she is “irreversibly infected” and refused to change her mind. Kreis's obsession with revenge, justified or not (for Kreis, it should be clear that Crichton is not responsible) is mysterious in the Premiere, but will be explained later this season. Irene herself provides an extremely interesting character. Being forced to leave the Peacemakers, she changes her whole lifestyle and in this regard is in the same (albeit less serious) situation as Crichton. <br /> <br /> The actual episode, as mentioned earlier, feels somewhat hasty and awkward. So much is happening, that it takes little time for something. In addition, D'Argo (at the moment) looks rather stupid to run around in his mediocre costume, trying to seem threatening. Still, "Premiere" - is sheer entertainment. The special effects (such as in star formation sequences) are impressive. Most of the costumes and sets on board Moya are original. Despite its shortcomings, Premiere is a must for Farscape fans. 3/4
