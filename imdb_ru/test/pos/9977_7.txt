When I first saw the advertised film, I thought it would be another Disney movie that almost immediately goes to the video. I finally got around and rented it. I thought it was going to be bad, because I couldn't see Shea in any other role, except his recently canceled show, Even Stevens. When I turned it on, I was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes. It started a little slow, and I couldn't understand the beginning, because the years didn't make sense, then they explained it later in the show, so I got rid of the surprise about it. Everybody and everything, I thought it was a good movie and I would recommend it. The cast was top notch, and although I am not a fan of golf, he easily kept my attention on a good plot.
