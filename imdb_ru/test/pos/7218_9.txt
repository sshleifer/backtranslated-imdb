This film is a brilliant retelling of Shakespeare’s classic love story, complemented by "perverted sex, piercings and dismemberment." He really follows the same spirit as all the other films about “Trome” (except for “Fighting shock” ... This sucker was depressing), but this is not only for Troma fans. Anyone who appreciates low-growth visuals and a fun script will no doubt fall in love with this film. <br /> <br /> Don't wait for pretentious, artistic hooliganism, such as the R & J version from Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio; This one knows his stupid film and draws on this humor. The game is also surprisingly good, and you can just feel the pain of Sammy Capuleta when he tries to get his brain back to his head. <br /> <br /> A soundtrack that contains many original and high-energy bands, such as The Wesley. Willis Fiasco, Supernova and The Meatmen are also four-star. This film should look at everything, because it remains true to the original story, while still being clogged with Trome's bloody / sexual humor.
