Well, in 2002, I need something to catch up on. And, looking back on a dim year, the Best In Show shone. No big storyline. Little action. Just a cavalcade of great characters. The special mention of Fred Willard and Jim Piddock as a noisy pair of television commentators. Well done. Worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Ron (viewed March 24, 2001)
