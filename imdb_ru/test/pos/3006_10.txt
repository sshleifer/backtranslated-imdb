I liked this show. I was waiting for it to appear on the DVD .... it never happened. Does anyone know how to make a show available on DVD? I contacted Lifetime TV and several others, and nothing. Please let me know if we can burn this series to DVD. I would be the first in line to buy it. I really got hooked on this show. I do not understand how a bunch of other TV shows are available on DVD, but not on any given day. I am sure that many of us would like to make this show on DVD or even on VHS. I thought about contacting a manufacturing company. Has anyone else tried to contact someone for this information?
