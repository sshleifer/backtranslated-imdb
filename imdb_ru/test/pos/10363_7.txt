In fact, I mistakenly switched to the channel Lifetime, as soon as this film began, and eventually watched it. <br /> <br /> This is certainly dealing with a serious problem, probably more common than we think, in terms of this type of attack of a young woman by an ego-manic fellow student who feels that he is above the system, and, unfortunately, it often happens. <br /> <br /> The cast here was believable, and the performances were credible. Many of these Canadian / Lifetime clicks are decidedly "excessive." However, this is one that I could call "unfinished." <br /> <br /> Evaluating the fact that it was not presented in a bloated way, for some reason this film seemed to me a record one, which was played at a slower speed than actually, 96 minutes seemed much longer, and it looked like a shorter film, repeated over and over again, seemingly goes on and on, and turns on - before coming to an inevitable and predictable end. <br /> <br /> Despite this criticism, attractive characters and performances made it better than the average movie of this type. <br /> <br /> And although these images often “milked” the climax, it would be possible to give him a little more detail and length.
