As a teenager, or should I say that in prime time I “ate” all sorts of science fiction novels every day of the week. It was in the sixties and seventies, when television was not such an important killer in my free time as I watched a movie on TV one night in the mid-seventies, I think it was ARD and I was stunned. I was impressed that I can almost remember every scene even today. <br /> <br /> Now I’m watching my kids play SIMS or something like that, and I think we’re close to what Fassbender has expressed. I would also be very grateful if I could buy this film on DVD. But in vain I tried almost everything to get a hint where. A MATRIX film cannot touch the quality and condition of this film. And, by the way, we currently have no glue, if we were a superior reality or just one of a pair of simulation models. Probably, after our death, we will know for sure ...
