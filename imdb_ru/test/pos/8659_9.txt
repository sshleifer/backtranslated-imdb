first real film this year. Amazing long shots, sometimes with a fixed camera, so specific to Scandinavian cinema (not to mention Dogma). This author's film I find. Athmospherique :-) It just amazed all my feelings and meant how the image becomes cruel and painful during the scenes when he tries to commit suicide. That’s the point, I don’t think it’s in the whole plot. Why, if it was a perfect world, you could not die, but still maintained your conscience? Either it was a real world with “adapted” rules, or it was a “fantastic” world, but in this case there could not have been a single accident, like people remembering, as it was before. <br /> <br /> This reminded me of Kafka, and perhaps more, from Huxley's Brave New World, especially in the part where sex was actually available to everyone, since it was considered a right to pleasure. It lacked a plot, but I think it was better because you understood and felt all the strange behavior of everyone, the absurd and the absence of real sensations in this “happy” world. <br /> <br /> I think, also, that the end was brilliant. true peace is really homo lupus, you have been eaten if you are not strong enough.
