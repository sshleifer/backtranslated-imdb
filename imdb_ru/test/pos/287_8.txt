Anyone who criticizes "Jacqueline Hyde", as something more than a playful and indisputably erotic romp, that he is meant to be simply not playing with a full deck. As the name implies, it is obvious that this low-budget horror comedy should not be taken seriously ... she has the same tongue in her cheek as the French kiss of a nymphomaniac is just as exciting. All female actors are great and fun to watch. Check it out, Rolfe Kanefsky is a clown prince of bottomless horror. Unlike most soft horror films, this film entertains charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses. The film does not even try to follow the storyline of Robert Louis Stevensonâ€™s classics, but instead looks for all possible ways to create risky spectacles and erotic situations. Blythe Metz, the brunette femme fatale who portrays Jacqueline's sexy, murderous side, is a real knockout. Watch and enjoy!
