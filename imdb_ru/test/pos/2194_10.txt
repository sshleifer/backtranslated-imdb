I can not overestimate the quality of the score, books and performances. This is Sweeney Todd's first production I've ever seen, so I have no one to compare with. But the impact is so strong that I just can not imagine anything better. <br /> <br /> First, there is music - take "Johanna" (Act II), during which Sweeney, Anthony and Johanna sing the interlacing vocal line, which includes three-song melodies. In this sense, this is Bach choir, just a masterpiece of composition. And the basic structure of chords and voices is so beautiful - a bit of melancholy, a bit of satisfaction, a bit of anguish, everyone expresses the point of view of these three singers. <br /> <br /> Then - - the words of the song. Rhymes are so smart. Rhyme schemes sometimes seem random, but they always add up at the end. (The DVD I watched has hidden credits, and they are necessary for the evaluation of dialogue and texts.) Sondheim deserves a literary award only for his poetry. <br /> <br /> Finally, the performances. I can not imagine anyone better than George Hearn. Why haven't I heard of him before? His singing is masterful in itself, but the range of its action is simply amazing. Angela Lansbury totally surprised me. The song about "we are with you on the seashore" - who could have done it better? Her time is immaculate, the field is perfect, every blow is counted; and the imposition of this achievement in musicality is its extremely delightful comic release. <br /> <br /> This is a grim story, but I sometimes found it sweet; and the melody "Johanna" keeps playing in my head.
