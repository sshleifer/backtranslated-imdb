It’s hard to understand what to do with this strange little Australian crime film - on the one hand, it’s a nice little movie with a great sense of humor; but on the other hand, he simply lacks something that ensures that the film never reaches its limits, which keeps him trapped in simply “interesting” territory. At the same time, the film “Two Hands” is a well-thought film, in which several stories are perfectly combined at the same time, which allows to achieve several small climaxes throughout the entire film, which, in turn, helps to stop the boring film. The absurdity of what is happening, thick Australian accents and a fancy set of characters - all this contributes to the fact that the film is entertaining as well. The plot repeats the story of a young janitor who thinks he will move on to more significant things after getting a job from a local thief in law. He is not; work only gives him trouble when he enjoys swimming and stupidly leaves ten thousand on the beach, which will quickly be stolen by a couple of children who spend time in shopping. However, not everything is so rosy for our hero; who has to find the money or face the consequences ... <br /> <br /> The film is composed of a group of unknowns; at least it was back in 1999, since currently Heath Ledger is something of a name. However, he is not particularly impressive, since his performance consists mainly of one note, and he does not make a very convincing advantage. He approaches the film because he is Australian and looks naive; but beyond that, he is not the best leader I have ever seen in a movie. If you ask me, Brian Brown gave the best performance here. He may not have a lot of screen time, but he steals every scene he is in, and it is he who provides the film with more humor. However, it has nothing to do with the best sequence, which takes place in the form of probably the most fun bank robbery ever filmed. In general, I can recommend this film to people who like fancy crime films; how many oddities, and the way events take a turn for the strange, is pleasant; but if you're not a fan of this kind of movie, I can't say that Two Hands will float on your boat. It's not necessary to see, but if this is your thing and you have a chance to see it ... you probably won't completely regret it.
