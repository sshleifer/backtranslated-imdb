This film proves that you do not need a Hollywood budget to watch something interesting. What struck me was the fact that a team from different places was able to unite without promises of wealth to do something just because they believed in it. I think that anyone who shoots low-budget films may have to do with certain scenes, such as actors who simply can't get this single line, worried about the police and making most of the team disappear after the first week. No one paid for it, which speaks volumes because of people who had to travel over rough terrain and for the long hours spent on editing. After Stewie sold his personal property, used his own money and laid out his house to make a film, I am a little curious how close his wife may have been to leave. Good job for everyone.
