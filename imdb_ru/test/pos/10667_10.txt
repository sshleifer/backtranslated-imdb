If you are a student, or were a student, or are going to become one, the name "Battleship Potemkin" has or will have a resonance. Sergei Eistenstein, like other silent film pioneers such as Griffith (although Eisenstein's innovations are not as common as Griffith) and Murnau, had such an impact on the history of cinema, which, of course, is taken for granted. The reason why I raise the role of a student of a film is that at some point, whether you like it or not, your film professor will show the “Odessa Ladder” 9 times out of 10 in this film. It is difficult to say whether this is even the “best” part of several episodes of the film devoted (at the present time) to the times of the Russian revolution. But this leaves the greatest impact, and this can be seen in many films that demonstrate uncertainty or just simple editing (the "Untouchable" climax comes to mind). <br /> <br /> Editing, which was not just Eistenstein's skill, but also the blood of his life at the beginning of his career, is often incorrectly used in a real movie, or if not used incorrectly, then in the wrong context for the story. Sometimes the installation is now used simply as another device to get from point A to point B. Installation for Eisenstein was something else; he tried to convey in the most direct way, as far as he could, the urgency, the passion (s) and the main tragedies that were in the Russian people at that time and in any place. Even if no one sees that all Eisenstein's narratives or traditional “plot” ideas have sufficient justification (Kubrick said this), one cannot deny the ability to see ships arriving at the harbor, people on the stairs, and soldiers go at them with weapons in different directions. Some may find it hard to believe that this was done in the 20s; she possesses such power as the Passion of Joan of Arc to overcome her time and remain important, if only in terms of technique and emotions. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can go for books (which have been written hundreds of times, not least by Eisenstein himself). By itself, the film Battleship Potemkin looks more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific story in the film. The first segment is also one of the great episodes in the film, as the rebellion is being prepared against the captain and other heads-ups of a particular ship. This is detailed almost manipulative, but somehow extremely effective; montage is also used here, but in energy flows that capture the eye. In other cases, Eisenstein is more pleased when the images speak for themselves, as the soldiers get tired without food and water. He is not one of those directors who will try to get all sides in the story; He is, of course, very Russian at the beginning of the 20th century, but he is no more than honest with the way he sees his themes and style, and this is what ultimately wins. <br /> <br /> Some may want to test this outside of the film school because the “Ladder” sequence is similar to one of those signs of a serious tragedy in the film showing the ugly side of the revolution. Eisenstein may not be one of the most “available” directors of silent films, but if the editing, the details in the frame, the non-actors and the Bolshevik themes are your cup of tea, this is indeed one of the must-see shows of all life.
