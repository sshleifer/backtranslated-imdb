The Ator series is a prime example of what B-movies should be. They fail in all aspects, but in such a fun way that they are funny, not sad. "Ator l'invincibile 2" aka "The Blade Master" aka "Cave Dwellers" shows us the beloved European clone of Conan, Ator, where we left him in the first film - after he showed us a long review of all the events of the first film. This time, the world must be saved from the “Core”, a kind of bomb, represented on the screen in the form of a bright light (I suppose they could not afford to support themselves). This one shows invisible attackers and samurai. As in the first film, a lot of video is used (including one fairly obvious piece from Star Wars). Carefully ridiculously and unforgettably bad - this is the exception of the B-film.
