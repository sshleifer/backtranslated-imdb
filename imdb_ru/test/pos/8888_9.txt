Black comedy is not always easy to sell. From time to time you get a black comedy that is extremely successful, like Fargo, for example. But usually they do not often find a large audience. People seem to be either set to comedy or to serious chaos. There seems to be no big market for a good mix of both. Throw Momma From the Train was a pretty decent hit, but few people remember this in our time. Danny DeVito almost completely hit him from the park in 1987. <br /> <br /> DeVito plays a strange mom's boy named Owen, who wants to get rid of her outrageously domineering and unpleasant mother, with whom he still lives, Mother plays Ann Ramsey, who died shortly after it was released and she is a caricature. She is loud, ugly, rude and domineering. Although Owen hardly thinks he can take care of himself, he desperately wants his mother offended. He fantasizes about it in some really strange scenes, but he clearly does not have the courage to do it himself. Here comes Billy Crystal. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's art teacher at a nearby college. Larry is a paranoid potential intellectual writer who claims that his ex-wife stole his novel and made millions on it. He is currently trying to write a new one, but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence. "The night was ...". Owen hears Larry wanting his ex-wife to die during an explosion at a school cafeteria. And borrowing this idea from the Stranger on the train, Owen decides to go to Hawaii and kill ex-wife Larry. As soon as it seems that he did this, he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny, and even sharp. This, of course, is never boring and often full of surprises. <br /> <br /> The game is exceptional, even if Ramsey was a little crazy. Crystal is as good as he can be, and DeVito has always been underestimated as a performer. The film relies on a small part of the physical comedy that usually works, often painfully. The film uses some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the original tone is really refreshing. I often criticized the late 1980s as a time of artistic malaise and lazy filming. Throw mom from the train, taking risks. As in how his characters are drawn, and in the general plot. How many comedies revolve around the son who killed his mother? The film is not too long, and it is full of laughter. Writers tend to find it more interesting than the general public, but anyone can still enjoy it. 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Dog.
