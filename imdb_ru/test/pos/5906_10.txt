By itself, the genre of this film has a limited audience and narrow appeal, combined with subtle overtones that permeate the entire production. Nevertheless, this is a wonderful piece of cinema, which is as eternal as a rare work of art. Capturing time in Quebec, which is rarely seen in movies, Mon Oncle Antoine’s strength lies in the depth of its characters and the richness of its settings. Quebec Duplessis, local and feudal, brilliantly presented as a backdrop that no one can achieve except pure Quebecum. <br /> <br /> It would be too easy to resort to stereotypes, cliches and unambiguous short-sighted statements in this story. Nevertheless, the director chose to skip the forced images and instead focused on the essence of life in the rural areas of Quebec at that time. This makes this film exceptional in its authenticity, but not pretentious in its presentation. If only more modern cinematic efforts would have done the same, the viewers might not have had to choose between the over-advertised Hollywood Pablum, which is suitable for watching “You Must See.” <br /> <br /> Mon Oncle Antoine - in every sense of the word - is unforgettable. It will leave a lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived or visited Quebec. Classic *********************************************** <br / > <br /> <br /> Follow-up: May 10, 2008 <br /> <br /> After reviewing some of the comments, it is worth noting that “Mont-anclone-Antoine” is NOT NEEDED - and probably should NOT be serve as the standard Hollywood / American cinema for mass sales. Yes, the history of adulthood, but much more than the simple memoirs of youth in Quebec in the 1940s. Viewers who are looking for entertainment due to the complex character development will be greatly disappointed. Go watch action / adventure / romance / comedy to have fun. Watch the monk Antoine being dragged into a rare but absolutely wonderful society that has been ignored and ignored for too long. <br /> <br /> “Grapes of Wrath” is almost a thriller on the edge of space. However, the story and the characters make this American classic film sturdy. Grandpa Antoine in the same genre.
