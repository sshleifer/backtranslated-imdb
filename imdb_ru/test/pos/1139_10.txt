If you listen to Ween (The Pod, God / Satan), then you know what happens with Split, I found that watching a movie influenced by LSD helped to cope with audio / video tracers from a fantastic editing job. The plot was only important from second to second. Acid helped to interact with the sounds, the subconscious and the overall pace of this masterpiece. Do not worry about writing about something that is beyond the reach of your understanding ... Itâ€™s just that these great independent attempts to express are not enough at the most unprocessed amateur level. I dare anyone to make a film that can equally ruin my head and change my view of the visual arts and the reality of the world. Not to mention the many realities that have not yet been explored by this human mind. I like the vision of Chris Shaw. I also appreciate the texturing terrorist film "Elias" by E. Melige.
