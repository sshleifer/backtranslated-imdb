Well, I'm a big fan of Italian horror, and I love films from such directors as Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, just to quote the most famous ones. La Villa Delle Anime Maledette is one of the most unknown films of this genre, made when this type of movie began its crisis, which continues to this day, and directed by Carlo Auzino sounds completely new to my ears (although he has shot six films .. This is the price that Italian directors have to pay in order not to work in Rome ...). But the film is not so bad. And it is absolutely not correct to talk about "garbage". OK, the plot is not so original; it reminds me of things like the Amitville series (the same year as Amityville Possession by Damiano Damiani) or The Shock, the last work of Mario Bava. But you have to think that this is a film of a cinematographer (for example, films of Mario Bava); therefore, the most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story or characters; The atmosphere is very well created thanks to the use of light and camera movement. The rest remain in the background. I think the film works; not very good, but it works; this is certainly better than many Hollywood productions, such as Ghosts, which have a larger budget, but not big ideas ...
