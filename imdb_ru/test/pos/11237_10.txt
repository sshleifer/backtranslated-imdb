I don't know what the last reviewer is talking about, but this show is pure entertainment. Usually 2 guys participate in the club, who collect girls according to 3 different scenarios. They mix scripts for each show, so every time itâ€™s not the same thing. A panel of 4 judges is not afraid to call people or admit it when they recognize the game. They break what the guy did wrong, and what the guy did right. Some participants are weak, some are strong, but what happens is always interesting. If you are the guy who goes out, you can chat. I saw a weak game, I saw a strong game, and this show is for real. Without a doubt.
