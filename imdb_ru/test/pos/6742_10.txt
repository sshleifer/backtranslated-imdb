This is without doubt one of the best plays of Neil Simon. He is full of wonderful characters and memorable dialogue. Jonathan Silverman makes a great screen version of the young Eugene (played by Matthew Broderick on stage). This is Simon's first autobiographical trilogy, followed by the wonderful “Biloxi Blues”, and ends with the television film “Broadway Connection”. If I had to say that there are flaws in the film, it’s possible that the characters sometimes speak in an obvious dialogue, but that's normal that's a great dialogue. Rent this little gem, you will not regret!
