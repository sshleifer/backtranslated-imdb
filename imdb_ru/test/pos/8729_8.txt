I am surprised at the relatively low rating of this movie. This is a comedic and romantic film about worms, made by someone other than Billy Wilder, but he does a good job and even won an Oscar. <br /> <br /> This is Ingrid Bergman's first film in the United States since the 1950s, and even though she is no longer the young bomb in which she was in her early films, she does a pretty good job with a difficult role. This film proves that she had many talents besides her attractive appearance. <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn, who won an Oscar in this, her first film, as a secondary actress is very good as a modern, sophisticated, but whimsical last mistress for Dentist playboy, love them and leave them to Walter Matthew. Goldie is amazing in every sense in this role, which with a great cast has put her on the bait for this early career. <br /> <br /> This film is not very deep, but is a gem that stands the test of time very well. Not sure why this average value is as low as I give it a solid 8.
