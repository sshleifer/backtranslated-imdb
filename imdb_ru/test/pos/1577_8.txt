If they were giving awards for the most tainted and tainted movies in the world, Japanese cinema would have cleaned out: their exploiting movies wipe the floor with most other rivals, the most striking examples of which are absolutely awesome bad taste exercises, nausea, blood, weird oddities and misogynistic sex. <br /> <br /> Guts of the Beauty is a vivid example of such spoiled dirt, offering shrewd viewers a little over an hour of complete licentiousness and unreasonable violence, culminating in some very insane J-splatter perfection. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a young woman named Yoshimi, whose search for the missing sister brought her into the arms of some dirty yakuza who continues to rape her and shoot her full of strong dope called Angel Rain. After the gangsters have finished having fun with a poor woman, she manages to escape and escape to the nearest hospital where the sex psychologist Hiromi (Megumi Ozawa) is trying to help. However, bewildered and bewildered, Yoshimi eventually rushes from the roof of the hospital, turning into a watermelon when it falls to the ground (at least as it looked to me!). <br /> <br /> In an effort to avenge the death of Yoshimi, Hiromi lured Higashi, a member of the yakuza, into her office, and, having tortured him, hypnotized him so that he would attack the other members of the gang. After Higashi is satisfied with the knife at the Yakuza headquarters, he is severely beaten and stabbed, forced to tell about his meeting with Hiromi, and then broken into small pieces. <br /> <br /> The psychologist was captured by a gang subjected to some place of forced beetles (at the same time being forced to give the yoke of yakuza to the head) and injected to Angel of Rain, after which she quickly killed him. Then the gangsters throw her body into the trunk of their car along with the remains of Higashi, ready for recycling. <br /> <br /> However, before they can kill the corpses, super dope has an unexpected effect on Hiromi. she returns from the dead like a hermaphrodite monster with a toothy penis and a predatory wound, and, obsessed with a thirst for revenge, begins to kill the yakuza one by one; this leads to some memorable scenes of terribly bloody splashes, including foul dizziness, a man choking on a monster's oozing vagina, and a woman who was killed by his gigantic grating phallus. <br /> <br /> As Most likely, from the above brief overview you can say that this is some kind of crazy, spoiled material, and probably not to the taste of most sensible people, but for those eccentrics who have long been tired from mass cinema and already well versed in Asian abundance, Guts Of A Beauty should be delightfully distracting and deviant entertainment. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded to 8 for IMDb.
