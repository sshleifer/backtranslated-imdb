Although the songs and dance numbers are generally not as strong as many would have liked, the film’s plot line and its message are still present and sound loudly over simple 70s-style musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Remembering that this film was made after the Hollywood musical almost became extinct (with few exceptions - rock musicals), the audience who came to see it new, did not appreciate the fact that he was brave attempting something that has not been done to date. Viewers who see him today will be inclined to judge today's films and musicals, and perhaps the huge strikes of stars that have passed by. But to do this with this film, or with any other, is unfair to the film itself. <br /> <br /> There are some good musical moments in the movie. First, this is Bobby Van. Mr. Van took on the role of Harry Lovett immediately after the closing of the two-year nomination of Tony (for the best male role) of the awakening on Broadway "No, no, Nanette." He has long been singing and dancing, and, frankly, the only one of the actors who was really talented and experienced in musicals. He never misses a single step in his “Question to me answer”, and rightly so ... he was completely at home, like Harry. Olivia Hussey makes other nice numbers when she welcomes new visitors, and although the lyrics are weak, James Shigeta shows her strong voice in the song "Family", as well as a beautifully made production of the entire piece. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie and find out what it is ... a fantasy about a place where you never get old, hidden in the icy and snowy mountains of Tibet, found by a group of unsuspecting modern people wrapped in discord of any modern culture. Take it and compare with reality, and you will get a film that does not reach the goal. But ... take this film for the message of love, peace, tranquility and brotherly love, and you will receive a warm, refreshing and positive message. <br /> <br /> This film may seem trivial to some; others have welcomed the release from the hectic pace of reality. First, try not to judge and just enjoy the message. Secondly, you have discovered the secret of Shangri-La!
