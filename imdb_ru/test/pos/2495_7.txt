It is through the comedy of mistakes, erroneous affection, passing from one to another, flourishing and turning into "cat and mouse" situations. Outbursts of passion, sparks of fire inflated and extinguished, guessing, maybe she loves, loves or loves? A circle of emotions, developing, liberating, hiding, but not hiding, wanting to let him know, wanting to let her know, let them know. A good ensemble, despite the seemingly tangled mix of emotions from different sides. <br /> <br /> This is a refreshing wizard, normal, free and easy, but rather down to earth - not Hollywood, like Notting Hill, but a lot of human feelings, fragility, vulnerability. Yes, everything revolves around a randomly found love letter. Kate Capshaw as the owner of a bookstore in the city, with a variety of characters depicted by Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Tom Everett Scott, Gloria Stewart, Alice Drummond and Geraldine McEwen in a role seemingly intact by Mrs. Romance is in the air, love is hiding everywhere. You will appreciate the talented Kate Capshaw. (“Alarmist” is another strange little film that is interesting to watch: Capshaw has excellent chemistry with David Arquette, and Arquette with Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> Notting Hill pleases with its revolving history around the glittering pairing of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, and the remarkable support of his circle of (London) friends. "Love Letters" is amazing in her quaint (Loblolly) small town, and its story, including Kate Capshaw's centrifuged ripple effects on her friends and neighbors. Both, perhaps, fantasies, one way or another, the latter felt more attainable if this happened to you. And if you value words or poetic lines, this could be a movie for you.
