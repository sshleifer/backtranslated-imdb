This episode with Buffy was one of my favorites. Also number three from Joss's personal favorites. There was very little dialogue in the episode, and despite this, good people from the Emmy decided that they deserved the nomination. Unfortunately, it did not win. When premiere Hush first received about 6 million viewers, it was the top-rated episode of the fourth season. That should tell you something. Despite the fact that there was very little talk, he managed to intrigue people enough to tune in. These gentlemen characters (who played my memes) were among the most terrible creatures created on the series (or on any network TV show I saw). There is nothing worse than a bunch of jagged silver men walking towards you with a scalpel and smiling. I think that, despite the lack of dialogue, the actors did a fantastic job on the show.
