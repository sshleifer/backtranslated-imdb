The film is not for everyone. Some might think that a game is bad when it is really understated and natural. There are no obvious atrocities and no stunningly beautiful moments. There is a lot of indecision, a lot of conflicting feelings. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is very honest about a very difficult topic - “Sex with minors”. It is difficult, because the characters are trying to cope with love and sex, when her body and hormones are still developing, and their mind and personality are still developing. Difficult also because society has very simplified views on sex with minors, and complicated because the characters do not know whether society is right or their instincts are right. <br /> <br /> Some people don’t like the film because it leaves unanswered questions. Questions such as who was really in charge of the relationship, who was damaged, benefited from it, was it an art that suffered more, did some problems in their relationship that it was prohibited by society, because of their own immaturity and, perhaps most importantly, was it a crime? <br /> <br /> The film is decidedly neutral in relation to all this, and it is this neutrality that is its strength. This is the reason for the understated game, simple sets, lack of background music, soft lighting and the overall "flat" presentation. The message is clear. Today we do not really understand this kind of relationship, and quick judgments will inevitably be superficial.
