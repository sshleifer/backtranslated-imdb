An old grumpy baronet, happily unmarried, decides to send for his three adult illegitimate children and provide them with a home in his estate. To his surprise, he discovers that he is tying himself to his free American daughter. Will he be able to find satisfaction in his new role as "BASKER FATHER"? <br /> <br /> This 1931 film, in which it demonstrates excellent results, marked the arrival at MGM of an elderly Sir S. Aubrey Smith, who was soon to appear. one of the most valuable characters in Hollywood. With his huge hooked nose and chewing eyebrows, Sir Aubrey looked every inch at the role of the duke or the general or statesman he would play so often. The recognized leader of the British community in Hollywood, Sir Aubrey also advocated cricket in Southern California. He would have remained very popular in studios throughout the city until his death in 1948. <br /> <br /> The movie star with the highest score is Marion Davis. Today she was remembered as the mistress of media tycoon William Randolph Hearst and Hearst Castle Castle, the most fabulous residence on the West Coast. In fact, she was a very talented and pretty comedian. For several years, Hirst tried to make her the queen of MGM (with her own production company and a huge dressing room for the bungalow), but the studio already had several other queens - Dressler, Garbo, Shearer, Crawford - and in the end he moved her Warner Bros. Here Miss Davies gets a joke and a clown, and her scenes with Sir Aubrey are interesting. <br /> <br /> Her love interest is played by Ralph Forbes, a beautiful young British actor who was just beginning to find good films (trail 98), as the quiet days ended. He had all the qualities for great fame, but unfortunately this did not happen. The celebrity will come to Ray Milland, who will appear on the screen for the first time. Holliwell Hobbes and Doris Lloyd also benefit.
