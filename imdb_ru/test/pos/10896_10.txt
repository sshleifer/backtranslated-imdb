Since I was again allowed to play Goldeneye, it was impossible to escape from this. I am surprised that I could do without it. This is without a doubt one of the greatest games of all time. I have never played other shooters, but I know that this rule is above all. Most people blame it on excessive violence, but I find it ridiculous. There may be several graphic tricks, but there is much worse. <br /> <br /> The most important thing is fun. Possessing a huge arsenal of weapons, such as the RC-P90 and the classic Golden Cannon, you will pass through several exciting levels from the film, completing important tasks and fighting off the crowd of guards. There are many great cheats and even two secret levels that you earn only if you have a real skill. Goldeneye is also one of the greatest multiplayer games. You can choose several characters from the film, classic villains from old 007 movies (Baron Samedi, Oddjob, May Day and Jaws) and guards in the game. Most likely, you and your partners will laugh so much that you will blow each other up and you will look like Bart and Lisa Simpson watching an episode of the show “Itch and Scratches”. <br /> <br /> So if you don’t have a game, don’t rent it: just buy it. This is too good to be true. To learn something interesting about Goldeneye, visit the Goldeneye website at Detstar.com. Every lover of James Bond will dig this game for a long time.
