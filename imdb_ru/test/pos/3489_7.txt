Ibuty letters along with Dan Mather, executive producer and actor Sasha Baron Cohen destinies, seeing parodies playing their part in the World, which is really real, and who constantly preach "Save Reality" from their own little world, which is West Staines, "The Array" is a real comic paradox. <br /> <br /> Directed by Mark Milod, his first full-length feature film since he starred in such television films as Shameless, Falling Stars, The Fast.
