This film was talked about in Fangoria, where I heard about it, it was interesting to me, mainly because it was a direct video, and I recognized two stars on the cover, James Marsden from Anxiety Behavior and Christine Taylor from The Craft. And to my surprise on Valentine's Day, when I was looking for a passage for horror, to find it on the shelf! I had to grab it immediately. I, my brother and our friends watched it, and to my surprise, it was pretty good, the stories were interesting, and this time they were really scary, unlike many other horror films that were filmed lately. Part of the story is not clear to me, but as soon as I look at it again, I bet, I will get it. And to my even greater surprise, there were other stars that I recognized, including one of the girls from the series “My so-called life” and Jasinda from Real World, I'm not sure why this film was only for video, with a small by advertising this film could at least compensate for how much money was spent on its creation. The only problem I have is that since it was not released in theaters, I think I can never see it in widescreen. You must take a chance and rent this one. <br /> <br />
