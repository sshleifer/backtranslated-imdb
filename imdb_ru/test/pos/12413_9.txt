I know that Chill Wills used to play old cute westerns. But his role in this segment is what I remember for a long time. Wills can be a first-class villain. Yes, Fall Burgess Meredith was right! This look into the eyes of Hepplwyth! He expressed swine greed, ignorance and the threat of violence at the same time. I think it was a good performance. <br /> <br /> The segment itself was also good. Question: Can a little black bag cure alcoholism? I think something like Fall. But it would be wise for the doctor to apply the medicine if it were, as soon as possible, to Heppleuit. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that is annoying, but also necessary. And this is what seems to be repeated in these segments of the Night Gallery. This is Serling's constant need to preach. Because that's what we got, once again, with Dr. Fall. I don’t know what was more frustrating: losing a black bag and all its wonders or stopping Folla from preaching about the benefits of a bag for humanity, while rubbing Hepplwita’s greedy face in the dirt and therefore almost not asking Heppwhite hit him. But, as I said, it was necessary. At least it was for me. Otherwise, we would not be able to see the performance of Wills, which was mentioned above. Everything is done without moving muscles and without saying a word.
