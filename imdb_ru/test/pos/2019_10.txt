Well, let me put it this way: I have always been one of the “hardcore brothers”; I have always loved rock music and especially heavy metal !! That is why this film is a gift from God! I believe that this film is one of the best ever (well, except for “Infinite History” and “Star Wars”, of course ...). Nice to hear all the classics such as "Long live rock and roll" (DIO), "Stranglehold (Ted Nugent)", songs by John Bon Jovi, Deep Purple, AC / DC, Zakk Wylde and several other legendary rock groups. Heavenly Absolutely gorgeous! WONDERFUL !!! I hope they make more of these films (otherwise they are just shit movies, such as “AC in da USA” or, as they call it, and “8 miles.” Bulls ***!) Well, I highly recommend it is anyway! All I miss is a couple of Stratovarius songs! But besides that, this is one of the best films ever! Ten out of ten!
