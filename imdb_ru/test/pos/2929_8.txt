It was another great episode from the 11th season of South Park. <br /> <br /> Cartman pretends that he has Tourette syndrome in order to be able to say whatever he wants without any problems. He can swear at other children at school. Kyle tells the director that Cartman is pretending. But she does not believe in it. Chris Hansen plans to have Cartman be on Dateline to talk about Tourette syndrome live and uncensored. But later, Cartman begins to get so involved that he can say everything he wants, that later he starts to say embarrassing things by chance. It was a funny episode about Tourette Cartman's fake syndrome. I recommend this to any South Park fan.
