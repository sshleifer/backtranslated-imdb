I agree with Andy, this is a good movie. Kevin McKiddâ€™s character is credible throughout the film. We have to hate him and lately sympathize with him. Paula Sage, who plays Robert, also plays well. It makes you think and emotionally without any overproduction of slush. Thanks to director Alison Peebles and writer Andrea Gibb for that. Very worth watching. The pace of the film is absolutely correct, they cause enough interest in the plot to interest you, and not to bombard you with facts in a documentary style. A good little movie soundtrack, which is also rarely used so as not to distract you from the plot. Featured.
