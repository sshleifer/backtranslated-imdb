I have never seen a Bollywood movie before, but I caught the first ten minutes of this, laughed stupidly and pressed the R button on Sky +. I'm glad I did !! I hope I’m not insulting anyone (because mostly BF and I liked it!), But we couldn’t take it half as seriously as the actors - especially the obsessive (who, as I understand it, is a huge Bollywood star) on the cover of many DVDs since then, and I even saw his doll today at Hamleys !! BF continues about this guy - I'm starting to think that he is obsessed! He goes on to say that it is strange for the traditionally good-looking to be the film's anti-hero! But then we really like movies that are not your predictable Hollywood fare). <br /> <br /> It was absolutely unbearable, but very fun, If all the Bollywood films are like that, then we look more. I had this song in my head all week, and I can't say a word about Hindi! PS Any recommendations would be appreciated!
