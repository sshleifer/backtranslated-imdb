I have seen this film since I was a little girl, and, being in New York and remembering how people lived then, brought a lot of good memories. This film is not only about the desire to finish the story, but also about understanding the struggle for becoming the best man, woman and provider that Claudine tried to achieve. It was about the social security system, putting women in a mandatory situation. It was about the injustice of the system, which invaded and forced the family to stay afloat. Diane Carroll was nominated for an Oscar for this role, and it was well deserved. If you want to create a strong family with conflicting, but wonderful moments of communication, enjoy Claudine. Your goal as a spectator is to maintain an open mind and to understand the general disappointment.
