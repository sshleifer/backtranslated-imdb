I have always been fascinated by silent films. There is something to see the actors and actresses 100 years ago. Inspired by today's high-tech special effects, I always try to imagine what it was like to watch a particular film during its initial release. It helps to assess the rudeness of early cinema. <br /> <br /> “The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ” is a very charming staging of Pate, originally filmed in 1902, but expanded and finally released in 1905. Imagine A series of famous religious paintings come alive, separated by title cards, and you have a pretty good idea of ​​what this movie looks like. For example, the scene in which Mary and Joseph rest when they run away to Egypt is almost identical to the picture of Luke Olivier Merson “Rest on the way to Egypt” in 1879, right up to Mary, who sits on the famous Sphinx. Although some may find these “living pictures” an unimaginable margin, I found them to be very charming and very nostalgic. <br /> <br /> It seems that the scenery and costumes are right on the stage of the production. life of Christ. Perhaps from the carefully crafted play of the passion of the day. The cast is very theatrical, so large that the close-up of Jesus is almost comical. Again, where others may be concerned about their wit, I was completely fascinated. <br /> <br /> Continued for three years, continuity is not so bad. The biggest shortcomings in the changes in the composition made during this time. The characters of John the Apostle and 12-year-old Jesus change in the middle of the stage, much to the surprise of the audience! <br /> <br /> The best unintentional humor of the film is the scene of the birth of Jesus. The baby literally appears, as if by magic, in a manger between Mary and Joseph. Maybe it was just my mood at the moment when I watched it, but I laughed out loud! If only the birth of a child was so easy !!!! To top it all off, the actress who plays Mary looks bored throughout the scene (in fact, throughout the film), as if this happens every day! Oh, how times have changed! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is so simple compared to today, this is really a beautiful window into the past. I recommend it! <br /> <br />
