This is a movie that you either love or hate. I like it. If you are looking for the unknown, excellent special effects, action, finesse, cynicism, etc., you will not find it in this film. This is a good film, sentimental, positive, inspiring. The film’s characters are Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), a strong and honest man, and Radio (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a mentally retarded person who finds a way to contribute to his world. I think I did not find this film "sentimental garbage", as many did, because it seemed to me very real. I know such people. I have seen athletes who think it's fun to choose vulnerable. I have seen honest people protecting the vulnerable. I have seen people who think that school football is a serious business. I have seen people who know what is really important in life. Any of these people could have been a person I knew. I was laughing; I cried. I left the film, feeling good, remembering that in my world there are people like Coach Jones and Radio. If there are no such people in your people, you may not like the movie. If you don’t like a movie that shows the best side of human nature, you will hate it.
