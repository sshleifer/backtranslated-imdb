*** SPOILERS *** For some strange reason, "Talk Radio" by Oliver Stone, based on Stephen Sigulyar's book "Talked to Death" and the movie star of the movie Eric Boghosyan about the murder in 1984 of Denver's talk show host Alan Berg, never received a confession that it rightfully deserves. The 1988 film was prophetic enough to recognize the underground movement that developed on the farm and in the interior of America. A movement that spawned about seven years later, like an evil and disgruntled Gulf War veteran, Timothy McVeigh, who hates US government action in Wacco Texas, led to his and his friend, Terry Nichols, blowing up the US Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995 which resulted in the death of 168 people, which was the worst terrorist act in the US before that time. <br /> <br /> The film, as far as I know, for the first time, when any major branch of entertainment media mentioned and developed a novel about the rural militia "Turner's Diaries" of the late William L. Pierce, it has since become a classic underground. The Turner Diaries predicts an internal and highly catastrophic terrorist attack, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, at a US government facility located in the FBI building in Washington, DC. <br /> <br /> Dallas radio station, talk show host Barry Barry Champlain, Eric Bogosyan, is the show with the highest rating in the Dallas listening area and is now set to become national. Barry gets his high rating thanks to a sharp mind and abusive behavior when he's on the air. Taking on everyone and avoiding problems, no matter how unpopular or forbidden, Barry became the most listened and hated man on the radio. Barry, being a soulful showman and not thinking that his conversation can lead to violence, retains its abrasiveness for his listeners as his rating rises to the ceiling. But there are those who listen to the audience, mostly ultra-right, who are not too friendly to their face. One of them decides to take matters into his own hands at the expense of Barry. <br /> <br /> Eric Bogosyan played in powerlifting as the tragic Barry Champlain, who in his actions on the radio crossed the line from entertainment to hard reality. Thinking that he was not so important that he was searched for and killed for his opinion on the air, which is the hostility of enemies, he found out too late that there are those who are crazy enough to deal with him outside. Also in the film “Talk Radio”, very young Alik Baldwin as boss Barry Dan, who tries to make him soften his tone, but eventually agrees with his style of talk show, as he kills competitors, not realizing that in the end it is he that he will eventually be killed. <br /> <br /> Both Ellen Green and Leslie Hope are two women in the life of Barry, his ex-wife Ellen, and now the lover and producer of the talk show Laura, who Barry takes advantage of and almost ends up losing both of them at the same time. The 1988 film “Talk Radio” was so ahead of its time that even if you watch it now, in 2005, you still think that it is too disturbing to show it to a too sensitive and delicate American public.
