Will any company PLEASE make a (good +) DVD of this movie! ??? In addition to the wonderful film about relationships and friendship, “Four Friends” is the ONLY film I've ever seen - and I literally spent * years * of my life watching movies! - this reflects the essence of the experience of the 60s (and I was there!): idealism, hope, freedom, confusion, betrayal, and, ultimately, its optimistic, but bitterly-decoupled ending. And all this is done without talking about any of the many upheavals of that era, although many of them have just been touched ... as part of a tapestry. But the story is primarily about the heroes and their friendship for 10-15 years ... and that they survived and deepened, despite the tragedies of this turbulent decade. Absolutely joyful and must-see film ... even if not an old hippie !!!
