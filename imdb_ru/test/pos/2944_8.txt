This film was both interesting and suggestive. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to be moved and tested. Great acting, directing - and that's Canadian for download! This is a movie that families and serious movie lovers can enjoy. Places in Ontario caused such a sense of nostalgia for the era. With so much rubbish and superficial hype being sold these days, it's great to see that someone could maintain an independent click. For any family that has risen to overcome difficulties or obstacles - whether financial or illness - this film is breathtaking! He approaches the idea of ​​the afterlife in a modern way, without using cheap benefits from all the “supernatural” and supernatural themes that have become major in Hollywood and television networks.
