I served as an orderly on the island of Parris in the late 60s, just over 10 years after the "D.I." was shot. I was in some barracks, where they filmed some scenes in the room. I knew many drilling instructors and recruits. I think the film is as close as any other film to showing the life of a recruit and training instructor. Without a doubt, I think this is the best thing Jack Webb has ever done. If you were in the army, you need to watch this movie. It was as it was. This shows how important it is to take a bunch of raw recruits and turn them into people who are ready to defend our country. One feature that struck me is that most of the characters are played by real marines, not actors.
