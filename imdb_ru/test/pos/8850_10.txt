"The Thing" by John Carpenter is undoubtedly one of the best horror films ever made. Unfortunately, as in most Carpenter films, it is also one of the most underrated films critically criticized shortly after its release for an almost pathetic reason. It seems that at that time people were overwhelmed by the idea of ​​a “good” alien. The idea arose after the success of "IT". And the very idea that a film about aliens could deviate from this idea was considered heresy. Human ignorance is a really scary thing, people need to judge films by who they are not, by who they want them to be. <br /> <br /> The thing itself is an interesting study of human paranoia as members. The American Antarctic base reveals the presence of an alien creature (referred to in the film only as a “thing”) that can imitate any form of life. Not knowing who may or may not be a creature, we see how each character reacts to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic, only a slow and gradual immersion into chaos, as more and more people turn out to be ... not entirely human. <br /> <br /> Carpenter succeeds in turning this movie into something much bigger than your average Sci-Fi / horror. There is no "what is behind you?" jumping moments here. Instead, relying on the intense atmosphere of distrust and pre-apocalyptic despair, as well as on some perfectly balanced moments of visual horror, not least due to the impressive effects of the creation of Rob Bottin, he gives us experience not comparable to many other horror films. <br /> <br /> Instead of throwing facts and plot elements in our face, Carpenter offers us a more gradual and delicate approach. Implying a sense of mystery, he gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret what happened in certain scenes, and at the same time gives enough plot to those who do not like interpretation in films. <br /> <br /> Ennio Morricone's assessment works to the end. His minimalistic and depressing sound fits perfectly with the overall tone of the film. Although it was always interesting to me, how would it sound if Carpenter (as you know, he composed all the OST of his films, except this one) did it? The characters, although not so deeply developed, are still remembered for the good actions of the actors, especially Kurt Russell, who plays the “apathetic” apathetic pilot of the R.J. Makredi It is worth noting how his character is transformed in the film. From his neglect of "do not let ...." at first to the attitude towards the unifier and the leader of a group of people who are trying to fight the "thing". But even with that said, there are no false heroics, no moments of "laughter in the face of death" and, of course, there is no comic relief, the film maintains its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last. Speaking about this, here again Carpenter continues his tradition of creating powerful finals. <br /> <br /> Quarter century after the release of "The Thing" does not look outdated. And with the worrying growing use of computer effects, he feels even stronger than before, because he shows the work of life and the dedication of people, not computers. Combined with his openness to analysis, he gives the viewer a lot more reason to watch his second, third, fourth, or ... times. A masterpiece of horror that will never be forgotten.
