This little-known comedy from the hit Ruth Gordon causes admiration. The play-based scenario is spicy, rich and fully undated. Same thing, but I have to underline the work of the lead lady, Irene Dunn. Irene is just gorgeous - as usual - and lights up the screen with every frame she is in (and she has a lot in it, thank God). In addition, the director Vidor gave her some unusual close-ups that are fascinating. What a girl! I do not know of any other Hollywood actress from that era who would have her own versatility and so convincing in every film. Why she is so little known is a mystery. I saw most of her films, and this one was a surprise even to a fan like me. I see everything!
