If you are interested in learning more about such things happening in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called “Outlaws of the Sea” or “Outlaws of the Sea”, which tells how story follows history. The lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. Firstly, many world freighters have dubious registration (nationality), and it is difficult or impossible to enforce international laws when shipowners do not have an office in a real country. Secondly, on many ship lines, there are crews from poor third world countries. Crews often (as illegal immigrant workers) are threatened and harassed with questionable or illegal activities. Thirdly, there is often a language barrier not only between officers and crew, but also among the crew members themselves. The crew is rewarded for their observance and their silence. Fourthly, once having committed a wrongful act, ships can hide in sight with a slightly more fresh layer of paint. In any case, this is an exciting read. <br /> <br /> Awful story, great movie. Does anyone else notice how HBO seems to make the best and most important films? Hollywood is having difficulty releasing a fair amount of Oscar-worthy films in a given year, so several of the top five candidates usually come from Britain. Jerry Bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the evil presentation of Sean Pertwee. I also, as usual, loved Omar Epps.
