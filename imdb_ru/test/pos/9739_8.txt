The brainchild of comic book pioneer Alex Raymond, Flash Gordon, was the progenitor of all science fiction epics. This series is the first time Flash has been brought to celluloid life. Despite the small budget, this is a great space opera. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the fact that the Earth is doomed to apparent destruction, when Planet Mongo rushes into space on the path of collision. Maverick's scientist Dr. Zarkov is heading for an approaching planet on a makeshift rocket ship, convinced that he can do something to stop the fleeing celestial body. He receives last-minute recruits in the form of resourceful athlete Flash Gordon and beautiful Dale Arden. Once they reach Mongo, their problems really begin. They face the mean-spirited Emperor Ming the Ruthless, the conqueror of his world, who has ambitious plans for the Earth. <br /> <br /> The rest of the series revolves around Flash's desperate attempts to save the earth; different alien cultures he encounters; allies he does; the spaceships he flies; the battles in which he fights and the monsters he kills. <br /> <br /> Brilliantly conceived by Raymond, Flash Gordon presents the classic archetypes of legendary myths and fables of antiquity. Echoes of famous fairy tales, such as the saga of Troy and Camelot and Sherwood Forrest, can be seen here. You have a dashing, handsome hero, in an effort to save the kingdom (Flash); Evil King (min); Old sage (Zharkov); Beautiful girl in trouble (Dale); seductive siren (Aura); faithful allies (Thun, Barin, Vultan); Plus monsters, dragons and various little animals. <br /> <br /> Flash is a modern Robin Hood, Jason or Beowulf. Min is Prince John or Aggamemnon. Dale - Helen from Troy, Guenevaver or the Virgin Marion. Zharkov is Merlin or Odysseus. (Or Gandalf) Thun / Barin / Vultan - Gay Men or Knights of the Round Table. <br /> <br /> You understood. <br /> <br /> You can't help but notice how many ideas from Flash Gordon will later appear in Star Wars. Cloud City; Ice World; Forest moon; Scrollable intro text (from the second series); There are others, but you understand the point. The entire science fiction genre is indebted to this timeless classic. <br /> <br /> Buster Crabbe is the perfect action movie hero, and I personally think that he is better at this role than any other action star genre. He also played Buck Rogers and Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton is the embodiment of devilish malice in the role of Min. Of course, today it seems a bit melodramatic, but this is what the audience expected from its bad guys in the 30s. <br /> <br /> Gene Rogers is the love interest of our hero, Dale Arden, and I was so in love with her when I first saw it in childhood. I easily understand why Flash always rushed to her aid. She is a typical good girl to counter tempting manipulations with Aura, the typical bad girl. <br /> <br /> It seemed that the cast was perfect to follow their comic-book colleagues, and despite the silly-looking FX, there were a lot of exciting action on this ground-breaking series. <br /> <br /> Merry bustle and the beginning of the sci-fi genre in the movie.
