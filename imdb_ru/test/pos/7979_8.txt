For a long time, this was my favorite movie about Batman. He had the best cinematography and thrills with two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - along with the always interesting Christopher Walken. However, after the last viewing, he finally slipped in my ratings, and, frankly, now I prefer the last Batman: Batman begins with Christian Bale. <br /> <br /> GOOD - Still, this is still the most intriguing of the last five movies about Batman. Stylish cinematography here is the best of all Batman movies. Director Tim Burton is known for his films with stunning visual effects, as this is a great example. All three characters listed above are very different and very interesting, almost exciting. Of the villains, I preferred the Catwomen, finding her the most fun to watch before and after she changed. The violence here is not exaggerated, as was the case in several other stories about Batman, but it is not boring for one to look at it. As in the first film, Michael Keaton plays the role of Batman / Bruce Wayne perfectly. <br /> <br /> BAD - For a movie based on a comic that kids mostly read, I still think that these first two Batman Movies, both made by Burton, were too dark and profanity was definitely not appropriate . Although, unlike the first film, here the name of the Lord was not used in vain, there was still profanity, and both villains made too many sexual remarks. It would be good if they did not sell this film for children and adults. "Penguin" Danny DeVito is completely rude in places. "Grotesque" I can handle, but who wants "gross." Meanwhile, few people complained about the beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer, playing "Catwoman". In general, too much darkness and a few cheap shots that Christian beats up made me reconsider my earlier high rating of this film. <br /> <br /> In general - incredible visual effects and memorable characters make this the most interesting in “Batman”. The series, but too dark a corner, too rough and too anti-religious bias - everything finally distracted me from half a dozen views of this film. Sorry, but I prefer the movie about Batman. In the end, it's just a cartoon. Most of them would disagree, but I was glad to see how the series lit up after that.
