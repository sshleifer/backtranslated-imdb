Frank Sinatra has appeared in this strange short film from RKO, which is now in the public domain. The film came out around the same time that the war ended, and this is a good call for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Sinatra, who sings on stage. After leaving the scene, he goes into the alley and finds a group of children who choose another because of his religion. Instead of shouting at boys (or helping them in this matter), Sinatra gives a good lesson to civil society on religious tolerance and equates prejudice with fascism. The kids seem to be taught a lesson, but then Sinatra starts singing a song that, honestly (See?), The children would hate. He had a beautiful voice, but unfortunately, I think it diminished the excellent message he gave children about tolerance. This is a case of good communication with too much singing - even if the guy sings Frank Sinatra. It is also an interesting surprise - a good historical artifact that is often overlooked ... plus it is quite touching, even if it seems a little smacking.
