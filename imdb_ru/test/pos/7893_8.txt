If Archie Bunker was armed, he could well have been "Joe." However, “Everything in the family” would be rather short, because the censors would never allow him to go along with the film. Joe is a working class guy, racist and fanatic, and he has a big mouth, especially when he's drunk. One night, he meets a man in a bar, Bill, who drinks to calm his emaciated nerves, after he accidentally killed his drug-addicted daughter's boyfriend, and he misses it Joe. What happens is that Bill's daughter lived with a drug addict, and after an overdose she was taken to the hospital, and he goes through the apartment to pick up her things, but does not expect him to really run into a guy who comes fresh from a big drug deal. . In this fight, the guy accidentally dies, and Bill, of course, does not want anyone to know about it. But he misses it to Joe, and then, when newspapers and TV reports appear, Joe sees them, puts 2 and 2 together, and suddenly this person becomes a hero in his eyes. Later, he contacts him, and Bill, of course, is concerned that Joe is going to blackmail him, but not for the money, he wants to hang out with him. Which, in a sense, is almost worse. Now, Bill's daughter escapes from the clinic where she is located, and slips home, and accidentally overhears what happened, and then is on the run, and most of the rest of the film consists of Joe and Bill, penetrating the "underground" to try find her. This leads to a rather shocking ending, which for me was completely unexpected and ends only on the right or wrong note, depending on your point of view. Something like a decent but vague view of life in the early 70s, mostly from the point of view of working class fanatics, which makes it not for everyone, but it’s not at all a bad movie and worthy of hours. 8 out of 10.
