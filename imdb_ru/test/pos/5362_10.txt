This is the film that they usually made: funny, heart-rending, disturbing, authentic, with convincing performances by people without nose work, boobs, eye work, in other words, real people. Shauna MacDonald is interested in female love, and she is so real that you at least want to hug her. Imagine a real girl in the movie, what's next? Hollywood would hate her because her freshness is a sharp rebuke to every fake star in Tinseltown. This story is just as fun as Sandy Mackendrick's classic whiskey in abundance song, with the dwarf humor of distant Scottish islanders, who intrude outsiders from time to time and enjoy a tiny drama from time to time (the actual intervals between these times are often quite short). Directed by Stephen Whittaker demonstrates the rare ability to handle it perfectly, and it is shocking when he learned that he died before the release of his film, at the age of only 56 years, which was a clear loss for the screen. Ulrich Thomsen perfectly plays the role of a German rocket scientist who, at the end of the 1930s, went to Scarp on Harris Island to build a small rocket to transport postage between the islands. There he falls in love with the charming girl MacDonald, and she reciprocates love. Some amazingly colorful local characters adorn the fairy tale, and the film is admirable. Of course, there is a threat of imminent war with Hitler, and we learn that Hitler executed 1000 rocket scientists who refused to create military weapons, which is a shocking statistic. Tragic love is never far from the eye, but in the review must be sealed lips as to what happens at the end. This film is a great example of what films people in Britain should shoot. But are they released correctly? In a country whose tastes were so spoiled by the reality show, where the disgusting nonentities became national heroes, is there a market for such a film? In the end, there is no rumbling sex, no close-ups of purulent wounds or anybodyâ€™s genitalia, no drugs taken, no pointless celebrities who are about to wander around and want to be looked at and therefore ask yourself to interest the public, which has become so decadent and exhausted that only the most extreme sensations can, for a short time, alleviate the boredom of their meaningless existence. Anyone looking for an antidote to the void of modern Britain can find refuge in this refreshing and honest film.
