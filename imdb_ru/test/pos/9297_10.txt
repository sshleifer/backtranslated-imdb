The Hunter's War for Everything is a weekly show from the guys who brought you CNNNN, and the hunter decides where 5 hunters and Firth deal with important problems for us every week. <br /> <br /> This Show goes beyond just ridiculing politics and television, without fear of robbing Mickey from anyone, whether it’s a counter girl on the subway or even the Australian Prime Minister, and although this may be familiar, let's say on American television. never been so well done. <br /> <br /> Chaser’s war for everything is the smartest, the funniest and, in general, the most interesting show on Australian television, and if you haven’t seen it yet, you should do it yourself.
