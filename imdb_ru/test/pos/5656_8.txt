This is undoubtedly the most terrible black and white war film that I watched; in fact, the only Western director in that time who remotely approached his level of intensity and pure inner strength in his work was Samuel Fuller. By the way, I visited a Kon Ichikawa retrospective at the London National Cinema in September 2002, but I managed to catch only some of his works made between 1960 and 1973. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly equally depressing; nevertheless, he also demonstrates the pleasant touch of black humor everywhere - the “dead man” who wakes up to answer the questionable soldier and again quickly “dies”, a delightfully ironic shoe changing sequence, a dying eccentric telling the hungry hero what part of the body he should eat, and so on. By the way, the script was written by a woman - Natto Vada, the director's own wife! <br /> <br /> Ichikawa is a multifaceted and prolific director, whose reputation may not be as high as it was in his peak years (1956-65), but his direction here is often striking - an amazing sequence of credits (the hero severely condemns his senior officer for having been discharged from hospital earlier than expected!), death surrendering Japanese at the hands of a Filipino woman armed with arms, bombing a hospital (when medical personnel flee to save themselves, leaving wounded soldiers to slip out from shacks to their so limited pace), an automated march in the rain to frustrated soldiers (who also include the aforementioned business with shoes, which actually resembles a similar scene in ALL QUIET AT THE WESTERN FRONT [1930]), a hill dotted with the bodies of soldiers trying to rise on it, the finale, etc. Undoubtedly, one of the main advantages of the film is the amazing cinematography of the inexorable and ruthless dirty landscape. <br /> <br /> The film is known for considering the forbidden topic of cannibalism (almost 10 years before it became the main product). from horror films), but Ichikawa’s approach is not only subtle, but also very effective: meat is actually called “monkey meat”, while the hero is only seen once (and quickly spits out a piece along with most of its collapsing teeth!); Conversely, when a weak junior soldier (played by Mickey Curtis, who, despite his name, was the Japanese pop idol of the time!), Indulges fiercely, the earth is spattered around with blood. <br /> <br /> In addition, Ichikawa recalls that the leading actor practicing the Method, Eiji Funakoshi (whose image, by the way, is unforgettable) arrived at the shooting site at the point of famine - as a result of which production was forced to close for two weeks he did not recover! An insightful Donald Ritchie interview endorses the film's nihilism in relation to basic patriotism, which lies at the heart of such a heartbreaking recent Hollywood fare, like Saving the Private Ryan (1998). <br /> <br /> “Fires on the Plain” is widely regarded as one of his director’s main efforts and from several Ichikawa films that I watched are closest in spirit to him: “Burma Harp” (1956; another war film character, but with a spiritual tone, which is also available on DVD from Criteria) and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION (1958; in fact, during the week devoted to foreign cinema, a couple of years ago they gave a limited theatrical performance at the local level during the week of foreign films) . Personally, I also have a special weak point for the director’s stunningly stylized color extravaganza, Actor's Revenge (1963), which I actually caught twice on NFT in 1999 and the aforementioned 2002 retrospective.
