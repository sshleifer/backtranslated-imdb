Anyone who wants to learn more about the development of skateboarding, should find Dogtown and Z-Boys adequate research material. This is not to be confused with Lords of Dogtown, this pathetic Hollywood attempt to cash in on the success of Dogtown’s initial revival. <br /> <br /> Directed by Stacy Peralta, himself a former Z-Boys, as well as a professional skater and inspirer of the Bones brigade “Bones” of the 80s, and in collaboration with skateboarding photojournalist Craig Staysick, this documentary traces how the group Surfing Children from the mean streets of Southern California (known as Dogtown), who formed the Z-Boys skateboard team (actually there was one girl, Peggy Okey), revolutionized skateboarding. The film contains interviews with almost all Z-Boys (the whereabouts of Chris Cahill is unknown), among which the most noticeable is the bad ass Tony Alva and the youngest Jay Adams, whose talents (along with Perlat) seem to be superior to the rest of the team. (and the Dogtown store), surfboard designer Jeff Ho, Skip Engblum and Craig Stacic. There are also interviews with people like Tony Hawk (obviously), Ian McKay (Fugazi) and Henry Rollins, who were small children in the 70s, when Dogtown influenced skateboarding (skateboarding was a completely different context in previous years, so as the documentary explains.) <br /> <br /> This really shows you not only who the Dogtown team was and how they formed, but also why their style changed not only skateboard stunts (skating became very popular and, thus, gave way to ice skating), but also contributed to the sport (though not in extreme commercialization, as it is today), since it was more than just a passing hobby, as it was before, as these kids who are surfing ended in the early morning, needed ways to spend time eventually go skateboarding. The days of Russ Howell and Alan Gelfand were long over when Dogtown, at least thanks to the advertisements of their skateboarding team, paved the way for a new generation of figure skaters. As Dogtown attracted all the attention, they were able to push skating to the next step. <br /> <br /> This is a great documentary in terms of how this is done, although Stacy Peralta always knew how to do it, even when creating a “Brigade of Bones” mini-films / skates such as “Ban This And Search for Animal Chin. The film, shot by Sean Penn, is accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack, contains many stunning archival videos and many interviews to give you a real idea of ​​who the Z-Boys were and how they left their mark on the skateboard.
