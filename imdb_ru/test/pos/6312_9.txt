This is a very visual film. By this I mean that the dialogue is rare, almost to the extent that it is a silent movie for very long shots, starting with the first shot. <br /> <br /> However, silence is broken by the tremendous sound of the Track, which ranges from discordant staccato-beats to an obsessive mix of violins, interspersed with vocals that sound like dreams. This is a celebration for the ears, as well as for the eyes, one of the earliest visual images is a man walking down the street, so preoccupied with his interest in a slender woman, that he goes into a lamppost: lying in the store ... <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, another movie ?? Love Story (1970) - said that love should never say that you regret. This story turns this idea from different angles, starting with the main character Titta (Tony Sevillo), a seemingly innocuous long-term resident in a luxury hotel somewhere in Switzerland. Every day, week by week, he sits at a coffee table, enjoying the passing world, his cigarettes, his coffee, his solitude. and he has been doing this for ten years. He sits, watches, and once a week he participates in three very amazing events that you learn about when you see this little masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> Love is explored differently, in direct opposition to Titta’s solitude and secrecy : The two elderly residents of the hotel are still deeply in love, but the man wants to die effectively when his time comes, while his long-suffering wife scolds him for cheating on other guests, one of whom is Titta. Now Titta knows about their quarrels, their love, deception of a man, his apologies to his wife and his whining. How? In an amazing and black comedic manner ... one of those unexpected acts that I mentioned. <br /> <br /> But in reality this is not a comedy, although it touches on the idea of ​​a human comedy in Balzac's Meaning: the irony of life and what to do with it. This decision was made by Titta ten years earlier, when he left his wife and began to live in a hotel. From time to time he keeps in touch, and it is clear that he still loves his children (now grown up), and the sadness in his voice speaks volumes. But there is something more than just sadness ... <br /> <br /> Such a life, like Titta, obviously seems to be quite boring, and in fact it is in many respects. However, only when we learn what lies behind his almost fatal facial expression, the horror of his situation strikes the viewer between his eyes. But not before we learn that the bartender Sophia (Olivia Magnani) is very interested in Titta and tries her best to annoy Titta’s interest in her. <br /> <br /> And here Titt begins to fall apart: he finally gives way to her femininity and at the same time reveals the consequences of love again. Ironically, with this, he finally understands what he must finally do with his life, and in the most impressive way. <br /> <br /> I know that all of the above is somewhat mysterious; but, to say more, would spoil the film and the story for you. If you like Italian cinema ?? I like it! ?? I urge you to see it. The game is great; sound track cools the spine; camera work is truly innovative; The direction shows the maturity of this artist. <br /> <br /> I know that I will see this film again and again ...
