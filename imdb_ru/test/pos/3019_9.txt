*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** CELLS / (2000) **** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Do you believe that there is a part of yourself deep inside you think With things you don’t want other people to see? During the session, when I’m inside, I see these things. "<br /> <br /> - Catherine Dean <br /> And we also. “The Cell” is one of the most visually stimulating films of the year - a film about love / hate - either you love it or you hate it. I can understand the reasons why some people do not like this production. With a plot that combines disturbing serial killers and mind exploration, Cage is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. I think this is one of the most exciting films of the year. <br /> <br /> Mark made his debut in the feature film, creating the creative world of rich, vivid images and provocative characters. The filmmakers use every shot. Protosevich came up with ideas for "The Cell" in 1993, when he decided to combine his two main interests: the study of reason and serial killers. Directors such as Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg reportedly influenced him. They will probably be proud of such an imagination. <br /> <br /> The film combines two main narratives: one about the scientific study of the human mind, and the other about the psychopath killing young women for their own sexual pleasure. Catherine Dean (Jennifer Lopez), a children's therapist, is part of a neurological research at the Campbell Center, a research clinic. Because of her sensitive individuality, scientists chose Dean to enter the consciousness of a catatonic teenager in the hope of reviving his brain to awakening. <br /> <br /> A sick, insane serial killer wanders the streets. In an abandoned farmhouse, Starger (Vincent D'Onofrio) locks innocent female victims in a large glass chamber, where he drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. The killer escapes from the FBI every time they approach, until now. Violent capture makes it comatose. FBI seizes his unconscious body. Unfortunately, he has already prepared the camera with his last victim. After forty hours, the chamber will fill with water, and Starger will be the only person who knows the whereabouts of his victim. <br /> <br /> The FBI takes this situation to the Campbell Center, where Catherine comes to Starger’s head, hoping to locate her last victim before the camera fills with water, sending the woman to a watery grave. <br /> <br /> Sci-fi fragments of this story were based on both real science and theoretical fiction. neurological mapping and synaptic transfer systems. The assumption takes a lot of time to develop, but it is worth it. It is contrived, but it does not matter. The film makes us believe. However, even if you do not suspend disbelief, visual seduction creates an attractive environment for pleasure. <br /> <br /> According to the film’s notes, Mark Protasiewicz was happy to work with a director named Tarsem, because they both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for his attention to detail, stunning artistic guidance and highly developed ability to tell a story. “When I wrote The Cell,” explains Protosevich, “when I worked, I surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of the artist’s paintings or photographs. So I think visually, and Tarsema is a very visual director. a similar visual reference system that provides very smooth collaboration. "<br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio gives the film the main support, and no actor could achieve his character better. He provides a mysterious, exciting and attractive presentation." I think my character, in a way , he is locked up in himself ", - D'Onofrio thinks. He also researched the psychology of serial killers to help him unfold under the character's surface. His deep preparation for the play pays off well. <br /> <br /> Although actors, writers and directors are doing miracles with his stuff, real honor belongs behind the scenes with the film's talent. Photography director Paul Laufer, production designer Tom Foden, costume designer April Napier, special effects coordinator Clay Pinney and visual effects manager Kevin Tod Haug. They embody the “Cell” world. This is an extraordinary world worthy of several views. Some movies you watch, others you experience. The “cell” belongs to a later category. <br /> <br />
