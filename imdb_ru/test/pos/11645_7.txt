Before watching this film, I suggest the viewer to remove all expectations that the victims of the crimes described will receive equal treatment and respect as a criminal. There were many films about victims of crime. This story is about the killer. <br /> <br /> The Walking Dead find realism in the simplicity of the story: there are no lawyers who are ready to save William Poncelet, and there are no dramatic turns of history. The film is not trying to put it in a good light; he is guilty, he is disgusting, racist and was responsible for heinous murders. Given all this, we are asked to do something very difficult: to look at him as a person, despite his crimes. Thus, the film challenges the notion that the death penalty provides "justice." Regardless of whether you are in favor of or against the death penalty, the film raises questions about whether the perpetrator can find atonement, injustice in the justice system and the relevance of the death penalty. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon played well and Sean Penn. In particular, the last moments of the film show the true depth of Penn's abilities.
