In the end, it becomes clear that the killers threw the murder weapon in Mrs. Colomboâ€™s car, and that was in the police ballistic laboratory. <br /> <br /> But where did the gun come from under the hood used in the demonstration? Didn't the killers clean out the stuff under the hood? Did they have a whole week? Or did the Colombo cops copy the camera / pistol under the hood used in the demonstration? How did they do it without hacking the car? Perhaps that is why at the end of the murder seemed surprised. But how could Columbo reproduce its camera / gun device and calibrate it to a key chain? Colombo must have returned the ballistics pistol and put it under the hood of the car, and it was very lucky that the rest of the device with the camera was still there and transmitted. 10/10 will show this apparent conspiracy error at the end.
