Personally, I treat the "Egyptian" in an exceptionally favorable light. <br /> <br /> He was introduced to a well-known Australian film commentator and critic by the name of Bill, known for his insight and wide vision of people. and places and especially movies. This film was perfect for Bill, and I began to appreciate his comments and enthusiasm for this film, which appeared more and more when I watched it, because I was literally drawn into it, minute after minute, after his opening comments, during my initial view many years ago. <br /> <br /> For me it was a promotion, layer by layer, within half an hour, in an intriguing and exciting production! Yes, I know about his shortcomings! But it was so tempting ?? Is a young man of idealism learning from his father? The peasant treated as trash in his suffering ?? Opportunistic friend, although flawed, but nevertheless beloved by his friend, the main character of Sinuta ?? and, of course, also a vicious hero, like many people in all societies and at all times - but dear and worthy of love! Yes, I believe in the Christian God, but I also recognize the rights and respect that ANY person with a kind heart should have who will not or will not disrespect the rights of his neighbor without a good reason. Thus, I support this film and its idea of ​​a man of good heart and conviction in his faith in the sun god to whom he was betrayed. Such people will always be welcome in my vision of the world, and, I hope, in many other aspects. <br /> <br /> Also, the drama in the next film, which I watched often, is as true as it touched my heart and soul. Of course, as it seems, it infuriated the critics in his era. It is fascinating, watching the struggle, sorrow and love of Sinuta, the doctor! When I watch it again, I always remember my friend at heart, Bill, a film critic who dared to resist ALL critics who had spoiled him a long time ago. Has he added criticism of too many critics ?? that they make statues in honor of stars, on the screen or in history, but they do not make statues in honor of critics! And besides all this, I am reminded with each viewing of the play SUPERB & TOUCHING, a beautiful and well-presented drama that was not just relevant for the 1950s or some bygone era. It was intended for YOU and I in time and in any place, for every man, woman and child, as well as for their personal aspirations for love and freedom and overcoming obstacles to misunderstanding and gross injustice and tragedy that appeal to people of simple faith. religions, which seems to be too much regarded as the cause of war! Take a break from invitations or unjust violence, from fanaticism and condemnation of attacks on others, unjustly executed, and consider the advantages of this proposal. Neither the god of the sun, nor the power that proves again and again that it is so transient ... let this outstanding film overwhelm you like waves on the beach, like the fleeting hands of time ?? how life was supposed to be. And perhaps you will find yourself in his world of possibilities! Lost offers no more! 9.9 out of 10!
