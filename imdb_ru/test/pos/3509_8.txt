The cover of VHS says it all: "Without a doubt, the most powerful film of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre." I'm a big fan of the 70s and 80s slashers, and I must say that I agree 100%. The characters are believable, the actors have excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as a forester). There is a twisted atmosphere, which only TCM has, a striking soundtrack that reflects the emotions and locations that are most beautiful in horror history. This is supposed to be one of the most beautiful horror films of all time! Jeff Lieberman as the director of this 1981 low-budget film does an excellent job with Blue Sunshine, Wrong Turn, and he must be one of the most underrated directors in the film industry today.
