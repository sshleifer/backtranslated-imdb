I found the movie “Don't Look in the Basement” very good, with some wonderful characters. This is a young psychiatric nurse named nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotic) who is about to start work in an isolated psychiatric asylum. There she meets a variety of characters, including Dr. Geraldine Masters, who is in charge of asylum after one of the patients killed Dr. Stevens, the hospital owner, by hitting him with an ax. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters in the film are Mrs. Chillingham (Rea McAdams), a very funny little old woman, nymphomaniac Allison, and Sam (Bill McGee), a young dark-skinned guy who walks all day, as if in the world time. The film was a film with a very low budget, but it was still really great. I know it was on the “Video Nasties” list back in the 80s, but I didn’t think that there was a lot of blood in it, although there were indeed some disturbing feelings in it. RECOMMENDED A LARGE FILM !!!.
