At 2:37, a high school student commits suicide. It is not shown who deprived them of their lives or the reasons are known, time returns to the beginning of the day. From here we follow six individual students; Marcus, Melody, Luke, Stephen, Sarah and Sean. Each student struggles with his moral dilemmas, reaching a boiling point, ending one by one. <br /> <br /> Having lost a friend as a result of suicide and having experienced his own suicide attempt, writer / director Murali K. Talluri created an exciting drama focused on teenage life and the terrible act of suicide. Suicide was a topic that was kept in the shadow, 2:37 - an attempt by Talluri to uncover it. If you were touched by suicide or someone who has, 2:37 it becomes harder to see. <br /> <br /> Talluri also copes with everyday adolescent life crisis with a difficult and difficult subject. With sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship Talluri manages and shows them extremely realistic. The talent of Talluri is a factor in his subtlety. He respects his topic and the problems through which everyone will ever suffer. Sometimes he approaches the documentary, he has such a painful realism; Interviews with each character stuck together in the film only reinforce this. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is very similar to the film “The Elephant” by Gus Van Sants. Although the essence of each film is different, both are engaged in teenage life. Like Sant, Talluri uses long tracking frames, the time from which is passed back and forth to show the interaction of each character from different points of view. The decisive moment for the Elephant was its ethereal atmosphere. With the help of free conversation, a small character development and long tracking shots, Sant created an exciting and fascinating atmosphere of approaching fear. Although this fear remains at 2:37, the emotional connection with the characters reaches a higher level, which Santa could not achieve. Over time, the fragility of each of the characters spreads, dragging you along with your emotional rollercoaster. <br /> <br /> The real hit in this film is the inevitable suicide predicted at the very beginning. The most difficult part of this scene is the total invasion and discomfort that we experience when viewers watch someone’s life end in a terrible way. Although many films that have shown suicide obscure the action or romanticize the action. Talluri shows the pain and agony associated with this act, and that this is not the best solution. With the unknowns in the lead roles and their first lead roles; Theresa Palmerch, Frank Sweet, Joel Mackenzie, Marnie Spillane, Charles Baird and Sam Harris all demonstrate a huge talent and promising acting career. <br /> <br /> Persuasive and exciting, 2:37 is a movie not to be missed.
