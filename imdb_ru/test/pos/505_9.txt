In the ever-growing genre of cinematic adaptations of comics, Blade is undoubtedly one of the most conscious and most faithful (in general) in relation to the source material ... given that the character has a nearly 30-year history of comics since its debut as a backup figure in the "Tomb of Dracula", the author took almost all the characters and plot elements from the history of the comic. While the changes were inevitably made, the thinnest moments of the film revolve right above any criticism. Do not allow any of your friends to tell you otherwise: “Blade” is one beautiful movie. If this sounds too comical to you, Stanley Kubrick is a snob, that's because it should be. Deal with it, but don't be upset about it.
