I also found the Oppenheimer a brilliant series and one of the best deals on American PBS. As I recall, David Suchet was particularly effective in the role of Edward Teller, and the overall concept was amazingly good. The only reason the series does not rate a full 10/10 is the low cost of production in some areas. As I recall, the actual content is absolutely first-class. <br /> <br /> Oppenheimer mini-series will be released in the UK on July 31! This will be the Region 2 / PAL set, but it may seem that the Region 1 / NTSC set will be on sale soon. <br /> <br /> If you have a universal player in the US, you can order the series right now from Amazon UK. <br /> <br /> http://tinyurl.com/znyyq <br /> <br /> Huzzah !!
