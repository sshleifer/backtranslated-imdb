I first saw this film in 1980, and he touched a cord that reminded me of a more innocent time. The initial narration, music and pictures of Norman Rockwell set the tone for me. You either love the movie or hate it. Ian Michael Vincent was the best at all times and portrayed Corporal Marion Hagepet in the most innocent and touching way. This film is one of my all-time favorites, but unfortunately it is no longer on DVD or VHS. The ending was great too. John Hancock did an amazing job to capture the essence of time.
