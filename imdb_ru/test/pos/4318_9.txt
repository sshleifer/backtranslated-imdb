a very good episode, though not as destructive as the end of season 1. The idea to make it a Desmond memory worked very well, and Henry Ian Cusick was fantastic, perhaps showing the best performance of this entire series, but my only complaint is Michaelâ€™s storyline, very similar to the plot, and after three minutes of the previous episode, I thought that there would be more plot in it. But Ciusix's character strength and performance dragged him out. plot development, as always, left more questions than answers, for example, who they are, something that we still don't know, and where they take Jack, Sawyer and Kate. What was this white light, what effect did it have? Locke, Eco and Desmond are dead? how the hatch is destroyed around them. If so, this will be a serious mistake, because these three are the most interesting characters, and the series will suffer without them, and Terry O'Quinn was fantastic in both episodes as Locke. A suitable ending for a better series than the first.
