When I first saw this film about 6 months ago, I found it interesting, but a bit more. But it stuck with me. This interest grew and grew, and I wondered if my initial boredom and reaction was more related to the actual quality of VHS, and not to the film itself. I bought a DVD box Criterion, and it turned out that I was right the second time. Alexander Nevsky is a great movie. This is uplifting, and I am sure that it has achieved its main goal: propaganda against the Germans. <br /> <br /> This is the most common criticism against this film and against Eisenstein, that he is just propaganda and nothing else. It is not true. He is a terrific film artist, one of the most important, no matter who lives. By now, the world is far enough outside of Joseph Stalin, so that one can watch Eisensteinâ€™s films as art.
