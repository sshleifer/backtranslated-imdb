a completely brilliant film from the CKY team ...... (no donkey guys ..... Johnny Knoxville, Chris Pontius, Steve-oh, etc. are not included in this movie <br /> <br />) . Well, so maybe they are not the best actors, but this is not what you call a serious film ... but, hey, it's fun here, and watching it is completely funny. who does not want to see Don Vito dressed as a Roman emperor! <br /> <br /> If you like viva la bam or CKY, you definitely need to ............ Almighty HIM, CKY and others ...... see additional features on DVD especially with the free Brana <br /> <br /> Chinese rap number two ...... seriously funny ..... ...... check out this movie ........ you are not regret it ......... 10/10
