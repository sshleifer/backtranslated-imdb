One of my favorite movies. I love horses, I like happy endings, and I love Walter Mattau. I miss him and am glad that I have such a wonderful film to remind me why it was so wonderful. Watch it with your children (or with your horse). <br /> <br /> History of an old trainer with heavy boots, with children, and his failure If you have ever had or appreciated racing, you will appreciate the storyline from dirt to wealth. This may be slightly lower than "Seabiscuit", but not by much. The story is the same, with the exception of the quarter horse version. Well acted, the correct racing conditions and equipment, and good racing scenes. Do not believe my word, take it and make a decision.
