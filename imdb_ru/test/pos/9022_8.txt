I love this film. I first saw it about 10 hours ago, and I had to rewind it so that my sister could watch it. This movie is so funny. Twice I laughed so hard that my sides hurt. I did not expect to see the movie so funny; I really wanted to see it only because of Laura Fraser in it. I first saw her in Titus, and this is also a terrific movie. <br /> <br /> Like other reviewers, too many people are waiting for an exciting movie. You will not get it. What you get is humor, sweets and the opportunity to ask yourself what your ideal partner would look like if you could create them. You may also wonder what it is like to be stuck in the body of the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous sequence involves the fact that Justine first sees himself as a naked man. I was delighted. <br /> <br /> I swear, this film is the most creative teen movie I've ever seen, and now it's my favorite. <br /> <br /> Just remember why the films were originally created; as entertainment, not philosophy in motion. Remember this, and you will have a great time watching virtual sexuality.
