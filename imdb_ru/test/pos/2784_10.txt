The young Frenchman uproots himself by becoming an Erasmus exchange student in Barcelona, ​​and returns as the best man. Sounds boring? Never! The film is filled with bright people, and all of them are stereotypes (Briton and her racist brother, sexually liberated Dane, ultra-organized German, ...). In this case, however, stereotypes are made brilliantly. You feel that you know such people (I know an arrogant doctor and his trophy wife, and they are just like the characters in the movie!), They feel like REAL PEOPLE! Watch this movie and enjoy subtitles!
