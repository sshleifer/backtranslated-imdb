... as valuable as the grave of King Tut! (Well, maybe this is NOT VALUABLE, but it’s worth a search if you can). I noticed that no one has commented on this film for several years, and I hope that the new publication will trigger some new comments. This is a film about which I remembered only fragments from my childhood, and I saw it recently when I was tired of waiting for Fox to honor my past and was searching for a Korean DVD (in English, but with irremovable Korean subtitles). I will not go into a detailed description of the plot - suffice it to say that when I first saw it in the proper widescreen format, I stayed away from the perspectives and scope of the film. Matt paintings still hold, and palace decorations are really breathtaking. But it’s the small details that give this film depth and wealth, allowing you to see the lifestyle of both the poor and the elite of Egypt. Bazaars, shacks, docks, embalming houses and taverns are as fascinating as the Pharaoh’s throne room. While mistakes abound (especially the dynastic continuity), the details are more thoroughly investigated than the vast majority of Hollywood films. Visually, this is not without its drawbacks - the interiors are often too overly lighted and colorful to easily blend in with the exteriors. Nevertheless, it is a film that deserves to be as bold in the small as in general. Boring? In parts absolutely. Replayed? Underacted? Yes, both - although "understated" may be a more appropriate description. Too long? Definitely not. I would like them to spend more time with the experience of Xinuha in the House of Death and among the Hittites, and less with his “romance” with Nefer. Historically inaccurate? Yes, that too, but so was Shakespeare. No one punishes him for it. I appreciate historical accuracy as much as the next guy, but ultimately, remember that cinema is a theater, not a history lesson.
