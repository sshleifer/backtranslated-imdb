SO well, acting, directing, directing there may not be the best, but the dancing, movement, heat and passion in this film are definitely the best (well ... at least for me ^^), it really touched me , inspired me to learn to dance. I even specifically registered on this site to vote for him and support this film. for this movie, I literally gave goosebumps when I watched it. I like it. Jennifer Gray is so pretty! Patrick is so sexy there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The first thing I will do tomorrow on my way to the university is to go to the video store and buy a copy of it, look again and again, until I get old and I can no longer dance with the film. before i need to learn all the dancing dancing there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
