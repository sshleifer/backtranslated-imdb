Although I can't say if Larry Ham has seen any old cartoons or not, I think that writing cartoons, card files and some comics means something. <br /> <br /> For fans from the old cartoon, this is largely a continuation of the same, with the exception of a few new characters - and the crazier Cobra Commander. <br /> <br /> We still have all the old favorites, but on a personal note, one thing that has always annoyed me is the “duke for storming” when there are many other * officers * instead. <br /> <br /> The aftermath of the battle is also similar to the old series; The main trick here seems to be the CGI. In general, this is not bad, if not too much.
