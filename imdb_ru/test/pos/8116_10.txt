I have never seen such a film; did not plan to see it, but it was worth the turn of the TV channel. I mostly watch science fiction films, but I would be more than happy to add this to my collection. It begins as a one-sided film with a simple love triangle, then it becomes something slightly different (I can’t say more about it. But two guys and one girl are involved in it. Just not what you expect). In addition, Hugo Weaving from The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings starred in this movie in a role that I did not expect ... a very funny guy. This movie is played HERE on TV, but if you don’t have satellite TV, you should rent it. So try it; You will not be disappointed.
