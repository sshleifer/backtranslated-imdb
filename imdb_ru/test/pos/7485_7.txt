We were taken to a store where Nick looks at the coins in his hand, trying to figure out whether he can get a special cup of 20 ounces of coffee at a price of 20 cents, which comes with free baking. He decides to go for a larger size, which, of course, is more expensive, and this does not give him the right to a cake. He tries to argue with the Indian clerk in the registry that supports her. With her this is a matter of principle. Well, Nick gets annoyed that he is not getting his way, and he continues to kill her. <br /> <br /> The tone of the story is set from the very beginning. The people we are going to meet are not good guys. There is Nick, his girlfriend Dallas and their partner Billie Hill. They are drug dealers. Nick decides to visit Casey, his friend and former accomplice in Houston. He wants to make another deal, and then go to Paris with a profit from the sale of drugs, which he brings. What he doesn't understand is that Casey went straight. He is an architect, married to Christine and wants to adopt a child. <br /> <br /> Casey does not appreciate his former friend who brought drugs into the house. He decides to get rid of things by lowering them into the kitchen sink. The late arrival of Ice, the pizza delivery boy, takes Casey by surprise. This man was sent to kill him, but before that, Casey brings some weed to share with Ice, who has a talent for raping. <br /> <br /> It is at this moment that Dr. Jarvis, the man from the receiving agency, arrives. Casey's statement reveals a two-year gap, which he cannot justify. Jarvis begins to doubt the alleged father. At this time Dallas makes an entrance. She is a woman who asks questions to point-blank, how and when she demands to know if Jarvis likes to watch porn. Aroused Jarvis eventually walks away in irritation. Dallas decided to seduce Casey at all costs. The store has a surprise when Billie enters the picture, and he doesn’t like what he sees when shooting Dallas in the process. Billy Hill also came to Casey, but he was overpowered. <br /> <br /> Casey visits Kasarov, who wants his money from Nick; in his absence, he will take it from Casey. Kasarov gives a deadline, and Casey decides to outwit all these low lives. All parties come to his house at the appointed hour, and different factions will take care of themselves. In the end, Casey has the best plan, which includes Christina's reception for staying in Paris. <br /> <br /> Never having heard about Thursday, we were involved in it because of his talent. Skip Woods managed his own material. It seems to be a film with good intentions. From time to time the film recalls other people of the same genre, not a sin in any form or form, which seems to be the main objection to the negative comments left here on the IMDb website. To begin with, “Thursday” shows the witty Skip Woods, who went to write other films, in particular, “Swordfish”. The script is divided into chapters with suggestive titles related to the action. Denis Lenoir works wonders mainly with an internal photograph. <br /> <br /> Thomas Jane makes an excellent contribution to the film with his Casey. Although it is difficult to imagine, he overcame the odds and did something of himself. This actor, who was recently seen on the Hung television series, is one of those actors that we don’t get tired of watching. Dark-haired Aaron Eckhart is a long-awaited addition to any movie. He is a fat criminal who does not show any redeeming qualities or something close to repentance and does not hesitate to involve his former friend in his scheme. James LeGros has nothing to do. The same goes for Polina Porizkova, a magnificent creature who only distracts, or an afterthought to add a sexy angle. We liked Glenn Plummer, which looks like Ice. He does poor listening on the phone. Michael Jeter and Mickey Rourke also appear.
