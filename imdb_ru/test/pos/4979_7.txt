John Parrish is a former Union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to Wilkinson at Anchor. The problem is that the price offered is too low, and when they start to intimidate Parrish and his employees, his temper changes, especially when things are going for a cruel turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> Initially, after seeing this, I had a feeling of disappointment, mainly because of the cast that was involved. When you star in the same film with Edward J. Robinson, Glenn Ford and Barbara Stanwyk, you hope that they get a plot and script in which they can succeed. Unfortunately, they have no chance to produce Western classics worthy of multiple revisions, or is it my excessive expectation that makes it a bad service? Well I slept on it and decided to think further about the picture. I think that yes, it would be fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work, this, when all is said and done, the plot that was finished for all that it costs, and then for some. But Cruel People is still a very useful film, despite the missed opportunities evident in the production. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford in the role of Parrish is as cool as the nose of the Eskimos, and it's always great to see Babs Stenwick playing the bitch because she is good at it. While Eddie J, when someone gets used to the fact that he is in the west, is good at what is written below. Robinson, who intervened at the last minute when Broderick Crawford got his first choice as Lee Wilkinson, was injured. He has changed the most among creators, even supporting such characters as devilish Wade Matlock {grinning delight from trustworthy Richard Djekel and Judith Wilkinson (radiant Dian Foster) get something that leaves an impression. But be that as it may, that very “bad” Robinson boy is, at least, remembered for all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> Without being ashamed of fighting and shooting a gun, Rudolph with his twists and almost Shakespearean tragedies The film Mate rises above the mundane, and all this is perfectly framed by the stunning cinematography of Burnett Guffey. "Lonely Pine" in Alabama has been used in many western paintings {see “Seven men from now” to see another great example of its use), but here Guffy really succeeds and manages to dazzle his eyes at every step. “Cruel people” is not a great Western picture, and perhaps a better director than Mate could really give the adaptation of Donald Hamilton's “Big Country” that you can be proud of. But for every little thing and annoyance that I personally had with it, I found two more reasons to really truly love it, so that it would be, it is recommended, for sure. 7/10
