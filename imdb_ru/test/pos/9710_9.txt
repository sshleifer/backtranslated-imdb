Yes. Bam cried a couple of times, like Englund. And, most likely, you too. The whole cast is back in action, and Knoxville has become the true leader of this gang of entangled mentally retarded (I mean it at its best). At first, I thought that maybe Bam or Steve-O were the main guys ... no, Johnny was the main person now. Don't get me wrong, everything, and I mean that in this movie everyone is great! From the very beginning, you laugh, and believe me, do not intend to rest with this smile. I personally think that the film definitely has better moments than the first one. You know, when you go to the theater, and you kind of do not want to put great hopes on it ... well, this film destroys all expectations. If you love Jackass, you can go for it with gigantic expectations. It doesn't matter that you laugh at your ass. If you are not laughing, the reason is most likely that someone has a gun on his face telling you if you are laughing, dying, or perhaps the sound of your laugh bothers you or the highest probability that you ate Jack Sh! for breakfast and Jack left town. All I have to say is to prepare myself to have a sore face after the film. :)
