This is an extremely fascinating series that plays well and portrays a sensitive subject with great magnificence. We are following Michael Or as an undercover agent for the FBI Darwin, intending to enter a terrorist cell headed by Farik (Oder Fehr). The series is very well written, and there are enough plot twists in it so that you sit on the edge of your seat and wait for what happens next. <br /> <br /> Michael Or, by my definition, one of the best actors I have seen as a portrait of a secret agent. Icy cold outside, but still a good man, trying his best to keep his head afloat during a very emotional rollercoaster ride on which the FBI made him stand up. Oder Fehr, on the other hand, comes from a guy who can fit into any social scenario. Large and strong, but still able to disappear in the gray mass, if necessary. Very authoritative and extremely cunning. The way these two communicate on the screen is nothing short of exciting. <br /> <br /> The way the story develops and the level of detail that the script offers makes the whole story extremely plausible and also very true to life. would suggest. This is so great that you feel insecure, not knowing what can happen in real life. We read about terror every day, and here we are given a good glimpse into the underworld, about which most of us know very little. <br /> <br /> This is a series that will surely make you come back, sitting on the edge of your seat, just waiting for the next weeks episode. In my eyes, this is a confident winner, and I have no problems with the statement that this series is on my list of the best of all time.
