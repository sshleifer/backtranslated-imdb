Hey, what do you expect from a movie with a very low budget!?!? Although I have not seen Dahmer (2002), I can say that after the media reports about Jeff, this is a fairly accurate description. I studied the case of Geoffrey Dahmer and found out everything I could about this man. This is a low-budget film, but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. If you can go through the blood and see what underlies the history of the sick mind. I like this movie! Just get ready for a low budget and no blood. This is a story that is visible through the eyes of a murderer, his actions and thoughts from childhood until his arrest. My favorite phrase: “If they bother to look at the back seat, it could save many lives.” Enjoy!
