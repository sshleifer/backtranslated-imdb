This is a terrific movie, and if you have not seen it yet, you should go to the video store and rent it. First, the cast is excellent. He has not only current stars, such as Ryan Philip and Billy Bob Thornton, but also stars from previous years, such as Judge Reinhold. It also has numerous cameos by actors like Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson and Jamie Lee Curtis. Secondly, the story was pretty good. It was interesting how they took the plot for the stoner film and almost made it dramatic. He accepts the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving him a comic face, as in Half Baked, he has a real life lesson, such as Traffic. So watch this movie, if you are a stoner, he will give you an idea of ​​what you like, if you don’t use drugs, he will give you a more realistic look at drugs than any of the parties wants.
