This 1-hour 30-minute inner joke is best understood by Catholics, the number one religion of self-made comedians around the world. This is not to say that he cannot stand on his own, which makes that the film is not without flaws that he has received. Technical problems, mainly: the belief that in 1998 digital was the answer, when in fact it was in its infancy - beta beta, if you want, and re-mastering will never improve it. For the love of God, Hal ... please take yourself Red. Or three. <br /> <br /> If you like Hartley films, of course, you'll like it. I liked it because I liked Grim / Fool, and the advantage of retrospectives was added: I couldn't help but notice the alarming prophecy itself, an airliner hovering overhead, used as a precursor of Armageddon in this 1998 film. As if Cheney got the whole idea from Hal. This is true - Hartley moves his players into the camera, as if it were the House of Commons, just one part of the trick that needs rest. After all, we already pay attention to the actors, and the script is alive. Not a very good letter, but ... ardent. Can I use the word ardent? Purposeful, intelligent, not indulgent. <br /> <br /> Absolutely love PJ Harvey in this, of course, I will love her anywhere. Oddly enough, if Helen Mirren needs youth, she should look for Harvey and bring a bottle of blond.
