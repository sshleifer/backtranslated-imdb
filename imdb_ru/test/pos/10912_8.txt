Beautifully built and brilliantly played comedy. In the cast, there is no person who would not justify himself (or himself) with cheerful honors. However, the real star of the film is the invisible director Frank Oz, who brings to this farce all the sensitivity and wit of the madcap that he led to the meetings of Miss Piggy and Kermit the frog. This is a movie not to be missed.
