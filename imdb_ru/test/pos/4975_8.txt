This is one of my favorite westerns. What a cast! Glenn Ford plays his part in his usual soft, controlled, but firm manner. Ford plays one of the smaller ranches in the shadow of a mighty anchor ranch that wants to swallow up the whole territory. Edward J. Robinson plays the crippled patriarch of the anchor ranch, and Barbera Stanvik plays his cunning intrigue. This western has a lot of action, which is impressive, the scenery is amazing, the photo in the mailbox is breathtaking, and the soundtrack is stereo! I would say that this western had an impressive budget. Looks expensive. One of a series of great Westerns Glenn Ford.
