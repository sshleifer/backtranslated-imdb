For those who have problems with naughty, crazy or restless children, this is a very important program. This is simply the best documentary behavior program, not only for hints, but also for transformations. Pretty attractive Joe Frost - Supernanny, with fifteen years experience working with nannies, she now has a program in which she shows a family where children misbehave, very, very bad. Frost is a nanny who does not allow children to win. In each episode, they have small children who are insane and very, very disobedient, for example. throwing things, constantly swearing, beating relatives and parents, and many other terrible experiences. But in each episode, by the end of the show, the parents turn (with the help of Frost) from small monsters into cute children. It's great when the transformations are successful, Joe Frost is a great Supernanny. He was nominated for a National Television Award for the most popular actual program (twice). It was number 15 in the “100 Greatest Television Pleasures” of 2004. Very good!
