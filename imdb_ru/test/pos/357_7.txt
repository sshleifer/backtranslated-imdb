I would strongly disagree with the previous lame comment. I watched it, not expecting too much from him. It is a fact that the actors were excellent, especially the leading teenage girl. The dark sides of them all passed, everything was confused in an unobvious way. There was a main stream that ran through the film of teenage fear and sexuality. The role of the serial killer was also played well, since you felt that he went through what they had as a child. That this film is a strong drama / thriller. Yes, I would agree that they do not make the obvious, but you could have tied up with spoiled teenage heads, they did what they did, and it is plausible. Also a nice dark ending, instead of which one could so easily give up on happy. The attention to detail in the film was fantastic. I am very good solid 7 out of 10. A bit slow, but sometimes allows the thinking person to see where the characters come from.
