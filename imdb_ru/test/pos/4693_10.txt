This HTV series is beautiful. I highly recommend watching the movie. It has everything you need: a wonderful script, strong characters, beautiful landscapes and an exceptional atmosphere. Add some ambient from Clannad and you will get an unforgettable picture. I like all the HTV adventure films I've seen: “Return to Treasure Island”, “Smuggler”, “Adventurer”, but Robin Sherwoodsky surpasses them all. I would like to thank the entire film crew of HTV and Richard Carpenter, in particular, for giving me a lot of adventures and impressions. I have a DVD release in my small movie collection. I am very sorry that such films are no longer made.
