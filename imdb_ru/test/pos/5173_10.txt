My choir Santa Lucia was selected to participate in this film. All 100 plus. When it came time to make a film, I was asked to choose only 10. Oh my goodness. We had a little girl who went early to take off her tonsils because she wanted to be in the movies. Elections were hard to make. The people of Georgetown are just as beautiful as the people they show in the film. Gracious, kind, faithful. The city sponsors the annual Christmas market in the first two weekends of December each year. I was there this year, and it was wonderful. The city is beautiful, and people try to make it magical. The city appears today the same as during the filming of the film. A great merit of a historical society that works hard to preserve historical value. The principal, who was turned into a charter school, received an award from the Colorado governor for volunteers.
