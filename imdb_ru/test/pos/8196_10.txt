After seeing the film several times, I found so many subtle touches and emotions in the dialogue. Jing Ke, Assassin has become one of the favorite movie heroes of all time. This beautiful Chinese actor speaks more with his own eyes and with his saving of words and movements than any American actor with a big screen today. Qin, the Emperor, is magnificent, because he makes the audience believe in the goodness of his heart, only to cause the most cruel acts on the people around him. The promises he makes with incredible passion and broken by an evil fist. Gong Li, like in almost every movie I've ever seen her, is fantastic. Her domination on the screen is so elegant and emotionally charged. <br /> <br /> If you couldnâ€™t tell, I liked this movie. <br /> <br />
