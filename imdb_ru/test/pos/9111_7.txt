When I first heard that Jack Black and Kyle Gass would make a film about their band, I was shocked! I love their music and I hoped that this film would be really funny! Now that I have watched it, I cannot say that these hopes were not fulfilled, but I think I expected more. The film is full of great music Tenacious D, and I really enjoyed listening to it all. There are many great jokes, and I just love the story, at least in the first place. I don't like the way the movie ends. The ending is very sharp, and, in my opinion, they could extend it a little more. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this is a good movie to watch! Anyone who loves rock music should watch it! It makes you laugh!
