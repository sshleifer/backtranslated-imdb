GoldenEye is a masterpiece. The storyline is amazingly depicted, the characters are beautifully animated, and the weapons are tight. The storyline is so interesting, even when you complete each mission, to get more levels, you need to beat them on a higher difficulty. And multiplayer is true. You choose the weapon you want to play with and then play. I and my three friends, along with my brother, always play Goldeneye. If you do not have this game, I suggest you buy it.
