I would hope so, and how can I get involved? <br /> <br /> This is a classic film, full of laughter, adventure and starry roles of the 80s! <br /> <br /> What happens when you Assemble a group of athletes and amateurs, a group of controversial nerds, a group of losers and a couple couselors? <br /> <br /> Lots of laughter that will make you ask for more! <br /> <br /> David Naughton acts in the role of Adam, the leader of the “yellow team,” a kind and fashionable college consultant who helps students with everything from the classes they want to the first dates. <br /> <br /> His sworn enemy is Harold the Leader of the Blue Team, played cheerfully by Stephen Furst from the Babylon Five, the useless son of a rich former student jockey with enough trophies to envy any hall of fame. <br /> Contrast these two with each other and add "red team", "white team" and "green team", an incredible "look" in the observatory, the consequences of cheating in miniature golf, a super tour of the Pabst B beer factory lue Ribbon and the hated old mistress among other adventures, and you have everything you need to remember for the night! <br /> <br /> Look for Michael J. Fox, Eddie Dizen and director Andy Tennant. In one of the latest films in which he starred before you become a director, you have a funny cast. <br /> <br /> The only shortcoming of this film was the performance of Debra Klinger in the role of Laura. She was terribly overzealous, but the rest of the film is so good that you can just ignore it. <br /> <br /> I own this movie and I can never watch it enough! <br /> <br />
