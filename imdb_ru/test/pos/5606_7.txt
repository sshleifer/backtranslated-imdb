Although this is not the best work of Hal Hartley (my personal favorite is “Surviving Desire”), there is a lot more in this film, especially for fans of Hartley dialogues. Even to an audience unfamiliar with Hartley, I would definitely recommend this film on top of Sofoma's Dogma. This film is smarter, more truthful about its original material (the Bible) and more fun than any of the other films about the apocalypse before the Millennium. <br /> <br /> This film is in fact part of the French film of 2000, as seen from Ot. "(2000 Par Vu) series; as such, it may even be a more budget film than other Hartley works Although the need for simple scenes taken with a digital camera is understandable in this context, the main problem with this film is the unfortunate overuse of the blur / shake effect. for viewing. But skip this flaw and you will be o It is noteworthy that Magdalena (played by PJ Harvey) tells how Jesus saved her from stoning to death; a short scene that I found surprisingly touching. (Despite the fact that this did not happen with Mary Magdalene; the woman in the Bible was not named.) <br /> <br />
