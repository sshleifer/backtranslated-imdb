I decided to watch it on FearNet on request for free, because I decided that nothing else looks pleasant. And it turned out to be a pretty good little terrible surprise! The film serves as an anthology of four urban legends told from the point of view of four teenagers whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. After they decided to build a fire in the forest, they begin to tell their eerie stories and film transitions to events in the stories. <br /> <br /> Honeymoon - a couple of newlyweds traveling over rough terrain in R.V. Las Vegas is terrorized when they park in a wooded area with evil creatures that hunt under the full moon. (I won’t spoil it for you!) Hook - Amy Smart and James Marsden (probably the most famous people in the film, besides the beautiful Christina Taylor) play a young couple who comes face to face with a maniac who has a hook in his hand most recognizable short film. <br /> <br /> People can lick, too - this is probably the most terrible and most gloomy of stories. A young girl chats with another girl on the Internet, but it turns out that this is actually a man who is obsessed with her, and he bursts into the house when she is alone. It was really scary. <br /> <br /> The Locket. It's also a great story with Glen Quinn and Jasinda Barrett, who play a motorcyclist and a beautiful dumb girl who are terrorized by the ghosts of the last century in a mysterious farmhouse. It was good, but it was the weakest of the records. <br /> <br /> The group around the fire slowly develops its own terrifying experience in its segments between stories, and the end of this film is amazing and truly amazing! Overall, it’s not scary to the bone, but it’s certainly a great little guilt that horror fans will definitely find worthwhile!
