This review is the answer to the question of how truthful the film was. <br /> <br /> I saw this film last year and found it inspiring in the hope of immigrants, such as my Italian grandfather and grandmother, who came across Ellis Island on the turn of the last century, they underwent all sorts of invasive checks just to enter in America. <br /> <br /> This, of course, opened my eyes, since my grandparents never talked about something terrible, being there. My grandmother was 5 years old, and my grandfather was 18 years old when they arrived. <br /> <br /> I just returned from a trip to New York, where I had the pleasure of visiting Ellis Island, and the museum actually takes you through immigration. The assessment process â€” the director obviously did his research, right up to medical examinations and equipment, questions and puzzles. They are all there in the museum. Even wedding photos and a conference room review - Actually correct! Anyone who has an immigrant grandparent should see this movie. Inspiring, to say the least.
