This is a film that in no way reflects the real world. Nothing in this film makes any sense in the real world or has no real-world logic. He works exclusively in his own small world, and your ability to accept it or not will determine your love or hatred for this film. <br /> <br /> I like the movie. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in the very beginning, I acquired a completely unrealistic premise that a female killer regains her memory as the past returns to haunt her. There was a moment when I remember admitting that it would be one of those films where the heroine would not know anything until it was needed, despite all the logic that this would not happen. “Oh, this is one of those films,” I said to myself, and the film hooked on a two-hour chase. <br /> <br /> This is a thriller with intelligence and muscle. logic, and you really have to pay attention to follow some of the turns. I like it a lot and I am pleasantly surprised when I come across people who feel the same. People either love it or hate it, if they ever heard of it at all. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies, this is a movie that is definitely worth a try. You may not like it, but it’s certainly worth the effort to find out <br /> <br /> And, as always, leave reality behind the door.
