I am 20 years old, a guy from England. I do not cry in the movies. But this one touched me. I cried like a girl! This is absolutely the most touching film I've ever seen, although the story was dubious. Joseph Mazello's little face, when he dreamed of crying, made me cry every time. How can you hurt such a sweet child? I'm going to cry, just thinking about it! Remarkable.
