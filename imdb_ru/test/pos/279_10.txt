In moments of despair, they were ready to do everything possible to win. I liked how the uselessness of Maple Leaves was used as a metaphorical basis for Bobby and Tessa. The action was accurate, far superior to the garbage consumption provided by the film industry. <br /> <br /> Great editing! At the end of the short film, I felt that it was a bit incomplete, but life was like that, and it was life and artistic waltz in the cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Sorry, as long as I wash off the cheese whistle, but I think it is acceptable at certain times. <br /> <br /> Two scenes that I have to pay attention to: a scene with a bathroom and a sofa. <br /> <br /> A scene with a sofa for Tessa was a defining moment. human condition. Throughout the short period, I saw her as a beast, but now we see her true reality. Her mind spoke before her heart. Do I need to talk more about the scene in the bathroom.
