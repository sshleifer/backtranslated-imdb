Late in the evening on Tom Snyder's “Tomorrow” show, I watched Tom ask his guest Henry Morgan what he considers “ideal.” Morgan replied: "Anything with Glenda Jackson." And although I do not think this film is perfect, it confirms this very well. I was going to use the cliché that Hollywood no longer makes such pictures, but then I just watched “In the Air”, another intelligent film about two people in love over 35 years old. This is where the similarity ends. "House Calls" is just fun when you look at two professionals, such as Mattau and Jackson, and they seem completely natural while they are in it. I saw this film in the theater in 1978 (at the age of 18), and it took me another 20 years to get all the jokes. Any film that could create a twist from the great tennis of the 1920s by Bill Tilden and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain wouldn’t play too well these megaplexes these days. Another thought: the original “Theater Walk / Fall in Love” montage was featured on The Beatles / George Harrison’s “Something” tune. At the time, he seemed a bit intrusive, but since then this song has been replaced by Henry Mancini's rather typical cue for the subsequent release of home video and cable release. Too bad, because this scene just lies there, another victim of music licensing hell.
