My brother hoisted me on Karlin back in the 70s. I have always loved his observant humor. That is, to look at everyday things and find humor in them, how to ask the question: “Have you ever tried to throw away an old waste basket? You can't do this! They keep coming back to you! ”And asking questions, for example, why the word“ kill ”is more acceptable than the word“ F ”, while at the same time having a sense of prefect in the discussion. <br /> <br /> However, in the 90s his material was less funny and more evil. What he seemed to be doing was holding a mirror in the face of society and saying: “Look!” At that moment his show was not comedic, but rather exciting. But in all fairness, he always had an enormous amount of sense. He really made you think. <br /> <br /> Here was the old and the new Carlin. He begins with fun, which can be obtained by growing old, and then challenging the world. Again it makes sense. <br /> <br /> This has been his best since Jammin 'in New York, and, as it turned out, his last. <br /> <br /> I think what “The Shootist” is to John Wayne or “Prairie's Home Interlocutor” to Robert Altman, “It's Bad for Me” to George Carlin Loving farewell to this great icon. Loving him or hating him, I think he will be remembered.
