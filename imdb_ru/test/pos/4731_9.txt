Many remember the confrontation of Waco, which happened a long time ago. What most people probably have ingrained in their minds is the “cult leader” David Koresh and images of the complex that burned down on the ground after a long confrontation. Many people believe that Koresh was some kind of crazy person who thought he was God. He was accused of having corrupted the child, and was credited with the breakdown and death of his followers. In addition, many people feel that the cult committed mass suicide when the FBI stormed the Mount Carmel Center and when the building burned. Most people believe that the cult is to blame for not agreeing with the FBI on reasonable terms. Most people believe that Koresh had brainwashed a cult and followed everything he said. Nothing could be further from the truth, because convincing evidence after the nightmare ended, and this one-of-a-kind documentary film pretty much proves it !! <br /> <br /> This documentary is one of the most balanced exams in this situation. This is much more thorough and detailed than all that most people received in the mainstream media. To the surprise of many, this documentary will show that it was the ATO, the FBI and the highest levels of the United States government, which were unfair, cruel and deceptive, and not David Koresh and his followers. What Corce did and Davidian just protected their constitutional rights, and the higher forces completely violated and raped these rights. AFT had no reason to storm the complex; it was the AFT that shot first and they shot from above helicopters at unarmed men, women and children !! What is even more shocking is the actions of the FBI when they entered Mount Carmel. See for yourself and you will have a new look at the US government. There is an infrared video recording that clearly shows that the FBI shot machine guns at men, women and children in a burning complex. This will make your blood boil. It really pisses you off. It will make you think about what kind of people rule this country. Finally, it will make you think that every evening in the news you are told about the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This video is scary and I highly recommend it if you can find it. This documentary does not need to buy; This can be watched for free on google video!
