There were many ups and downs in this film ... The storyline is strong, telling the saga about the growing up of Ma Barker, and then about her misfortunes with her boys and the FBI ... Teresa Russell is very talented, and her beauty even shines through, like Ma 'Barker, in public enemies. The direction of Mark L. Lester, although not as good as in Commandos 85, was nevertheless very interesting. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts plays a brief role in the role of a guard who became a gangster (and Ma's lover), and Alyssa Milano plays a prostitute who hangs with a gang. Frank Stallone plays a gangster who helps the gang, and while one of his exploits puts one of Ma's boys into trouble, he goes to the finals By the way, so to speak ... <br /> <br /> Throughout this film I was puzzled, intrigued and captivated ... So it surprises me what kind of film was watched by all these others who voted for him so low! .. For all those who are interested ... Yeah, the FBI actually was so bad, at first he didn't have machine guns, like criminals, and therefore they were at a disadvantage whenever they started a shootout with gangs epochs ... Since I, I saw that these were the 30s, I felt that it was more realistic than in many other films shot from that era ... It can happen like a train wreck ... You don't want atch, but ONLY too .. Enjoy !!!
