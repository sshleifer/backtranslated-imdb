This show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit together and watch. Stories are a little slow for adults, but they are still good. There are many children in my family, boys and girls, and it is difficult to get them all to agree on what to watch, but they always agree with each other when they want to see the Mystic Knights. This is a wonderful show, and I hope that they will continue to do it. All the kids are in my family and I think Vincent Walsh is the best of them. We saw that he did a lot of other work and we think that he does an excellent job. We wish good luck to all the actors, actresses, writers, directors and producers, and just want to continue in the same spirit.
