I am 17 years old and I am a biased fan of Muppet, and although I love Treasure Island, Christmas Carol and the Great Muppet Kaper, the Muppet film absolutely deserves to be there with the best of them. It's incredibly exciting, thanks to Jerry Julia's quick script, and the film looks great, with some beautifully-staged musical numbers. Speaking of songs, I really liked them, of course, they are not the best song from the Muppet series, but they were very pleasant to listen to, especially Never Before. Never before has one of my favorite Muppet songs with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate. The dolls, as usual, were fantastic, especially always the amazing Miss Piggy, and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzy was magnificent. And what a wonderful cast - from Bob Hope to Orson Wells, from Madeleine Kahn (the same wonderful actress who brought us funny movies like “What happened, Doc?”, “Burning saddles and clues”) up to Richard Pryor, all of whom made unforgettable guest appearances, if careful not to overshadow the dolls in the science fiction film. 10/10 Bethany Cox
