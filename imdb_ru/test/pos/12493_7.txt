Orfevre embankment takes too much time, because Clouzo is so in love with a backstage situation that he almost risks forgetting this story. However, as soon as this happens, Clouzot is at its best. Bertrand Blier (father of Bertrand Blier and colleague of his "Buffett Froid") is a world famous pianist who married himself and plans to kill the wretched studio magnate with pictures on his wife, only to find out that someone had beaten him. And not only that, but his carefully planned, but awkwardly executed alibi falls apart, not least when the thief steals his car at the scene of the murder. <br /> <br /> The film really comes to life with the arrival of Luis Juve. A police inspector, a rather remarkable piece of work, half Alistair Sim in Green for Danger, and Megre half tired of light with the best dialogue. In a neat gag during a conversation, an investigation is constantly conducted against chaos and noise, whether it be noisy cars in a police station or a loud rehearsal. The police station itself is an amazingly realistic creation, replete with chaotic and telling the smallest details, thanks to which the once revolutionary demonstrations of US police officers Steve Bocko in the 1980s look like outdated museum exhibits. <br /> <br /> If Susie Delaire is a rather unconvincing femme fatale, the cast is more than compensated, and the beautiful Simona Renant is an outstanding lesbian photographer, who loves her from afar and is constantly mistaking for her lover Bliier Delaire. and other interested parties (only Jouve, who also has no luck with women, understands and genuinely sympathizes). With a gorgeous black and white photo of Armand Tirar, this is a stunning little thriller with a beautiful twist and a beautiful scene with a taxi driver reluctantly identifying Renant at the police station. (General information: Pierre Larkey, who played the playful philosopher Dr. Vorze at Le Corbo, is playing small roles as a taxi driver in Quai and Les Espions.) <br /> <br /> DVD Criterion is pretty great - great picture quality plus vivid excerpt from a french television show with interviews from Clouzot, Blier and Renant.
