One of the best war movies I've ever seen, if not the best. It is very difficult to talk about such films, since it is very difficult to point out any mistake made in the film. The “problem” is that it looks too real and thus draws you into the ruins of Stalingrad and makes you suffer for both sides. For the reason that this film, unlike most Hollywood films, does not glorify war or heroism of the main characters. Instead, the film makes them heroes just because they are human, and thus, this is an anti-war war. Extremely convincing war scenes and such an impressive acting game, most of the scenes look like separate theater plays. Germans also play in the German army, which is so convincing. The film was created and implemented by the Germans, where you can see their love of detail to perfection. That is why Stalingrad is one of the films that I can watch a million times and never feel bored. I watched a movie with my father, who fought in World War II, and the first thing he said was: "This is like a real one, this is how a war against the Germans looked." This is the place where you can see what it looked like to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of war in human history and at the turning point of World War II: Stalingrad.
