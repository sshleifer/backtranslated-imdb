If I were allowed to watch only one program in my whole life, I would definitely choose “War of the Hunter for All”. Of all the satirical shows that were on Australian television, I found “Chaser” the most fun of all. It is so amazing that boys are not afraid to do anything. <br /> <br /> Do you dress like Hitler to get into a Polish club, or push a huge string ball around Melbourne to try Tourism Ads or swing to a Coca-Cola factory naked in a bath from $ 2.40 to buy some water. Boys hunters will go there. <br /> <br /> In accordance with the comments above (and / or below), “War of the Hunters for All” is more popular than their previous program “CNNNN”. But CNNNN was just as funny. Some unforgettable moments of this show ... Take away Cambodia !!! Classic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to stop me from further ranting, I STRONGLY advise you to at least give Chaser a chance, you will most likely find it fun!
