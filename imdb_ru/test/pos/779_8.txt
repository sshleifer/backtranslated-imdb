Driving Lessons From the author of the famous movie scripts, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock brings a touching soulful drama in the title role, Oscar nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney, and also from the Harry Potter Rupert Grint series. A beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint), a seventeen-year-old boy who is captured in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney). After the end of the school year, he decides to get a job with an intelligent, free spirit and a “heavy on a bottle” retired actress Evi Walton (Julie Walters). The couple embarks on amazing adventures from camping to walking around the quarter to simple conversations about life. Struggling with the imperious mother, as well as with each other along the way, they develop an excellent connection that revolutionizes both their lives. <br /> <br /> Comic elements are flawless and accurate, especially from British veteran Julia Walters, Brock uses his unique style to create a disgraceful and loving nature, which the first time directors could only dream of. The direction becomes natural for Brock, as he creates stunning images that break the surface and immerse the viewer in an abundance of adoration and creativity. Even the subtle scores of the unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renborn emphasize the tone and manner in which Brock had no difficulty creating. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney always makes her mark in films, as in the film “Laura”. The imperious and domineering mother is at times unbearable, and with Linnie at the head of this we are absorbed in this person. The complexity of her character could not be more flawlessly portrayed by anyone else. Rupert Grint breaks away from Ron Weasley and tries on someone new. His game is more responsive than the mediocre, but Grint gives us someone new to the kid’s game, and the viewer likes it. But the outstanding result comes from Oscar-nominated actress Julie Walters, who gives Evie her own life. Despite the fact that the role is clearly the leading one, Walters is better at supporting the role, where, I think, she can just take the prize home. “Evie” is a blend of “Clementine Kruczynski” and “Mrs. Laura Henderson” with its free spirit and attractive persona. We hope that her role will not go unnoticed this season awards. <br /> <br /> Driving lessons are not an experience “from this world”, but a wonderful, pleasant one, which any spectator can simply throw back and learn something. about life, love and friendship in the most beautiful colors and sizes. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** / ****
