Spoilers in this review! Despite several incredible scenes, including boys in physical education, measuring their penises at the competition, and several mandatory vignettes that they are trying to put on themselves, this film reflects the painful nature of high school in a way that only a few teen films did. made. This is achieved not only by the fact that the trio of friends, Gary, Dave, Rick, smoke, drink, ever fall ill as a teenager, but also tells about the nature of the friendship itself, since these three friends test their loyalty. This film is a snapshot of the time when childhood ends. For the shy romance Gary, when he first sees the beautiful Karen, he immediately falls in love. Gary's evocative emotion is written extensively on screen, and he proves his love for her by accepting her when she is in love with her. This love for Karen signals the end of Gary's innocence, as the ties with his two best friends will be tested and destroyed during the course of the story. Self-confident Dame Rick is a high school person whom we all secretly want us to be: beautiful, cool and always in incredibly beautiful girls in a swoon. Rick turns out to be a cad, but you have to keep in mind that his hero is only 17 years old. He panics and makes a bad decision. From Rick's point of view, the story is also about finding one girl of your dreams, a bad break, and then, finally, reconcile. Rick's facial expression, when Gary enters and sees Karen kissing Rick, shows that he finally realizes that his best friend and he loves the same woman. As in real life, you do not worship, because your friend has unrequited love. This is the tragedy of the film. Rick is not a villain, and he constantly reminds Gary and Dave through the film that they are his best friends. However, the spiritual quality of performance of Gary is the heart of the story. Lawrence Monozon is a great loser. He does everything right, his heart is in the right place, and he is consumed with love for Karen. However, Karen, after all, is not touched by Gary's devotion and kindness. Karen represents all the people in the world who accept, without giving away, who exist in a vacuum of their own ego and never cease to be aware of the emotional damage and trauma they cause to others. This film is cruel in its declarations of love and friendship, but this is what makes it unique among teen films. It ceases to be a comedy and becomes a hopelessly romantic film, albeit doomed to a tragic end. Anyone who has ever found the girl of his dreams and did not conquer her will understand. The heartbreaking destructions of high school are as real as the emotional strains of adult life, and this film will remind you of this with bold strokes. Gary’s last turn, when he leaves with an inscribed medallion, is just as painful as any other in a movie. Watching this, you feel that it is really made from two films. The first part is a stupid film about sexual sexual orientation for teenagers, and as soon as the story begins, it is a strongly affecting drama. Awesome movie. It should also be noted that the soundtrack was predictable in the choice of many rising stars, including “Police”, “Cars”, “Devo”, “Wingo Boingo”, “Plimsula”, “Waitresses”, “Brilliant Spiers” and Phil Seymour.
