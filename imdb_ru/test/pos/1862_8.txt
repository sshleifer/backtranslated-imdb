Paul Bettany played a big role in the role of the tortured father, whose beloved little girl is tragically killed by disease. For this he deserves all praise. Nevertheless, the film was mainly about this, preserving Darwin's adventures when he collected data for his theories in the form of incomplete stories told to children, and completely ignoring the controversy surrounding his ideas. <br /> <br /> Two things terribly bothered me: the soundtrack with its whiny sound, almost saddening the viewer, and the trailer of the film showing some beautiful landscapes, theological reflections about him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends preparing to battle against blind faith, thus completely distorting the film. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, if you remove the scenes from the movie trailer from the movie, the result will be an indescribable family drama about a small child dying and as a result his parents' difficulties arise. Obviously, I did not expect from a film about Darwin, although the film was beautifully interpreted.
