Finding something, the journey will be much more fun, much more surreal and much more emotionally inspiring than when you finally get to your destination. Love is probably one of the richest feelings in the world. You feel energetic, vigorous and alive. You just want to be with this person every second of the day, and the very sound of his voice makes you excited, and sometimes excited. Love and all the physical and emotional side effects associated with it are pure bliss. From where it goes, you can only guess, but when you begin your journey together, nothing can compare with it. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane and Richard Gere are played by Adrienne Willis and Dr. Paul Flanner, two emotionally injured middle-aged people. In this film, they get together to go on this mystical journey, where love and the detection of emotions along the way will help save them. <br /> <br /> Lane is dealing with the typical push of an ex-husband who still loves her, but in her eyes, just because the woman with whom he cheated no longer wants him. No matter how painful she is, no matter how much she likes him, there is a part of her that is actually considering the possibility of bringing him back. Why you may ask? Because in life and love sometimes comfort replaces the mind. Yes, this man has changed her, but she has children, she has built a life with him, and, obviously, there is still a connection with him. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere plays the newly divorced husband and alienated father. He also just lost a patient because she reacted negatively to anesthesia. Currently, her family is suing him, and he feels guilty, but is tempered on this issue. This is what leads him to Rodantu in the first place. Although his lawyer told him not to do this, he felt obliged to visit the womanâ€™s husband in Rodanthe. He stops at the hotel that Adrienne takes care of. Soon, they find solace in the arms of each other and discover that they, too, may have a second chance in life. <br /> <br /> By now it sounds like a simple idea for a movie, and although it may be something you've seen or read about it before, Gere and Lane just own the movie Diane Lane smiles at the screen . Her eyes flicker in the dark, and the life she brings to a character is worth seeing. Gere's character is slightly different. It is more hardened and bitter. It takes Adrienne's pain and her passion to get him out of his shell. He quietly blames himself for his strained relationship with his son, and she secretly blames himself for the death of the patient. Outside, he tells everyone who will listen that it is not his fault, and that she was 1 out of 50,000 victims. But deep down, it frets him. They find each other at a time when both need to listen to someone. <br /> <br /> Gere and Lane were shot together before, but this is the first time they play lovers. They were married to the Infidels, but here they play lovers who find each other when people in their lives abandoned them. They have a spark and real chemistry. I would like to see more movies with them. In fact, I would like to see more films with Diane Lane, but this is a story for another time. <br /> <br /> Nights in Rodanthe is a very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls who save each other. They both become better people, they both become strong people. I really liked it, and I would recommend it to everyone, not just couples. This is a film about redemption, absolution and second chances. <br /> <br /> He will also ask you to bring some scarves. <br /> <br /> 8/10
