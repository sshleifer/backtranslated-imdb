I first learned about this movie when I saw a preview in front of another movie. I was intrigued, but he did not see him until his short film in cinemas was made. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s not easy to watch a movie several times. There is a lot of violence against unarmed civilians. Here you can learn the lessons. Summarizes one of the lines of Patricia Arquette. "For Americans, if this did not happen on TV, this simply did not happen." There is a lot of truth in this. <br /> <br /> Another reason: she thinks only because she declares an American citizen that the soldiers will part and miss her. It doesn't work that way. <br /> <br /> The scenery is beautiful. The game is all decent. PROFESSOR is especially good. Mostly though I care about these characters. Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray are fine, but their appearance is short, so they don't matter much. Patricia has courage. In the hands of a smaller actor, this could be very bad. Since this is love or hatred for the film, you should still start from the idea that military dictatorships still exist in the world in this century, and until one of ours has suffered, we ignore their oppression. <br /> <br /> Aung San Suu Kyi, woman political leader in the film. In real life, she won the Nobel Peace Prize. She was only recently released from house arrest. The Bush administration, on the date I am writing, is trying to put pressure on the military government to negotiate with it and reform the government. The government of Birmiza was under such scrutiny that it changed the name of the country to the Republic of Mainnamar. The US government has not yet recognized the new name. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to see the message in your movie, do not watch it. If you don't mind a little learning with your entertainment, then that's good.
