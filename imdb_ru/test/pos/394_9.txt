I liked this film, which offers many interesting plots and complex love-hate relationships, as well as intermittent battle scenes and some carefree moments in which mountain people confront severe military discipline. All the main characters are well played. True, John Wayne or Robert Mitchum, probably, could also play the main role, but Victor Metri certainly looks like Tarzan’s stubborn whelp. Reminds me of his role in the film "Samson", another difficult, but not impossible person who can be tamed. <br /> <br /> Mountain men on the debut scene are certainly anachronistic, since the era of pure mountain hunters largely ended 20 years ago, with the decline of the population of western beavers, as well as the fashion market for beaver skins. This story allegedly takes place in Oregon shortly before the end of the civil war. Judging by the volcano against the background of the opening scene (probably Mount Lassen), the fictional fortress was located somewhere in a remote part of the Cascades, since we never see other civilians. However, there is a lot of conflicting evidence that this is happening in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud, a military commander who threatens hunters and soldiers at the fort, is the namesake of the very famous military leader Sioux, who in 1865-66 led a very successful campaign to destroy the newly built army forts in Wyoming and Montana. Fort Laramie (eastern Wyoming) is referred to as being close to a fictional fort. The Assiniboine Plain Tribe is referred to as joining the Red Cloud. Thus, this aspect of history has a common resemblance to historical fact. <br /> <br /> It may be interesting to note some similarities between the plot of this story and the plot of John Ford “Fort Apache”. In both cases, we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first border post with Native American problems. He underestimates the military power of his opponents, considering them only cannon fodder, contributing to his career. In both films, he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy. Also, usually a new commander takes offense at a subordinate who has many years of experience in dealing with local Native Americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and what is not. In both films we have a romantic bond between a woman who is very close to the heart of the commander, and a subordinate, which the commander is doing everything to suppress. It is clear that the commander must be eliminated to allow these novels to end. <br /> <br /> I also see some similarities with “Inconsistencies”. Soldiers in general, including the commander, are losers of their own kind ((as one of them admits): they mostly have “problems” or are rude recruits who have no experience in dealing with Native Americans. Obviously, the commander’s wife is the only woman or somewhere near this fort, therefore, is inherently not suitable, with a husband who is very uncertain about his future in the army. Hunters, in turn, are also losers who do not really want to accept military or civil discipline, but cut off from their past lives her free spirits with the army-generated antagonism of the Red Cloud. <br /> <br /> Finally, we can also compare this story with Anthony Mann's later film “Distant Country” with Jimmy Stewart in the movie Stewart After all, he may return to becoming a lone cowboy, but the Mature character cannot come up with an appetizing new way to be his own boss. The Red Cloud has made life outside the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate. In addition, he is obsessed with the commander of his wife.
