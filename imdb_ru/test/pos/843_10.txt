I have long been looking forward to the release of this DVD (and its continuation {Scorpion Prisoner Woman: song of hurt number 701}) for some time. I really liked the first two films of this series. Just seeing this movie, I would say that this is probably my favorite of the three. <br /> <br /> All three films were shot by Shun Ito. What is remarkable about them is that, despite the fact that they all have the same main character (played by Meiko Kaji remarkably), each of them is very different from the others. <br /> <br /> The first film (“Woman Prisoner No. 701: Scorpio”) is a more or less typical film “Women in Prison”. But the character of Scorpio is very intriguing - very much like the antiheroes of many westerns of spaghetti. And the director often used several very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. <br /> <br /> The second film (Scorpion Woman: Prison 41) is a real trip. Not so much a WIP movie as a movie Scorpio and six other escaped prisoners on the run. <br /> <br /> This film (“Woman Prisoner of Scorpio”: “The Stable of the Beast”) is the third in the series and the last one made by Shun Ito. This one plays a lot more criminal drama. Once again our heroine is on the run. But this time she managed to keep a certain standard in her life (relatively speaking, in any case). She gets a job, she finds a place to live, she makes friends on the street. But, of course, everything must ultimately unravel. FPS: Beast Stable has a more rectilinear story that is told at a more leisurely pace than its predecessors. But I found it to be attractive from start to finish. And do not worry: in this film is still a lot of debauchery! But I think that these films go beyond most exploitation films, because the more disturbing elements are reproduced in a more direct tone, and are not used exclusively for shock assessment. Yes, there were moments in this film when I cringed badly. But I did not feel that they detract from the value of the story (well, maybe, once or twice). One thing that I really liked about these films is the continuation of the creation of the myths about Scorpio. With this record, character development is used much more widely than in the previous two. We see that she is much more than just a vengeful and evil spirit! <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier in this review, followed by a fourth film. It also depicts Meiko Kaji in the role of Scorpio, but he had a different director. Without giving anything away, I want to mention that FPS: Beast Stable ends in such a way that making a sequel completely unnecessary. The fourth film is still pretty good, but he seems to play the odd footnote to the terrific trilogy. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in unusual films. FPS: Beast Stable can be used as a separate play (like the first two films), but I would also recommend watching others first, if you have not done so.
