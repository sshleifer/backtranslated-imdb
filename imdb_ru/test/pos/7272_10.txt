Blimey! I picked it from the rental shelf because I loved Robert Carlisle and Johnny Lee Miller in Trainspotting. This is a phenomenal film; he has action, romance, suspense, intrigue and wit. When I was not laughing, I was on the edge of my place. This is definitely a film that I would recommend to people who value a sensible dialogue and a fresh look at the 18th century. This film has everything that I was happy!
