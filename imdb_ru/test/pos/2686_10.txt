This show is brilliantly fun! I started watching in 2007, and have never heard of it before. After one episode I was hooked. I am never at home to watch this, so my wife bought me an entire series on DVD. Don't stop laughing, should I say more? I wish it was still on television, because it is definitely worthy and much better than the crap currently on television. <br /> <br /> I would like them to make a serious film that wouldn’t go to see, Kevin James’s name alone will bring huge fan support to any film, the funny guy. He has a very fun, believable, believable show. If you have the opportunity to buy it on DVD, do it, it's worth it.
