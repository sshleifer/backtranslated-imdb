Starewicz is infinitely inventive, and his methods still amaze animation fans 70 years later. Now we may have computer methods, but all he had in 1934 was imagination that would not accept no for an answer. Everything he wanted to see on the screen he created. <br /> <br /> And he wanted to see some really weird things - every imaginable scrap piece was called up for service: old shoes, chicken bones, dishes, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats ... it seemed as if nothing that would be inaccessible. <br /> <br /> A truly creepy, even disturbing film that everyone who is interested in animation should watch. This film must be seen to be believed!
