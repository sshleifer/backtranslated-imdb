... scratch it. In the same way as rhythms created by Africans with the jaw bone of the ass and Virgin Islanders welded the oil drums into pleasing steel ribbons, the city DJ wanted to scratch in search of new creative expression methods. "Scratch" is a completely obscene documentary that takes you to the very heart of hip-hop / rap movement and explores the genesis of Turntablism, the art of scratching vinyl and the ultimate DJ / MC modern entertainment. The film reveals surprisingly intelligent and well-articulated “Scratchers” with strikingly unique abilities in concerts and competitions where rhythm meets street. Good material for those interested in grassroots ghetto movements in sound art. (AT)
