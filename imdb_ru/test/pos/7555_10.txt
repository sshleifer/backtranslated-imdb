Great movie about people. I first saw “Four Friends” when it was shown in cinemas, and since then I have seen it many times. If I do not watch it on TV, I will gather with my friends and hire him. People with whom I watched this movie, always find it enjoyable. He practices with friends from childhood through adulthood, in the 50s and 60s. It's very funny and touching to deal with first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics - all the sixties of the 60s This can also be quite dramatic. If you like movies about people, this movie is definitely worth it.
