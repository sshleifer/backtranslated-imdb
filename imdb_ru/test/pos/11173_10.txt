By now the game is outdated, right? <br /> <br /> The jokes have already been made. Its end. In the end, the creative genius who led this game in the first two games disappeared. <br /> <br /> Wrong. <br /> <br /> The game is still intact, the jokes are here guys. Of course, they are all rechecked, but it was the same on Monkey Island 2. And 1, for that matter. <br /> <br /> The difficulty is well posed, somewhere between a little light 1 and an absurdly complicated 2.
