There were two video frames that Troama considered terrible, so the desperate movement turned into this film. Perhaps the bitterness on the side of Troyam helped stir up the comedy, but for some reason this is a very funny thing with an inspirational episode when Oliver Stone made comments during the film. A lot of cameos, a lot of use of the song Lesbian Cannibal HoeDown add fun. Trey Parker, Ted Raimi, Julie Strain, etc., etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> One of the best recent releases from Troama. Yes, it is everywhere, know that input, quality of production or lack of it, becomes one of many jokes. Keep up the good work and have a good time. <br /> <br /> Behind the scenes, often the best moments of Troama releases this time above average. I really think that the anger they felt about these two lousy films helped them bring them, well, not really great, but made them “fix” this film in a way that would be better than any of the films as they were originally planned.
