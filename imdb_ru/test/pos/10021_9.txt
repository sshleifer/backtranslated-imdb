The pearl of the cartoons of the era of silence - it was reopened by CARTOON NETWORK and probably aired for the first time in decades, if ever. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so enjoyable is a variety of cameos ... Douglas Fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitoes; Will Hayes makes a visit as “boss” of Static Studios; and Chaplin, Keaton, and William S. Hart. The image of chewing gum destroying the shoes of the population (the idea of ​​making money for the almost bankrupt Felix shoe boss = seller) cannot be described - it needs to be considered. Awesome cultural gem.
