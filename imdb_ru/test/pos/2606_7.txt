The film begins with a promise, because between Spanky and Buckwheat there is more interaction, but as the film progresses, the two boys have less scenes together. This slows the pace significantly. Billy "Buckwheat" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left on a riverboat, his fear and abandonment are palpable, and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he turns from person to person with a request for help and is repeatedly rejected, the viewer really begins to wonder whether it is a comedy or not. Viewing children’s birthday over the fence is another touching moment. As another reviewer mentioned, I was also worried that a big dog was choking on chicken bones! When Spunky and Buckwheat are in the house of Marshall Valiant, Spunky tends to interact mainly with adults, and the chemistry of children is essentially lost. <br /> <br /> The “Old South” and “Heck Finn” type settings actually do little for the plot, except that children are often out of the house. Ralph Morgan is the most attractive adult, but other roles don't really make much sense to them. Louise Beaver at the end comes up to funny moments with a Yankee soldier. <br /> <br /> Villains are not really villains enough, and lovers are not strong enough. However, I think it is worth seeing if you are an enthusiast of our gang, if not for some other reason, that strange curiosity of the whole work. I give him seven stars, because, despite the fact that it was not a very good film, he kept me busy and wondered what would happen next.
