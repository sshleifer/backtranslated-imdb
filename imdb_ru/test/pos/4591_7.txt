There is a lot of bad in this movie. I will not lie. I will say that most of the problems are made up of the fact that they are connected with the budget, which was cut out from under the flick, and with some poor editing of jobs. <br /> <br /> This is not Office Space. Do not expect comedy levels in office space. This is very funny. This is a mess, but at the same time very funny. Funny movie mess. That Caddyshack is funny. A mess of incoherent fun scenes filled with some very annoying unfunny scenes. <br /> <br /> This works as a whole, though, and it certainly deserves a wide release. This is the best commentary to the Wal Mart / Starbucks / MTV nation you can hope for. The fact that the film explores the idea that stupid people are multiplying at an alarming rate, and smart ones is not, is magnificent in my book. Not very politically correct, but at least itâ€™s worth arguing.
