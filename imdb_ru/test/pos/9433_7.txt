Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote many stories about Sherlock Holmes, but the popularity of the famous detective said that the sequels in both print and cinema would go far beyond the work of the author. <br /> <br /> In Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon, Holmes, Basil Rathbone, patriotically serves British intelligence to provide the desperately needed bomb blast of a Swiss scientist. The film was made in 1942, and I wonder if producers and screenwriters realized how important the secrets of a bomb sight were (Nordenâ€™s American bomb sight was guarded almost as zealously as the new radar installations that could change the course of World War II). <br /> <Holmes and his loyal, but expected awkward companion, Dr. Watson, Nigel Bruce, fight with Dr. Moriarty, Lionel Atville. Despite the fact that Moriarty has always been so angry, it was a bit shocking that he subscribed to Hitler. Does not a man have the rest of decency? I think no. But Atteville is incredibly angry. <br /> <br /> The story evolves rather quickly, since Holmes and Watson are trying to recover the stolen components of the bomb sight before they can be delivered to the submarine. Rathbone is his usually courteous person, and several Holmes disguises are well executed. <br /> <br /> This and other Holmes stories from the 1940s are now available on DVD, and oldies.com has released a very good set of four discs in the Wooden Box: this film is included with the bonus CD interview with elderly Doyle. The kit sells for about $ 26 in the main DVD and CD stores, but I found this and other kits at oldies.com in the club from the warehouse for $ 14.98. Transfers are very good. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant and quiet night viewing. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
