It was an interesting movie. I could do without a scene in the bathroom and a scene of seduction - EWWWW! In addition, I liked the awesome music around which this film revolved. Chris / Izzy's parents are AMAZING! They fully support the interests of their sons and believe in him enough to support him - now it is AMAZING !! What really surprised me was Chris awareness at the end. It was not exactly a “Hollywood” end on the road to self-discovery. The general rise to glory and its fall were a real rollercoaster ride.
