I don't think the world was ready for this film. I know I was not. I expected this to be a standard low-cost boiler for operating a slok. Instead, I received the cleverest reworking of Shakespeare since the “Prospero Book” by Peter Greenaway. This should be the final version of the movie Romeo and Juliet. It will not be finite. But this is the loss of peace.
