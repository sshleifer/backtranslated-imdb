This film is completely about reality, the underwater war in the Second World War was not a pure exact science. There were no computers that gave accurate data of the enemy, there were no exact instruments for 100% control over the submarine. Not the whole team went to the fight with a song in their heart and a smile on the dial. <br /> <br /> People expecting to see a “beautiful war” in this film will be very disappointed ... ........... Well, they deserve disappointment, they deserve to faced their face. <br /> <br /> War is not pure, accurate, with people who are about to burst into a song. It is carried by scared, cold / burned, hungry, desperate people, ready to do something to survive. <br /> <br /> “We dive at dawn” is a great example of a desperate situation requiring desperate actions.
