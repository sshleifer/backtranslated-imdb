See Les Amants Reguliers immediately requires a comparison with Bertolucci’s film “Dreamers”, in my opinion, the best film about the revolt of students in Paris in 1968. In fact, director Philip Garrel does not seem to avoid comparing with his much more famous colleague, sharing the role of the main actor, and even includes a direct, face-to-face replica of the older Bertolucci film. Yet LAR is another interesting film. <br /> <br /> Storyline also seems familiar. The film begins with the long scenes of the emuts of 1968, possibly one of the best ones made so far. The film is made in black and white, and the perspective of a static camera on one side or the other of the barricades resembles Eisenstein. Then, as in “Dreamers”, the action takes place in a Paris apartment, where the heroes of the defeated uprising create art, smoke drugs, dream and fall in love with each other. There is no direct social commentary, no real explanation of the background of the uprising. The film is devoted to the psychology of the characters and the love story between the main characters. This is similar to the premonition of the process of transition to the establishment, through which the generation of 1968 passed, just not all participants can adapt or survive. <br /> <br /> The film is more about heroes than about events. And this is only because of the style he will remember. Black and white cinema is remembered not only in the revolutionary scenes, but also when looking at the evolution of the characters. Many sequences are amplified by a technique taken from silent films, with long takes accompanied by a melody without a piano. The effect is exquisite. However, the length of the film is hardly justified, it lasts more than three hours, and I doubt that reducing it to two hours would be a blunder - in fact, I am sure that it is quite the opposite. <br /> <br /> Without raising the depth and subtlety of the Bartolucci film “LAR” is another perspective worth remembering about one of the most important years in the history of France and the world in the 20th century.
