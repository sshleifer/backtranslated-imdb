I first saw it one afternoon in the 80s on T.V. I think I was 9 years old. (On today's TV movie, a picture of a horrible horror movie). Anyway, I saw it again years later, and this, as I remembered, is a really good, scary film. I think that the reason why he could go unnoticed, is that he was not followed by many sequels, that is, on Friday the 13th. But this is one of those films that takes the original idea and makes it better. Despite being a killer in the woods like on Friday, he has more in common with the original Texas chainsaw massacre. This is because the film creates a certain atmosphere and a sense of fear, even in broad daylight. And the killers feel more threatening than on Friday. There is also a good amount of waiting. I recommend watching it now when it is released on DVD at the end of July.
