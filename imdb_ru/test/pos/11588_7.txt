SEA INSIDE the film Alejandro Amenabara. <br /> <br /> Almodovar always held the Spanish cinema flag alone for years, Amenabar appeared from nowhere, reinventing genres and introducing new blood into the spoiled industry of Spain, now in big gambling he switches from psychological terror to social drama would be great, are the viewers ready to accept the hesitation and, more importantly, can he hold the flag? This is the story of Ramón Sampedro, a sailor who, at the age of twenty, was paralyzed from the neck down as a result of an accident at sea and his struggle with the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has traces of the day made for the TV melodrama, and the only way it is going to work is through words and honest actions, and they both come to the peaks. Mateo Jill and Amenabar jointly write in such a way that the audience should not be blind to a mortal end, but they are invited to form their own opinion in the process, and this is a brilliant blow, this is not about the movie death, but the film in favor of the final illusions of our time FREEDOM. A few laughs go a long way, for example, when a church comes home in a wheelchair to destroy Sampedro's beliefs, but basically it's a valley of tears, the blows are coming from all sides, even if you think his father is safe. At this point, it made no sense to invent the most touching lines of the entire film. This is a heartbreaking experience, especially when Sampedro seems more full of life than most people wandering through the streets, and everyone around him tries to convince him of the wonders of life, even those who help him die ?? but when do you deprive the man of your dreams ?? The film is almost exclusively based on close-ups of a claustrophobic feeling that makes viewers more likeable to Sampedro. This is an enormous task for the actors, which should create all their performances with their eyes, and their eyes do not lie. Bardem was not given a second Oscar nomination, probably in favor of Eastwood, but in my opinion, he was the only one who could chase James Fox. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck in the movie “To Kill a Mockingbird”, where acting was effortless, and I believe that Bardem reached a state where the line of what is acting and what is real has become completely blurred. I have never been keen on his early work, but after Almovovar’s “Living Flesh” he was in shock, LOS-LUN-AL-SOL, DANCE-MEETING and nominated for Oscar BEFORE NIGHT PADAM made him an international star, and although he and Banderas come from the same Almodóvar The story looks amazing at how different paths they chose, and how Bardem became the real benchmark for Spanish cinema all over the world. Golden Globe, 14th Goya, jury prize at Venice and possibly Oscar with permission from THE CHORUS BOYS. Amenabar directs, writes and edits and puts music into a high-caliber drama that he shot ?? how about science fiction now? Whose life is it? ****.
