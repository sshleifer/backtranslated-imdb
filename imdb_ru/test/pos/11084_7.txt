I'm not a fan of Sean Penn, but, unlike my German colleague, whose review appears here, I think he played a great role as a neurotic, drug-addicted character in this film. He perfected every nuance and reminded me of several acquaintances who had similar tastes in “recreational chemistry”. I saw this film, but once, 10-15 years ago, and this is the only part of the film that was imprinted in my memory. I do not say this very often, but in this case I will: Bravo, Sean Penn! As for the storyline, it is based on facts, and, as such, it is a tragedy when people sell the secrets of their country to the then enemy. Again, Penn showed what you can do if you disagree with the administration. Use your freedoms for which you paid with blood; don't break the law.
