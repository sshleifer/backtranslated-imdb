At the beginning of this film, which I watched at IFC in the early morning hours, I was full of claustrophobia and general discomfort. The feeling that I was not able to escape was so strong that I did not know if I wanted to continue to look ... although it did not seem to me that I had a big choice, the situation was so convincing. <br /> <br /> However, this feeling of discomfort gradually decreased (although in fact it never completely disappeared), and I felt embroiled in Tessa’s and Bobby’s difficulties and really just hoped that they could come back together. <br /> <br /> A truly moving, powerful story that fits into a tiny package. I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with it until I looked at her trifles, so now I love it even more. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend it. ... If you are lucky that you will ever understand it on the Independent Film Channel, or you have enough tricks to find some other way to watch it.
