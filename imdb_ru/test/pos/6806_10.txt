My daughter has already written a review of this film in my account ... but I want to add a few words. <br /> <br /> National Velvet was one of my two favorite films in childhood. (The other is “The Wizard of Oz.”) Cinematography, acting, script, and music — all of this is such a wonderful little drama that is felt in my heart that it can still cause tears in my exhausted eyes. The script, based on the book of Enid Bagnold, followed the book quite well. Characters are so thoughtfully created. It is easy to become emotionally connected with the whole family and the strange little Irish village in which they live. Premise ... a complete outsider believes in his horse and in himself enough to try himself in the greatest leap in the world ... it inspires awe in any young man, especially a young girl of the 40s ... a time when girls were sometimes ignored as people, not to mention athletes. You would have to be hard boiled hard not to appreciate this virtue. <br /> <br /> But the perspective that I most valued in this film is the indomitable innocence of his moral message ... It is almost magical, as there were films with mom and apple pie. I was really perplexed by an IMDB reviewer who asked: “Has the world ever been so trusting?” And then proceeded to punish the director for his complacency regarding the “lawlessness” of a night journey involving the two main characters. My answer to his question is YES !!!! The world of cinema was such confidence in the 40s. <br /> <br /> My grandmother and grandfather remember how they took my mother to this movie when it was released. Then my mother took me to see when I was little, and my daughter was lucky to be born at a time when she could repeatedly watch it on videotape. Now we have it on DVD. It has been a family favorite for generations, albeit generations of horse lovers. It was never about sex ... it's about coming of age! It is about faith in yourself and hard work to achieve your goals. In addition, so old-fashioned that not even about the prize! It's about a girl who realized that her horse had what it takes to be the best. And yes, the director was really worried about Elizabeth Taylor's lack of physical development, because the book said a lot about that Velvet Brown (character Liz Taylor) had to get a haircut and tie her chest so that she could play the role of a male jockey when she went in the Great National Obstacle Run. Then it was only a sport for guys ... I think that only 12 women participated in this race. It is almost insulting that someone bother to think about Lolita about this particular film ... besides, anyone who has anything to do with the teenage girl and her horse will know that the only thing they ever think about with stars in their eyes have four hooves and a tail. <br /> <br /> And now for a small number of small things ... the stunt ride was performed by the now famous Horse Charmer, Monty Roberts. I believe that he received a mention for his participation in films. <br /> <br /> I give this film 10 out of 10! I never get tired of watching him again.
