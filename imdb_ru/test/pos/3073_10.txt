If you don't like Mel Brooks, you won't like this movie. It is given. Why someone does not like his films, I do not know, but for those who do not see the light, just avoid it. <br /> <br /> All others: This is a classic. The whole cast is perfect: Carey Elvis is dashing, smart, BRITISH Robin Hood, Amy Yasbek replays accordingly, because Marion, Richard Lewis is his usual confused, irritated self, Roger Rees is a brilliant combination of unrest and violence, because Mervyn Dave Chapel, Eric Allan Kramer, Mark Blankfield and the Sadly Undervalued Matthew Poretta are Perfect Gay Men. <br /> <br /> There are similarities with Cosmic Balls, Glowing Saddles ... and all the other Mel Brooks movie. But why do you want him to change his style when he damn well works? The references to pop culture in this film are old enough to be funny again ... at least from the point of view of a 16-year-old. This is a complete and complete parody, every second game for a laugh. Some of them do not work, but most work, and well. I discovered new jokes for the fifth and sixth time when I watched the movie! <br /> <br /> Of course, if you are pursued by constant visual and verbal jokes, this is not your style, you will not like it. This is not an Academy Award winner, this is Mel Brooks. You know what it is when you get into it. If you want non-stop laughter, surprisingly well-developed characters and flashy phrases to last a lifetime, take a look.
