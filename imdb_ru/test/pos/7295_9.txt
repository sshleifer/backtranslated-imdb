In one of the topics on the bulletin board on IMDb, two women talked about Colin Firth, about how they watched the movie just because of him. Obviously, these were two young women; but what struck me was how little this film was rated by the audience in general. Brilliant and I mean brilliant performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange were hardly noticed not only by the audience, but also by the Academy, and by most critics. <br /> <br /> I think I know why. First, the conspiracy — or, in fact, only installation — is a kind of bastard of King Lear Shakespeare with a dying, crazy patriarch and three treacherous daughters who will inherit. Their names even begin with the same letters: Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia — Rose, Ginny, and Caroline. And I think Larry (Jason Robards) works for Lyra. The obvious idea proposed by Jane Smiley in her novel, which won the Pulitzer Prize, was to tell a story similar to Lear from the point of view of daughters, and to tell about it a kind of realistic way of the end of the twentieth century, not considered Bard. The problem is that in the history of Smiley and Moorhouse, the two eldest daughters are very human, they have strengths and weaknesses, and the father is the most despicable character without special redemption abilities. His only strength was his ability to achieve the financial success of the farm; however, we can even discount this, since his father and grandfather had built a farm before him, and he inherited it. <br /> <br /> The second problem - and I cannot attest to it personally without reading the Smiley novel. - this is what the film is only a limited and partial interpretation of this novel. However, it is almost always the case that an excellent novel, especially a long and ambitious one, with many psychological nuances, cannot be faithfully transmitted to the screen. The vision and audio requirements of the film drown out the subtleties of the narration, while the time constraints do not allow to fully develop the character and motivation achieved by the novelist. If it were five or six hours, perhaps Moorhouse could have made the film more like the Smiley novel. <br /> <br /> The third problem is, perhaps, only Moorhouse. She began her directorial career with a very well-made Australian film “The Proof” (1991), starring Russell Crowe. She then tells “How to make an American quilt” (1995), in which women, especially women of a certain age, are glorified. However, it was a bit tough, clear and decisive. In a sense, a thousand acres flies out of there, showing us not only the women's point of view, but also in a way that may seem politically motivated to some. Larry Cook is obviously a bad, bad daddy. He beat his daughters, and he had carnal knowledge about them. He ruled the household with an iron fist. Jess (the character of Colin Firth) seduces inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing but fun. And then he goes to Rose, who will obviously become the force behind the new property, and will contact her, while at the same time urging her husband to end his life in a drunken accident. The remaining men are characters without nuances, as they often appear in novels. I think most viewers have been pushed aside by tough incest, adultery and sexual betrayal, woven into the story. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, I think that critics and the public are wrong. I think that the direction was biased against men, but in this story it should have been. I think Moorhouse did a great job creating an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that would not be too beautiful. And the game of Pfeiffer and Lange was just a sensation. They seemed to be feeding on each other in ways that I found absolutely genuine and deeply touching. In particular, Pfeiffer riveted, projecting his bent anger and hatred. How Moorhouse allowed us to gradually reveal her character is a tribute to her ability as a director, as well as to the outstanding work of Pfeiffer. And the skill that Moorhouse guided Ginny’s character change when she switched from “nanny,” as she called herself, to a person with self-awareness and some understandable bitterness, was also excellent. The fact that she left her husband was just as disgraceful as everything else. He needed to take her, forgive and return. And Robards in his rage and madness was also very good. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie, which was bombed in cinemas, will be better appreciated in the coming years, when people will see it on DVD. My question is: what happened to Moorhouse? Her talent is obvious, but she has not yet starred in her fourth feature film. When she does, I hope she remembers to go with what she believes in, but to be fair as well. I think that in fact she was fair to the two main characters in this film, but did not pay enough attention to others. In addition to the untrained father, Caroline Jennifer Jason Lee was unfinished, which made us wonder why she did what she did. And husbands had to be more than dummies. They had to be involved and involved.
