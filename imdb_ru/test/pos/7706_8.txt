Tracy and Matt, Michel and Sebastian: these are two couples whose life from drug addiction, crime and poverty is brilliantly captured in this raw and honest documentary film on HBO. They, in turn, are irritable, charming, disgusting, surprisingly stupid and devoted: to drugs and to each other. They are also very different: Matt is a working-class boy who clearly enjoys his prank, while Tracy's preparatory school dropout supports a couple with Western Union money from her father, who makes a surprisingly sympathetic cameo role at the end of the film, Meanwhile Michelle (whose husband died of an overdose) makes his living by posing as a New York police officer who wants to make a deal with her future Jones to avoid imprisonment, and sad companion bag Sebastian lives on ohody. You will be drawn into their stories and want the film to last twice as long. Unlike most of these documentaries, none of the codes provide us with updated information on their progress (can Matt and Tracy really leave this apartment in Brooklyn? Michelle will return to Bellevue for more detoxification? And can Sebastian become more pathetic? As a result, the film seems incomplete, but perhaps that was the point. A must see if you are not completely against the scenes of shooting people.
