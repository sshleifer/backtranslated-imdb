I like this movie. To be honest, the film starts very slowly, and not one of the characters shows any terrible sympathy. This continues for a good half of the film. <br /> <br /> But if you are patient, you will be greatly rewarded. What the first half of the film lacks in character development and / or sympathy is adequately compensated in the second half. Itâ€™s a bit like a roller coaster ride - a slow climb up the hill to start moving, then speed, turns and turns, and a few surprises. <br /> <br /> As usual, Meryl Streep is wonderful. She is the best actress of our time. William Hurt is good, albeit a little stained wooden. Renee Zellweger does a very good job showing that her performance at Jerry McGuire was not an accident.
