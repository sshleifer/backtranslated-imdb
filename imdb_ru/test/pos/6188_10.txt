<br /> <br /> There is something in watching a movie in a good old-fashioned cinema, which gives each photo a huge appeal. Fortunately, I managed to see a couple of Ernst Lubich’s comedies at the New York Film Forum during their three-week dedication to the legendary director. The double feature that I visited was the show of the comedy Lyubichi “The Eighth Wife” of 1938 by Lyubich and the classic “Design for Life” preceding the Code, which I had not seen before. Everything I read about Design for Life praised the film, but I could not find a good overview for Blue Beard's eighth wife. Leonard Maltin did not like it. VideoHound also gave the comedy a low rating. Her IMDB score was not complimentary. And Polina Kel (not surprisingly) blew up the movie in her terrible review. Therefore, when I arrived in the city that day, I expected that I would enjoy only a little the Eighth Wife of Blue Beard and would love “Design for Life”. Bluebeard's eighth wife (which was shown first) began when the clowns who inhabit the cinema took their seats, and the music of the thirties subsided. “Adolf Tsukor represents Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper in Blue Beard's“ The Eighth Wife ”of Ernst Lubich, says the title card. Then the picture opened with a fun scene: Cooper wants to buy a pair of pajama tops, but doesn't want any part of his pajamas! He enters a quarrel with a clerk who seeks help from his higher bosses, and they seem to have no end to the controversy. Enter Claudette Colbert, one of the most beautiful, charming and talented movie personalities of the thirties. "I'll take the bottom," she kindly interceded. And there you have, perhaps, the best comedies with baseball teams that have ever met. The film surprised me. I almost always laughed. When, before making a family portrait, Colbert discovered that her future bridegroom was married seven times, the whole theater fell into disgust. When she bargains for money right after she overcomes a shock, the laughter (which still hasn't stopped) intensifies. And Edward Everett Horton also softened some funny reactions from the script. When Cooper draws inspiration from Taming of the Shrew by Shakespeare, punishing his wife by slapping her face, I could not help but laugh when she struck him back. And the drunken scene with green onions is one of the most funny comic scenes of Claudette Colbert. The greatest comic moment in the film came when Colbert knocked out a boxer to "teach his husband a lesson." In pure form, like a gossip, he knocks out the wrong man, instead lulling his friend David Niven. He wakes up when Cooper arrives. To hide the situation, Colbert herself at the moment of strong sexuality brings her fist to Niven and asks: “Where did this man hit you? Here? Right here? Right here?' and then bam! knocks him again! The film was wonderful, from start to finish, it was a perfect delight. I also really liked “Design for Life”, although, I dare say, I think that for the sake of pure laughter and entertainment, “The Eighth Wife's Wife” was a better and more enjoyable film. There is some beauty to see a vintage film on the big screen. And in the presence of other people laughing, he feels more comfortable doing it himself. Perhaps that is why I felt the same way as with the eighth wife of Bluebeard.
