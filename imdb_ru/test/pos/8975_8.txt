Aaron Sorking raises the same questions as Shakespeare. How could they know so much about the inner life of palace life? Here, as in the “West Wing”, Sorkin opens amazing doors that are hardly shocking, but seem to confirm our worst fears. Everything is so random and at the same time so directly responsible for the lives of many people. The plump Tom Hanks somehow tells us that things can be manipulated with semi-pure intentions, but without weighing the consequences, and Julia Roberts in a bright southern hairstyle reminds us of the forces hidden in the side. The topic is serious, but the treatment is easy, smart, but easy. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as an invisible intermediary, steals every scene he is in, just like Charles Lawton in every film he was in. The dialogue is fast, but not so fast, so that we cannot catch up and discover that this is not an ordinary comedy. The seemingly random pace, filled with punches of wit and provocation, gives another badge of honor in the collection of Mike Nikola.
