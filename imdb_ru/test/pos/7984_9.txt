Tim Burton is essentially an expressionist director, not interested in character sizes and possessed of gothic proportions, constantly choosing style rather than content. However, since his style is so piercing, I, like many movie lovers, forgive all the innumerable flaws that can be found in many of his films, and I am absorbed, in fact, by feature films for one hundred million dollars. <br /> I am almost ashamed to see the poetic, emotionally involved spirit in the second part of the mediocre franchise, especially when half-smart 15-year-olds are the target franchise. The return of Batman had to be as commercial as his predecessor, in order to provide box office and cheap (in fact, very expensive) thrills, having fun, not even involving the audience. If this were the result, then Tim Burton would undoubtedly have to send a third installment. Instead, Burton suggests something that can really be defined only by the phrase "there." <br /> <br /> From the sad discovery in which a couple from high society throws a prison cradle in which their newborn child is deformed. in the river it is clear that Batman is returning, this is not a picnic at Buckingham Palace. Cutting down to thirty-three years later, during the political speech of business magnate Max Shrek (ominously depicted by Christopher Walken), a gang of Red Triangle attacked Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returns to this role) first appears with a new logo, eventually saving the day. Soon Shrek was kidnapped by a circus gang and blackmailed to support the political return of the child, now an adult penguin (Danny De Vito in a terribly perfect makeup), whose motives are suspicious only in Batman. /> <br /> Meanwhile, Shrek is trying to get rid of her curious and awkward helper Selina Kyle (which Michelle Pfeiffer played well, who, frankly, deserves greater recognition for her performance), which turns into a delightfully sexy and psychotic Catwoman, thirsting for revenge and cover For some inexplicable reason, a deadly vendetta against the Dark Knight. <br /> <br /> Batman’s return is bleak. The serial design is breathtaking, delivering Gotham city cold pursuit with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. Danny Elfman brilliantly supports the film - from invigorating to tragic. The tone and direction of the entire film is intensely pondering, filmed like a sad nightmare, the direction of Burton overshadows what is true, the devilish scenario with an almost completely irrelevant plot and at the same time is ideal for the visual style of filming Burton. And although Burton's sequence of actions fights for excitement, the real excitement is in choosing the direction that reflects the fall of each of his main characters, the demise of the Penguins, the mental state of the catwoman and the lonely fate of Bruce Wayne. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers hated it, while the audience’s critical reaction was ambiguous. In the end, they wanted Batman to continue, rather than a strange, somewhat horrible horror film, in which a deformed orphan psychopath is trying to kidnap and drown a party of babies, all the time vomiting, which can only be called green mucus. The production company wanted the audience to be comfortable for the audience, something that the McDonald's clan could advertise for their happy meal, not a horrible unsuitable character film, including a sexually repressed secretary, who was pushed out of a skyscraper and enlivened by a gang of cats that awaken her consciousness, chewing on bloodied icy fingers. <br /> <br /> It is easy to understand the massive disappointment that followed the release of Batman Returns. The film never felt like Batman's blockbuster. It is doubtful whether Burton really knew who Batman really was, or even cared about the character as much as about the film, which fits into his usual themes of beautiful visionary artistic guidance and misinterpreted, lonely characters who rarely meet the standards of society and expectations. . That's why Burton failed to make a great movie about Batman. He did however; create a nostalgic and mind-blowing cinema that remains my favorite and nostalgic favorite. <br /> <br /> This may not be the best movie about Batman. But this is a great Tim Burton movie.
