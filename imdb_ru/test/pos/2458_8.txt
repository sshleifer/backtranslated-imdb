Undervalued, invisible gemstone. Estevez does a wonderful job of illustrating in a sharp, heartbreaking manner the tension that arises between the son who was in hell and back, and his parents, who cannot begin to understand the emotional scars left behind. He is no different from the “Born on the Fourth of July” in that he deals with the emotional and mental disorder of soldiers after serving in Vietnam, but while he focuses more on politics after Vietnam (antiwar speech, etc.) with a much more personal topic: Family. The struggle of one person to return to normal life after life experience and the inability of his parents to see the change that has occurred. <br /> <br /> Estevez plays the smoldering role of Jeremy Collier. You may feel pain and frustration below the surface. There to match him inch by inch, his real father, Martin Sheen. This is a journey in which these two are acting against each other, as you have the feeling that they are constantly trying to unite. It looks like each other’s presence inspired the couple to do their best, and their performances triumphed over it. <br /> <br /> Recommended for anyone who appreciates a solid acting, writing and directing. And to any lover of the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> **** / ***** (8/10)
