I have to say that this is the best movie I've ever seen. I know that on this site he received only negative reviews, but this time I would like to be a good person who gives the best film in the world a good review. I find the film very funny, and it has the perfect combination of everything. it makes me feel all sorts of emotions when I watch it, and I can't get enough of it. soundtracks are brilliant. I love it, I understand why people may not love it as much as I do, but I do not understand how people can hate it. The film is 100% shine. Blurred amazing. I never realized that Australian films can be so good, and I also never realized that I can watch one movie so many times in one day without getting tired of it. I think everyone should look at it in order to understand what life was like when you were young, or to see what you do when you reach the end of the year. 12
