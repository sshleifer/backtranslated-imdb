Warner Brothers created this three-dimensional extravaganza, which became the largest commercial success of Westerns in 1953. Guy Madison is leading a group of guard soldiers and picks up rescuers to rescue two white women held by Indians, which, in fact, is in this film. The 3D format was in the early stages of a Hollywood trick to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. Rescuers flee with the women and are pursued by the Indians, until white people get up on the island in the wake of the stream. Indian weapons come to public non-stop, and splashes of tobacco juice, aimed at the rattle, are added for good measure. Madison was quite popular as Wild Bill Hickok TV and is good as displaced cattle, which is entrusted with his thankless task in the army. Despite the fullness and presentation of the film, the film was made in just three days.
