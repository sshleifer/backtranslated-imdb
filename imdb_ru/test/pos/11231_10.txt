A dreamy, breathtakingly atmospheric film takes place in the small town of Northfork, Montana, in 1955. Government officials are arriving to evacuate the city, which will soon be flooded with a new hydroelectric dam. There are other visitors in the city, angels from another time, but only the dying boy Irwin saw them. The local priest (Nick Nolte in a quiet, heartbreaking performance) takes care of the boy. Irwin implores the angels to leave this place with them ... <br /> <br /> There is some kind of unearthly quality in the film, some kind of worthy mourning and sublime sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitability of everything - people and their relationships cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know it. Death and birth have something in common - we experience them in absolute solitude. <br /> <br /> I can’t remember a film that touched me as deeply as North Fork, a film so beautiful and so tender, so quiet and powerful, so heartbreaking and so exciting. Even now, a few weeks after I saw it, I see tears in my eyes when I just think about it. <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I had to talk to someone about it. I sent a message to one of my friends and asked: “Tell me, please, what did I just see?” And my friend answered with the words: “You just watched one of the greatest films of modern times. One of these days others will see the light. ”
