This is one of my favorite movies since my childhood. Being located in the remote Siberian desert at the turn of the century, a small community is agitated when an extremely cold winter forces two tigers to descend from the mountains in search of food that hunt remote farms. In this atmosphere, we meet Avakum, a hermit fur catcher who lives in the wilds when he comes to the village to sell his annual catch to Boris, his close and only friend in the village who manages to keep. At the request of Boris, Avakum accompanies the arrogant son of his friend Ivan on the hunt for menacing tigers. Personalities crash and flare up when the older, more experienced Avakum criticizes Ivan's amateur methods, a clash seen also by other members of the hunt. On the second day, the hunters see their prey and pursue it. In a dense forest, Ivan wounds one of the tigers, who then attacks the unfortunate man. Avakum, seeing Ivan mingle with a furious beast, shoots, but accidentally hits Ivan. He kills a tiger when he runs away. Other hunters arrive at the scene with suspicion. <br /> <br /> Back at the village, the doctor works to save the wounded Ivan. Avakum tries to leave the village, but faces Ivan's friends. The catcher, however, brushes them away, and rides dog sledding. The young villagers swear after him that they will come after him if Ivan dies, which he does later, but before his death he explains to his father that this was an accident. Old Boris, having learned that his close friend ran out of the village, straightens the assembled "crowd of vigilantes" and goes beyond Avakum to find him and fix everything. And so begins the main story. <br /> <br /> A simple film about the conflict between man and civilization and nature, mainly about Avakum’s struggle for survival in solitude in the desert. Winter landscape is very well shot. Perhaps the strongest element in the film is Jimmy Haskell’s soundtrack. Very sentimental and memorable, the main theme resembles Adagio Albinoni. Other movements reflect the Russian style, as well as several melodies in the style of folk music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is not available for purchase, as far as I know, which is pretty annoying. My copy, taken from television almost twenty years ago, is gradually getting worse. This film is definitely worth seeing for those who can appreciate it, if it can find it. 8/10
