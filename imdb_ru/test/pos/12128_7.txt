In New Jersey, a very accurate depiction of the life of a small crowd. The plot, characters and script are plausible, but the action throws the ball. Nevertheless, it is worth seeing, especially the strong images, some of them are still with me, although I first saw it 25 years ago. <br /> <br /> A young hood comes up and starts doing big things (trying), but these things are not going on, which makes the local boss suspect that his end is confusing, and this is not the best place if you enjoy health or life. <br /> <br /> This is the film that introduced Joe Pesche to Martin Scorsese. Also present is the multi-year screen guy, Frank Vincent. Strong on performance and visual effects. The sound is tangled and most of the acting skills are amateur but a great story.
