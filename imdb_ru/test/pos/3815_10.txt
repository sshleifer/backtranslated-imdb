It's amazing what you can do with a little money. "DEAD SILENT" is a low budget film that keeps its promises. <br /> <br /> It’s a pity we don’t see Rob Lowe on the silver screen more often. Lowe is at his best on this exciting thriller. Not surprisingly, he moved from DEAD SILENT straight to the mega-hit The West Wing. <br /> <br /> DEAD SILENT 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Sputtosi Toronto.
