Well, I'm not sure that this is considered a spoiler, so I still ticked to avoid trouble. <br /> <br /> I noticed that opinions about this film seem fair. I personally liked it, although I have to say that I think that some of the cameos were there in order to have a cameo. (Peter Kay?) Personally, I’m just grateful that it wasn't Edward, Tubbs and Papa Lazarou’s show, and that they chose the top 3 characters in the series to headline the film, especially Sir Goff Tipps, perhaps the funniest of the heaps. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is not a summary, but rather a rather stupid thing, similar to a blog, but, damn it, the movie was awesome, and I think that is all that matters.
