A fascinating story about stabbing in the back behind the scenes. The film tells about the plight of David Letterman and Jay Leno when they fight for the elusive place Tonight Show. Letterman, led by his desire to take the desired time, and Leno, headed by his agent and little devil, Helen Kushnik. <br /> <br /> Kathy Bates (Kushnik) is great in this film, alienating Sama from such best dogs as Bob Wright, Warren Littlefield and Howard Stringer. At the end of the film, you are so fascinated by how she copes with any situation, starting with booking a guest and ending with a delayed taping that you discover that you want more. <br /> <br /> John Michael Higgins (Letterman) plays his part in the game. Sometimes I wondered if he had anything to do with the real Letterman. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of corporate bargaining.
