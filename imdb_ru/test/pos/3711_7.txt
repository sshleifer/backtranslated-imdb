This short Oscar film (40 minutes), based on a short story by William Faulkner, takes us back to the small town of Tennessee in December 1941. Two brothers, one about 18 and one about 8, are looking for bird eggs (obviously, Huge collectibles for boys in the south at about this time). Well, the Japanese Pearl Harbor bomb and the older brother, Pete, decide to enter military service. He gives his prize egg to his younger brother Willie and sets off, wanting to show more emotion and tenderness to his little helper. Well, Willie has none of this, if Pete can be a soldier, then he can. He goes to Memphis, showing his stubbornness and determination when he gets several adults along the way. Having found a recruiting station in Memphis, he demands that his brother pull out a knife on the lieutenant and wound him in the process. We show the devotion and love of a little brother (Jonathan Furr). He demonstrates the impeccable role of a stubborn strong-willed boy in milder times last year. The film tries and basically manages to show how brothers can show the loyalty and importance of family ties in their youth. Soon both brothers will be reunited, and a cathartic cry will be heard in the film, as brotherly love envelops us all. <br /> <br /> This film looks like a cold bottle of water. Maybe Dasani or Aquafina, good, clear water with a fragrant mineral package, but not pure natural spring water, like Evian. Nevertheless, he quenches his thirst, and you do not doubt his purity and the effects of quenching. It works more at the factory and is cheaper than some, but it does the job, leaving it updated and detoxified. 7/10
