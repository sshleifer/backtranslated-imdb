First, the apparent mental drama has passed into the funny Kvey melodrama. confusing, outright independent and a threat to platitudes. Aplomb Zhuvta found a good use in the hard actions of a policeman, immediately noticeable in his strength and bright strength; his Antoine is not so much a man of intelligence, as a man with great life experience and earthly instinct. QUAY ?? not disruptive in the sense that today's (and already yesterday) ordinary people like to use this word. This is Cloz's most playful hour. He tended to adapt the books of Stimen in a satirical note. (It is said that Clozot was a great reader of detective novels.) As a director, Clozot's strong hands are successful. <br /> <br /> This is not a mystery or a thriller, but a satirical look at the Paris couple and the actions of the police. Those who are accustomed to the masterpiece of Clouzot LES DIABOLIQUES, can find a little embarrassing variety of things, styles, elements in QUAY ??. Here, Clouzot talks about many things, about a couple and a hidden love story (Simone Renant for Blier), about the entertainment world and about old maids, about police techniques and about the old bitter cop with a boy who needs to be raised, etc. There is a touch abundance not only performed by Jouve, but also in the concept of the film. <br /> <br /> Quay is a realistic crime drama created as a satyr. He offers an outstanding performance by Jouve as a tough police inspector. Antoine is an old cop with an adventurous past (he fought in Africa, but did not climb the stairs due to his independent behavior); he lives with his son, a schoolboy; At work, Antoine is cruel and merciless, a capable inspector, bitter, intelligent and stern. This is the role of great pleasure, very picturesque. Jouvet composed his character of several characteristic features - his clothes, his expression, his funny accent, his cruelty and this mocking air ... Antoine does not make him look smarter than believable; when he interrogates Blière, Antoine makes mistakes, and his talent is presented as a talent that we encounter in real life, mixed with errors, spaces and flaws. Antoine's talent — one that comes from experience, from daily observations — is not nearly a supernatural brilliant gift from almost all known detectives. <br /> <br /> QUAY ?? Many-sided is a realistic crime drama, as well as satire and melodrama. It can be considered one of the first sketches of the film in the legendary fortitude of the French police. Long ago the stern policemen of Eastwood and Wayne, there was Antoine. <br /> <br /> The title is interesting, suggesting that this is a film about the police, and not about a case or a riddle. <br /> <br /> Like skill, Clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in France (as were Wells). QUAY ?? This is very true for the nature of Closo - sardonic comics, abrupt observations, great psychology, sharp, not sparing irony. This man was first in class when he was shooting something - he knew what to shoot, what to choose - to see the opening scenes of this film with great success by Jenny Lamour on stage. Each scene is remembered, simply removed. Clouzot's technical, stylistic addictions were awesome. His style is inventive, satirical, sharp, extremely transparent, brilliant. <br /> <br /> Jouve's style was bright, powerful, passionate. (Some people didn’t like it because of these peculiarities. Since he was a great theatrical actor, his style of the film was considered too theatrical, etc.). His Antoine is an excellent example of what was meant by role creation through composition. <br /> <br /> Jouve had a very peculiar physiognomy - very much like a threatening bird of prey - something like Van Cleef - but still much more subtle, noble, more intelligent and outstanding. Jouve had this predatory, fierce air, and he is useful here because he performs the old tough cop. One of the parties to QUAY is that this is a Jouvet recital. He is immediately recognized, recognized by the quality of his play (I see that many who watch this film do not know that this is the film “Zhuve,” which in itself is an amazing quality). <br /> <br /> Frenne and Juve are two French actors who I admire most; The first one was shown to me in the drama of Renoir (famous), and Juve - in the comedy Carne. I was fascinated to see that Kluzo gave them both leading roles. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a few words about Stiman; he wrote the novel used by Clouzot (who had previously adapted another Steeman novel, like the comedy Fresnay). Steeman was the author of the mysteries of the old school, in the spirit of Wallace. He quickly outdated with a new hard-boiled fashion. When I was 11, I read one of his thrillers, and I really liked it.
