An Arab American man was abducted from an American airport and taken to "somewhere in North Africa", where he is being tortured. Cause? A well-known terrorist called his mobile phone. The CIA decides to avoid legal means to determine if a phone call is a consequence of guilt or just a mistake. After watching this movie, we can only pray that a terrorist would not accidentally dial the wrong number! <br /> <br /> In addition to issuing, there are several related side stories. One of them concerns the daughter of the chief of intelligence (secret police?), Who tortures the suspect, and her involvement in her lover, who turns out to be in a night school for suicide bombers. This story is too contrived, but nonetheless intriguing, especially when we see its outcome. The director uses a neat switching timeline to attract an audience. <br /> <br /> The second incident is an attempt by the suspect’s wife to find out what happened to her missing husband. She makes the old lover help. He (the muffled Saarsgard) is an adjutant of the senator (Alda) and soon begins to freeze when he realizes that his work is not worth revealing the truth. Witherspoon is lost in this role. All she has to do is look miserable and pregnant, with one brief fit of rage. The strip is good, cold and stereotypical, like a government. (CIA? NSA? Homeland Sec?) An official who seems to be a clone of Cheney. <br /> <br /> Hilenhall was also wasted as a secondary analyst in the area he was above, although in the end he was doing the “right thing”. <br /> <br /> I found the film fascinating, although somewhat languid, but I thought it had added little to the subject. This, of course, should not be seen as final, and it certainly has an ax for grinding. Like the "Kingdom", it scratches the surface of a very complex object. <br /> <br /> The film is struggling to give us an idea of ​​the program, but it can only end up being a “warning story” about one unfortunate story. one. The whole point of extradition is not to “torture”, but to “suspected of terrorism” transmit information, avoiding legal (and therefore preventing) barriers. Of course, torture can be used, especially if it is not from our hands - although we are obviously not innocent in this matter - but information that can save lives is vital in this “shadow war”.
