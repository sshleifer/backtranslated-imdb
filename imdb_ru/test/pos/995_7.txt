The stars Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller in the story of two women in the life of Dylan Thomas. Knightley is the childhood of Thomas, whom he again meets during the Blitz. When they meet at the bar, they reunite, but everything gets complicated when Thomas brings his wife (Miller) the next time he meets her. Women cope with this, and everything continues at a pace until a man joins Knightley as the trio. This further complicates the situation when jealousy begins to manifest itself. <br /> <br /> It is pleasant to look at her, she is unusually written and works beautifully (all disappear completely in their roles). This is a luxurious feast for the eyes and ears. It is so nice to watch a movie that adults are adults. On a purely intuitive level, I really enjoyed watching the movie, because the film is so artistically pleasant. Rarely have I ever seen such a beautiful film. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that I'm not quite sure about everything that happened. It seemed that something was missing, and I had to play the film a couple of times to see what I missed. This is not bad, but not entirely satisfactory as a result. (I tried to watch online to see which part of the movie is true, but I couldnâ€™t find anything) However, I think this movie is worth seeing. This is an excellent film for adults, in which, probably, the best acting game.
