I'm a big fan of horror, and I really liked this remake. I think that with all these horror remakes it is one of the best attempts. <br /> <br /> I watched this with my two younger sisters and I think it got even better since they were scared. Also, with shouts on the screen "Do not do it!" <br /> <br /> Overall a decent movie.
