Half comedy, half romantic, the story is simple and unambiguous." Atmosphere "Warm and sunny, and various stereotypes (desperately unorganized or romantic Italians, serious, stern-looking Germans and phlegmatic and pragmatic British), although unoriginal, are still ridiculous. Nikolai Piovani’s musical accompaniment also adds to Mediterranean color. br /> Although this is far from "Tea with Mussolini" or "La Vita E Bella ”,“ In Love and War ”is a very simple film that will make you smile and even get a little tan on your face.
