There are several things in life that we cannot experience more than once, and college experience is one of them. Especially if we live in a foreign country and in an apartment with 6 fools from 6 different countries. The main character, Xavier, leaves his life in Paris, his hippie mom and beautiful girl, and goes to Barcelona to study Spanish in order to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a French doctor and makes friends who make him look at things differently. When Wendy's brother (Wendy - one of the roommates) comes from England, the film starts to become much funnier. Well, anyway, Xavier begins to see things with his new friends differently, and he probably lives in the fact that he will never forget and will change his life forever. In general, a very good nostalgic film, which becomes even more interesting because of the multinational composition. I thought it was very interesting that you could see all these children from different countries, they all spoke different languages ​​and had different cultures, got along with each other and had fun. I gave him 9 out of 10 because I left the theater with a smile on my face and thought about things that I had not done while I was still in college and would like to do before it was too late.
