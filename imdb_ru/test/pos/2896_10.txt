This long-awaited DVD memory of Rush’s visit to South America in 2002 is perhaps the best rock video ever recorded on a disc. The value of creating images and sound is amazing, especially since they constantly struggled with the elements to take off this production. All the tracks you expect from the RUSH catalog are here from Tom Sawyer to The Pass, superbly reproduced for the frankly orgiastic Brazilian crowd. They actually sing YYZ, which is instrumental, and gives you an idea of ​​their zeal! The first disc is a concert, the second disc contains 3 multi-angle sets - Villa Strangiato, YYZ and an amazing drum solo, as well as a 30-minute documentary about visiting bands in Brazil. In general, this is a triumph, and all serious fans of classic rock should have a copy.
