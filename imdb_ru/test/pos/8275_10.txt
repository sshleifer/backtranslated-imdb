PLOT IN NUTS: Dave Sevil, the father and manager of the Chipmunk brothers Alvin, Simon and Theodore, went on a business trip to Europe, leaving the boys at home with Miss Miller as an observer, much to the chagrin of Alvin, who wanted to go to Europe. Playing against her woman, Brittany, the leader of Chipette, consisted of her younger sisters Janette (woman Simone) and Eleonora (woman Theodore) in the brutal arcade game "Around the World in 30 Days", they attract the attention of two evil foreign brothers and sisters who need smuggle money and diamonds around the world, but they need a way that does not attract the attention of their sworn enemy Jamal. Two evil brothers and sisters, Claudia and Klaus, overhear the banter between Alvin and Brittany and decide to use them as couriers and girls for booty (Claudia’s idea is more than Klaus’s, the latter initially objects, considering it too dangerous for children). Two brothers and sisters make an offer to boys and girls - travel in balloons to 12 places to leave dolls (which resemble children) with diamonds and / or money to indicate their arrival, with the promise that whoever wins the race will receive an obscene amount of money. But when two different sets of talking animals of brothers and sisters make detours, they are pursued by the minions of Jamal - but who is Jamal? Is he friend or foe? <br /> <br /> GENERAL INFORMATION: A pleasant, carefree farce based on the 1980s Alvin and Chipmunks television series. Beautiful animation is a highlight, it lacks coarse humor, which penetrates into modern family films and fascinating songs (Boys & Girls of Rock & Roll stand out) Eagle-eyed fans will probably notice that Brittany’s character design has been changed from the animated series, giving her a less round face, adding a seemingly permanent blush on her cheeks (which also show Jeanette and Eleanor). <br /> <br /> rumor Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson.
