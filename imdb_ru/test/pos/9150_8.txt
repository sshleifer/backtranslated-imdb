Francois Villon was a real poet and rogue who lived in Paris in the 15th century. However, much of what is depicted in this historical film is in fact an invention - a play created at the beginning of the 20th century. While in the film he met and became friends with Louis XI, he actually died at the age of 30 and was never involved in all the intrigues he was in this film. In fact, he wrote some beautiful verse and was often on the wrong side of the law — not in combination with a patriot and a hero like Robin Hood, as in the film. If you know that the film is almost 100% fantastic, then it’s worth seeing - just don’t think this is a good history lesson. <br /> <br /> Villon's “Sweetheart Swindler” is played with wild energy. John Barrymore I was also very excited when I saw that his three friends were playing very familiar faces. Angelo Rossitto, who was a brave dwarf, played in tons of films over the years and had a very long career. Slim Summerville was the character of an actor known for adding comedies to films. Mack Swain is best known as silent film in many short films by Chaplin and played his partner in the Golden Rube. All four of these people did an excellent job and didn’t complain - even though Barrymore had an overwork that was quite similar to Douglas Fairbanks’s performance. However, the performance, with which I had serious problems, was with Conrad Weidt in the role of King Louis XI. Calling it "unconvincing" would be a gross understatement. He played the role of a high school student who thought he had to be a stereotypical Richard III — hide and act like a demonic caricature. While Faidt was wonderful in many, many films (both quiet and sound), but here he is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> With regard to history, it is full of lustful adventures and action films - like nonsense, with the exception of the movie sailboats. The kits worked well for all of this since they were used last year for HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. Both films were shot at about the same time. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of the latest great silent movies. The film has a lot of interesting things, and the film is a great combination of romance, comedy and action movie. Worth seeing, although he loses a couple of points for Feidt's reassessment, as well as for how the film plays quickly and freely with history. <br /> <br /> By the way, this film was also shot twice as much as if I were KING (1920 and 1938) and, apparently, these two films are closest to the original play. However, only six films were about Villon and they tell, more or less, variations of the same story!
