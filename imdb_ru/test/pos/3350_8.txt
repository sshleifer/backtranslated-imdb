What can you say? This is uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It works also with a large energetic composition, presumably enjoying the hilt, and while one might want a re-mastered version, I guess we were lucky to even have this video broadcast. Pretty much ecstasy everywhere. There are a few things that a little dislike, but it might be embarrassing all over, and this is certainly not the case. It could also be too lager today. No, a very good effort, funny, melodic and quite sexy. Excellent performances, especially Christine DeBell at the head, and whether it was an uncredited Richard Prior as the inclined Knight, who rode vigorously (if carefully)?
