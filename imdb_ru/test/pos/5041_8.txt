The 1996 MICHAEL is a warm and winning comedic fantasy, featuring one of my favorite shows from the John Travolta Library. Travolta gives one of his easiest and most pleasant ideas in the role of Michael, the archangel, whose quiet existence in the house of a lonely hotel owner named Pansy (Jean Stapleton) is disturbed when Pansy announces the presence of Michael in her house in a newspaper like "National Enquirer" . and the editor (Bob Hoskins) sends journalists (William Hurt, Andy MacDowell, Robert Pastorelli) to the motel to check it out. It hurts, McDowell and Pastorelli are pretty good as exhausted news workers who find it difficult to accept that they met an angel, but this is a Travolta show, and he rules like a pot-bellied, sugar-eating, smelling like cookies, a pie. loving, loving aretha, hunting bull Michael, an angel who is not at all what you think of when you think about angels. And you will definitely enjoy the scene in the bar when he and the ladies dance under the "Chain of Fools". I love this film more and more every time I watch it, and this is mainly due to the completely winning performance of John Travolta.
