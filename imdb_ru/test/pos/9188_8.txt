It was a film that, in the end, I thought: “Now it was a pleasant 2 hours!” I hate spending about $ 20 (not counting $$), so that my husband and I had a feeling “everything was fine ". <br /> <br /> I think I like Will Smith more as a comedian than as an action hero. He was good at it. His character was very pleasant, as was Kevin James. <br /> <br /> There were several scenes laughing out loud. This is also a romantic film, so guys, if you want to impress the girl in your life, take her to it. Women will like it just like any other, but I would not attribute it to one. It has a lot of male humor that men can enjoy. I think this is one of the reasons why this film is as perfect as a date film. This is romance and farce. I usually do not really like slaps, but this is not exaggerated, and I can not remember any of those scenes that did not bring laughter. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband told me after it was over was, “I want to see it again!”
