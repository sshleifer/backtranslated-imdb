Warning, contains spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Italian meanness movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot depicts a teenage girl interested in the occult and possessing supernatural powers. Her mother is a member of a satanist group and is afraid of how this will affect the girl. No need to worry, the girl knows what to do, and she has no return, she belongs to Satan. <br /> <During the movie, strange things happen in a typical way, italo, not too much logic, but that is only good. It's amazing how interesting these films are. In the final battle, we see how she and her mother fight each other (nude) of course) and doing some mysterious rituals, you can guess who will win ... Final shots of the films leave your mouth open and wandering, why not maybe more movies like this? <br /> <br /> There is excellent music. The whole movie and the actors are pretty good, better than usual in films of this type. Especially Anne Haywood looks and behaves well. He also has some unusual camera. and so on, so it's not boring at all. My rating is 10. <br /> <br /> I hope someone will release it on DVD.
