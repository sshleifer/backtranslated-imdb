Although this film never achieved commercial fame, my experience led me to the conclusion that many well-executed works of art often do not receive mass interest. The storyline depicts a boy who hijacked a car and set off to a surreal, dream-like adventure with a very small base in our concept of time and space. Therefore, anyone who tries to watch this film in terms of its conformity with reality will probably be disappointed; it is not intended to be “realistic”. It is, however, intended to be metaphorical with extensive symbolism, evident to those with excellent attention to detail. In addition, symbolic representations remain open to interpretation, which can be said about many great works of art. Do not be fooled by the cover (if you happen to rent or buy this film) - the film is not what it may seem on the surface.
