James Franco is absolutely cool in this movie. Not only beautiful and charismatic, but sincerely open and vulnerable. At the show in Tristan behind him were people who were puffed up and sullen and did everything with James Dean, but I do not think this is true. The blind spot is proof of his tremendous talent. In this film, he carries a completely different weight. This is a unique presentation. Bitter-sweet and really touching. The lines from his diary cut you like a knife. You feel a keen mind watching his words. Tone is everything. He carries it through action and suspense as well as dark pieces of the gallows humor. I also really like the other two actors. The blonde is absolutely gorgeous, and the man is hysterical in his perverse, steep, courageous courage. Some of the thugs seemed a bit sketchy, but this is really a mini point. The film is absolutely solid, and Franco is cool in everything.
