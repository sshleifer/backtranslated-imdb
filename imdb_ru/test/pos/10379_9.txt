I do not quite understand why some people complain that this film is not a comedy and at the same time is too unrealistic. If it were realistic, there would not be a lot of comedy. I also do not think that comedy should make you laugh out loud twenty times. There was a lot of subtle humor, sweet feelings, and Kim Frank simply portrayed a dreamy character. In real life, there are a lot of people whose facial expressions do not change much, so Kim Frank was fine. I would say that the final was unreal, but happy. This is a carefree movie with a pleasant ending. I like it. Loved it, really. A significant role was played by the fact that Kruger went to Schwedt, and I am glad that they did not show what happened to him there. Showing how he was when he came back hinted at it quite clearly.
