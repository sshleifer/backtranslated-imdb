Once again, I am amazed that Thomas Gibson did not come to head the pack earlier in his career. In this film, Gibson once again demonstrates his ability to understand a character, regardless of his sexuality, social status or nationality. Gibson plays a very convincing gay man of the late 20th century. Gentle, but not feminine, afraid of the basic principles of love, the character of Gibson touches a variety of emotions. The performance of Cameron Bancroft also deserves praise. His need to be a heterosexual conqueror, in contrast to his best friend's “homosexual conquests”, provides a dynamic for relationships that are unexpected in many ways. The chemistry of Bancroft and Gibson is evident from the first scene in which they appear together. There are many panels in this blanket. From fun relationships to direct relationships; from heterosexual relationships to lesbian love studies; This film travels across a wide spectrum of sexuality, based on the story of a serial killer. My only regret is that 6 years have passed since its release, before I opened this film! I look forward to seeing him again and highly recommend him to any Bancroft fan, Gibson or director Danny Arkand.
