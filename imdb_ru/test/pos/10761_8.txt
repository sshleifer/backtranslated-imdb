The eight people who found the previous comments by FIERCE PEOPLE "Psycolicious Me" and "Topdany" were "helpful", as well as any future visitors to the site who saw them before their authors deleted them: these negative criticisms are not only shorter than Mandates site manuals, but they are completely fake, not factual, incorrect and misinformative. For example, Blythe's father is in a coma, and NOT dead - Maya and Finn even visit him in the hospital. In addition, it was the poacher-deer Duane, not Blythe, who knocked Gilly from the maid, etc., pretending to be Siskel or Ebert. Otherwise, include a disclaimer with your comments!
