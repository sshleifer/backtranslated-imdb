Although it was a failure in cinemas, because basically Mylene Farmer, one of the 3 main stars in France, did not play the first role. Fans changed their mind after this and waited for it on DVD. When it was released on DVD this year, it was a huge hit! Other failures were the slow pace and incredible duration (3 hours) at the time (1994), which irritated critics. But the melancholic history makes this slow pace and a long time mandatory. The moral of the film is that you cannot escape the death for which you are meant. This is the same theme as in the movie “Final Destination,” and makes it a Gothic tale. The atmosphere is very melancholic.
