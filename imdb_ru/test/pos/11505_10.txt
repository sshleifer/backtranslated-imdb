“Angels of the Universe” is a pure masterpiece, and it proves once again that you can make a brilliant film with a low budget, for example, “American Beauty” and “Project Blair Witch”. Director Fridrik Tor Fridriksson gives the novel Englar alheimsins a new life on a white screen. The film is a breakthrough in Icelandic filmmaking, because it is the biggest and best film ever made in Iceland. <br /> <br /> The music in the film, played by Sigurros, is very symbolic for the film absolutely brilliant. I recommend to anyone who might think, go and see this film as soon as possible, you will not be disappointed. Would I put on this film to win the award for best foreign film next year? all over the world!
