Chaplin - bun in his last film of 1918, bun, which, it seems, can not go straight down. He spends time "there" in the trenches of the First World War. Several jokes stand out: Limburger cheese as a homemade pomegranate for one. The narrow quarters of the barracks in the trenches, and when Chaplin and his comrades are washed out of the flood bed, these are the main points. Chaplin eventually captures several German soldiers alone, and he slaps the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did this, Chaplin replies that he has surrounded them. Chaplin hides behind the enemy line like a tree of all things, and these scenes are very, very funny. He escapes to a blown-up house, where he meets a Frenchwoman played by Edna Purvans. He is tracked down by German soldiers, again runs away from them, and Purvans is arrested for helping him. Chaplin can quickly cope with the task, striking the soldier and using the form of a soldier. As a result, he, of course, saved Purvans and captured the Kaiser. Along the way, Chaplin uses some sights and a farce when returning German soldiers. With this film, Chaplin explored the possibilities of location during filming, while simultaneously maintaining the attention of the audience for a shorter time that his contract with Mutual Film Corporation rejected. The film also allowed him to ridicule the enemy, which he would do again to achieve greater effect in The Great Dictator. *** out of 4 stars.
