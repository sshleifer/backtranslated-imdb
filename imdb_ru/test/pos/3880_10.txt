I thought it was great! It was great to watch the host track each one of them. Dwight Schulz still looked the same, he almost did not change his views, like Dirk Benedict, he still looked so ugly! I thought Mr. T looked thinner, but it was still great to see what he looked like after all this time. I thought that it was necessary to find other cast members, such as the one who played Decker, and the lady who played Amy. It was just a shame that Mr. T could not arrange a real reunion. It was also a great shame that George Peppard died, thus leaving a space. I only want to now, when I wrote it down to save. Let's hope they repeat it again.
