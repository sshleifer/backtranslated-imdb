Like many, I first saw The Water Babies in childhood / adolescence in the late seventies / early eighties. Since then, he has stayed with me with his memorable melodies, memorable images, less successful animation and history, full of heart, coldness and, ultimately, good, victorious evil. I recently sat down and saw him again, at least after two decades, and noticed that this time he was strikingly similar to the Wizard of Oz. No, these are not obvious similarities, but listen to me. In this we have a boy and his dog - with personal problems in the “house”, running away from something and on the stage immediately after they run away, changing the essence of their appearance. In this, the boy and the dog become animated. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy and Toto are in color. In this story, the boy and the dog are told that they have to find the Water Babies for answers, and then, ultimately, the Kraken for guidance, and he can let Tom go home if he shows that he has the courage, etc. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy also has to find an authority figure that checks her before he lets her go home. In The Water Babies, Tom meets three characters who will help him on his journey to the Water Babies — Dorothy also has three assistants. When every helper is met, we are entertained with the rendering of “Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, HI Cockallorum ... We are on the way”. In the master it is "We go to see the master." Dorothy has a good witch who looks after her; Tom has a woman with many roles (Billy Whitelow) doing the same. If you look closely at them, there are many other similarities. That being said, Water Babies is by no means a fake, I just commented on the terrible sympathies between the two. This film has some solid performances from the bad guys Bernard Cribbins and the always charming James Mason. Children playing Tom and Ella are good. The supporting cast of Joan Greenwood (I love her voice!), David Tomlinson, and the vocal talents of John Pertweigh and Lance Percival complement this mix significantly. I have to admit that the animation is less than sterling, even for its time, but adequate enough for a challenge. The three animated characters that help Tom get home are cute. I always have trouble picking my favorite French swordfish and John Inman / Mister. Humphreys, like a seahorse. The scene where we hear this guttural maniacal laughter from a shipwrecked ship and see a seahorse with a huge polka dot bow tie always makes me roll! Watery kids are a lot of fun. Of course, this is more a children's film, but in my heart it will always be and should be. Much of the merit in the success of the film should go to director Lionel Jeffries. Jeffries is a great comedian, and his sense of humor is clearly visible everywhere.
