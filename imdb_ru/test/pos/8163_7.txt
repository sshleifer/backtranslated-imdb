LAST DAYS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Trouble erupts when a lover from Los Angeles (Wes Ramsey) falls in love with a beautiful Mormon missionary (Steve Sandvoss). <br /> <br /> This film, which has received immense recognition in the festival scheme and in a limited theatrical release, debuts as screenwriter S. Jay Cox (SWEET HOME ALABAMA) - This is an “attraction of opposites” exercise in which Ramsey is superficial changes forever after he fell on the vulnerable beauty Sandvoss, who is limited by the requirements of his religious beliefs. Here, the path of true love is paved with difficulties, and not least the response of Sandvoss Mormon friends to his newfound sexuality, which leads to his separation from the church and the anger of his indignant parents (Mary Kay Place has a small, but destructive cameo, like an offended mother boy). But Cox’s scenario is mainly focused on Ramsey’s ransom path, because his hedonistic lifestyle is disorientated by Sandvoss’s influence and responsibilities due to his growing maturity: he voluntarily acts as an outreach participant, delivering food to people living with AIDS living at home, resulting in an unexpected friendship with the former party-goer Erik Palladino (TV "er"), whose illness gives Ramsey a much-needed signal to wake up. <br /> <br /> Cox's script is permeated with succulent one line and various pearls of wisdom (about Mormonism: “Does your church not like alcohol or homosexuals? Well, I definitely do not join - I cannot imagine a paradise without both!”), and the characters are surprisingly complex and well drawn. Ramsey has a spectacular, sexier role (he first saw that he was doing something rude with a willing participant!), But this is Sandvoss, who has become something of a gay icon, with his empathetic image of a good-natured innocent whose journey from Darkness to Light leads to a startling revelation about his place in the world around him. He and Ramsey are well chosen, and behind their inevitable sex scene (short but memorable) is a convincing sequence in which Ramsey describes the childhood trauma that determined his life today. <br /> <br /> Shot for hi - due to a lack of video and a 35 mm broadcast for a theatrical exhibition, the film’s meager budget limits the scope and greatness of Cox’s ambitions, although the characters and situations are strong enough to survive this minor flaw. Jacqueline Bisset shines like a wise restaurateur at a diner where Ramsey is waiting at the tables, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (“The Third Stone from the Sun”) steals everyone's thunder, like Sandvoss, a Mormon, unlike his friend's relationship with Ramsey. by religious principle ... but ONLY by principle. Despite the fact that in some places this film is a bit unnatural, it suffers from romantic longing and deserves praise for its honesty and compassion. It is best to look with a crowd of like-minded people, preferably with a loved one on your side.
