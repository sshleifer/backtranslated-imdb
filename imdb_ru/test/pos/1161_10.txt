I really like the wind and the lion. It was a good movie. I thought that since I was young, and it was done so long ago, I wouldn’t like it, but after I saw it, I was amazed at how good it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone I showed liked. I liked it because it showed how Germans, French and even Americans treated Arabs and people in Morocco in the early 1900s. If I were a high school history teacher, I would definitely show it to my student, from the point of view of a high school student. I give this film a good 10 out of 10. My grandparents liked it so much that they bought it for themselves. My little three-year-old cousins ​​even sit down and watch it. <br /> <br /> Systemoffell
