"Nazarin," directed by Luis Bunuel, presents an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico. As the director wrote and Julio Alejandro, his famous co-author, this film put Mexican cinema on the international map after receiving the Cannes Grand Prix this year. This is a disturbing film, because Mr. Bunuel deeply delves into what is wrong with the church. <br /> <br /> Nazarin, by all accounts, is holy. This young priest lives in a poor pension in the city. He does not have enough of himself, but he does not object to parting with the coin when a beggar appears at his window asking for help. At the same time, he takes a prostitute into his small room who has suffered in a fight with another woman. Andara, the woman thanked him for his kindness, burned the room and the whole building! It is evident that Nazarin is taking him to the village, asking for food. Andara and Beatrice, two prostitutes from his old city, follow him. Life Nazarin parallel to the life of Jesus. In fact, this holy figure speaks of humility. <br /> <br /> Of course, Mr. Bunuel did not mean religion when he and Mr. Alejandro took over the creation of this film. The irony is that Spain welcomed him after the release of this film, because they saw in him Christian qualities, although in reality it is a sharp satire on the Catholic Church and its ministers. <br /> <br /> Francisco Rabal, Spanish actor, makes a wonderful Nazarin. It was one of his best roles. Mr. Rabal has worked extensively in his home country, as well as in Mexico and Argentina. Rita Macedo, like Andara, is also gorgeous. Marga Lopez also makes a valuable contribution to her image of Beatrice. <br /> <br /> A magnificent film by one of the leading filmmakers: Luis Bunuel.
