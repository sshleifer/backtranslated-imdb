I watched this film in 75, and this film was for me a kind of open look at how important it is to take care of nature and wild life. When I got a dog in '83, I called him TRUSKA (in the film ... Avakun's dog), never to forget this film. <br /> <br /> By the way, I have a copy of this film, but in Portuguese, and the quality is not as good as the DVD or the new VHS (I recorded almost 20 years ago and with a fast SLP. so the quality is not very good ..) <br /> <br /> If someone wants to copy ... I will try to convert to DVD and can send for you, ok? <br /> <br /> Ot's a great movie, and I agree that this is a movie that you should always watch. <br /> <br /> Waldemar Braz - Sao Paulo / Brazil
