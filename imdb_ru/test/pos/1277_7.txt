The following is a little-known British film of 1998, shot with a budget of £ 8,000 and a duration of 70 minutes. Watching this, you never expect its director to continue doing it in Hollywood and become one of the most famous and famous directors of the 21st century ?? well, everyone must start somewhere, I suppose. <br /> <br /> The director of the Follower, as you probably already know, is the Englishman Christopher Nolan, who immediately after the Follova will be the director of the independent film Memento; a few years later he was hired by Warner Bros. to lead the new Batman series, which gave him more recognition, and so on and so forth. I want to say that everyone should start with something ?? even if this is not the most striking debut ?? and Christopher Nolan presents himself to the world in 1998 with “Following.” <br /> <br /> Watching this, I could not but go with another directorial debut, director-avant-gardist David Lynch. The following is not a surreal psychological horror film in this sense, but the similarity is noticeable; Most notable is that it is shot in a grainy black and white image and has an atmosphere that makes it unique. It is difficult to describe in words, but it is faintly reminiscent of the smoky atmosphere that could be found in the films “Old Notes”. Therefore, we can say that Following is a modern film noir or neo-noir. In general, this is a merger of this psychological thriller, and the story is most suitable for these two genres. <br /> <br /> The main character is nameless, and the name of the film comes from the early, obsessive-compulsive trait he possessed ?? randomly choosing people on the street and following them, sometimes even for hours. During one of these “tracking expeditions,” the main character becomes noticed by one of the people he follows and encounters him. It turns out that an “adversary” is a person who wants to make friends with our storyteller, and he presents himself; his name is Cobb, and he is a petty robber who invites the narrator to follow him on his thefts. <br /> <br /> From there, the protagonist enters the Cobb world, and he finds himself embroiled in crime, passion and violence, as he becomes more and more intimate with Cobb. The following is not so much a study of the characters, but a film that tells about the tumultuous relationship between these two main characters and the devastating consequences that it has for our narrator. Nolan manages to make the film look like a film noir, and he mimics the atmosphere well. <br /> <br /> Like a thriller, “The Next” is tight and atmospheric; however, as a film as a whole, it is somewhat disappointing. If not for this, then one could definitely call it overwhelming. The whole film was shot in a non-chronological and non-linear manner, and this makes the film’s history and experience unique, to some extent ?? This style has been made so many times, now it is almost an ordinary technique ?? and the story itself is somewhat unique. <br /> <br /> However, the “Next” is ultimately not enthusiastic about the entire film and is disappointing. Does history require more ?? more action, more anticipation and more thrills ?? but he gets too drawn into his own storyline, and instead focuses on creating a complex story. Followers succeed, but without any other elements this is a film noir that does not quite work; he has a feeling of emptiness, which is not huge, but still noticeable. In addition, the shocking revelation of the film at the end ?? almost mandatory convention in noir films ?? one that makes us feel betrayed; it is unpredictable and comes from nowhere, but in connection with the story it is disappointing, since it essentially makes the previous scenes, and the whole film seems like a huge waste of time. <br /> <br /> But positives are far outweigh the negatives, and, in the end, “The Next” turns out to be an erroneous, but satisfactory film. Yes, everyone should start somewhere. Christopher Nolan does it with a follower, and he does it well. Quiet, gentle, but good. This is not the most striking film, and it is not quite worthy of the praise that the director will receive in the next decade, but, nevertheless, he is still a good film. Choosing «Follow», you will find a well-made, tight and atmospheric thriller, which lacks noticeable nuances or innovative style, but nevertheless manages to capture the audience.
