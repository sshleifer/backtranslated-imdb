Superb editing, outstanding acting, especially Epaty Merkerson, and a very nice musical soundtrack. This film dates back to the 40s to comment on the differences in racial lifestyles and some desegregation effect, while he weaves a true story of a truly wonderful and fantastic lady. <br /> <br /> The actor depicting the young character Terrence Howard does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small northern town of New York. The audience laughed, cried and burst into applause from the film and its director. <br /> <br /> Soon the show on HBO (February 7, I guess) - run TIVO and enjoy the great story!
