Bluff I really think this film is very good. <br /> <br /> This is a completely different Colombian movie. It's fun, and the actors use local expressions that cost so much to listen. <br /> <br /> This shows the other face of Bogota, and I think this is very important, because Colombia is a diverse country, and we have to show this world. This is the first film directed by Felipe Martinez, and I really, except for that That this film will be the beginning of a great career as a director. <br /> <br /> We must continue to support the Colombian film industry, because this film and other good films are the beginning of something big.
