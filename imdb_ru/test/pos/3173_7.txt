I am amazed that of all the reviews I looked at, no one seems to have noticed one of the highlights of this film, or at least how I saw it. It looks like one big homosexual fantasy, hiking clothes, the famous naked Ferdinand, a certain sexual tension between Ariel and Prospero and, ultimately, a group of men in tight sailor suits dancing the Hornpipe. This whole approach, once you get used to it, provides you with all sorts of fantastic scenes and images. The sight of an innocent Ariel who is drawn to the hideous naked Sycorax to perform "her earthly and hideous commands" is one of the darkest scenes I have ever seen in Shakespeareâ€™s movie. However, by the end of the film I was tired of style, and the final hornpipe dance was too complicated. In general, this is an interesting interpretation of the play.
