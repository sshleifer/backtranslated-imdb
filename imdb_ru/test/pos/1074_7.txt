This is not really about wine. No, the real goals of Nossiter are those who will simplify and assimilate the peculiarities of local (wine) production for business purposes. To this end, he shot an excellent, objective film. Energetic, noisy, emotional, and flawed independent wine producers are compared with sophisticated media by Americans and long-time Europeans: the art of winemaking versus market, laboratory production of products. This is an open show that does not lead to a conclusion. <br /> <br /> The Nossiter film is sometimes infuriating to watch - the cameras are neither hidden nor steadicam, anyway. There are also many signatures and subtitles, often too short on the screen. <br /> <br /> However, this is superior to Michael Moore in a game that Moore cannot play anyway. Characters speak for themselves and therefore condemn. Worth seeing 7/10
