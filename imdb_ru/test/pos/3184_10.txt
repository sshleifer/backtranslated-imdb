there is only so much that I can take from Filipino films, especially nowadays, when trend is sex, action and comedy (which I hate) the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me watch during the movie was a big plus. He has good cinematic scenes, and editing was great, especially cinematography. I think Claudine deserves a better actress here, and not to get Milan in the film. the fact that there are very few Filipino films that I really like. I think Cholo Laurel did such a great job in this film. I really sincerely loved this film from a technical point of view and in terms of character development; the plot was complicated and that is what made it awesome.
