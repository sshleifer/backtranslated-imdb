I saw this film with a live performance by the Buffalo Philharmonic, and the music was one of two things that definitely made the experience for me; in particular, the song after the battle, where the woman is looking for her husband, was simply destructive. Another thing that stood out for me was the battle on the ice, a bit of strategy, carefully torn by the creators of _King Arthur_ in 2004. In addition, the battle goes on forever (half an hour?) - painfully long. I can't think of another propaganda film that makes war look less charming or useful. I am surprised that Stalin liked this film so much; I would not want to go out and fight after seeing this.
