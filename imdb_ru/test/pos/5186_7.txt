This is a film about the disaster in London. Starting a hurricane, a hurricane and a tornado in Scotland move eastward, sinking down to the coast of England and then southward. After several hours of torrential rains, the London barrier over the Thames will not make it and will pave the way to a catastrophe. Then a tremendous journey on the tidal wave, unrelenting down the East, leading to devastation, and the lives of millions of Londoners in danger. At the center of the story is a climatologist (Tom Courtney), a climatologist who is trying to save London from the effects of a giant wave, trying to convince the authorities that the city dam is unsafe, moreover, a marine engineer (Robert Carlyle) and his former wife Samantha (Jessaleen Gilsig ). They hit the barrier and fell into the sea. Currently, the headquarters of a secret government agency led by Nash (Joan Wally), under the direct instructions of the Deputy Minister (David Suchet), is trying to control many displaced people and to avoid the death of more than 200,000 people. They have little time to save London from a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> Absolutely acceptable disaster drama with normal actions. Magnificent Tom Courtney as a climatologist who predicts a catastrophe and the excellent Robert Carlyle and Jessaline Gilsig as a marriage that incites their love. The film presents spectacular flood scenes that come to life thanks to the exciting special effects of a computer generator, better than the classic of the 70s, for example, “Earthquake Infernally Exalted” and similarly to “Armageddon and the day after tomorrow”. Although this is not a clear condemnation, we know that flooding is caused by the greenhouse effect and global warming, which causes the ozone hole. The movie is well directed by Tony Mitchell. I would recommend this movie to people who love movies about disasters. Another adaptation to floods: "The Flood (1976)", directed by Earl Bellamy with Robert Culp and Barbara Hershey; “Heavy Rain” (1998), directed by Mikael Salomon, Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater; "The Flood: Rampage of the River (1979)" directed by Bruce Pittman with Richard Thomas
