It starts a little slow, but give it a chance. In the spirit of "The most stupid ship in hand" and "Pink Saba" this film is about a not quite orthodox group that uses less-orthodox methods to outwit everyone. Rob Schneider is priceless as LT, who takes himself too seriously, which leads to an unsuccessful rebellious attempt, and the “pirate” team forces him to walk on the board. Unlike Kelsey Grammar (similar to Cary Grant) does not take anything serious except work. This film is more about lines than plot. From the fishermen in Charleston Harbor to the whale bait, their antics caught me off guard, and I laughed out loud.
