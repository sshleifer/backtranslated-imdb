Absolutely different, with a lot of understatement and black comedy, few people will see this film, but those who do this will remember it. This film creates its own universe and fascinates in all respects. What is it about? I believe that alienation is probably to the viewer, but I found that this film is trying to say something about the cold and emptiness of all designer furniture and perfect facades. I do not know if I am right. But this film really got to me. See it. I really hope that the team of this film will make more films, and that they will continue to do it in their own, slightly strange style. And I forgot: Casting is here, I am superb, with Trond Fauz Aurvog, who is ideally suited as an annoying Person who does not understand where he is, what he does and why. Recognition of misunderstanding the purpose of life (in the city) - that is what worries him. All the others do as they are told and pretend that (?) Are happy. This film is a good and humorous commentary on the life of 2006.
