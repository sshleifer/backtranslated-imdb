This film will be especially interesting for anyone who has been in the film industry, especially in any indie role ... those whose legacy includes the introduction of the film may not appreciate it so much. I find it hard to please in the documentary category. This document is different from others - its pleasure comes from the earthly realism of the punk from the film industry who want to be there and watch. If you have ever thought about what it is like to be in a movie, in front of a camera or behind it, or you made your way through the sometimes painful and difficult but useful indie world, you will probably enjoy this movie.
