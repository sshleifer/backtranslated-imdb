The joy and tragedy of the Christmas season is that it mostly revolves around the family. This is why some people call it a â€œchildren's holiday." With age, natural exhaustion and progress remove people and what gave us our special memories. John Denver in one of his nicest roles is played by George Billings, a successful New York architect and a new widower who lost his wife about a year ago. His life is centered around his 9-year-old daughter Alex; both are still grieving for their loss. George does her best to make this special Christmas for his daughter. Enter his boss, Thomas Renfield (fraudulently played by the wonderful Colonel Flagg from M * A * S * H, Edward Winters), who sends George to Georgetown, Colorado, to study a possible real estate transaction. The lie to his daughter that the purpose of the trip is rest, not work, George and Alex fly to the city, where they are immediately met by a group of loving generous, but somewhat eccentric characters, whose main eccentricity is that they all believe in Santa Claus. Georgetown is a community of picture books in which we all would like to live, and we would like people to be neighbors. George soon meets a love interest for Susan (Jane Kazmarek). If it were not for the Grinch (Renfield), it would be the perfect time. But the fact is that he is in the city to find property for the development of Renfield, and there is a good ranch not far from the city, which should be excluded, and the dark edges of the film revolve around the impending foreclosure and the reaction of the townspeople, the ranch and outsiders. I will not spoil the final for those who have never seen the movie. This is a typical happy Christmas ending, but it is processed in a rather subtle and believable way that shows the best in the human spirit without being too syrupy. In general, this is the most pleasant way to spend a couple of your Christmas hours of TV. John Denver and Jane Kazmarek have excellent chemistry, and Jenny James has Alex, a very good job. I always liked the work of Mary Wicks, a recognizable actress, and all the other actors do an excellent job with less meaty roles. This is the usual Christmas fare for my family; I rate it 4/5.
