Many of us who went through high school probably did it well without attending a physics course - I know I did not. But after watching this program, I would certainly like to. <br /> <br /> This documentary is a guide to the "Holy Grail of Physics" - the desire to unite all the fundamental forces of the universe into one "main equation". “It escaped Einstein in the last years of his life. Brian Green, a professor at Columbia University, presents this amazing theory to us in a surprisingly simple way and gives us even greater appreciation for the universe in which we live. <br /> <br /> We start with the tantalizing possibility of a “main equation” that could unite and explain everything ... * everything! * in this universe, including the four fundamental forces that we know exist: electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force and gravity. Green tells us how our understanding of the universe became known through the work of Newton, then Einstein, and then the revolution of physics at the quantum level. <br /> <br /> But it is at this very moment that we are faced with a problem that has tormented physicists for many years and which no one else has yet managed to solve. How can we unite all these forces that we know together? We find, as Green constantly indicates throughout the entire problem, that the solution to this complex problem may be string theory. However, if we want to describe the universe in terms of string theory, we have to pay a very high price for it. <br /> <br /> It turns out, from the mathematical equations of the string theory of the mind, which, as a result, we discover that perhaps we could live in a universe filled not only with the 3 dimensions that we see with you every day plus 1 (for time), but rather the fact that we can actually live in the universe * 11 * size. But the mathematics that follows from this theory does not stop there - there is a possibility that parallel universes can actually exist; some of them are right next to you and me! Can we take seriously such a theory, which leads to such consequences? As Green indicates; we have yet to fully figure out, but we know that the mathematics that arose from these equations already shows us that the universe can still show us much. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are afraid of this, you will not be able to understand the concept of this program - do not be afraid. Professor Green does a wonderful job of getting rid of math and more complex concepts of physics, and instead focuses more on * the concept *, which, when you take all the math away from her, turns from a monstrous beast into an incredibly simple and as Green constantly emphasizes, " elegant concept. Viewers of this program do not need prior knowledge in the field of science; The concepts are so simple that even a child can understand them. <br /> <br /> When you finish this program, you will truly understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe we live in.
