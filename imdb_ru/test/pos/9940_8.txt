If you agree with the outlandish work of the main Italian horror director, who is able to take on his outrageous plot lines and bright style, then you should have a great time with Opera. If you do not, then you will not. <br /> <br /> Christina Marsillah plays Betty, a beautiful young opera back-up who is being shot down (in the avant-garde performance “Macbeth”) when the star of the show is hit by a car. As any specialist who “walked on the boards”, “Macbeth” is known to be a curse, and Betty soon discovers that the series in which she is now a star is no exception: the killer systematically dismisses employees in the theater and poor Betty is forced to watch the sadistic murderer (who writes down the needles under her eyes so that she does not close them!). <br /> <br /> With the help of a little girl who crawls through the air, Betty learns the identity of the killer and the truth about her mysterious past. <br /> <br /> Let's face it. <br /> <br /> Let's face it. ... Opera is one crazy movie, with its ridiculous plot twists, tangled scenes of death and a ending that does not believe. And although director Dario Argento has never been one of, let's say, ordinary plot lines, this particular jallo is so stupid, and there are so many of his signature stylish touches (all of them are overclocked to the maximum) that it is almost as if, with each successive the film he sees what he can get away with (sometimes almost parodying his earlier work). <br /> <br /> That's why I find the movie so funny !!! <br /> Argento's camera movement is absolutely incredible: slips, crawls and, in one amazing scene, even flies the opera house over the audience; the power of Verdi's music is perfectly combined with the synthesized grandeur of the score by Claudio Simonetti, providing a correspondingly grandiose accompaniment of gorgeous visual effects and several outstanding stage productions (including the sickening blood of Sergio Stivaletti) prove that no one does death better than Argento (look at the amazing death of one character in which the bullet passes through a hole in the door in slow motion) and right in the eyes!). <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded to 8 for IMDb.
