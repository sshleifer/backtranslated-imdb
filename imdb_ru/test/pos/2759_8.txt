This game is very good for n64. You can ride like Tony Hawk, Bob Bernqvist, Steve Caballero, Karim Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lazek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Stimer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Musk, and possibly a few more skaters. There is no Mike V or Bam Margera in the game. Dang! Well, anyway, the gameplay is awesome. Level II school is an excellent level, where so much to ride. In career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high points and other things in 2 minutes. There create a skater, which is pretty cool. I created a figure skater named Butt Mulligan, a black guy with an afro and girls' board. There is a park editor, several cool ready-made parks, free skating, and there is one session where you skate for 2 minutes and get points. You can watch replays, which is always cool. Every skater has two styles: A and B. The graphics are not so good. Well, they are good for playing n64. I wish I had a package of controllers so that I could save my data. Overall, this game is awesome. I give it 8/10 for the N64. But with the GBA version this is as much fun as with the n64 version, but rather difficult to control. I give it 7/10 for GBA. So, go to the place where n64 games are still being sold, and pick up a copy. There are also versions for PS1.
