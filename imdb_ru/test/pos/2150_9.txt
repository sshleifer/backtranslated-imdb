This difficult to understand small picture played at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival. This is a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson, using many famous people who sit for interviews, rarely watch television performances and backstage shots of Nilsson at work. There are even a few shots from Son Dracula. This film is the last and worthy tribute to one of the best voices, the smartest composer and the most funny person in popular music. It is a crime that the name of this person is not as well known as some of the songs that he wrote and / or performed. His friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented Hulk with a subconscious desire for self-destruction. As a bonus, you even get Eric Idle, performing the song for the last Nilsson album during the final credits. This is funny, this is sad. This is not a general release. If this picture is reproduced somewhere near the place where you live, look!
