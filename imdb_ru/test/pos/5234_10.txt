I never expected such an old film to be as impressive as this western film of 1930. The scenes of the pioneers heading west in their covered wagons, encountering storms and mud, river crossings, Indian attacks, and all sorts of trials and dangers, are striking in their rigid credibility. Most of the film was shot outdoors, and the film has a truly epic feeling about it. The actors must have experienced almost the same conditions as the original pioneers, and the results are astounding. Cars, clothes, every detail looks and feels good. The characters are simple but believable, with a simple story that travels like a car to its destination. <br /> <br /> John Wayne is slim and young in one of his first roles, being a scout driving a cart, and he works great as an idealistic young border guard. He confronts the amazing tsinovo trio of villains, including Ian Keith as a clever player, Charles Stevens as the Mexican assistant and Tyrone Power, the Elder, as a growing bear resembling a bear. The power of a bearded, growling, more than a way of life, and comical, and formidable. I continue to portray him with a bandana, a gold wedding earring and a black eye patch, with a parrot on his shoulder, when he grunts and growls with various threats and insults. His character can easily be transferred to a pirate ship without any difficulties. He almost steals the whole picture. <br /> <br /> Tally Marshall is amazing as the cunning old frontier guard, who is Wayne's best friend. Beautiful Margaret Churchill makes an energetic heroine, whose initial encounter with Wayne is a ridiculous confusion leading to lengthy courtship consisting of insults and feigned indifference on her part to shock him with his persistence. The results are pretty humorous, and everyone is glad that they will finally gather at the end. <br /> <br /> The landscape is stunning, the wagons cross real prairies, and they have to be lowered onto the ropes down the cliffs. Indians who are genuine articles, not white actors in make-up, look like friends and foes, and they are treated with dignity. Wayne's character tells an admiring group of young boys that the Indians are his friends, who taught him everything he knows about wilderness survival. <br /> <br /> “Big Path” is a simple story told by a talented actor and crew. This will probably seem naive to many modern viewers, but there is a quiet merit in this that never allows it to become commonplace. There is a lot of deliberate humor, including the noisy scoundrel pioneer, who makes loud animal sounds out of hiding, every time a sleek player Ian Keith tries to get a beautiful heroine to marry him. His floral talk about the plantation, which he allegedly owns, is interrupted by very realistic imitations of screaming cats and quacking ducks, with the result that the seducer looks around at invisible creatures with annoyance. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended, as for Western fans and lovers of old films in general. This is truly a classic film for the ages.
