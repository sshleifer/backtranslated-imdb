Until I performed a search on the Internet for “What Alice Found”, I did not understand that the title of the film was embedded in the title of one of the books of Lewis Carroll. The full title of the book is “Behind the mirror (and what Alice found there)”. <br /> <br /> “Alice” of the film comes from a background that is completely different from “Alice” by Lewis Carroll. However, her fresh and energetic nature is similar. Alice begins with a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her boss patting her ass and goes to Miami, dimly planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She meets a middle-aged couple in a motor home (her husband left the army), who save her from a strange person at a bus stop and from a car breakdown (possibly caused by their mechanization). <br /> <br /> As it turns out, the couple is actively involved in prostitution with trucks and sees a sweet young Alice as a promising recruit. Wife (performed by Judith Ivy in a performance worthy of a big award) buys Alice's sexy clothes and shows her how to apply hot makeup. Initially, Alice passively takes her care and, with the instructions of the couple, does a few tricks. The meeting, shown in most detail, is quite different from most cinematic sex, but may be typical of what happens most often in real life. This person is shy and respectful and apologizes for having “finished” too quickly. <br /> <br /> What is surprising about Alice (and different from her prototypes from Clarissa to Sister Carrie) is that she learns from her experience and asserts herself. So it really is. Prostitution is everywhere. People are not all good or bad. Alice leaves her motor home with her well-deserved money and a sense of mutual respect.
