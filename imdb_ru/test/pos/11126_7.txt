"Glory" is a very well-made portrait of students who live at the New York High School of Art. The film tells about a group of students who dream of making it big, improving their skills in the now famous school. Director Alan Parker allows each of the selected students to grow up on the screen, allowing them to feel a connection with each of them. The music here is infectious and fun. Dancing exciting and fresh. Ultimately, the film became the basis for a television series starring Emmy, with Debbie Allen and several other film actors. One of the most enjoyable "dance" films of the 1980s. Got an Oscar for the music. 8/10
