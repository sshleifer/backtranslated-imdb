Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. When I watched this movie, I was extremely disappointed because I was preparing for a reunion. It never happened at the end, which disappointed me without end. But the ending gives an even more cynical shade to the overall cynical film. This is not a film that people are likely to revise, but one hour will in itself have a profound effect on people. At the moment I have not reviewed the film and do not think I can. <br /> <br /> The story tells about the experience of a man, Max, who is engaged to Muriel. He remembers his old friend Lisa (he considers it the love of his life) when he accidentally listens to Lisa’s conversation on the phone. So he tries to find Lisa. Here begins his extremely disappointing search for Lisa. This film has many layers. There are undercurrents of jealousy, voyeurism, and so on. There is another character named Alice who is involved in this mess. The film then goes through a series of turns and finally leads to the final, which can be interpreted differently. It's amazing how there are only four main characters in this film, but clever writing makes it interesting and unique. What I like about this fact is that the film about obsession, jealousy is made with such a light heart. He has a very fast pace, which is probably the reason why a large audience might like it. The main character, Max, has shades of gray, and I felt that the ending was perfect. I do not think that he should be a sincere character, given the fact that he is looking for his long-lost love while he is engaged, and he is also in love with Alice. <br /> <br /> Alice's character is even worse. Her manipulations and her obsessive lies can really annoy the audience (I think that's the point). The scene where she breaks down in front of Lucien truly shows another aspect of her character. This shows her side, which wants to be accepted, and that she is tired of all the lies and games, and she wants to lead a normal life. In the end, she realizes that she needs to get away from it all. The ending gives a cynical touch. Because it seems that Max’s love for Alice is temporary and false. It is as if to say that love in general is a temporary emotion, and it is better to choose a safe option (for example, Muriel) than to pursue something so fleeting (for example, Lisa or Alice). In many ways, this is not a romantic film, but a satire about the novel (in a sense). <br /> <br /> Speeches deserve high praise. Vincent Cassel in the role of Max perfectly performed. He beautifully depicts the confusion of a man who is not quite sure of his engagement. His defiant appearance is an added advantage as it is ideal for the character. But the real star of the film is Romana Beringer in the role of Alice. Her nuance in the image of a woman who is jealous of Alice and loves Max. The scene where she shouts “I am crazy too” really shows her despair and her desire to live a normal life with a man who loves her. <br /> <br /> By the way, I also thought that lesbianism is another interpretation that can be taken from this film. Alice's actions can be explained in many ways. And her unreasonable obsession with Liza can also be explained as a manifestation of lesbian desire. This can be contrived, given that she calls on Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. But I had the feeling that she was a lesbian for a long time. She also avoids questions from Lisa about the guy. She spends a lot of time with Lisa, and she is happy during this time. This may lead many to doubt her sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would put 9/10. I think it deserves it, but I subtracted one because of the frequency of occurrence. I think this is a perfect movie otherwise.
