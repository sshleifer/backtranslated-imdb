When I tuned in to my local PBS station last night to watch the “War That Made America.” I was expecting a boring documentary; instead, I received a very good and believable reconstruction of the main events of that time. Now I see the reasons for the American revolution and the role played by the Indian Wars. Larry Nering - George Washington, and he is perfect for this piece. Camera narration is also a fantastic job. I look forward to next week to see the rest. It's nice to see that PBS really uses the HD format to bring the 1700 straight to our living room. <br /> <br /> I hope Larry Neringa will see more in the future because he is such a talented actor.
