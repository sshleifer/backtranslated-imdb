Awesome 5 star game makes it a must see. <br /> <br /> Based on the stage play “SILVER CORD” about “maternal love” in the worst. The film was very controversial because of his purported homosexuality of the youngest son and the unnatural "romantic" feelings of the mother towards both sons. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunn plays the role of a new bride (and biologist) traveling with her husband (Joel) McCree to visit the family before heading off to New York for work. But something is wrong. <br /> <br /> The mother, Laura Hope Crews, seems like the rude bride of a younger son (Eric Linden) (Francis Dee). But Dunn leaves such thoughts aside and ignores some strange things that his mother says. Then she learns that "her" room is in the corridor from McCree's room, and his room adjoins the mother's room. <br /> <br /> Later she enters, as the "mother" hides McCray and kisses him (on the lips) good night. Mom also worked on Linden and made him doubt her feelings for Dee. Everything explodes, and Dee runs on a snowy night to a frozen pond. When the boys run after her, the mom from the window shouts for the boys to come back and take their coats! Dee falls through the ice and escapes. <br /> <br /> When the girls leave the house the next morning, Dunn tells her mother what she thinks of her and her attachment to the boys. But my mother has a strong grip, feigned illness and eternal boasting of her victims. The girls leave, and the boys are left behind ....... <br /> <br /> The crews are gorgeous, like an insatiable mother (repeats her stage role); Few actresses will play this role. Sexy notes are incredible for the 1933 film, and the crews enjoy her best movie role. Dunn is also excellent as she tries to maneuver without losing McCray. Dee has some great scenes after being confused by a bewildered Linden. All 5 stars in this drama are stunningly underestimated and unknown. <br /> <br /> Abandoned stone for those who love a great game ......
