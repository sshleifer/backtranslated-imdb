Mighty Like A Moose is one of many short films in which director Leo McCary starred in the lead role with Charlie Chase. What a dandy! Charlie and his wife undergo plastic surgery to improve their disgusting appearance without knowing each other. Then they meet at a party and get hit with each other. Now they cannot let each other know that they are cheating. This is the absurd premise of this mad farce. Vivienne Auckland, one of the few humorous shorts that after a long silence makes a successful career, is ideal for Charlieâ€™s wife with a long nose. Charlie has a terrible case with teeth that quickly go to the dentist. After the police raid the party for no other reason than to raid, Charlie and his wife desperately try to avoid each other at home, fearing that the changes in appearance will be known. Both were photographed with their new features at the party. The fun at home reaches its climax in Charlie, who is trying to teach a lesson that deceives his wife. Of course, the bad one is the new Charlie, about whom his wife begins to understand long before Charlie teaches a lesson in loyalty. This is one of the best attempts Charlie Chase. *** out of 4 stars.
