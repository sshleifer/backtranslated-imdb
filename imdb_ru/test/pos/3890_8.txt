Garlin did a great job. Good concept, well executed and thought out. Stumbled upon a very sincere story. As a fan of "Curbing Your Enthusiasm," where Jeff was pretty much a straight guy, I was fascinated by how deeply he brought this role to a simple but effective image. humor was understated and subtle and attracted the urgency that I really liked, rather than being a farce or reappraisal. And there were some pleasant surprises and surprises. The vignettes in the store were delighted. <br /> <br /> When I say that this is a wonderful “small” film, I don’t mean budget or quality. It is simple, intimate and handmade. It tells a believable everyday story. Relax and look at it. Let it sweep over you, and you will feel good doing it.
