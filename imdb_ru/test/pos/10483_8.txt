Stephan Odran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured exploration of a small Danish community at the end of the last century. Two beautiful and musically talented sisters abandon their own perspectives of happiness and marriage in order to look after their aging father. One day the French woman Babette comes to work. After a few years, she wins the lottery and intends to do something for the sisters who accepted her. Her decision - to prepare an exquisite and luxurious feast that will change the lives of all those invited. This is a film about human and cultural interaction, reflected in the change of language of the dialogue from Danish to French, and especially between the obedient sobriety of Protestant northern Europe and the sensuality of the Catholic south. This also applies to human needs and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the development of feelings. Deeply inspiring film.
