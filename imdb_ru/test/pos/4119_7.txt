George Saunders - a forger who steals a rare copy of Hamlet, killing the guard in the process. A few months later, his partner sells fake books for large sums of money. One of the fakes was sold to a Nazi-based man. Not happy with the fact that he was taken away, the Nazi frontman insists on getting his money back, and at the same time an investigator appears working for one of the other deceived clients. The average woman, trying to keep herself safe, starts playing all sides against each other and arranges a meeting in the New York public library between different parties, however, when people start dying, the library closes and new murders are committed (and maybe some kind of theft rarity), it seems, close to what is happening. The difficult murder mystery is a good little thriller with a great cast (Saunders is joined by Richard Denning and a group of solid supporting players). If there is a flaw, the film is almost too complex with plots with plots, and all largely for themselves. The layers of theft, forgery, murder and wartime intrigue (it was in 1942) are almost too much for a short 70-minute run. Nevertheless, this is a small, pleasant film with darkness and a sense of inevitable death for some characters, which clearly marks this as one of the first noir films. Until Denning appears, we are among the charming thieves that we like, perhaps even more than the hero, but it is clear from words and deeds that they will not have a completely happy ending, and they know it even if they fight with by this. A good little movie to look for.
