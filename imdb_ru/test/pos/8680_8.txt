I read most of the comments here, where everyone saw only the flaws of the film. I agree, the director is not Kuprik, the actors are not Oscar winners, but there is something that everyone can relate to. I do not want to spoil, but telling more than the plot - graduation from school and a trip to a big party, or, if you like to look beyond the bounds of metaphor, is the choice of a path through life. Remember those days of youth? days when you or our friend acted like characters? Or do you think that you should behave like one of them, but now you regret that you did not? if you can go back to that time and if you can ask yourself any of these questions, perhaps the film was not so bad.
