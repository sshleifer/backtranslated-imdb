Hell To Pay declares itself to be a renaissance of the classic western ... it succeeds as a Western-style film that the whole family saw, and is not much different from films that show a demographic picture a decade ago. The good guys are good, and the bad guys are really bad! , Bo Svenson, Stella Stevens, Lee Majors, Andrew Prien (excellent in this film) Tim Tomerson and James Drury - they are all great, and it's nice to see them again. James Drury really shines in it, perhaps even better than his days as "Virginian." In a sense, “Hell To Pay” reminds me of those 60s films that featured actors you know from many shows. If you are of a certain age, Buck Taylor, Peter Brown, Denny Miller and William Smith provide the wow factor because we rarely see these badges these days. Hell To Pay features screen legends and new names in Hollywood. Most notable in the newcomers cast is Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah), whom I recently saw in Young and Restless, and Kevin Kazakov, who plays an angry Kirby, a war-weary man who is torn between wanting to live and let live or enter, to "do the right thing." William Gregory Lee is superb as Chance, the naughty and feminine brother of Kirby. Katie Keane plays Rachel, Rebekah's sister, a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive, but gave up her pride in the process. In a small but memorable role, Jeff Davis plays "Cheesy Joe," a former Confederate with a rather disgusting meanness. I think we will see more of these beautiful actors in the future. "Hell To Pay" is a funny movie with a wonderful story to tell. take popcorn, we go to the west!
