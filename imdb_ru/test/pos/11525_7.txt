As a father of four, he was over forty, I thought that this film made an irresistible viewing - if not the material of the extreme place. I deserve a much higher rating than 4.3, which was when I wrote this. (I gave 7). <br /> <br /> I agree with some comments about the characters, but Cameron Diaz again played another completely different role. The plot was a bit silly, but for me the meaning of the film was perfectly summed up in a rather surrealistic last sequence. A moving end for any parent. <br /> <br /> I could assume that a young lonely guy might find the film rather boring, but for other people who have not taken high doses of testosterone, you can find something sweet in this.
