Oz was a fantastic show, while frequent male nudity does not distract you. There was too much male frontal nudity in this show, more than any other show you would see on the porn channel. The minus of this, it was the best show on television, and the previous commentator said that “better than Prime Suspect”. The main suspect is Tom and Jerry against the Simpsons. No contest. If you have DirecTv, they now launch it from the very beginning on channel 101, now they are in episode No. 3. It is highly recommended. Creator Tom Fontana also did Homicide, which was an AWESOME show. But why the whole male naked body? We all know that this happens in prison, but did they really have to show it so often? It was the only thing that distracted me from the show. If I want to see naked men, raped guys, I will kill someone myself and become a first-hand witness. Otherwise, I like my television shows without black dicks every five minutes.
