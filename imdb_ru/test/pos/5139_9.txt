Hoot is a good young manâ€™s film about a group of high school children who are trying to keep a network of pancake houses from building a bulldozer land where endangered owls endangered live. The acting is pretty good, and fresh faces are good to see. Many famous comedians in this film support humor almost non-stop. This is a film for young people, perhaps from 5 to 11 years. I thought it was a good tempo change from adult films that pervade the screen these days. There is no realism or accuracy in life at all for adults or children. It's just a lot of fun with a constant message on how to save the beautiful places in this country from over development. If you can remember the day when you did not fight for the dollar, you can remember that money is not all. Not many people over the age of 12 will like it, unless they have a weakness for the old after school special shows.
