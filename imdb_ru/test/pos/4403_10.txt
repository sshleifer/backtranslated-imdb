The Cohen brothers have truly surpassed themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped prisoners. Although it is based on Odyssey, Homer's ancient work, you donâ€™t have to read Odyssey to be able to follow the story. The Coen Brothers wove a tapestry of celluloid and auditory frills! The soundtrack is an integral part of the film, indeed, the soundtrack is the product, and the film is wrapping paper. Each character is wonderfully exploited and goes back to the times when films were rich in characters, whose appearance in the film adds wealth, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is great because the fat-haired Everett Ulysses McGill is an honest run-up scammer whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are ridiculous and charming. Oh Brother, where are you, you are undoubtedly the best Coen film to date, and also Clooney's best efforts. Clooney is good enough to guarantee a nomination for the best male role, as well as the image of Tim Blake Nelson, depicting a nearby friend Delmar, and the film itself deserves the title of Best Film.
