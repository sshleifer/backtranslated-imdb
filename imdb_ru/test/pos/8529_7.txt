1983 saw a strange phenomenon; two competing Bond films. Octopussy, starring Roger Moore, was part of the official Cubby Broccoli Bond franchise. “Never Say Never”, created by a rival producer, apart from the terrible Casino Royale, is the only Bond film that is not part of this franchise. His biggest attraction was that he returned the original link, Sean Connery; his name, as is well known, derives from Connery’s remarks after Diamonds Forever, that he will never play this role again. Some complained that Connery at 53 was too old for this role, but in fact he was three years younger than his successor Moore, who not only starred in Octopus that same year, but also made another Bond movie , "A look at the murder," two years later. <br /> <br /> The film owes its existence to the settlement of the trial on the rights of the film to the work of Ian Fleming. Perhaps, unfortunately, the terms of the settlement included a clause that the new film was supposed to be a remake of Thunderball, as this may not be the biggest Connery bond. (A remake of "Dr No" or "Goldfinger" might work better). The plot is much the same as in the previous film; The terrorist organization SPECTER, acting together with a magnate-delusion of grandeur named Largo, stole two American nuclear warheads and is trying to force the governments of the world to buy them out, threatening to blow them up if they do not receive a huge amount of money. Of course, Bond must save the world by searching for missing missiles. <br /> <br /> The film is successful because it contains not one, but two of Bond’s most beautiful girls, Barbara Carrera as the seductive but deadly Fatima Blush and Kim Basinger as Largo Domino’s friend, who goes over to the side Bond, learning about the evil plans of her lover. A number of Bond films have a plot that depends on the hero’s ability to defeat the villain’s mistress or accomplice - there are similar developments, for example, in Goldfinger, “Live and let die” and “Live Daytime Lights”, in the official series, Bond’s ally is usually regarded as the leading woman, but here Carrera, playing atrocity, is billed above Basinger, who was a relatively unknown actress at the time. Of course, Basinger was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, and Carrera is one of Bond’s many girls who have somewhat disappeared from view. <br /> <br /> Of the villains, Max von Sydow makes an effective Blofeld, the head of SPECTER, but Klaus Maria Brandauer looked too affectionate and not as threatening as Largo, except, perhaps, during the game “Domination”, a more complex version of those violent computer games like Space Invaders, which were so popular in the early eighties, Brandauer can be a great actor in his native German language, in films like Mephisto and Oberst Redl, but he doesn't look as impressive in English . <br /> <br /> One of the features of the film is that both of them follow the usual Bond formula and sometimes depart from it. This is the standard plot of “The World in Danger”, chase sequences, a series of exotic locations, glamorous women, sinister villains and a specially written thematic song based on the title of the film. However, there is no extended sequence of pre-credits, and we see some familiar characters in a new light. For example, Bond boss M becomes a languid, arrogant aristocrat, his American counterpart Felix Leiter is shown black only once, and scholar Q is depicted by Alec McCowan as a disappointed cynic with (despite his typical Christian name of the upper class Algernon) a clearly working accent. There is also a funny cameo from Rowan Atkinson as the awkward British diplomat. Although Connery was perhaps not entirely good here, as he was in some of his earlier films in the role, these sounds of changes on a familiar topic make this one of the more memorable Bonds. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Fool. Character Rowan Atkinson claims to be from the British Embassy in Nassau. However, since the Bahamas is a Commonwealth country, there will be a High Commission in the capital of the United Kingdom, not an embassy.
