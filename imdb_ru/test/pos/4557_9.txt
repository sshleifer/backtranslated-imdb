This film has it all! He has a good storyline, good acting, great scenery, adventures and great jokes! Chris Farley plays Tommy Callaghan, the mega-successful company Callaghan Auto Parts must take the road to stop the company after Big Tom dies. The trouble is that Tommy knows nothing about brake pads and needs the help of Callaghan Auto Parts employee Richard (David Spade). From the moment the two assholes hit the road, the film became so hilarious. If you like to spank with a great storyline, you will like it, because the jokes go on thick and fast, and the movie makes you laugh out loud! It was so sad about Farley's untimely death in 1997, but the merit of his genius is “Tommy Boy”. Get it, relax and enjoy this brilliant farce!
