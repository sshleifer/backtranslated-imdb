This film has a Spartan, unsentimental edge, which gives us enough space to participate in the action without any stylistic burden telling us HOW we should feel; in "Blue" everything was openly sad (of course, damn powerful, but still); in "White" it was delightfully capricious. But there are no such emotional tips or clues. As if he finally let the power of the tale create his own magic without admiration. I think this is what makes him the most mysterious of the first three, but finally the most transcendent and redemptive. Never before merciless, sparing honesty was so beautiful.
