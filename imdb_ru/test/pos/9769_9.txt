Apparently, this Australian film based on the novel Neville the Jester exists in several forms. Watch out for heavily chopped versions, sometimes shown on cable or satellite, that work anywhere from 95 minutes to 2 hours. Only the full 5-hour version of the mini-series tells the story correctly. This is a very close realization of the story, which suffers only from editorial errors commonly found in television films: randomness and episodic progression. But this excellent cast makes the story very well forward, and in general, their work is accompanied by good performance. Yuki Shimoda is known as “Gunso Mifune”, one of the guards entrusted with escorting women on their painful journey. In the end, he becomes a friend. You will suffer with him when his loss of face leads him to death. Helen Morse in the role of “Gene Paiget”, cute but not very beautiful (she reminds a little of Sigourney Weaver), records only the correct amount of sponka and Vincent, as the case demands, the Mini-Series correctly emphasizes beautiful love stories, three of them: “ Joe ”and“ Gene ”,“ Noel ”and“ Gene ”, as well as“ Gene ”and Willstown. Gordon Jackson plays "Noel Strechen" attractively, but as a slightly younger man than Neville the Jester, mentioned in the novel. The third love affair I mentioned does not receive the proper emphasis because of this, and the full meaning of the name is reduced. Jin is dedicated to bringing business to Willstown, which will attract young women and girls and their civilized influence on this god-forgotten city. She wants to make it "City Like Alice"; This is Alice Springs. We get only a few hints of this in a few scenes. If you have five free hours, this mini-series will be a really rewarding experience. Nevil Shute founded his novel about the cruelty of the Japanese military when moving a large group of women and children from one place to another in the Mailay Peninsula on a true incident. However, according to the Jester, this happened on Sumatra, not on the peninsula. Crucifying "Joe" by a Japanese officer for stealing chickens to feed women is probably an invention, but the cruelty of the Japanese towards the prisoners is certainly a record.
