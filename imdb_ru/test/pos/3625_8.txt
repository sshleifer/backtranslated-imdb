If you have never encountered Zasu Pitts, here is Zasu Zinger! In 1933, Mei Questl caricatured Pitt's voice for the Olive Oil character for the animated cartoon Fleischer Studios from the Popeye comic. Zasu (pronounced Zey-Sue) is trying hard to imitate Olive Oil, walking around the whine and clinking hands or joining the policeman’s laity. I kept waiting for her to say, “ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo” “something always happens to someone”. When I first saw this film, I loved Saas and found that her character was really funny. Since then, I have seen her in other films where she performs the same nagging, stressful, fragile floral routine. So, after watching this movie, I began to get a little annoyed by the constant whining and almost hysteria over a piece of dust. But there are some funny comedy episodes, as well as a mysterious film. This is an interesting mix of riddle and comedy that really works. The mysterious plot is well kept in the camp of Zasu Pitts and James Gleason, who plays Arthur Krimmer as a policeman. The haunted house is fun with a lot of secret passages and even a skeleton in the attic! Worth seeing. Read more public domain movie reviews at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/
