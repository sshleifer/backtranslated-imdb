This film is about the aging geisha in post-war Tokyo. Okin, played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara, lends money to two other former geisha, Tamai (Tikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki), and they are offended that she is somewhat smug. Tamae has a son, Otomi - a daughter who during the film announces that they are leaving them, while Okin, who has never been a mother, visits two men in her past who, it turns out, just want to get from her money. This is a compelling story about what choices you make, what you do to live your life, and to whom you are responsible and obligated. Haruko Sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest actresses of all countries, and she plays mostly an implacable, less compassionate Okina with an atmosphere of excellence that makes you dislike her, but at the same time almost jealous of her. At a time when great films were shot by Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita and Kurosava, among others, Mr. Naruse is already next to him. If you have a regional DVD player, you should try to find two sets of Naruse released in England. I think this film is an excellent study of the nature of women in danger of being irrelevant. That they really do not make this film a true masterpiece.
