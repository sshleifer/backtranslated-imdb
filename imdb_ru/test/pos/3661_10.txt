I was very lucky to see the film Hari Om at the Bermuda International Film Festival. It was a premiere and was such an amazing movie. It was beautifully shot across India, and I want to go there now. The main actor .. Vijay was absolutely incredible. He was the highlight of the film. Apparently he, too, was in the film .. Monsoon Wedding. He was the star of the show. The character of Benoit excited me ... it was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was also gorgeous. They were all great! There were many amazing scenes similar to the monkey scene. And basically I just loved the movie. All who left, raved about this, and it certainly was the culmination of the film festival. Was my favorite from the festival. It really beautifully captured the liveliness of India and cannot believe how beautiful India is. The feeling of leaving the cinema was very high. This is a delightful, happy movie. I like it!!
