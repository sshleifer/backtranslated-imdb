A powerful film that gained much of its value in the second half of 2007 after the new desperate movements of the Burmese against their tyrants. I felt a complicated mixture of feelings for people there, something like compassion and admiration at the same time, and a bit of rage, because I feel that no one, neither the countries of the world, nor themselves, do anything effective to end this shame. I think that these feelings arose directly from the film, and that they were intended when it was made, so this is a successful film. The desire for peace, the desire for enlightenment, respect for life sometimes lead to submission. In fact, it was Buddhist Burmese culture that opened its doors wide to its dictators. But how can you get mad at these poor people?
