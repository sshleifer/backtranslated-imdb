Perhaps the bullets did not rebound from his chest, but the Lone Ranger was for me, as for my other childhood hero, Superman, the symbol of the icon. He represented truth, justice, and the American way in the classic western TV space, living on the principle that he would never use his weapon to kill, while also searching the American south-west with his loyal Indian companion Tonto to bring every criminal to justice . The advent of television provided an excellent opportunity for the post-war generation to find it perfect in a mysterious masked man who defended law and order, while providing unprecedented entertainment for five seasons spanning almost eight years. <br /> <br /> Today I had the opportunity for the first time to view the complete episodes of the beginning of three parts, starting to the end without the standard opening and closing episodes, in order to interrupt the continuity of the story. For ranger fans, this is the great dad of all the Western sagas, telling how Texas ranger John Reid survived an ambush in the Cavendish Buch gang, and how he recovered from his Indian childhood friend. Tonto (Jay Silverheads) declares his companion a “loyal scout” and calls him Kemo-sabe. I read various interpretations of the origin of the term Kemo-sabe, but I am pleased with Tonto's explanation. Reading too much of this just distracts from the story, as does the English translation of "tonto" from Spanish, which I will not disclose, because it is better to simply not know if you can help with something. <br /> <br /> I thought that quite cleverly, as the story of origin created the mystic of the Lone Ranger, like the sixth grave, which created the illusion that all the Rangers died in ambush in the canyon. You never see the face of a person who becomes the Lone Ranger, as he always turns away or hides to hide his real identity. Even the origin of silver is treated brilliantly; the voice of the narrator describing the sterling qualities of a wild stallion. Does this apply to, say, sterling ... silver? I got the biggest hit from this. <br /> <br /> Of course, over time, watching the episodes of The Lone Ranger today gives an idea of ​​how unsophisticated was the show outside of the original story. Some of them are almost embarrassingly stupid, especially when it comes to opening the "Lone Ranger" when he shoots a crowd of bad guys to knock the gun out of the hands of its owner. What about the little wave that he gives to Tonto, when they are going to ambush the bad guys - this is always the same gesture, but Tonto always knows what it means in different circumstances. Then you have episodes when Clayton Moore takes off the mask of the ranger to put on another disguise to impersonate another character serving history. One day, he even came under cover as an actor depicting President Abraham Lincoln in order to uncover a villain, a top hat and all that! <br /> <br /> Few of my fans know that actor John Hart replaced Clayton Moore in 1952/53 seasons in a contract dispute that Moore had with the producers of the show. If you have ever seen the episode "Happy Days" in which Fonzi idolized his childhood hero, you will notice that John Hart was in the credits. In fact, it is difficult to say whether you are watching the episode with Hart or not, the main thing is to hear the voice; Moore is so distinctive that it is a dead sale. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the opportunity to try some of the color episodes of the final season, a treat awaits you. The presentations I saw on VHS are absolutely great, although I don't know if commercial prints are available. Most black and white episodes were repacked by any number of distributors in different configurations, so getting them should not be a problem. Of course, you have to see that these are three parts, and if you don’t watch anything else, it gives you all the taste and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the most famous heroes of the West. Hi-yo Silver, Awaaaay!
