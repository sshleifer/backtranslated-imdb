Jack D. Webbâ€™s film "The D.I" emerged from a real investigation into the death of several interns in a swamp on the island of Paris in the 1950s. As always, Webb, being his patriot, came to the defense just like all the rest of his shows. I actually found this film hand-made by the 1957 standards. I served in the army and I can understand the intensity of training on the island of Parris (someone from the death camp), so this film will never come close, as well as "Full Metal Jacket." I think this is a good film that is more patriotic than relevant. But again, think about the time when it was made (1957), and what could be resolved and said at that moment on the tape. I always found Jack Webb neat and very loyal. I know that many have criticized the film as one-sided and state propaganda. If you feel this way, see 'Full Metal Jacket' with Lee Ermey. I'm a fan of Webb, and I like the film for its merits, not for accuracy. As I said, Webb believed in this country and adhered to high moral standards (LAPD-Dragnet, Adam 12, Emergency, etc.). Just relax and enjoy it from a very strict moral period in this country. Don't be too judgmental with Mr. Webb. Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas ..
