There is one of the best films directed by Andrzej Wajda, which tells about a young writer who is looking for his place after the second war (he survived in a German camp). a great true atmosphere (action goes to a camp for displaced persons), the main character (played by one of the best Polish actors, Daniel Olbrichski) finally fell in love, but unfortunately his lady was killed. There was a beautiful scene when he was talking to an American soldier and said (about the death of his girlfriend) â€œnothing happened, you just shoot at us now ... his state of mind is destroyed.
