If you take Huxtable's parents and mix them with Kyle's parents, you will get the perfect combination of parent and parenting, which you can wish for in your own family parenting skills. The most pleasant thing about every show is that parents don’t leave a pompous, self-satisfied senior class, everyone knows, but at the same time they are not stereotyped, not well-educated parents who are constantly overpowered and their children do not respect. My children are 20, 16 and 6 years old; about the same age as Kyle's children, and I see that their situations reflect my own experiences with the family. The stupidity that they do only says that when there is love in your family, you don’t need to take yourself too seriously to keep the household together and have fun with your children.
