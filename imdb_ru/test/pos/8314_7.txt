This dinosaur documentary was undoubtedly fascinating and very well done. However, I found myself watching many bits with alarm. The film, as a rule, took a fairly confident position with regard to everything that was said and shown, but inevitably much of the behavior of animals, their interaction with each other, how they looked, how they moved, what they ate, etc. In many ways, this is undoubtedly guessing — sometimes guessing with reasonable certainty, sometimes just guessing. But the viewer will never know about it, the film pretends that it actually watches real dinosaurs and their actual behavior, etc. This probably makes watching better than the audience’s confrontation with mountains of disclaimers, but it makes him a little too populist in my assessment,
