Centers on Czech pilots WW2 ?? the senior František, the boyish impulsive Karel and in the background the quiet playing the piano Honza. When the film opens, it is 1950, the war is over, and Frantisek and Honza are imprisoned in a former monastery. In their country now controlled by the Soviet Union, they are "enemies of the people." Gonza is subjected to ill-treatment by his fellow-communists and dies. <br /> <br /> In 1939, many pilots managed to leave the Europe occupied by Germany and head for England, where they joined the RAF. Despite their high motivation and experience, they face the reluctance of the RAF and tough British upper lip. Finally, they fought valiantly in the battle for Britain. However, Frantisek and Karel find that their friendship is put to a serious test when they fall in love with the same woman. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the romantic plot, this is very similar to the Hollywood production of “Pearl Harbor”. However, given the context of the film and the possible fate of Frantisek, the treatment of the English woman with two men can also be considered a symbol of the British treatment of Czech and Polish air force pilots: it is convenient to forget them after the war. br /> <br /> In addition, the film is much less cliché than Pearl Harbor, and the characters are more fully realized. The dark blue world also wins in terms of its stunning airborne air battles, which were easily created using a combination of models, real live footage and footage from the 1969 epic film Battle of Britain. <br /> <br /> In short, “The Dark Blue World” is a well thought out, touching, thought-provoking, and exciting drama that sets Pearl Harbor as an example. Highly recommended.
