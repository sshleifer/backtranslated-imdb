This is the last Ghibli film, and it is also a big departure from the well-established studio style. First of all, this film was clearly aimed at young children, much more than any of their previous films. He lacks the depth of other films and there is a new, much less realistic style of animation. and yet it is very interesting. Despite the fact that nothing attracts adults, I was still attracted to the screen and completely immersed in the story. The secret of the film is cruel honesty about the plot and characters. The story and characters are very sincere with their feelings / intentions, etc., But this makes them even more attractive. Particular attention was also paid to the soundtrack, which is simply amazing, despite the fact that it is very different from previous Ghibli soundtracks. I always sing a sweet song, like anyone who sees this movie!
