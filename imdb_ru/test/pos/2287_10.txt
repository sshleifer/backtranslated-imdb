This is a great, little-known film. Tom Selleck does an outstanding job in this film with the Japanese "Clint Eastwood." I would like to see if this movie was released on DVD yet, there are some places that have clearly been cut. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) clearly split some pieces. It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the film. Baseball sequences are by far the most realistic of all baseball films, and I'm pretty sure that most of the actors were current or former baseball players. I love to download cassettes of this film at least once a year. The best scenes include the absence of hat turning over after Tom is beaten in the big game, and a very sensual scene in which Tom is taking a hot bath with Hiroku. Dennis Heysbert also does an excellent job, it's nice to see that he finally won recognition, not only in baseball films (he was also in the big leagues).
