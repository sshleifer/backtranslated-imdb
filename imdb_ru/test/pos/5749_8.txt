I just wanted to say that the movie was good and touching. The film explains to you the real meaning of salvation or being born again and is very well laid out. The acting was pretty good, but with some improvements. The notice board is memorable, and when there was a youth ministry in my church, and we watched it, 8 people gave birth to Christ there. I would also like to say that everyone who reads this will give his life to Christ and repent of his sin.
