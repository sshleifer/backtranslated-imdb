Glenn Ford is hired by the dishonest bank owner and the cunning stable owner Edger Buchanan to arrange a fake robbery, while the banker hides the real loot. With Ford, who did not show up, they instead come with a successful second choice, leaving Ford on the hook for murders that he did not commit. <br /> <br /> Columbia Pictures' first color feature - “Desperate” looks fantastic. with sets and costumes made to take full advantage of the Technicolor process, highlighting tons of well-delivered western spectacle. <br /> <br /> This is the compelling union of young Glenn Ford (third count, but essentially star) and the main Randolph Scott, leading an incredible cast with outstanding actors in bright roles, including stage thief Edger Buchanan as good-natured, a slightly villainous jerk who is not as stupid as it looks and which has quite a few memorable lines. br /> <br /> A rather complex script effectively mixes incredible action films, melodrama and comedy, well directed by Charles Widor. This is one of the great Westerns of the XIX century, which is strongly recommended.
