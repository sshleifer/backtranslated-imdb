And what is his genre? Backstage revealing story; what theater life really looks like behind these Broadway (and other) curtains. He, of course, has many competitors: Singin 'in the Rain and I and II (1929 and 1952), 42nd Street, Golddiggers (you name the year); Damas, 1934; Noises Off (1992) from the farcical side, and the star was born I and II from the 1930s and 1950s from the tragic side: not to mention the Summer warehouse of the 1950s: the list does not stand still. So what makes this movie so special? And why are there so few comments on this amazingly great movie? So few people actually saw it? How amazing to see the younger Frank Langella in front of Dracula and in front of Moroz-Nixon for 30 years! How amazing it is to see the fresh and talented Tom Hals so pre-Amadeus! And another excellent Stiller! What a wonderful composition of talented people at their best since ancient times! And such a scenario! Who was this David Chaber? So full of realistic disappointment and pathos compared with the usual sentimentality and pleasant comedy! In particular, this illustrates an episode similar to the birth of a star, where the heroine reaches Broadway, while the Langella character must be content with another provincial tour. <br /> <br /> The subsequent hysterical and sadistic explosion of Langella against the star — the startled Latin teacher and his granddaughter, in whom he expresses his rage and frustration, is just one of many fantastic and psychologically real moments in the film. (The Latin teacher and his love affair with backstage life certainly resonate with Marlene Dietrich and her seduced professor in The Blue Angel, 1929.) Another of a series of mercenaries and cold-blooded agents, such as Kevin McCarthy, who was preceded by Bert Lancaster in " Sweet ”The smell of success (1957) and replaced Alan Ald in Clubland (2001) in the history of cinema. The sexual liberation of the character by Julce recalls such incidents in O'Neill's great comedy “Ah, the wilderness”. <br /> <br /> And what a tribute to the disappeared operetta of ancient times: “The Red Mill” by Victor Herbert; Rose Marie and the tramp King Rudolf Frimle; Desert Song by Sigmund Romberg, etc. What are the satirical inserts of bits from great plays such as Romeo and Juliet. Tribute to the theater itself, as expelled by the star of Langella. The richness and depth of this film are endless. And be burdened with such a name! Who would have thought about what this great film is about, under such a ridiculous and unassuming title? But on the other hand, what name could be applied to such a magnificent drama, which could correspond to its exciting, emotional content? <br /> <br /> PS: I just saw (2009) Frank Langella in his last acting spectacularly: like Richard Nixon in Frost-Nixon. How this great actor after 30 years just goes from triumph to triumph!
