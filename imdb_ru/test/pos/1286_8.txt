Great movie. No useless tricks like most Hollywood movies. All supported the tension of the plot. B & W gave it a simple, no frills. In short, he was intuitive in his simplicity of cinema and cast. <br /> <br /> The following is an interesting contrast to Memento. Characters in both cases widely used manipulations and tricks. In this sense, both reminded me of something from “In the company of men”, also highly recommended. One of the differences between the two Nolan films was that it was a little easier for me to watch “Memory”, given that black and white scenes evolve in a constant chronological direction, like color ones. I don't think that was true of Follow, where the scenes seemed random. If you have a choice between a VCR and a DVD, I highly recommend the DVD because it gives you the opportunity to watch the movie a second time in chronological order, and not just in the encrypted (albeit simple) order presented by Nolan. In addition, when re-viewing is easier to arrange the order for yourself, if you want. <br /> <br /> As another viewer noted, one of the best sides of this film and the memorable film is that none of the actors was famous. These were the characters, not the famous actors who led the characters created in other films. <br /> <br /> Given some of the similarities in the plots, I’m wondering if Memento is a sort of remake of “Following,” but did he intend to reach a large audience, such as Edward Burns, made her the only one with the same composition as the Brothers McMullan.
