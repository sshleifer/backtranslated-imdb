Murder over New York is one of Chan's best mysteries, and I just saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> In this, Charlie Chan visits New York to attend a police convention. At the same time, people associated with aircraft factories are killed, and he decides to help with the investigation with his son number 2. These killings are the result of sabotage in aircraft factories, and Chan helps to identify the killer ... <br /> <br /> Charlie Chan is played well by Sidney Toler, and the rest of the cast is Senj Yung as his son number 2 and Marjorie Weaver. <br /> <br /> I rather liked this mystery, and it is worth it if you like such things. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
