I hope that Robert Redford continues to make more such films. Hillerman's books are wonderful, and when he grew up in the southwest, his stories became popular! Adam Beach is an actor with a very low rating and actor. Wake up, Hollywood, not everyone thinks your Mel Gibson is cool! Today, many movie lovers want to watch movies that make you think. I have seen all the Redford / Hillerman series. They are thoughtful, picturesque and have excellent plots. I hope that if enough people write to Robert Redford, he may decide to do some more! Thanks to Adam Beach and Tony Hillerman for great fun! If someone has a chance to read the latest book by Tony Hillerman, do it! It's great. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Stop at each site viewing and feel the atmosphere of the books of Hillerman. Awesome experience.
