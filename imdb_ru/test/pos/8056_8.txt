Raised in the city of Phoenix as a child, I recognize many of the locals in the film, so for me it’s like a trip down memory lane to see “The City of Phoenix History” again. In fact, my grandchild is in it in one of the very first scenes. Uncle Drew is the one in the Hawaiian shirt who raises his chair to get a better look at the singer / stripper. <br /> <br /> If you weren't there, like Mr. Page and I, you both couldn’t possibly not understand the story he tells. A reviewer from New York calls John Patterson a racist and most likely never met Mr. Patterson or his father. And what is your point now to arrange the work of Mr. Patterson? This has nothing to do with the movie you are supposedly watching. How in the world can you sit back and judge them or this film, when you probably did not go further than the southern Bronx? In my experience, people who do this are just trying to feel morally better than the people in the film. In most cases, both Mr. Patterson were mostly good and decent people. Their families were respectable people, like most people who lived in the city of Phoenix. <br /> <br /> By the way, why is it so difficult for those who live outside the south to believe that there are good and worthy people? are people even in small Alabama cities? And why do they assume that everyone who lives in a small southern town is racist? My parents lived there, and yet they did not tolerate it in our house. Others didn’t tolerate this either, but the myth that everyone in the south is racist lives thanks to the deliberate ignorance of others. <br /> <br /> The film itself is simple and direct. This is not the whole story - Hollywood added a certain sensation when the film was shot. Parts of it were absolutely on target. Its other parts border on fairy tales. And if this is the source that someone uses to decide which people in small southern cities, they need to understand what most of us are doing - this is ONLY a movie.
