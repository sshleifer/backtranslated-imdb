No matter how close the movie is to comics, it doesn't matter. This film radically moves away from the boredom of Interview with the Vampire (although it plays well) and slides through the wonderful scenes of the action movie. Very convincing and interesting story with an amazingly good game from everyone. The downside is poor graphics. Does it matter? Nope
