Not quite sure how I came across this movie, but I'm so glad I did. Initially, we were repelled by the fact that it was subtitled, but even my dyslexic brother, who hates reading (especially on weekends), enjoyed this film. I find the script fantastic, and the way it was delivered in this form only added to the puddles of urine on my couch. Not quite sure what is so funny with the local Dane, as the comedy seems to be intensified due to the colorlessness of the subtitles and the ambiguity of the translation. I have not watched a lot of Danish films (or any other for that matter), but judging by this film, I assume that they are not limited to the same political correctness as in other places (bless them), forcing Eigelâ€™s character to breathe fresh air, because let's face it, special needs are ridiculous. There are so many great commercials in this film that shame American comedies.
