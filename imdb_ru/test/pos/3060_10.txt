How can anyone dare say something bad about this movie? Sorry, Mel Brooks for the fact that he is a great comedian and makes a film that is getting funnier every time you watch it. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this, I cried with laughter. Everything in it is funny. <br /> <br /> Although Robin Hood: Men in Pantyhose is not my favorite comedy (this place was taken by Real Genius), it takes place in my book. So go take a look! If you don't laugh all the time, then at least you spend all the time drooling over Cary Elvis.
