Simply the amazing feature of clay from Nick Park and the company that faked such great films as King Kong and The Wolfman makes Wallace and Gromit protect rabbits who find it difficult to solve the main problem in their village ... a giant werewolf rabbit Lavishly feasts on the townspeopleâ€™s vegetable crops! What makes it even worse is that the great vegetable festival will soon begin, and all citizens have dutifully prepared to win the grand prize. What makes the situation worse is that Wallace is the cause of the whole rampage of eating vegetables ... he tried out a new invention that his brain waves were trying to brainwash captured rabbits so as not to like vegetables. What is happening is catastrophic, as some hybrid werean rabbit is being created in the process ... and it has more to do with Wallace than he could have imagined. It will be his faithful (.. and amazingly clever) and quick-thinking dog Loud to save the day. <br /> <br /> This is a clever and creative team effort for other Oscar-winning glination functions. Starring Wallace and Gromit. Seeing good old-fashioned clay is refreshing, given the CGI boom, which recently showed a rather dull fare, as the industry produces an increasingly mediocre product. Here we get the full function with witty humor and some wild stunts, showing amazing animation, not to mention the picky sights.
