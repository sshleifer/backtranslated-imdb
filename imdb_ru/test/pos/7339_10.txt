Everyone who worked on this film did an AWESOME job. This is, frankly, one of the best lesbian films I've seen in a long time. Acting, writing, cinematography, music, visual effects - everything was at the highest level. As an avid fan of the genre (both lesbian films and gymnastics), I was incredibly pleased with this film. It really gave me a lot more than I expected in all directions. Listening to questions and answers with the actors and the crew was great, the main actress has so much positive energy, she is so modest and friendly that it's nice to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what is really important. And the writer did a hell of a job, as well as directing, and editing was awesome. Thanks so much for making a great movie! Thanks also for the line that "if you are going to stick a label on yourself, it will be bisexual." I'm so tired of movies where characters with both sexes posing as gays or straights, it's great that bisexuals are recognized for being and are part of the gay community, and it was nice that the labels weren't even necessary altogether in this film. What an end! Just when I thought it could not give me more, did it. Beautiful work and my applause to all. I will spread the word, this is definitely a movie not to be missed!
