This film is really interesting, good, clean, funny movie for kids. Kaylie (played by talented Amanda Nickelodeon) is an assistant to a violent boy who finds it difficult to tell the truth. In the end, he turns it into a movie script that is stolen. I will not bore you with details. If you have children, and you want to watch an entertaining, if not exciting children's film, I highly recommend this one.
