This is a very dark movie, somewhat better than the regular Asylum movie. It was much better than I thought, a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The voice on the phone is really creepy - this voice without a face, this unknown and threatening voice works very well in the film, since we never see the killer's face left to the viewer's imagination. . <br /> <br /> Action and suspense never disappear, and after the first half of the film it becomes dizzying; there is not much blood in this film, enough to tell a story, and the director holds your attention well. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8/10, because some cliches.
