This is a very strange film for Harold Lloyd - at least in relation to the cute character he played in films throughout the 1920s and 30s. Instead of a good guy, he and Sneeb Pollard are scammers who rob all blind. In a particularly successful fraud, Chester pretends to have lost a “very valuable ring,” and Harold finds it a little later, since the puppet is also looking for a ring. The ring, of course, is cheap, which Harold threw and then found, but the puppet's greed is so great that he “convinces” Harold to say nothing and sell him a “valuable” ring, and then they run away to enjoy their luck (?) Again and again, they find cakes until they meet with a woman who is herself a fraud (works with a guy who does fake sessions). She arranges an elegant swindler and takes all the money they stole, and a police officer stands next to her to make sure they give her money. <br /> <br /> By a lucky chance, these two scammers stumble upon a dubious business lady when no one is at home. Soon the lady returns and mixes with their minds - releasing a lot of dirty tricks to punish them for their evil ways. <br /> <br /> Around this is a completely weird and contrived film, but it's also very funny, because jokes work very well, and Lloyd and Pollard make up a great team. Besides, despite the fact that I am creepy and strange, I liked to see how Pollard is dressed like a lady.
