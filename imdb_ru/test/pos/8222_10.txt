This television adaptation was an excellent means for Bill Irvin to demonstrate his ability to perform physical humor. Against the backdrop of the struggle between the actor and his writer / director, Bill uses his clown antics to demonstrate various skills, including hat tricks, pantomime, dance and various physical devices. <br /> <br /> Although this requires a big blow to the entertainment industry and its craft, it is fascinating for people of all ages and ages. <br /> <br /> This work was shown on television as a special PBS program. Bill performed some of this at the Tonight Show, but out of context it did not go well.
