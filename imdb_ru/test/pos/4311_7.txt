Nicely filmed, a bit uneven, “Nobody” is a good evening entertainment. The plot is quite simple - three yuppies fall into the scrap with a group of strangers in the bar, and it turns out that this is much more than they expected. The game is decent, and there are some unexpected turns. Keep an eye out for the absolutely incredible (for example, a revolver of 10 shots and a semi-automatic pistol of 25 shots).
