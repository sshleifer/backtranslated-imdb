"Cover Girl" is Rita Hayworth's best musical. Miss Hayworth will always be remembered for Gilda, but the next movie will be The Cover Girl. Great story. We are talking about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it great in show business. She does this without the help of her talented dancer / director (Gene Kelly). Mr. Kelly is given the opportunity to put on musical numbers. The dances are impressive. It's interesting to see comedian Phil Silvers recording musical numbers with Miss Hayworth and Mr. Kelly. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is perfect. Lee Bowman gets a chance to be an interesting third wheel, another guy.
