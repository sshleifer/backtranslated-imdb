This is a fresh, very interesting drama with a great cast. Garfield is good as a boxer, hiding from the police with this motley team of Dead End Kids. The most famous of them is the handsome Billy Helop, who has some very exciting moments. Gloria Dixon, who in real life died very small in a fire in the house, is strong and very attractive, like Helope's sister, and in the early scenes of Anne Sheridan on the verge of fame - a knockout. Mae Robson is very funny, like an old fucking grandmother, but Claude Raines proves here that even a great actor can get confused if he was mistaken (who would have thought that he would be left as a tough New York policeman?). <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley argues that he was a good director with or without musical numbers. The film moves at a terrific pace and the sequence of the water tower is very good and alarming photographed. The ending is contrived, and the plot is not surprising or original, but I still found it a very pleasant experience.
