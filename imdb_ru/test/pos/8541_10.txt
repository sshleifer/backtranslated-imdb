You know those movies that are terribly awful, but you can't help but love them? Well, that is what evil Ed is perhaps the best horrible movie in the world. Sound is nonsense, dubbing is crap, script is nonsense, and special effects are nonsense. However, I cannot dislike this film very dearly, and I have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years. Sam Campbell (or the guy who plays him) should be featured in Actor's Studio series because he is so memorable. Perhaps the greatest villain of the movie, not named Tony Montana. Seriously, if you do not expect much, you will not be disappointed. Adhere to the frivolous approach to watching this film, and soon you will appreciate it in ten hours.
