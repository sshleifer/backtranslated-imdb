A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel "Waltz in the Darkness" by the writer Cornell Woolrich. This is rather a drama, not a film noir, which tries to send a message that love changes your own life, that is, your love for any person and the love you received from him. A rich man really changed his life for the sake of love, while his partner finally realized that he was the only one who loved her. Belmondo played well, as usual, while several still young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role as a detective or police agent. Frankly, the bouquet was not so impressive in this film, but less than the performance of Catherine Deneuve. She was not so convincing in her role as a prostitute than the lover / wife of Louis Mae (Belmondo). For those who love to travel the world, the film offers the opportunity to see part of Ascension Island, as well as the city of Lyon in France.
