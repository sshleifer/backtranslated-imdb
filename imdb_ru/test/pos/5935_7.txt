Prestigious royal roar <br /> <br /> 1. Edge Vs Shawn Michaels <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 Very strong starter ... performance The rim was excellent, as it was during the roar .. allrall can say EDGES NIGHT .... <br /> <2. Undertaker vs. Heidenreich Match with a basket <br /> 7/10 Many people hated this rivalry, although I liked it, I thought that Heidenreich really played his character . The match was not surprising in the excitement that existed until Kane and Snitka intervened. It improves as you continue. <br /> <br /> 3. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show vs. JBL (WWE CHAMP) WWE TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 surprisingly good match, as there was only 1 really exciting ringer in it ... corner of course ... ... very good match for the title .. good pace ... although a predictable end. but not all royal matches are predictable. <br /> <br /> 4. Triple H (WORLD TITLE) vs. Randy Orton WORLD TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 is actually not very good for the guys who took part, too many dry spots, Orton surprisingly sold his concussion, although the ending was something anti-climax. <br /> <br /> 5. THE ROYAL STRUGGLE AGAINST ... by the way, there were several segments during the other matches ... two that were really cool ... Chan pounded Christian and Guerrero, stealing the talents for the entrance ticket No. 30. The event was good, 7/10 would get 9 if Sina wins, but unfortunately, my biggest enemy Batista wins (WHY I WHY WHY WHY) ... Vince falls and makes a drop, and the whole arena bursts out laughing .
