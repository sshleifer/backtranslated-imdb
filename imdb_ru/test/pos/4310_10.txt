A unique blend of musical, film-noir and comedy - with a few sex scenes added for good measure. The only other film that I can recall with a rather similar wild and insane mix of themes and clichés is the French film Billy The Kick, but it has a more surreal and whimsical approach. <br /> <br /> It’s not that this film is going to be surreal or weird. At times, humor is quite subtle, and sometimes clearly on your face - and often crosses the border into an insult. As an example: in a post-coital chatter with a prostitute, our hero Max Muller calls on her to reveal who was guilty of the recent murder, using the words "Schiess los!". Literally, this phrase means “Shoot!” In German, and this is exactly what the hidden killer does in return. In other words - this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a pun. <br /> <br /> The Mullers Bureau is also one of the very rare examples of movies with funny sex scenes. Larry's romance is accompanied by the song “Ich will mehr” (I want more) - although the song perfectly reinforces the action, the meaning of her words changes a couple of times, hinting at the end of Larry’s inability to provide any additional services. The main love scene of the film between Max Muller and Bettina Kant lacks such subtlety - these are amazing things, especially when Bettina's singing slowly turns into moans, of course, everything is in the rhythm of the music. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed Unless you are one of the easily offended.
