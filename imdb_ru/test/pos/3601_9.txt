This film gives us some history of the Second World War along with some moving novel, a little imagination and significant emotions - and beautiful landscapes. Nicolas Cage never fails us, and here again does an excellent job. Like other main characters. One key character, the doctor / father, played by John Hurd, provides (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I have ever heard. Some events are too random to be real, but I justified it, knowing that this is partly a fairy tale and invention. My wife and I really liked the movie. And it's nice to see how people risk loving the enemy. One man who left the theater next to us said to his wife: “You can wage war like this!” I think you will understand what he means when you look at the Italian occupants of this beautiful Greek island.
