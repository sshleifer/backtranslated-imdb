The trailer for this film was so focused on the chain (of course, because it is so sensational) that it missed most of the film about the developing, though fairly simply drawn, relationship between Lazar and Rey when they try to recover from their past pain with a friend. <br /> <br /> Of course, with the premise of a nymphomaniac in chains, it is not surprising that they have many presumed sexual relationships involved. However, in essence, the Black Serpent's Moan is the main story of redemption and the healing power of helping another person. Maybe it's just me, but I think that poor Lazarus should have focused more on his story. He hurts her husband after his wife leaves him, but we never understand how Rei’s help in resolving her past pains also heals. The implication is that this is the case - in fact, he plays a wizard who helps young Rey to overcome his curse through a big old chain and a few blues. <br /> <br /> I like this story, but I would like it to be a little more evenly and should not have relied on the sensation. The side characters were pretty decent, albeit simple, and I liked the music. The game was good enough, although I can’t be sure that Rey’s character is completely believable. But this may just be my naivety. <br /> <br /> In general, I liked the film, but he did not force me. Maybe it's because I'm too critical, but the story seems too comfortable to be completely believable, and therefore, although it all looked very cool, I could never really buy it. The chain was too far-fetched for me. Nevertheless, it can provide some entertainment for those who are looking for dramatic redemption stories with a blues beat. 7/10
