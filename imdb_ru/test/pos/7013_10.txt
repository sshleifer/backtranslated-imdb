As with most women, this film is the best movie ever. With his hot chemistry, sexy dance routines and beautiful songs, I mean timeless classics like (I had) “The Time of My Life” and the wonderful “She's Like the Wind” that makes this film. I love Patrick Swayze in this film, and he shows that he can sing and dance, it's so hot. He sings "She's Like the Wind" in the film. The chemistry between Swayze and colleague Jennifer Gray is amazing. I love all the dances and everything related to them. But, saying this, “Dirty Dancing 2”: “Havana Nights” is also great, but the scenes of Patrick Swayze do it. I love songs, dancing and everything in it, but this is not Dirty Dancing. As I said, this is a terrific tiptoe movie. Please, let there be a third one, because I love to see what is happening with the hero of Patrick Johnny. Jennifer's character might be more sexual, but hey, Patrick will catch it up if you know what I mean! Great movie, and I'm so glad that Billy Zane didn't win the role in the movie. I heard a whisper, he was meant for the role, but they learned that he could not dance.
