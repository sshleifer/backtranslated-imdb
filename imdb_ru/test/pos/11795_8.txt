Working on a night shift in a dismal police station, bumping into life in an alcohol mist, one can hardly say that Detective Mickey Hayden firmly understands reality from the very beginning, but when a blow to the head releases terrifying psychic visions, things become really strange. Soon he goes on following the serial killer and deciphering the secret of his beautiful first victim, the elusive Alice. <br /> <br /> The role of bitter burnout seems especially for Kaiser Sutherland, and he does most of this. A typical serial killer of the plot, but it has enough quirks, turns and genuine surprises to raise it above the usual genre tariff and even compensate for the painfully low budget. (I wonder how this movie could be if there were money for a few more rewrites and a few more takes.) <br /> <br /> In general, “After Alice” is pleasant entertainment for everyone, but for fans of Alice’s books Lewis Carroll is a real treat. From reality with a coup, in which things are rarely what they seem, to more obvious mentions - a killer named "Jabberwocky" who leaves playing cards on the bodies of his victims - each of them has a link "Alice" turn. Below is a list of what I found. Since finding them on my own is half the fun, I marked them as spoilers. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Composition of characters <br /> <br /> Mickey - In a sense, Alice herself wanders through strange landscapes, meeting strange characters, but Harvey, recognizing his true nature identifies him as a wretched, awkward White Knight. <br /> <br /> John Hatter (Mickey's boss) - is he really "crazy"? You will be the judge <br /> <br /> Claudette is an African-American transvestite. Obviously, the Black Queen <br /> <br /> Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen, but her cruel nature suggests, in particular, the Queen of Hearts. <br /> <br /> Gideon Wood - Suspected of being the killer of Jabberwock, his ambiguous role is more suggestive of a snare (or, perhaps, bujum). <br /> <br /> Harvey - his role as an unofficial guide to “Wonderland” and his name resembling another famous cinematic rabbit makes me think that he should be a white rabbit <br /> <br /> Dr. Vera Swann - Her last name and relationship with Mickey speak of the White Queen. <br /> <br /> Other connections <br /> <br /> Mickey's adventures begin when he pursues a man in a white and falls (rabbit) hole. <br /> <br /> Mickey drunkenly tells his cat to stop smiling at him (Cheshire Cat) <br /> <br /> The killer opens up "through the mirror." <br /> <br /> The climatic battle ends with a swirl of playing cards, like Alice’s adventure in the book. <br /> <br /> Garden statues look like giant chess pieces.
