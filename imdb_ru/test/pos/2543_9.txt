This is a wonderful film about the soul of ale. This is a trip to Ale's heart. I found this exciting. The director did a great job. He makes the scenes speak. Especially on quiet scenes. The window ale is great. Scenes when he lies in bed is one of the best director scenes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Beyond directing. I have not watched a movie about the soul. As a philosopher, I can say that this film proves that age does not matter to your soul. Since the soul is Ale. <br /> <br /> Since I live in Turkey, I don't care about the other side of New York. This is a universal scene that can be seen everywhere in the world. As for my opinion, more universal than any other thing. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie. Otherwise, you miss the great thing about the soul. If you have. <br /> <br /> Baris.Sentuna
