Personally, I think the film is pretty good. It almost values ​​8. I liked the aspect of ethnography as well as gorgeous photography. Colin Firth's character is not the most pleasant, but he copes with the role better than a decent one. The heroine, played by the beautiful Nia Long, is the heroine of a famous film in which she tries to do what she thinks is best for her child - to marry a respected member of her expatriate community - fighting her attraction for "bad" man - the one who is not a member of her community (“outsider”). Much of the film is about the struggle of this mother: should she do what is expected of her, which, in her opinion, is better for her son or should she follow her heart? I do not want to give the ending. Let me just say that this is a pleasant to the touch film with great pictures, an exquisite African dress (the film is worth seeing only for women's brightly colored African clothing and hats) and generally cute characters. The actor who plays the son of Nii Long is bright and charming. The plot is a bit cliche, but I still liked the movie. If you are a fan of Colin Firth, you MUST watch this movie. If you like chic movies, take a look. I think I'll see it again tonight!
