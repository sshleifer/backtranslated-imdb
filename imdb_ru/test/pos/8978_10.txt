Charlie Wilson’s war demonstrates the clever truth about how useless wars can be, especially to those people who spend countless hours and finances financing them. Virtuoso performances and surprisingly memorable characters combined with a sarcastic sarcastic script, a catapult film, led by the constantly unpredictable Mike Nichols, to the top of the best this year. Politics has never been so fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a Texas congressman who is credited with winning almost alone in the Cold War. Wandering around a lot of drugs, women and scotch, he also takes an unexpected interest in the events in Afghanistan and the horrors of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. He enlisted the help of Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an expert on the secret missions of the CIA and Joanna (Julia Roberts), a wealthy socialist, who raises money to provide Afghanistan with the rocket launchers and anti-tank weapons they need to do serious damage to the Russian military In the end, by the end of the 1980s, the Cold War will end, and funds will be immediately reduced, which will deprive all developing countries of assistance and help in recovery and reconstruction. <br /> <br /> This is exquisite, although this was to be expected from a better cast. However, much of this must be attributed to the scenario, which allows each character to be undoubtedly well developed and memorable. And the cordial help of this loan goes to a novel with the same name, which is fun honest. Tom Hanks shows another unmatched performance in the role of Charlie Wilson, a man who has done so much for many and is still relatively unknown. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Gusta, a character who is vividly expressed both in his physical form and in his crooked cynicism; Inimitable Hoffman again shows an excellent range in the characters he portrays. Julia Roberts is perhaps the only weak link in the film, with its characteristic snobbish character and not enough subtle accent. And there is also a squad of young secretaries of Wilson, who seek to make him happy. Led by the always-admirable Amy Adams, each supporting role has its joyful moments. <br /> <br /> It was not easy to defeat the Soviet Union, especially given the many conflicting goals between various political leaders. “Why does the Congress say one thing and do nothing?” Asks the disgruntled politician. "Tradition basically," Wilson returns. It seems that everyone wants the Cold War to end, but they still turn a blind eye to the atrocities taking place in Afghanistan. To motivate Wilson, he is sent to the war-torn refugee camps in Pakistan, as well as with his main financial source, Doc Long (Ned Beatty). Wilson uses strategic connections with committees to increase the funding of armaments in Afghanistan from $ 5 million to $ 10 million with simple command, but the President of Pakistan scoffs at the idea of ​​winning the war for such a trivial amount. By the end of Wilson’s campaign, $ 1 billion is being sent to the Mujahideen to destroy Russian helicopters — the first step to victory, as Wilson had predicted. Outside the film, the unresolved unrest in Afghanistan led to further, less neglected issues that Wilson seemed to foresee. <br /> <br /> During the war, Charlie Wilson’s main characters travel from the United States to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Jerusalem, Egypt, but wherever they go, sarcasm always follows. There is an amazing amount of comedy in the film, given that political overtones are generally serious. Hoffman jokes with almost every dialogue, as does Hanks, with his naturally witty ideas pursuing a woman. The scene at an early stage, when Gust was constantly injected from Wilson’s office, when he was trying to solve a legal problem with his squad of gorgeous girls (“you can teach them to print, but you can't teach them to grow boobs” . <br /> <br /> The press focuses on drug charges against Wilson, not on the important issues of the Cold War and on the conflicting desire of officials to draw up a budget. With their help, it becomes clear that by the end of the film, politicians still do not understand , what is really necessary. And since the scenario is so smart and insightful, some members of the audience may not keep up with all the intensive dialogues with events. But, as politicians have shown, who are not aware of the difference between Pakistan and Afghanistan, this is, in fact, another argument in supporting Charlie Wilson's position. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massey
