A visit to this film was an excuse to avoid the work I had to do for my classes, but this turned out to be one of my best events here in France. The film is quickly working on the creation of multi-dimensional characters and has excellent smooth plot. The characters really did have the voices you expect while reading graphic novels, and the artistic talent surpassed my expectations. The music was a catchy, funny and frivolous comedy, almost frivolous incorporation of modern subjects in playful manners. The film attracted attention, cute and at the same time saturated with action. A beautiful tale spun expertly. I will show it to my French students.
