Like all the other Mel Brooks comedies, People in Tights is funny. But considering this as an outrageous comedy, I think that many do not understand that the reason why the film is so funny is that the characters themselves behave so well. Elwes is a well-known former British nobleman, Lewis is an eternally annoyed king (I hope it costs just NOOOOOOIIIISE!), DeLuise is a FANTASTIC godfather, Roger Rees is a concerned and cynical sheriff ... so loyal to their parts that jokes flow easy. Yes, we have seen a similar comedy before, but the only comedy that, in my opinion, improves character development, is The Big Lebowski. Very very funny
