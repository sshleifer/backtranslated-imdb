I just saw this broadcast on channel 4. Having seen some of the comments previously made here, I think that I would first like to state that I do not support the death penalty. Given all this, I expected great things from this film, but it did not quite justify itself. The walking dead are made very clean, with good performances throughout and a good script. In fact, it is difficult to blame in artistic terms. Nevertheless, I felt that although he tried to confront the problems associated with the death penalty, he seemed to be distracted from the religious / moral position (which is not surprising, given that the main character is a nun). Although I am not a soulless person, I didn’t particularly sympathize with any of the characters in this story. If you do not take religion seriously, then most likely you will not see much in this film. I think Peter Mayak’s Let It Receives movie was much more powerful and touching, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to watch it, watch and see.
