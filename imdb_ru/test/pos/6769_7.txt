Send them to the freezer. This is the solution that the two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh. Incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it a lot more than a horror movie. Difficult characters defy surface classification and make the story intriguing and useful - if you can stand it. Definitely a dark film, but also a bit redemptive.
