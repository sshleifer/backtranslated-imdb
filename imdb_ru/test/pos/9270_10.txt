There are so many episodes that make me howl over stories <br /> <br />, and I would like to choose the best ones, Roco and Bill are filming for a strange couple that do not help, but they manage to play the victim and B.C. . their way out of difficult times is only to draw Dana into her criminal life. <br /> <br /> Canadians will notice a strange joke for Toronto or the federal government, and because the CBC stopped a really good Frantikov show that Dan was part of the show, which shots were filmed, and in the episode “Dan’s Umbrella” BBC robbed in the corners. <br /> <br /> When Dan says that the CBC will never spend taxpayers money on a worthless enterprise, Roco enters the room and gives his “Friday Night Evening” with Ralph Benmurg to Dan, this show was a failure, and most people will not joke if they do not know the CBC story about how to do shows, people do not watch or show good shows. what are they watching.
