Not much for this, but a confirmation of the values ​​of a small town and the reach of a young man with mental disabilities in his heart. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews and was surprised by some of the hostility it gave rise to. I felt that Cuba Gooding coped with this role with dignity and respect, unlike the salivation of Sean Penn in the movie “I am Sam.” <br /> <br /> The fact that it is based on real events makes it even more spiritual. Sport is taken very seriously in America’s high school (and, I suspect, somewhere else), and I felt these competitive students open their hearts to one less fortunate, truthful, at least for me. <br /> <br /> The Coach was never forced to choose between his daughter and Radio, but rather he delicately made a decision on the loving and open ways of Radio. Very good for everyone. 7 out of 10. Debra Winger, we need more photos!
