Chan is in New York, and he is trying to sabotage a new aircraft design. <br /> <br /> The war was at a distance of more than a year from America, but the Second World War was already raging everywhere in the world. and therefore he painted everything, as most people probably understood that war was coming. War is not mentioned here, but the fact that the film is dedicated to the production of aircraft, at least, hints at it. The mystery itself is pretty good, but the concept of sabotaging an airplane is perfect for a couple of rather tense moments. To be sure that we are talking about Charlie Chan, we can be sure that he will live to another day, but there was no guarantee what condition he would be in, and not whether anyone would survive around him. > I really like this movie. This is not one of the nests, and not the worst. This is one of the really rare things, really enjoyable. Definitely worth a look or six.
