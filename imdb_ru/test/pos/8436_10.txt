This film is definitely the best film of the Foundation. The plot is awesome, the acting is awesome, and the direction is awesome. A classic of all time, this was to win the best picture, not the cramer Vs. Kramer. Although it was not even appointed. Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas are also at their best. One of the best endings. If you have not seen this movie, do not go to shoot it. Had to get into the top 100 afi. See it not only for the Fund, but for everything. <br /> <br /> **** of **** 4 of 4
