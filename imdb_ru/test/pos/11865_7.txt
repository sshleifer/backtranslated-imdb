If you have nothing to do, then shoot this film, it is smart, funny, it will surely attract your attention for a while. <br /> <br /> I found out about it by watching the channels on Boring Sunday, it was on cable, and for the people I saw, I thought it might be worth the effort, it made me laugh, and for the movie in sunday, when nothing else is on TV, it was ok. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler looks amazing in the film, even though her acting game doesn’t meet my expectations, it’s kind of a bad acting game, and for the rest of the team I liked Reba in her role as doctor. It seemed to me interesting to see the guy from the comedy series “What do you like about me”, playing almost same-sex lawyer. <br /> <br /> As for J. Goodman, I found him, as always a very good performance, Michael Douglas plays a small role, but his characterization was difficult for me to identify him. <br /> <br /> This is also a good movie to watch with a company.
