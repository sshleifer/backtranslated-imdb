FIVE STAR FINAL was one of the best films of the early 1930s. He played the lead role of Edward G. Robinson and was a very gritty story about a mean newspaper and their willingness to do anything ... NOTHING to sell newspapers. In particular, the old story about an innocent woman is spread across the pages and helps to destroy her now happy life - many years after she accidentally fell into a scandal. The reason why I loved this film so much was that it was unshakable and without any blows - showing how low publishers can be to sell newspapers. <br /> <br /> Here, in TWO AGAINST THE WORLD, this is a remake of FIVE STAR FINAL - with a few changes. Instead of Robinson, Humphrey Bogart will appear in this film, and he heads the programs on the radio station, not in the newspaper. Otherwise, the story is essentially the same, except that it is a little less acute and lacks some of the sand and sensations of the original. It’s not that the film is bad - it’s just not as good as the first film. In other words, if you want to watch one of these films, see the first one - although this film is quite powerful and enjoyable. As for me, I really liked the story, I watched both films and enjoyed both of them. <br /> <br /> TWO AGAINST THE WORLD begins with the fact that the owner of UBC Radio complained to his program manager (Bogart) that all the high eyebrows of the show that he puts on receive low marks. The owner requires dirt - a lot of dirt to attract more listeners. One of the ways they are discussing is the multi-part dramatization of the famous assassination two decades ago - even though the killer was acquitted and she killed only for self-defense. Nevertheless, they decided to reproduce the story, as if she were guilty, and even went so far that they sent the writer to the house of the lady, pretending to be a minister (!), And also transferred her current name and location. Needless to say, it destroys a woman and leads to a terrible tragedy. Then, and only then, does Bogart feel real remorse for producing such garbage, which leads to the final finale of journalistic honesty and decency. <br /> <br /> A well-functioning, great idea for a story and a message that is just as important today as it was in the 30s is one story you should see. In particular, pay attention to the wonderful and very emotional scene of confrontation, where the daughter attacks the owner and Bogart - this is a damn good example of acting and writing.
