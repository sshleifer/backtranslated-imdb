This is not very flashy, but this film copes with the development of a large number of characters and allows them to know their hopes and desires, but at the same time it can be both fun and bitter. Very cute movie. Itâ€™s also fun to see Vincent D'Onofrio and Mary-Louise Parker so early in their careers.
