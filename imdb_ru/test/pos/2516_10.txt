A cool deed - yes, the premise was made - but not so - that's what's the matter. Hi guys - SHOCK - this is the "Secret Material". <br /> <br /> For me, it’s cool that Scully / Mulder has almost no scenes together - they have to adapt, rely on each other’s inner feelings about what’s really going on - and their adaptation skills. They read each other's moves and do their work .... (sort of). <br /> <br /> Oh yes - really good game - are these people paid for it? Or - a slow day when the store does not invite them to work. (hey - Duchovny - where are the day donuts? Malcolm - go to school ...)
