Classe Tous Risques (“Big Risk”) is repeatedly recommended every time I watch a Jean-Pierre Melville film, which I had to give him as soon as possible. Since I discovered Melville and, it would seem, worked on his filmography in reverse order, it would have been easy for me to mistaken for one of his films, but it was made in 1960 by Claude Sotet before Melville arrives and puts it on their claims French neo-noir. <br /> <br /> Class Tusa Risk has two of the best leaders of the time - Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, a gangster exiled to Italy with his wife and two children who want to return to Paris because the police are approaching him. After a loud and stormy discovery, Abel finally gets in touch with Erik Stark (Belmondo), who wants to get into the underworld. Stark becomes Abel's chauffeur and, in the end, the only friend in the underworld who returns to Abel after all he did and went through. The film shows the duality of two men: the elder Abel hit him at the end of his time after the tragedy, while the younger Eric began just like Abel, falling in love with a beautiful woman who holds on to her man, despite the world of which they are part. It never ends beautifully for them or their loved ones. It is one thing to see how the individual criminal comes to death, otherwise, when he has relatives, whom he risks to kill with him. <br /> <br /> Similar to Melville’s movie, the seemingly simple story gets complicated as it gets thinner. Going together As usual, like what I feel in Melville’s films, I felt dizzy (in a good way), and I was impatient to watch her again to understand what I missed the first time. The Tous Risques class is a defined keeper.
