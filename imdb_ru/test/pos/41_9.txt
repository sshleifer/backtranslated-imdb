What a wonderful movie, filled with eccentric, unique characters that are wonderfully realized by a great cast. The director also did a great job, keeping the story together, getting those great performances (without contacting them) and using music (and what a wonderful music it is). S. Epata in the title role is gorgeous. I have always heard what a wonderful actress she is, and although I liked her in Law and Order, it really shows what she can do with a full, complex role. Macy Gray is awesome, Mos Def is awesome as usual. Lou Gossett, great. Jimmy Smits, stunning, and not trying to focus, because he is a star. This sample ensemble game. <br /> <br /> Rent it, enjoy it, enjoy it and cherish it. Something special
