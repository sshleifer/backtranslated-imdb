Black Serpent moan outraged. It is overly rich, fantastically organized, strange and cumbersome, unique and farsighted. In continuation of Hustle & Flow, Brewer draws his portrait of the American South almost like a mythological land that could be seen in the epic Fantasy or Ancient Greece. And yet, as his films soar high above us, they are still rooted; rooted in the deepest and darkest soil. <br /> <br /> As in traditional fairy tales, Brewer paints his portrait in “The Black Snake's Moan”, using extremes and exaggerations. Sharp and sharp traits of character, combined with such extreme actions as chaining a half-naked white girl to the radiator in an attempt to atone for her sins, exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor just as extreme visual techniques like some characters having color in Pleasantville heightened the metaphor in this fabulous film. But Brewer doesn’t start his movie once; in this film, as well as in Hustle & Flow, Brewer presents us another fairy tale; dark, gothic fable about sex, prostitution and, ultimately, redemption. These themes pervade the veins of the film, such as blood, resonate and flourish in its dark, brooding environment. <br /> <br /> But despite these severe extremes, Brewer treats his characters as humans and creates extremely well-executed spatial characteristics in Lazarus and Rae, especially emphasized by their relationship with her friend Lazerus in the pharmacy, Angela and mother Rae . <br /> <br /> The game is, in general, completely flawless. One gets the feeling that both Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson were born to play these roles. Their characteristics are so intense and harsh; It is even more difficult for actors to hold their heads and create realistic characters. And they are doing well. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson completely disappears in his character, which serves as the opposite of most of the characters he played before. With films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft, and others, he came up with a “typical villain” for himself. In the movie "Black Snake", Jackson plays an old, broken, defeated and down-to-earth character, not at all like what he had done before. And frankly, it's just fantastic. However, what is surprising is the casting of Justin Timberlake, or rather, the fact that he looks like quite tolerable. Of course, he doesn’t have that much time on the screen, but, like what Brooer did with Ludicrous in Hustle & Flow, he actually makes Timberlake act and do what he has to do, and not seem completely flimsy and annoying. <Br /> <br /> But what’s really amazing about the film is the atmosphere that Brewer creates. Rural southern areas work in his favor, creating a dark, dirty, messy, crunchy, rough texture for the entire film, which more than fits into thematic and metaphorical aspects of the film. And using all sorts of elements, such as the growing sound of cicadas when Rei gets itchy, or a violent thunderstorm that intensifies and intensifies when Lazarus plays his blues number "Black Serpent Moan" for Rei, Brewer does manage to create an almost fantasy world rural southern settlement. And it works so fantastic to create a unique vision of Brewer. <br /> <br /> You can't talk about the Craig Brewer movie without mentioning the music. In Hustle & Flow, he used the soundtrack of dirty and street hip-hop music to highlight the atmosphere and vision. In this film, music works even better, polishing and completely representing the unique atmosphere. This is a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, roughest, roughest blues you've ever heard. And it sounds fantastic. <br /> <br /> In general, one could say that if this film were a simple story about an old, spoiled, lonely, God-fearing singer of black blues, saving a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania. . But this film is not about the plot and not even about the heroes, but about how they were created in the film. No, this film is about seeing ?? and what a unique vision! It is about the atmosphere, mythology, setting. It is about anger, fear, redemption and, most importantly, the blues. And all this is wrapped up in a unique, interesting, stylized and flawless ribbon. Brewer guaranteed himself a place in the list of the most promising and promising directors, and with such a serious continuation of the magnificent debut film, Hustle & Flow, it will definitely be on my radar for future projects. <Br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles I've ever heard.
