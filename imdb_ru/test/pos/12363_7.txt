I just finished watching this movie for the first time, and I must say that I am very impressed. <br /> <br /> How gloomy. How full of despair. How dreadful. Incredible. <br /> <br /> In my imagination there are several stunning scenes: the first appearance of a ghostly carriage ... the soul of David Holm, rising from his corpse ... his spirit on his knees, imploring. <br /> <br /> This movie tells a simple story — a story about a ghostly driver of a ghostly carriage who is doomed to collect the souls of the dead for a year — brings it into the current situation of the film, and then uses the memories as a means to David Hill is in his predicament. <br /> <br /> I would like it to be released on DVD so that more can be seen. Everyone should.
