This animated short is a remake of one of Tex Avery’s early shorts for Fred Quimby in M-G-M (Dog Gone Tired). An escaped convict (here just known as Joe), who has just escaped from Alka Fizz Prison, tries to outrun Droppy a step (known here as Sgt.McPoodle of Mounties), but always manages to face him, one way or the other . This is probably one of the funniest shorts that appeared in the animation studio M-G-M. He manages to get most of his laughter from Joe's shocked reaction when he runs into McPoodle (including some equally crazy sound effects — that is, car horns, screams, elephants, etc.). As with any Avery M-G-M, one should expect a short, frantic, kinetic stimulation (along with some nice surrealist jokes — that is, Joe tries to run away from McPood and actually runs away from the edge of the film). Put it in your DVD player and laugh silly.
