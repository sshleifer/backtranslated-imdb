I watched it again after not seeing him since he first appeared (in '97), and it still made me laugh out loud. It is skillfully written, Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their roles, and if you can look at Bob Newhart in this film and not laugh, you're more a person than me. <br /> <br /> For that matter, I think that the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Klein, where Kevin Kline listens to the How To Be A Man tape, and the scenes after (almost) the wedding with Joan Cusack are the three funny scenes in any movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the last scene justifies a bit of a happy ending, but ... few films are perfect.
