Is this a good movie? No, of course not. But for fans of Jolie is a must. Her impeccable acting scene and half-naked scene will delight her fans for many years. However, the current rating (3.2) is too low. The film may not have a good storyline, and in general it is not a good sf-movie, but the acting is good enough (and, as mentioned earlier, Jolie's acting is good and cheese), the film is shot very straight, with a big UPS. The landscape is quaint. Last but not least, leaving Van Damme was a very good choice. Presumably, none of the lovers Jolie would like to see how she has sex with him. This film has the potential to become a cult film.
