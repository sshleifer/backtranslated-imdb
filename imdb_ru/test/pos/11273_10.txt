I loved it, it was really awful and disgusting. I thought the rift of human flesh was completely provocative. The way it portrayed the human crucifixion of Jesus Christ was really interesting. Tears of limbs and jaws were terribly cruel. Do not look at it, if you have a weak heart, you cannot bear it.
