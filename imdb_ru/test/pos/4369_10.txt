I just saw this delightful classic again many years later, next to the last film directed by Henry Cornelius, who died three years later at the age of only 45 years old (at the same age that the male star of the film Larry Harvey also had to die in 1973) . Three future directors were on the team: Jack Clayton (production assistant), Guy Green (filmmaker) and Clive Donner (editor). This film is based on the autobiographical story “Goodbye to Berlin” by the famous British writer Christopher Isherwood, who was first turned into a play by John van Druten, then into this film, and then into the musical “Cabaret”. and finally shot as a “Cabaret”, which attracted the attention of the amazing Liza Minelli, whose voice can break a glass at a distance of a mile. Isherwood appears as a character in the film under his own name. He was gay, but in those days it was illegal and could put him in jail, so he hides his inclinations under the description of what he calls a "confirmed bachelor." This is the key to his platonic relationship with a wildly eccentric, wacky, dissolute, forever gay and completely unique character, whom he calls Sally Bowles. The portrait of Sally Bowles in this film is a journey of young force Julie Harris, who turns each scene into a magical and charming web of sparkling personal charm. What a car for an actress with her own charm! This is one of the greatest cinematic performances of the 1950s. Isherwood brought to perfection the young Lawrence Harvey in an elaborate performance that never allows comedy to cross the threshold, and even the moments of the farce, bordering on the farce, remain somehow "almost believable." Larry so funny portrays a weak hypochondriac. What irony, given the complete absence of hypochondria, manifested by his courage and stoicism in the last year of his life, when he died of incurable stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and lack of complaints. I knew him well for the last three years or so, and he was a generous, warm and humble man. He adored his little girl Domino, who now, alas, is also tragically dead. This film was his best early performance, followed by his spectacular work in Room at the Top (1959), Summer and Smoke (1961) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962). During his life, Larry was often underestimated because he was too handsome, he was often shot in the frame, and the glamor guys were not always considered good actors, but many of the best actresses played against him, and they did not doubt his abilities and he was a strong leader in many of the most important films of his time. If he lived outside the middle age, he would gain strength and become a “great old man” on the screen. Sitting at his home in Hampstead one day, he gave me a glass of his usual white wine from a huge barrel, which he brought from some foreign cellar. I said that he always gave me such a delicious wine, what was it? He proudly replied that it was Sancerre, whom he himself had chosen in a vineyard in France and deliberately delivered. Then he added with extreme longing: "You know, I waited four years for someone to comment on this and ask me what it is, and you are the first person who ever did this." It was important for him to recognize the taste of wine, and his more charming friends denied him that satisfaction. In this film, Anton Diffring gives a touching, early performance as a serious young man (he later had to play too much Nazi officers, poor fellow), and the young Shelley Winters plays a rich German Jewish girl in her usual noisy setting. but in an effective way, but it was not so difficult, as she was still noisy Jewish. In this film, such an atmosphere of joy of life that is pure delight.
