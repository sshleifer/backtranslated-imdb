** SPOILERS ** Looking for a little more excitement than to feed the crocodiles in local reserve sisters Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn and Maeve Dermoy, along with the guy Grace Adam, Andy Rodored, decided to go on a journey upstream in the desert place and abandoned, from human habitation, Australian mangrove swamps. <br /> <br /> With their guide through the swamp of Jimmy, Ben Oxenbuld, at the helm of his motorized boat, four climb to their feet with a giant saltwater crocodile, which quickly grabs and drags Jimmy to the bottom with him. Grace Pat and Adam were stranded on a tree in a swamp, and Pat held on to dear life in an overturned boat. In the rest of the film, a hungry and goal-oriented crocodile plays cat and mouse or a crocodile and human game with a trio that ends in a battle on the muddy shore, where Jimmy's dead and dismembered body finally comes to life and rests. . <br /> <br /> The director and actors of the film make full use of the swamp, which sometimes makes it much worse than the giant crocodile floating in it. In the film, we will see a crocodile killer about half a dozen times, but each of them will hit you, and Jimmy Grace Pat and Adam - right in the gut. <br /> <br /> In any case, they were on their toes. the giant reptile always does damage because it comes so unexpectedly from below that it, the attacks of the shard, has a much greater effect when you donâ€™t see how they approach, like, for example, in the last ten minutes of the movie when you do it . From the very beginning, you are wondering who will eventually survive the attacks of crocodiles and ultimately tell about them. Ending the confrontation between crocodiles and people was the weakest and most unrealistic part of the film. <br /> <br /> A crocodile, who was just as agile and effective in earlier scenes, seemed to have punched or swam himself, having neither the strength nor the speed to grab his deadly jaws and finish off the only survivor of the expedition. In fact, the killer shard was so ineffective that even after he poked his victim or victims, he simply could not hold them. In the end, it was fatal on his part. <br /> <br /> Much like the movie "Jaws", the movie "Black Water" has a crocodile killer, such as the great white shark in "Jaws". kills its human prey and then eats them. With all the food available in the swamp and rivers that he inhabited, the crocodile was only after the quartet, Grace Pat Adam and Jimmy, for invading his water area, which he felt was a great ruler. And for daring to do this, they had to pay with their lives!
