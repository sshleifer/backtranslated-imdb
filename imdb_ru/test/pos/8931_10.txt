Well, my dad drove Lee Evans back and forth around the hotels, so I had to see what some were doing. This is a brilliant movie! Bob Pugh walked past a canopy with a lawnmower, and he accidentally let him go, and he fell into the fence, and he fell. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans was also funny when he saw me and said you were cold, I said yes and he said: “Well, put your hands in your pockets!” I think it was really funny, and it will be famous comedy. Like any other Lee Evans film! They were really great people. they seemed pretty polite and funny. I would like to meet them again once. Brenda Bletin stepped out of her caravan of blood and branches in her dirty hair, and I was very scared because I didn't notice her until she was right behind me.
