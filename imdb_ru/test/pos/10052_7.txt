Leah Errol Flynn brings his usual talent for drama in this historically erroneous but interesting film about the life of George Armstrong Custer. Flynn's bright, funny essay about Custer from his days at West Point, as a reckless, stubborn cadet, during the civil war in an unusually generous and partisan interpretation of history, and finally, as an impartial Indian fighter, whose mistake in the Little Big Horn Custer as a victim of his team as a way to expose the corruption of government officials and postal traders, as well as to protest the unfair treatment of the Plains Indians. Olivia de Havilland, one of the main roles of Flynn in several other films, considers herself devoted, adoring Libby Bacon, and Anthony Quinn plays the role of ferocious chief Sioux Crazy Horse. The fighting scenes of the movie are excellent. The battles of the Civil War are brief and are shown in the form of several vignettes, in which Custer, apparently supported by just a few soldiers, drives the Confederation army into submission. Custer's last battle against the Indians is a grand spectacle, a wild clash between the Reds and the Whites, a quarter to that given in a wild mixture of military power between determined fighters. Excellent direction, cinematography, casting and great music by Max Steiner make this film a classic Hollywood film.
