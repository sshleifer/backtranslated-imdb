Dr. Stevens (Michael Harvey), the head of a seriously staffed institute for the mentally ill, uses a “progressive” approach to treating his patients, even allowing his psychos to completely free the building day and night; however, he pays the price for his visionary thinking, when he rather foolishly prescribes chopping wood with an ax as therapy for one of his patients and, therefore, mistakenly takes his neck for a log (serves him correctly so as not to offer basket weaving). /> <br /> Shortly after this tragic incident, nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the hospital to take up the position of physician assistant, and discovers that the institution is now managed by a much more severe Dr. Geraldine Masters (Annabel Broom). Despite the fact that Dr. Masters agrees to allow the pretty nurse to get to work, despite the fact that she does not know about the decision of her late predecessor to hire Mrs. Beal and does not want to take on new responsibilities, but after several painful experiences in the hospital, Charlotte begins to think perhaps it would be better if it was turned away. <br /> <br /> You don’t need to be a genius to understand what is actually happening in the hospital, because “the insane took refuge” - a prerequisite is to be familiar to most experienced horror fans, but SF “Do not look in the basement” Brownriga is still interesting entertainment, thanks to his clearly defined collection of psychos: lobotomized, sucking popsicle Sam (Bill McGee); Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross), who constantly mumbles phrases in the courtroom; the old Mrs. Callingham (Ray McAdams), who reads William Allingham’s creepy poem “The Fairies” and warns Charlotte of impending doom; Danny (Jesse Kirby) giggling, who likes to tease other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr), who thinks her doll is a real child; Army Nut Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and, best of all, Allison King (Betty Chandler), the rejection of which by a number of men made her thirst for love (that is, she tries to jump on any man who approaches her). <br /> <br /> This convincingly crazy set of characters, plus a little blood and nakedness, a sensible guide from Brownrigg (who also gave us an impressive white trash can Scum of the Earth), and a solid turn from the cover of Playboy Holotik, everyone is coming, to turn the rest of the rather predictable, low-budget piece of operation in a very watchable psycho shocker.
