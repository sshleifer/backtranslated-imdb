I always felt like I was a kid, I loved this movie. I have always been a fan of Joseph Mazzello. the child had pure talent both in this film and in the Jurassic Park. I was looking for a DVD or VHS to buy in the store next to me, I can not find it, I hope it goes to DVD! Well, anyway a great movie. If anyone knows where I can find it, please contact me at wrp24@adelphia.net. Also can anyone really explain what happened to Bobby. was she real, or was he fake, and was he an imaginary friend and his escape? lol i'm ignorant my favorite part was definitely to be where they made monster juice and spilled it all over the kitchen, it was funny, but also sad because of what happens with bobby because of the mess. face because he played his part pretty well. I think mother was a great actress, I think her name is Lorraine Bracco or some sort of similar name .. Well, thatâ€™s all, please contact me <br /> <br /> wrp24
