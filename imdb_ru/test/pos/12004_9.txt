I felt it when I saw the episode in its original run, and I still agree when I watch it on replays. Throughout the episode, you mocked Colombo and treated him as if he had Down syndrome. And in the end, you see their shock when Colombo makes them dead and arrests them. You will also get a realistic reaction from arrogant neat killers. They still can not give Colombo his props and say that he was just lucky. I like the formula, where there is a carefully considered crime, the murderer (s) completely underestimate Colombo, and then you understand that Colombo completely plays off the criminals. I remember that in the first few episodes after 1989 they did not follow this formula, and this was the first episode that pleased me.
