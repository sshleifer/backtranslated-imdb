Making a movie about comics is difficult. Making a good comic strip movie is extremely difficult. Making a good movie about Asterix and Obelix is ​​complete. <br /> <br /> This film shows that the French know how to do: a) funny, b) funny, c) beautiful, d) excellent movie. The acting is no less gorgeous, the sunny atmosphere of the whole film is beautiful. It must be the most ridiculous since we started the new millennium. 10/10
