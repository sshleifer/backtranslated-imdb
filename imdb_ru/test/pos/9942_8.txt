Betty is an understudy for leadership in the production of Macbeth Verdi. When the car mysteriously gets in the lead, Betty is in the spotlight. The premiere is a terrific success, and Betty decides to leave the party to celebrate alone with her boyfriend. But when the guy leaves the room, Betty grabs an unknown black-masked figure in a mask from behind. An unknown attacker ties Betty to a pillar, pecks at her and puts needles under her eyes, which will cause incredible damage and pain if Betty closes them. The guy returns to the room and stunned, seeing Betty in such a difficult situation. He is even more shocked when the killer grabs him and pushes the knife through the lower jaw with such force that the tip of the knife is clearly visible in the mouth. And Betty was forced to watch it all. So begins the terrible test of Betty with the murderer, who not only wants to hurt her, but also makes her watch as he maims her friends. <br /> <br /> Opera is classified as Jallo, but for me it differs in quite a lot of ways from the model. Less attention is paid to the mysterious elements of the story, than in something like Argento "Tenebre" or "Bird with crystal plumage". The black-faced killer in the mask may be omnipresent, but the clues and red herring, usually associated with the good Djallo, are missing. Instead, Opera is the strain of an unknown killer and discomfort of the audience. The focus is on the terrible scenes of death, Betty's fear and the obsession with Betty's killer. <br /> <br /> In the opera, it seems to me, some of the most artistic scenes of the death of Argento. When the killer grabs Betty after her boyfriend leaves the room, you are sure that Betty had it. But the sadistic murderer just wants to get Betty to watch him brutally hurt her lover in the neck ?? the knife appears in the mouth. This is a well thought out and thought out scene. And those needles in the eyes? brilliant. Or take the death of a seamstress. At first, her death seems to be an ordinary, ordinary murder. But when the seamstress accidentally swallows the killer's medallion, what started from the next death scene, lifts her a step above the level, as the killer uses scissors to cut the girl's throat to get his chain. Finally, there is the most famous death scene in the Opera, with which I am amazed every time I see it ?? Mira shoots her eyes, peering through the keyhole. This scene displays a lot of what I like about Argento. He has a style to burn. No matter how incredible it may seem, it is creative, memorable and pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> Argento, of course, was not the first Italian director who focused on eye injury, but in the Opera he was injured to a new level. The needles holding the eyes open, the bullet in the eye, and the crows jumping out of the eyes are part of Argento’s vision (the pun is intended). And these scenes really give the effect that, I believe, Argento was going to. The first time I saw a killer put needles in Betty's eyes, I couldn't stop blinking. In fact, it had a physical effect on me. What is it about the eyes that make them such a target for ill-treatment in Italian films? <br /> <br /> To be fair (and not like such a fan), I have problems with Opera that prevent me from evaluating her as the best Argento. One of my problems is with the duct system running through Betty’s apartment building. Although I have no doubt that in the old apartment buildings there are duct systems that connect the apartments, the air ducts in the Opera are HUGE. I am not an expert, but I sincerely doubt that any building, similar to the fact that in this film, would have such giant air ducts. This does not seem practical at all. And don't you think that someone would have done something with them long ago so as not to let criminals and curious neighbors to other apartments? This is convenient for the plot, but not very realistic. <br /> <br /> But I suppose that my main problem with the film is connected with the final. What is the end? It seems completely out of place, stuck and looks like a bad belated thought. I'm not sure what else to say, except how awful it is.
