The Muppet Movie by Jim Henson is a charming, funny and brilliant film that can be watched and watched for both adults and children. I feel that this is my favorite childhood movie, because it combines great characters, a wonderful story and the wit that it is irresistible. The plot involves Kermit the Frog (puppet and voiced by Henson) in his odyssey across America to pursue his dream in Hollywood. On the way, he meets Fozzy the Bear, the Great Gonzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf and DR. Teeth and electric lawlessness. <br /> <br /> There are so many good things in this movie that I can't even say them. But it's unforgettable, and every time I think of a puppet or a puppet, I remember this film. Look for cameos from Mel Brooks, House Deluxe, Paul Williams, Madeline Kahn, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthy), Elliot Gould, Carol Kane and the great Orson Welles. Excellent and entertaining, one of the best films of the 70s. A ++
