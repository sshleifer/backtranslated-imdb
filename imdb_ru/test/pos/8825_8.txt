Watching this PPV, I had high hopes for him, since Smackdown is the best show in WWE, this is a very good PPV, as it is the last before Wrestlemania. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH-HARDY BOYS & CHRIS Benoit vs. MVP & MNM W / MELINA in a match of 6 people. A great way to start a match. At first it all started a little slow, but then the pace accelerated and the match became more exciting and interesting. Benoit rolls and makes Joey Mercury knock to get the win for Hardy Boys and himself. 6/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND MATCH - GREGORY HELMS {CHAMPION} VS. Shannon Moore vs FUNAKI VS. FAQ GERRERO VS DAIVAIRI VS. Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Jamie Noble VS. JIMMY VAN YANG IN AN OPEN CRUISERWEIGHT INVITATION FOR WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP I am a very big Cruiserweights fan, and I never get disappointed by watching them, especially in this match here. Chavo Guerrero attacks Jimmy Van Young to get the victory and become the new WWE heavyweight champion. 5/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH - FINLAY AND A SMALL PLANT V.S. BOOGEYMAN & LITTLE BOOGEYMAN Actually it was not a duel, but rather a comedy duel, despite the fact that it was not a clean duel, it still entertained me with funny antics. Finlay nailed Little Boogieman to Shillag to get victory. Boogeyman does not deserve to be on PPV, nor does he deserve to be in WWE. 4/10 <br /> <br /> Fourth Match - Kane VS. KING BOOKER W / SHARMELL It was a surprisingly good match, I thought he would be mediocre, but he turned into a real competitive match. Hats off to both men, pulling a very entertaining match. Kane wins after Chokeslam at King Booker. 6/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH - PAUL LONDON AND BRIAN KENDRIK {CHAMPIONS} VS. DEUCE & DOMINO W / CHERRY FOR WWE TAG CHAMPIONSHIPS Not a lot of a good match, Deuce & Domino needs more training to fight, and London and Kendrick are the only ones who keep up the pace at a fast pace. London and Kendrick retain their titles after Kendrick received an award for one of the guys for the victory. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH MATCH - BOBBY LASHLIE {CHAMPION} VS. MISTER. KENNEDY FOR ECW CHAMPIONSHIP Mr. Kennedy attacks Lashley from behind, before the match. It was a good match, but not very good. Lashley & Kennedy has a bit of chemistry, but this is not enough to make a great match. Kennedy defeats DQ after Lashley nails him with a chair, then attacks him from the chair to the entrance area itself. Lashley still retains his title. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SEVENTH MATCH - JOHN HAY AND SEAN MICHAEL VS. BATISTA & UNDERTAKER This is probably the best tag team match I've ever seen. I take my hat off to all these men (yes, even Batista) for taking off as close as the 5-star classics of the main event. All four played their part in the match very well, as it was a very good and interesting team match. Batista turns him back on Undertaker's backbone to ruin him, then leaving the ring that Michaels encourages to nail Sweet Chin Music, then Cena to nail F-U for hard fought victories. 7/10 <br /> <br /> I don’t know why everyone says that this PPV isn’t good enough or boring, I just don’t understand. This is a great PPV that Smackdown always offers. Great ppv. <br /> <br /> Overall, I will give 8/10 and B +
