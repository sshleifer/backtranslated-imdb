Just thinking about the movie, I laugh to myself. Ann Ramsey plays an unforgettable role in the role of "Mom", probably the nastiest but funniest matriarch ever filmed in the movie. Danny Devito and Billy Crystal make a terrific duet, bringing true warmth to the film. Despite the fact that this cute story is not too complicated, it attracts your attention and makes you laugh to the end. This is a funny comedy to light things up and will even entertain children. I give him my full recommendation.
