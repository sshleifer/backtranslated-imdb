UNUSUAL LOVE is surprisingly interesting. While the plot unfolds, perhaps in too many directions, which makes it too long a film, it never ceases to fascinate and intrigue. Several story lines, one of which warmly resembles Sherley Valentia, give enough smiles, laughter, wisdom and tenderness. All this should not work, and from time to time, of course, stumbles, but forgive its inconsistencies, sit back and have a good time. This is the charmer!
