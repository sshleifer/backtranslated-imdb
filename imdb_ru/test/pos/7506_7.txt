PLAYERS SHOWERS !!!! Dr. Boh (George S. Scott) is the head of medicine at a major hospital in New York. He left his wife, his children have denied him, he is impotent, drinks a lot and considers suicide. Also in the hospital the killer wanders. Then he meets a VERY strange Barbara (Diana Rigg) and falls in love. She wants him to run away with her, but can he completely abandon his old life and start a new one? <br /> <br /> A very strange film with an Oscar-winning screenplay by Paddy Chaefsky. He portrays the suicidal protagonist and shows us a hospital full of overworked nurses and doctors who work incompetently. He manages (somehow) to make it seem pretty funny. This is not laughing out loud - this is VERY black humor. In addition, the acting is right on target - Scott is just great (and nominated for an Oscar). You see how he tries to maintain his sanity in a completely insane situation. Riggs's character is more than strange, but her manner of behavior works, and she is also incredibly beautiful. The script is strong and cruel - but not too much. I think that at the end the ball gets into a situation that is too complicated, but still worth seeing. If this were done absolutely seriously, it would probably be impossible to accept. Also look for Katherine Helmond in small numbers and Stockard Channing and Christopher Guest in non-credited bits. Personally, it was difficult for me to take it seriously. From what I heard, hospitals were so bad back in the 1970s, but not anymore. Watch this for acting and screenplay. I give him 7.
