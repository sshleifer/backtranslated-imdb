I'm not kidding with this. He was a guest columnist for Entertainment Weekly and gave him a positive rating. And who can blame him? This is a charming, funny and quite funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? Music in Ev'rybody wants to be a cat jamming. It makes me want to snap my fingers or something. Only years later, when the movie “Cats Don't Dance” was released, I saw a movie that was so musically cheerful. What the Aristocats lack in animation and history, it makes up for its charm. In addition, everything moves at a relaxed pace, and even the villain is not so scary. It is ideal for a junior set, without being so full that adults will not like it. If Snoop were here, I'm sure he would say the same thing. Yeah. Dig those crazy cats, dude.
