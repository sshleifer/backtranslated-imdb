The main reason for viewing this picture is to enjoy the brilliant performance of S. Efaty Merkerson. Ms. Merkerson dominates this film with her amazing presence as a nanny, a woman who believes in good, no matter whom, without any conditions. This actress clearly demonstrates a stunning range. <br /> <br /> Thanks to director George Wolfe for bringing together this outstanding actor from among the best black Americans. This ensemble group under his strict guidance helps to create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this would have been impossible if Ruben Santiago Hudson had not written his wonderful play. Working with Mr. Wolf, perhaps the best theatrical director of this generation, they opened the play so that it reminds us of the not too distant past where the child lives under the influence of Miss Crosby when his own parents are not around. take care of him. Miss Crosby becomes the adored mother of little Ruben; in a sense, he presents her reward for having lost his own daughter. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no time to develop some characters, since the action is focused solely on strengthening the relationship between the nanny and the young man. Ruben, with such charm, played the young Marcus Karl Franklin, straight. The only thing that could be done differently is a voice-over, which is sometimes intrusive, because it does not clarify and does not justify what they see. Honestly, just watching the interaction of players, it speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> There is always music in the background. No matter what difficult times these people go through, but the house of Nanny is full of laughter and that glorious music that brings us back to that era. <br /> <br /> In addition to Miss Merkerson, other outstanding performances are given by Terrence Dashon Howard, one of the rising stars of that time. Mos Def, Jeffrey Wright, Marcy Gray, Louis Gossett Jr., Delroy Lindo, Rosie Perez, Carmen Edgogo, Jimmy Smits and others. <br /> <br /> Ms. S. Efata Merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience. In Lackawanna Blues, she clearly demonstrates that she can do whatever she wants, thanks to her tremendous talent and charisma.
