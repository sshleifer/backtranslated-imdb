This is a brilliant series in the same vein as the Simpsons. Follow the family, experience life, problems, etc. Is it a little less realistic than the Simpsons, to talk with the child and the dog? The family guy goes where the Simpsons or Futurama do not dare, penetrating past into more painful jokes and even more cool jokes. And trust me, it works! Almost all the jokes hit the target, and they will be in the seams (especially random, frequent memories!) When my brother first showed me this, I was not hooked, but after several episodes I was hooked. You will be 2. 10/10 for a really brilliant show. Congratulations to Seth McFarlane for bringing this show to life. :)
