L'Appartement, I think, is a very valuable Hitchcoquian film. The plot was full of symbolism (that is, white and red roses) and plot twists that are neatly wrapped. The look was very Parisian and pulled you closer to the story. I saw it in London and I am very sorry that it is not on the video in the states
