Yes, non-Singaporeans cannot understand what is in this film. Some of the references in this film fly over the heads of foreign viewers, and basically Singaporeans will “understand” this. But I beg you, a foreigner, look at the other nonsense that was released from Singapore and compare it with this film. It is like comparing pieces of a mule's diarrhea with a small diamond. This film is the first one that really shows some of the battered stomachs of Singaporean countries - something that is lacking in strength, which pretend and pretend. And there is a part in the film where the gangster (ah-beng in our unique colloquial "ingredient") swears in 4 languages, namely Tamil English Malay and Hokkien. Well, the truth is that most of us can and does this all the time. The sad thing is that it will be easier for viewers from other countries to get their fat little claws on this gem, in its country of origin, it was originally banned, just to get an R-rating, and this, too, with about 20 cuts to it . It is good to know that one of the best, creative, sharp and original films ever created would be easier to get without distortion, without censorship; halfway around the world than in your own nation.
