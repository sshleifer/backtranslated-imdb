First of all, I have to say that I like this movie. <br /> <br /> This was the first film I saw from director Michel Haneke, and I was amazed at how good the good direction was! <br /> Haneke certainly knows how to lead the actors. What I found interesting is also the script of Haneke. At first you saw a woman who is very forthright and seems to be a good piano teacher and is very well loved and respected by everyone around her. Then you realize that she has a mother who is ugly and has too much in her life. Now you know that she is not normal, she has emotional problems, but you do not know exactly what. And then you fall into her dark side, but her dark side is revealed only when the student falls in love with her. She can no longer control herself. <br /> <br /> Roles are very complex and difficult to perform, but Isabel Huppert is great in her role and deserves the recognition she received at the Cannes Film Festival. Benoit Maginel is also very solid, but slightly overshadows Huppert's performance. <br /> <br /> In the script, I discovered one strange thing: the character played by Magimel is not very trustworthy. He is too talented! A person rarely plays the piano, but most of the time he plays hockey and learns ... He believes that this is a weak point, but only a minor flaw. <br /> <br /> I just saw the movie once, so I can’t make a very full critic because I didn’t analyze the movie. I like what I saw! so I give the movie 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... as for the end, Haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience. A motivation that does not think is necessary for making films, but Haneke does it with style and precision, so his film is better than, for example, Baise-Moi. <br /> <br /> Vince
