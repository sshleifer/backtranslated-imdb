This is a movie that was originally chosen for making video rental rooms ... just to discover an undervalued, entertaining and enjoyable movie !! The opening ceremony of police arriving in a dark and rainy house where the "wife" committed the murder ....... or is it ?? .... and the rest of the film is trying to uncover what really happened. ... well ... the film is a little "polite" ... but it has good editing and dialogue ..... professional play ..... often with a sense of humor ...... and the very last scene with facial expressions is one of the best of its kind ...... definitely worth a look ..... deserves at least 7 or 8!
