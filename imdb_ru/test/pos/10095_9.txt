Three words: a work of art. This movie is just great. It is beautiful, sad, scary and makes you think at the same time. The score always remains in my head, the acting is beautiful, scary and beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie rather by chance than on purpose. At the time when I decided to watch this film, I was just bored and I read lists of Asian films, which is probably good. Well, I saw the name “The Tale of Two Sisters,” which sounded very interesting. Then I read the summary of the plot and decided: "You do not just watch this film, you have to buy it." No sooner said than done. I bought this movie and was in love from the first minute. <br /> <br /> The plot interested me from beginning to end; The turn at the end of the movie made me scream. I really did not expect this to happen. And the final scene made me cry ... she just made me cry. It was so sad. <br /> <br /> Well, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie that combines an interesting plot, scary scenes and an atmosphere. Although you should know that the ending, as I said, is very sad. But it just matches the mood of the movie, right?
