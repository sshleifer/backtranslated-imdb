“Cold Mountain” by Anthony Mingela (screenwriter / director) is an elaborate, sensitive and intelligent drama, set in the social context of the confederation during the civil war, which very subtly and realistically considers the policy of war. While it accurately depicts the cruelty and inhumanity of this war, he also does what many films from this period do not cope as effectively - Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside and portrays changes among non-slave owners owning common people caused by war. And, almost uniquely, Cold Mountain does not generalize southerners, northerners, or anyone else. <br /> <br /> The film views genres as needed - never a dull moment. This is a novel, military history, action adventure and historical fiction, they are all perfectly woven into one. <br /> <br /> In the center of the plot are Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). battled each other for very simple reasons. When this young romance begins to develop, Inman enters the army of the Confederates, taking with him the book that Ada gave him and her photo. Ada's character is one of the highlights of the film, which is important because viewers perceive this film from a third-person perspective, but the story clearly belongs to it from beginning to end. Ada is a clever southern beauty and daughter of a liberal minister. She begins the film as Dad's girl, owning many of the arts that southern women were supposed to explore, who were surrounded by servants for most of her life. In other words, as she is recognized by Ruby Tews (Renee Zellweger), she is a master of everything worthless. <br /> <br /> Ada's father leaves, and she is left to independently manage his modest property. Having no such experience, she fights and survives, keeping the memory of Inman close to her heart. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who was raised by a drunk and careless father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities that Ada does not have, and as they become inseparable business partners, they begin to love each other like best friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but something like a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for reasons they really do not believe in and decides to leave them. None of those whom he meets comes to his aid when he begins to walk a thousand miles back to Cold Mountain and Hell, and most of those he meets die. <br /> <br /> Much of the film takes place during Inman’s long walk, after both main characters as they live, learn, grow and change. A constant act of will, born of despair, retains their strong passionate love. For Inman, this is his only source of hope in the world of pure despair. For Ada, this is almost the same, but also a symbol and a remnant of the old south - the fast passing world. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of Appalachian landscapes that give the film a strong sense of history. Scenario and editing are also extremely strong - emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the southern dialects of ante bellum of the middle and lower classes. With the cast of this film, nothing but perfection is expected. And the cast is mainly suited to this occasion. My only criticism, however, concerns accents adopted by Kidman and Low. Probably, we should not expect that the Australian and the British will accurately reproduce the South American speech, but there are several cases in which these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal recordings. I admit my over-sensitivity to this and I can say with confidence that this will not bother most people. Zellweger's performance is outstanding, and she creates a character that I will remember in old age. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
