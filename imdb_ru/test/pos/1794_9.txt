In Fassbinder's earlier films, his ideas sometimes exceeded his ability to perform them. He was always a great writer, but it took him some time to master his style of camera work and storytelling. <br /> <br /> The Four Seasons Merchant is one of the first Fassbinder films to use colors from bright green pears in a merchant's cart to bright red roses at a funeral ). <br /> <br /> His camera work was also there, but it was still pretty minimalistic. From time to time, the zoom seems a bit uncomfortable and unnatural, but on the other hand, Fassbinder still went out of its purely avant-garde phase. This may be due to the fact that Michael Ballhouse is not behind the camera, but slightly inferior to Dietrich Lohmann. <br /> <br /> However, this is Fassbinder, and you get your solution here. Broken dreams manifest themselves so vividly and steadily that they repel the audience and make them depressed. Just what the doctor ordered. Early classics, which shows a remarkable progression compared to his first films, released only 2 years earlier.
