Now I'm a little prejudiced, since I'm a big fan of late night television. I was a devoted fan of Jay Leno for about 6 or 7 years, and I think that he is one of the funniest, most talented comedians. And David Letterman is also a hell of a comedian, although I watch his show (unless Jay repeats) during commercials or when he has a better guest than Jay on the show. Daniel Roebuck and John Michael Higgins are great actors, and they really looked like Jay and Dave, but did they disappear into the characters? Nope Roebuck barely nails Jay’s face and expression, mumbling at a high level, sounding like Castera Marlon Brando. Higgins mutes David's expression (for example, his trademark black), but he doesn’t nail Dave’s voice. Those who are not big fans of late night television may be less biased. There are a couple of humorists who can imitate Jay. Why they could not choose one of them for the role? And the same goes for Dave. I would prefer them to play the role of Norma MacDonald. Norm doesn't look like hell Dave, but he perfectly imitated him in SNL. "Hey ... do you have a cud?" It was so much fun! <br /> <br /> However, I learned a lot about night wars, which at first I knew very little. I never watched “The Evening Show” before Jay Leno was the host, so I didn’t know about the struggle to finally replace Johnny Carson, and the countless talks that finally convinced Dave to join CBS. I knew very little about what happened behind the scenes, and found the film very instructive. And Kathy Bates gives a knockout performance as a former executive producer of "The Tonight Show." She basically steals the movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 (out of 10) <br /> <br />
