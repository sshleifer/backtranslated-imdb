Fata Morgana is definitely one of the strangest and most intricate feature films I've ever seen. I hesitate to call it a documentary film, because although it contains elements of documenting its images, the images themselves are so unusual, so hallucinogenic, so unclear that I wonder if it was worth telling this story so that these images could exist. The film is basically a story about land and the creation of land, taken from the perspective of a stranger, whether alien or something indescribable, happening in the Sahara desert. The name of the painting refers to the illusion or reflection of images, both real and hallucinated, which people in the desert often see. They are also known as mirages. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the landing of the aircraft, followed by the landing of the aircraft again, and then again and again and again, and again, and again, and again, and again and again. With each shot of an airplane landing, the actual architecture of the place in which it lands, and of the aircraft itself, slowly begin to dissolve into each other and become less and less real and more and more reflective images. The images in this film only become more intense and more unusual as the picture continues. The narration of the film tells about the creation of the Universe, when disturbing sexual images of sand and landscape pass by the camera. The pictures go farther and farther into the desert, and the Duke shoots everything he sees and finds. The strangest reflections of the world are shown at a distance, while Herzog meets some of the cleanest and most photogenic collections of outsiders you could ever see. When the Leonard Cohen soundtrack comes on, you can be sure that you are in the world of a madman in love with the universe. <br /> <br /> I cannot say too much about this film without destroying anything, but I will say that this is a sobering experience, and in fact there is nothing like it. I love to watch movies that are just in their classes. This film is certainly a good example of how the Duke likes to mix narrative and documentary films in interchangeable form. Unfortunately, Fata Morgana is overdue, but this is a bit welcome, but by the time it comes to an end, the images will most likely remain in your head forever. Definitely a must see for those obsessed with nature and the origin of the universe.
