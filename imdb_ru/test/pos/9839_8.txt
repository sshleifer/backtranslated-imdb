Frankie Darro was a wonderful childish actor who succeeded in playing in daring little circles with giant chips on his shoulders. He appeared in several major films of the early 30s - “Public Enemy” (1931), innovative crime drama and “Wild Boys from the Road” (1933), a thematic film of the Depression epoch about children traveling on rails. In fact, was the younger version of James Cagney. Despite his small stature, his willingness to perform his own tricks forced him to work in a series of programmers when he no longer needed big studios. <br /> <br /> The Crime School was supposed to be a remake of the Mayor of Hell, but there was much more humor in it, and in it the Dead Children and Humphrey Bogart were very calm deputy commissioners. “Mayor of Hell” is really a combination of “Hell House” / “School of Crime” / “City of a Boy”. Despite the fact that Cagney did not appear until the 25th minute, his blow (as usual) was immediate. He plays a hot gangster who is in the list of a mob-driven political group. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Smith (Frankie Darro) and his gang (including “Farina” from “Our gang”) run the car wash racket, but bite off more than they can chew when they rob a department store and push the owner through the glass window. They are brought before a juvenile court and sentenced to imprisonment in a state correctional institution. It is written in vivid terms - a model school, where boys get the opportunity to learn the craft. In fact, this is a hell of a place run by the sadistic overseer Mr. Thompson (superbly played by Dudley Diggs). The only sympathetic person is Dorothy Griffith, the nurse who plays live (played by Madge Evans). <br /> <br /> Patsy Gargan (James Cagney) was appointed as the new Deputy Commissioner as a favor. Upon arriving at school, he witnesses an unsuccessful escape attempt and, after talking with Dorothy, realizes that the school needs radical reforms. Soon he runs the school and introduces a system of "self-government" - rather on the principle of "City boy". Despite the fact that Cagney has little to do, the picture carries with it an exciting climax thanks to the energy of Darro. After Patsy temporarily hides (he accidentally shoots a gangster and is forced to leave the state), Thompson returns and his ill-treatment, which killed the boy (“Skinny”), turns the other boys into an angry mob. They burn the barn Thompson falls to his death - Patsy returns just in time to calm the crowd with some sobering conversation. <br /> <br /> Of course, all the guys seemed to be tough to speak for their crimes, but I disagree with one of the reviewers - Thompson was more than just "mean." His sadistic appeal led to the boy’s death. In the beginning there is a scene where the boys are served with inedible slops - Thompson orders ham and eggs and continues to accumulate butter on his bread, talking to Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Allan Jenkins plays Mike's Uncle and Sheila Terry, although the “only blonde” account has one of the most memorable lines when she pouted and said, “I thought there would be young guys here,” where they? "!!! <br /> <br /> highly recommended.
