I'm not a big fan of movie musicals. "Annie" was a stage show that I loved, but the film failed. “The Ghosts of Opera Cinema” (and I think there were three of them) did not correspond to Weber’s production. But I loved it. The DVD will take pride of place among my "keepers". Despite the fact that this is a film adaptation, it somehow reflects the taste and atmosphere of a live theater. Bette Midler, always a treat, is simply exceptional in this role. There is great music, lots of laughter and even a tear or two. I have seen most of the big musicals of the eighties and nineties. Somehow I missed this one, so there is no comparison. But if it is restored, I will be the first in line for tickets! But this film is so good that I will wonder if the theatrical production will fit the film.
