“The Man Who Knew Too Much” (1955) - Alfred Hitchcock’s own remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on vacation in Morocco, where they fell into a nightmare that includes murder, espionage, murder and worst of all, the kidnapping of their 10-year-old son. The film, which Hitchcock himself considered superior to the original, is very funny. Stewart and Day spend good chemistry together. The film is filled with wonderful comic scenes and dialogues, as well as scenes of frightening expectations. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of “Que Sera, Sera” turned out to be a brilliant move, because the song rarely matches the content and plays such an important role in the film as “Que Sera, Sera” in the movie “The Man Who Too Much knew. " <br /> <br /> Hitchcock also treats us to live music performed by Arthur Benjamin “Storm Cloud Cantata” for almost ten minutes while the scene takes place at the Royal Albert Hall in London, where an attempt was made on a very important politician, and both The scene and cantata are amazing.
