It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after receiving this movie, and this is either love or hate, this is a reaction. You probably either love it or hate it too. I think that the best films are those that separate people, because obviously they have some kind of influence. I am in a five star camp because this film made a real impression on me and made me want to come back and learn more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned in when it all happened. Especially in Afghanistan, and I feel guilty about it. The music in the film was beautiful. I was constantly lost in it, especially during some historical memories. Personally, I thought the sound was great. It seemed to me that the soundtrack with the speeches, music and radio was composed so that you feel that you are in the RV with the main character Jim or in his head. Everything that was not on the radio was very clear, and everything on the radio sounded as if it really was on the radio. Anyway, this is a very awesome DVD that made me cry.
