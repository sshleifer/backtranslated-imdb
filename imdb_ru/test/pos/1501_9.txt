At the end of the 1940s, a series of short films titled “Flickering Memories” were released, in which excerpts from silent dramas involving such as Mary Pickford and Blanche Sweet were played for laughter. Scratched clips from outdated old films were rearranged, projected too quickly, with overlaid music and lame notes. The attitude expressed in this cruel treatment largely summed up Hollywood’s mid-century look on its early days: a silent movie was considered ridiculous, ornate, a little embarrassing and useful only for laughter. During the 1950s, this attitude gradually began to change for a number of reasons. James Agee's famous 1949 essay on silent clowns for Life magazine was an important factor, but television played an important role in re-introducing viewers to silent films. Admittedly, television networks sometimes handled the material as rudely as people from Flicker Flashbacks, but in more toned series such as Silents, Please, treated movies with respect. Another milestone was the team of Robert Youngs "GOLDEN AGE OF COMEDY", which turned out to be an unexpected hit when it was released in theaters in late 1957. <br /> <br /> I don’t know if Charles Chaplin knew Youngson’s movie or its success at the box office, but around this time he decided to start a theatrical re-release of three of his best short comedies: “LIFE'S DOG”, “LACE ARMS” ( both made in 1918) and THE PILGRIM (made in 1922 and released the following year). These three films worked as a trio, as they are well contrasted by plot, theme and setting. In addition, all three have familiar faces from the Chaplin joint-stock company, some of which play several roles in each short film. At the time of the re-release, films were not shown in public for more than thirty years, so perhaps Chaplin was concerned about maintaining his reputation among viewers of the new generation, especially since his best work was rarely shown on television in the early days of the new medium. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Chaplin seems to have come to the conclusion that the films were moving too fast with the old speed of silent projection, so it was decided to “stretch them”, which meant that every other frame was printed twice. Perhaps he wanted to avoid the Flicker Flashbacks look, but it was not the best way to do it. Aesthetically speaking, the results were terrible and almost ruined the course of the film, but nevertheless it was THE CHAPLIN REVUE that was released for cinemas in 1959, and it was this version that was ported to video and became commercially available Playhouse Video in the 1980s . At that time, I purchased a VHS copy of the film and was terribly disappointed with the tattered rhythm of the films “Stop and Start.” <br /> <br /> I am particularly pleased to learn that David Shepard is restoring Chaplin’s collection. (originally created for the laser disc format) is a significant improvement over the Playhouse Video version. For the most part, the projection speed has been fixed. The stretch print has disappeared anyway, although sometimes it seems that the action is delayed. For example: in “DOG'S LIFE” during Edna and Charlie’s awkward dance at Green Lantern Cafe, Edna’s bare hands look noticeably blurred; at another moment, during the trench scene in SHOULDER ARMS, when Charlie is relieved of his guard duty, the action seems strangely slow for a few moments, but this may be the result of a maneuver of film restorers to cover a little decomposition. In general, the image quality is fantastic, considering age of the films themselves. <br /> <br /> Other bonuses: REVUE begins with rare backstage shots taken in Chaplin’s studio. This includes shots of a clearly organized rehearsal where Chaplin stifles miniature actor Loyal Underwood, as well as scenes with Charlie at his vanity table, applying make-up and cutting his famous mustache. These scenes are accompanied by Chaplin’s narration, delivered in a quick clip. Chaplin also wrote a new musical score for compilation, and, in my opinion, his themes for REVUE are ranked by his best compositions, especially the plays used during the cafe sequence in A DOG'S LIFE. The only exception is a song written for THE PILGRIM, a pseudo-Singin 'Cowboy number called "Bound for Texas", performed in the style of the fifties by Matt Monroe (sounds more like Gene Autry), which distracts with anachronism and inappropriate. Otherwise, throughout the rest of the revue, music is perfect for action and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It feels like the THE CHAPLIN REVUE release in a sense is, in a sense, his postponing debut, presenting these classic comedies as they should have been seen all the time. In this form, REVUE is one of the most durable and pleasant works of Chaplin.
