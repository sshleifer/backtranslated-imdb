I am a 49-year-old woman who is happily married and she likes to LOVE this film to death. <br /> <br /> Gina Davis's character is strong, intelligent and stunning ........... .... I thought she did a great job in this film (this is an understatement). <br /> <br /> I'm not very good at action movies, but it seemed to me that it was sooooo sexy and interesting. /> <br /> She is my alter-ego ............. when she begins to assemble this assault rifle in an old hotel room ............ ... ...... I have chills ............... she did it as if she knew what she was doing ............ one of my MANY favorite roles in this film ........ <br /> <br /> I think she deserves an Oscar for her acting and physical roles ........ <br /> <I'm going to do tattooed "Charlie" on my back .............. I am one of those girls who will NEVER BE VICTIMS ....... ........... .... I, like her ............... (shshshshshshshshshshshshshshshshshshsh ... secretly ........ and not that oh so sexy th?)
