This is one of the best films about the 80 punk scene. I saw it a few years ago on the bootleg of a copy and was amazed. Very few of today's children know the true roots of punk, and this film shows some of the 80s punk legends, such as The Germs, and how it was then. So much punk has now become popular with MTV and radio, and it's nice to see the real underground rebel movement of the original scene. Darby Crash (from The Germs) is one of my heroes, and this film shows why. Be sure to look at all the "punks" and everyone who is interested in the punk scene of the 80s
