I swore that I would never allow myself to go to the fictitious authority figures of the sixties, who told me that in the "good old days" things are better ?? The current Prime Minister of Australia is a disgusting example of just such thinking. <br /> <br /> But I switched to “A Decade Influenced” because I found myself watching a very acclaimed documentary “Sneakers” on another channel such a depressing experience. I believe that the values ​​expressed by the Sneaker respondents are too ugly to be accepted as reasonable. So materialistic! So devoid of any sense of anger in a society that can kill someone, to steal his very ugly shoes! It was so lacking in any worthwhile goal that they could, without disgust, report on the exploitation of the audience, offering them to hold these shoes over their heads to conclude a sponsorship deal for themselves with a company of shoemakers, there were too many to keep watching. <Br /> <br /> “Decade Influenced” depicted a completely different response to the fruit of stupidity, corruption and lust in high (and low) places. <br /> <br /> I noticed a change in the film; the creation of this was accompanied by the exposure of America’s catastrophic foreign policy disasters in Vietnam and many other less well-known places on my site www.peterhenderson.com.au. The Influenced Decade documents the exact moment when these changes occurred. <br /> <br /> Until the seventies, the armed forces were depicted in American films as an invincible fighting force consisting of decent people who were transmogrified in capturing heroes on the battlefield. After the seventies, they are usually portrayed as a dejected rabble, misled by a bunch of clown bureaucrats in the Pentagon. Until the seventies, an FBI agent and an honest cop were usually portrayed as your friend and protector. After the seventies, all the FBI agents were incompetent, and the best that a policeman could aspire to is to ignore their stupidity and corruption of their boss and defend justice in their own way. <br /> <br /> Until the seventies it is an archetype. The American “little guy,” “average Joe,” a type of Jimmy Stewart, had to solve problems and thus gain some insight into the deep wisdom of his chosen leaders and the justice of the “American way.” After the seventies, Kevin Costner is usurping this role, but now he is a voice crying in the wilderness that evil can be exposed, or by accepting one’s destiny and trying hard. <br /> <br /> And now these views of the “religion of the old time” are devoid of any honesty and righteousness and are depicted (with a certain amount of justification) as sanctimonious fanaticism and selfish hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> “Decade Influenced” tells how it was. “A Decade Influenced” talks about how it is now. It depicts the release of the American film industry from the hands of artistically, morally and intellectually bankrupt studio moguls. This shows the storming of the Hollywood Bastille by independent directors who have promised to return a disappointed and tired audience to the cinema. The fact that their failures were numerous and at times disastrous only underlines the greatness of their achievements. Achievement is reflected in the adventurous and dubious views of large box office stars such as Clooney, Daman, Affleck, and others, as well as directors and producers who provide cars for their talent.
