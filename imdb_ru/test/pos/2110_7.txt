First I am a teenager. Good, and I must say that this film was pretty good. I think any child under the age of ten will like it, but people of my age may be a little bit, well, well, we would describe the film as LAME! But I liked it. Maybe I still behave like a child, or I visit a cattle farm every weekend, but this film was cute. I liked that the actors looked like children, and not like little bright cute cakes, with three layers of clothes, a fashionable hat and about a thousand accessories (like most of today's shows, Drake & Josh, Lizzie Mc Guire well, any a show for children.) And the setting was perfect, but there was a drawback. The family was in debt, right? Why in the world did their inner home look like something from a "Western" all-around? It was one flaw. <br /> <br /> Cameos are great, there are about five hundred of them, and the only explanation is Julia Roberts, the main aunt of a little girl. How in the world did they get everyone else? It seemed that this film had a limited budget. <br /> <br /> I liked this film, it was fun to watch, and I thought that some parts were far from ready (Like a cow selling for 750,000 dollars? Ha! my ass cow is selling a lot for it!) But otherwise it was good, I liked it, and I could watch it again. But I would never have bought it; there are not even special features on the DVD! What's up with that? But rent it, especially if small children run in the house.
