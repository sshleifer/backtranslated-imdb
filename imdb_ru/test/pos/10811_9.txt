French cinema has always been very strong when it comes time to present historical plots. 95% of the time they never make mistakes. This film is one of the best in the genre, thanks to a very very strong actor game of Depardieu and Psonjak. Waida, as a director, is truly a miracle. Everyone should see this wonderful movie.
