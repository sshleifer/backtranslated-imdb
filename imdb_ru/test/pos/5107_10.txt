When it opened in London during the Christmas season of 1969, this musical version of the famous story of James Hilton was criticized by critics. The same reception welcomed him when he opened in the USA, prompting MGM to withdraw its Roadshow status and cut out almost all of its songs. What mistake !!! <br /> <br /> Looking after years, when the fashion world of the 60s and 70s turned around, this version of GOODBYE, MR.CHIPS causes complete admiration. First of all, as “Chipped”, Peter O'Toole gives one of his greatest performances. Watching him turn from a hated, cold, unfeeling Latin teacher in a boarding school for a boy, to a man who can finally see the colors in the world (after falling in love and marrying musical star Katherine Briskit) means seeing genius at work. (If you can, watch LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, LION IN WINTER, MY FAVORITE YEAR AND CHIPS for a few days or weeks. Then you will see what a really great actor O'Toole is and how great he is in CHIPS.) <br /> <br /> Katherine, played by luminous Petula Clark, at the peak of her popularity, is always a man’s dream; beautiful, loving, understanding, with a great voice. Most of the songs are beautiful and fit perfectly into the story, while the director of the late Herbert Ross wonderfully animates the process. <br /> <br /> Well, this film may be too romantic for some people, but for those who are looking for a beautifully played, sung and directed love story, look no further. (If you can get a version with a wide-format laser disc, even better. I'm looking forward to debuting CHIPS on DVD.)
