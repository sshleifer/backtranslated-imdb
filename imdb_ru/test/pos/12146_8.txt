“Classes and risks” is one of the best “gangsters” of noir films ever produced by France. Ideal cast: Lino Ventura, young Jean-Paul Belmondo (who made the “souffle bout” of Godard the same year), Marcel Dalio and the wonderful cast, a brilliant script by José Giovanni, who also wrote Becker’s masterpiece in same year! What a year for him !; Wonderful black-and-white cinematography of Gislena Cloquet. And tight action, first-class director Claude Saute, who surpasses Jean-Pierre Melville. While the latest gangster film with metaphysical claims, which sometimes lasts more than two hours, Claude Sothet directs people of flesh and blood, and the presence of two children adds moments of extraordinary sharpness that Melville could never produce. And Sote avoids pathos, excessive sentimentality: the last time Ventura sees his children, the descent to the subway (metro) is the peak of reserved emotions. <br /> <br /> Ventura portrays a gangster whose dies when the film begins. He thinks he can rely on his former acquaintances, but they are all cowards - we are far from the courageous friendship, dear Jacques Becker ("touchez pas au grisbi"), which Melville had to continue throughout the Sixties, sometimes incited by mean-spirited women (the film Noir misogynist ”, living in a rotten microcosm, ready to tell about himself), is far from Jean Seberg's simplistic behavior in Godard’s“ opus ”. > Cloquet creates miracles with a picture: a scene on the beach on a starless night, when two children see their mother dying after a shootout with customs officers, is staggering. <br /> <br /> good use of voice-overs, which cotet uses only when necessary, therefore the last lines make the ending even stronger than if we were present at the scenes. <br /> <br /> Claude Sothet found a good niche, and he followed the rules of “classroom risks” quite well in his continuation of l'arme à gauche (1965), which included Van Tours again and made good use of the uninhabited island and ship. If he continued in the same vein, France would have Howard Hawks. In his subsequent works, only Max et les ferrailleurs (1971) showed something brilliant. He showed himself in the first half of the sixties. Beginning with "les choses de la vie", he became a cinema-quality director who focused on gentle bourgeois in such works as Cesar et Rosalie (1972). , "Vincent Francois, Paul and Others" (1974) or "Mado" (1976)
