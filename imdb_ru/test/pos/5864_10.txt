I remember this movie as another person said. I recorded it, but I would like it to be with me now, simply because it was supposed to be one of the worst films ever. Funny, very bad. I remember the label on the box: "The ultimate frontal lobotomy." I got it from my mom, who got it from a friend at work, who said it was the worst / funniest film she had ever seen, so my mom said, "My son will surely like it." and the woman gave it to her just to get her out of her possession. Later I taped it, which I regret. I also remember that the “screw with screw” was one of those who caught the balls ... in the shape of a yellow cone, with a red “button” on the end, and when you push the red thing, it sends the ball flying. Well, they used it with a handle at one end and a corkscrew in the funnel. When the killer killed, they showed him that he was ahead with a “weapon” and then cut into pieces what seemed like raw chicken and fake blood on the victim’s head. I don't know what else to say about this "pearl", except that if you like bad movies, it doesn't get worse than that.
