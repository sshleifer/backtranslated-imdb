I will never forget the spectacular effect this show had on me when I first saw it. From the moment when the major is struck by a clown, to his painful attempts to understand the situation (“We are alive, we are people, we must have memories!”, An inaccurate quote, but close), to his clever attempt to improvise as a means of salvation drama. <br /> <br /> Small touches remain with the viewer for a long time after viewing. The moment when the beloved ballerina dances for everyone, turnkey, the screeching of the bagpipes of a Scottish musician; Rogue's thoughtful remark: “Miss is as good as mile,” the shocked major's conclusion that they should be in hell. <br /> <br /> This is a great episode, beautifully written and valid. Susan Harrison's addictive beauty adds a memorable, touching story to the memory.
