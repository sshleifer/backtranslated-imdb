It should be one of the best musicals after Astaire made by Colombia. Created by Arthur Schwartz and directed by the veterinarian Charles Widor, this picture really put Gina Kelly on the map and consolidated Rita Hayworth's reputation as the main partner of female dance in the movie. She plays a dual role here because she plays the modern numbers of the 1940s with Gene and film colleague Phil Silvers, but also puts her in the role of a grandmother, a nightclub artist at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> The music should also be highlighted because it was, I believe, the last project that the legendary Jerome Kern worked on (the most famous “Old Man’s River” and “The Smoke in Your Eyes Today”) and his The author of the text was equally Legendary Ira Gershwin. They set the bill, which is full of charm and characteristics. The music for the historical episodes is particularly noteworthy because it is so perfectly stylized to the idiom of the early 20th century, which was the original Kern period. It’s like taking a recording from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing how they perform a song in the original style of the time. <br /> <br /> The story is rather insignificant, which suits me because this film is as close as you can ever see about the golden age of the Broadway style of a musical comedy of the 1930s - 40s. Even the propaganda aspects of the 1940s film music give it extra charm, as the talented trio sings "Break Through Tomorrow" and even playfully tease American enemies and use slang from that time, for example, referring to "gremlins". <br /> <Perhaps the most memorable performance in the film is Kelly's dance under “The Alter-Ego Dance” in which he argues and then dances with himself as a metaphorical battle of conscience. This predetermines much of his later work, and is also an effective and memorable scene in itself. <br /> <br /> Fans will want to search for this for various reasons — Kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside of MGM with a different set of colleagues and music beyond his usual MGM material. Hayworth fans will want to see Rita in gorgeous color at the peak of her fame and abilities. And fans of classic Broadway musicals will probably want to hear the final score of Kern and marvel at the quality of Gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles. This is a definite jewel in the crown of the Colombian music program.
