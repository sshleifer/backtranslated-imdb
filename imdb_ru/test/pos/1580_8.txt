This film, I would like to say, was great. I can see how many people think this is just a shocking movie. This is not at all wrong, but it is just as shocking a story as Chuck Palahniukâ€™s books. Bijo no Haravata is one of my favorite films of all time. This is a certain type of rude films that you can get almost any reaction to. It's scary, funny, stupid, rude, full of unusual materials and makes some people excited. The first time I saw it, it was with a friend of mine, and his mother brought him home so that he could see it. He said it was just some spoiled Japanese movie, but I saw a lot more than that. This is badly done, yes, but he has a certain type of acuity to be also beautiful. As the director himself says, this is a shocking film made for a specific reason. It's like atrophy. If you leave the audience soft, then the whole human race will become soft. I think this is a good philosophy, and I agree with it a hundred. Bijo no Haravata is a type of film in which the gang fucking rapes itself by doing fitness, yogurt and all these new things.
