This is a real gem of science fiction! Peter Cushing gives a special personality to this classic midnite film. <br /> <br /> I especially like the sound design. The strange, intermittent voice of creatures and rhinos - all this creates a bizarre background (of course, the baby dressed in scanty clothes does not hurt either!)
