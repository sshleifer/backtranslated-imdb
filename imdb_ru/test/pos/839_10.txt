The third and final film is Scorpio Prisoner, directed by Shun Ito. The star of the series, Meiko Kaji, will finish the series in the fourth part, Grudge Song, with the director Yashuhara Hasebe (who also put Kaji in the excellent game Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The original female prisoner # 701: Scorpio is one of my favorites. The sequel, Jailhouse 41, is almost as good. As a rule, he is considered the best of the series, and I can agree, I think, if he ever gets the best release on DVD (original, Image, very bad). Beast Stable, in my opinion, is almost as good as the FP701. It is much slower, much more contemplative. It has a share of violence and evil, but more attention is paid to history and characters. Sasori (Kaji) escapes the detectives in the first scene (they handcuff her, throws his hand away and runs away with her in tow, which must be seen to be believed!) And connects with the freelance prostitute Yuuki. Yuki is harassed by the local prostitution ring, which includes a stupid Madame with a cage full of crows of domestic animals. What really surprised me was how sad the film is. Yuki's story, which is never solved, is heartbreaking. The images are striking, and the guide is Ito masterfully. It is a pity that he did not go anywhere after leaving the FP701 series. This is a terrific movie.
