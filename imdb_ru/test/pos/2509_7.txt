Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookstore in the sleepy coastal town of Lobolli by the sea. Divorced, Elena has a little daughter who is going to camp for the summer, giving her mother a little more freedom. Helenâ€™s store is run by manager Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a crazy village gossip who looks after the beautiful fireman George (Tom Selleck), and two young students, Jennifer (Julianna Nicholson) and Johnny Tom Everett Scott). One day, Helen stumbles upon a romantic, tender love letter, and she suspects that Johnny wrote it for her. Throwing caution to the wind, Helen and Johnny begin a little "thing." But then the letter falls into the hands of others, including Janet, who thinks that George sent her to her, and Johnny, who imagines that Helen composed it for him. And, on and on the letter goes. But in truth, George may have eyes for Helen, and Jennifer suffered a lot for Johnny. The curator of the city museum can also have secret love. Will such things get confused? This is a cute movie with great decor and capable stars. Each of the main actors gives a pleasant presentation, including the addition of Blythe Dunner and Gloria Stewart to those mentioned earlier. In addition, the coastal landscapes are the nicest, the costumes are quite well chosen, and the photo is very good. There are several surprises, including a thin game plot, which may not appeal to all viewers. But for those who love romantic comedies, this one should be included in any list of good choices for the genre.
