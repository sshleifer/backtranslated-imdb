One of the best horror / suspense movies I've seen in a long time. Wow, it was a big surprise and stunned by how good this film is, sometimes such a stone appears, but rarely. I expected it to be a popcorn monster and a slightly distracting way to spend a late night, but instead a very well-made and directing film with great acting, shot with passion and heart. <br /> <br /> This is a film that makes you feel the characters and what happens to them, and it is shot as if you were there, and it really happens. I know that some people in other reviews compare it to Open Water, but I do not agree, because I thought Open Water was rather boring and mediocre, although this film was the opposite, although at first glance they were shot in the same "realistic" style. br /> <br /> The actors are unknown, at least for me, but they are all very effective and convey a terrible situation with frightening intensity and realism. The story is well made and flows smoothly, the plot is logical and, it seems, something that can happen, all the actions and thoughts of the characters - this is what a person will do and think. Very believable, and because of this the film becomes more real. <br /> <br /> At the end I had tears in my eyes. I have to say that the film rarely has such an impact on me, this is how powerful and emotional this film was, and I was impressed by the director and actors of this wonderful film.
