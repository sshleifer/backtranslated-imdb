No, it has nothing to do with the comedy series "Seinfeld" or its eccentric and funny character Cosmo Kramer. In fact, Kramer vs. Kramer is an excellent dramatic film, without a doubt one of the best of its kind and one of the greatest films of all time. I am glad that he got more Oscars than Apocalypse Now, because he really deserves such fame. <br /> <br /> “Kramer vs. Kramer” is a great movie, so well done and so balanced that I wouldn’t change anything about it. There is nothing wrong with the film. This is filmmaking of the highest quality. And this also stands the test of time. Not only does it not look outdated, but its cultural influence is long, and its realistic history remains as significant as it was in 1979. Eternal classics. Today they do not make such films. <br /> <br /> This film is dramatic, realistic, simple, but brilliant, rich, powerful, sweet and even tragic and even depressing. However, he also has a great sense of humor. He has no special effects, but who cares? This is not a movie or a place to discuss such things. For a film like this, such a thing would be meaningless and completely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. The chemistry of the actors is just perfect. All the actors are great, but the 3 main ones are the best. Dustin Hoffman, a brilliant actor, has the greatest idea here, as an attractive but distant workaholic Ted Kramer. Meryl Streep is great as Ted Joan's wife. And sweet little Justin Henry is terrific as a loving, but sometimes stubborn Billy, the son of Ted and Joanna. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is all instrumental and wonderful. The introductory song (guitarist Frederick Hand) is brilliant. The rest of the soundtrack is mainly Antonio Vivaldi's classical music and is simply gorgeous. <br /> <br /> This film also has an incredible character development. Look at Ted Kramer's character: a workaholic who becomes an amazing father after he has no choice but to take care of his son, trying to adapt these new responsibilities to his work after his wife Joann left him. With this, Ted learns about the most beautiful things in life, but also understands how life is, with problems in his work and the return of Joanna, who wants custody of her son. But even Joanna is changing for the better, and the final is an unexpected surprise when you first see it. <br /> <br /> In this film there is something, for example, scenes in the courtroom where Ted and Joanna face the brutal nature of the murder provoked by lawyers. Another thing to see is when poor Billy falls from the gym in the jungle with his toy (plane) and gets a serious face injury. But again, the scene is very well done, and what happens next is very intense: his father quickly runs and crosses numerous neighborhoods, ignoring the movement to take his son to the hospital. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a film that is a good lesson in life. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be in the top 250.
