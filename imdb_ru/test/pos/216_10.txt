The inspiration for the films “Naked Gun” is Leslie Nielsen, who has just recently begun acting in a comedy, * as the incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin, who always solves a ridiculous thing. Like "Airplane!" and films based on the series, humor relies on solid Mel Brooks-like jokes and silly comments (namely, “yes, that’s so”), and the fact that Nielsen remains very serious, despite all the rubbish around him. And, of course, the last frame in which something is moving. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there were only six episodes in the series. At least it spawned a movie. You can't be wrong with Leslie Nielsen in such roles. I suspect that they were all having fun shooting this. Really funny. <br /> <br /> * Before Plane! Leslie Nielsen starred in films such as Forbidden Planet, Harlow and The Adventure of Poseidon. Back in 1987, he starred in Nuts along with Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfus. But since the release of the first movie "Naked Gun" all this time there was a comedy.
