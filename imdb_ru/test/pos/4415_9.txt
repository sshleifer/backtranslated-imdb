I was the youngest in high school when Flesh came out on big screens, but I was lucky to see him at midnight in New York cinemas just two years later. <br /> <br /> Flesh is the first part of the so-called “trilogy” of films featuring Joe Dullesandro as an object of desire. He bears the name "Warhol", but this is more the work of Paul Morrissey. In fact, the story is connected with the exploits that happened one day in the life of a street vendor man (played by Joe Dullesandro). Joe is young, handsome and a bit naive ... but he manages to bring home the bacon to his wife for reasons that should not be explained to fully appreciate the film. <br /> <br /> Movie lovers are the fact that this film (along with the remaining two of the trilogy), in fact, did not have a script. Warhol superstars were simply given a prerequisite ... and the words and actions that the viewer sees are quite natural (even sometimes funny or meaningless). But in general, it works ... Rolling Stone noted in his review that the film was better than Midnight Cowboy, the film of the same year, more polished by Hollywood (Oscar winner for best film), with a big name talent ( I equally admire the film) ... but FLESH, being improvised, was somehow more painful and realistic, without the need for complex plots and any "reasons for celebrity" ... or for that matter any reason at all! <br /> <br /> The film raised over $ 3 million and became an absolute sensation, especially on the German market (which, ironically, thought they were given a “censored version” of the film because of post-editing .... see note below). <br /> <br /> It is curious that the film is very "cut out and pasted" with a "bang." “Clicks”, “flashes”, and the dialogue is literally clipped in the middle of a sentence. It’s as if Warhol / Morrissey is telling a simple truth that this is a “day in the life” superstars, excerpts for your voye tendencies. Much better than before, Warhol works with an 8-hour sleep, and the statue of liberty works like a more than 20-hour film. <br /> <br /> FLESH, in my opinion, is the first of Warhol's films, which is actually easily assimilated (with a wide palette) and Warhol’s / Factory’s first legitimate response to the Hollywood star phenomenon. <br /> <br /> The first of the “trilogy” depicts a young, desired male icon, naive, searched for, responding to invitations to please his family. Subsequent films will show “the same character” with a different set of values. (See “Basket” and “Heat”)
