Having received this DVD from the ACCENT series, which is a label specializing in feature films, they released The Irreversible and a number of Bergman's opuses. <br /> <br /> What struck me in the Alex Frein film with the strange name MODERN LOVE is that it is a flawless film that breathes perfection and foresight, a film that reminds us of Mr. Joe the Middle, full of voices , visions and madness. It is set in rural rural Australia, the film does not trivialize or praise people like many Australian films. that is, our films are full of "cute crooks" or people with "golden hearts", etc., etc., etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Not in this movie. The spirit of Stanley Kubrick looms very wide here, he is not perfect, but he has a fascinating attention to detail, a romantic strip and a mood that invigorates, if not hugs. <br /> <br /> Minor quibbles ... the translation looks defective - the front credits have been sliced, they do not fit into the frame. <br /> <br /> Also one of the short films is damaged, it stops halfway through.
