It is very easy to understand why “New Professionals” were losers, at least in New Zealand: they not only followed in the footsteps of the original, but also followed “Bodyguards”, which significantly surpassed “Professionals” in their boss show and two agents. Commander McIntyre has recently been George Cowley: tough on his team, but to those who defended them to death against others. The shadow cast on the show was huge. <br /> <br /> Well, not as big as it should have been in the UK. Here he was online in prime time. He even sold in promotions as "They are professionals." Someone clearly noticed the difference. We are lucky that we did not release this show in different regions at different time intervals. <br /> <br /> For me, it was high performance. As other observers have noted, he followed the great British tradition of one-hour action, but at the same time mixed with personal elements. A small current develops between Liz and Yen, although it never distracts from the real plot. Most of the episodes were based on inflammatory diplomatic incidents that sometimes help Spooks. <br /> <br /> Unlike many shows of the 2000s, the plot was not sacrificed due to photography in costumes or a more stylish direction. Directors such as Christopher Young did not lag behind and did their work. They used good spots, making bodyguards smoother than if they were shot on country roads and side streets. It was modern, today it will still stand beautifully, and it was one of the best examples of the British action movie in the 1990s, showing that the UK can still do them better than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Maybe other than the Germans and their cobras 11.
