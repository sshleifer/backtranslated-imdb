It may seem that some previous reviewers may have overestimated their expectations for this film. I discovered that something was scanning the satellite channels (not knowing what), and came across it. I thought that by name it could be one of countless soft-core porn clicks regularly appearing on movie channels, but I was pleasantly surprised. Although there was some kind of male frontal nudity (actually, more than your typical software title - go figure it out!), This was not the main theme of the film. It was just fun. <br /> <br /> Don't be deceived by my tastes: my recent views included “Before Night Falls” and “Europe”, “Europe” (both). But I also enjoy a complete mental shutdown while watching a movie. Virtual sexuality has done this for me, and it is not bad!
