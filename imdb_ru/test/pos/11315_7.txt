Seeing this film, I remembered the events of September 11. The first thing I remember about this morning is to watch television pictures of an airplane flying into a large building, and my immediate thoughts are “There must be a preview of Tom Clancy’s new film”. <br /> <br /> This was not a Tom Clancy film. It was, of course, not the British version of the "Sum of all fears." A typical film or novel about Tom Clancy has a relatively small cast, a linear plot and, as a rule, some sort of resolution. This film had none. Of course, what I saw right on the screen was a small cast, a plot and an undefined resolution, but, as in 9/11, the point was that the reality was much bigger and more complicated. <br /> <br /> I work in systems planning, and the reality of disaster preparedness exercises, and the catastrophe itself, is painfully obvious. It is impossible to prepare for such a disaster, and it will no longer be possible to cope with it when it happens. <br /> <br /> Coming from a dispute between the police (not enough to prepare) and politicians (if you give everyone a gas mask on the tube, it will cause a panic), constant loudspeaker announcements (you do not represent a danger to your health, but don’t go home until we will not cleanse you), and (Do not eat, do not drink, or smoke until we have cleansed you), I was on the verge of the whole movie. Not the slightest desire to surf. <br /> <br /> This film lasted 90 minutes. This could be twice as much, and all possible details have not yet been shown. Instead, he left unsaid enough for each of us to present the details, each of us in his own way. It made him a lot more real for me than any Tom Clancy film. <br /> <br /> I once lived in London, not far from Edgeur Road. And I took the train from Waterloo many times. Watching the “Dirty War”, I kept repeating to myself that this was just an invention. Right now. <br /> <br /> Allah and Jehovah desire, this film will remain a fiction, and some 20 or 30 years later my nephews can watch this film and recall the beginning of the 21st century, and the panic that we felt too much I hope, to the same extent as I feel now, when viewing memorable things about the Cold War with the regime of evil communism of the mid-20th century, and remember the "Drop and Cut" exercises in school.
