Cuba Gooding Jr. is back to the top! Lord, he did a great job in this movie! I loved this movie. This is one of those good mood movies that makes you run away and volunteer for a mission or something. In any case, I would advise to watch this film in an instant! Well worth the price of admission. As for Cuba, Gooding Jr., just give him his next Oscar right now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
