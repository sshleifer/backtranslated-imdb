When I first saw the poster, I was struck by its calm and beauty. Since then, the city of Istanbul has pursued me until now. <br /> <br /> Not a lot of dialogue, not a lot of music, the whole film was shot just as thoughtfully and aesthetically as a sculpture. This in itself is a landscape. <br /> <br /> In fact, a lot of things happen in the film, but the director intentionally missed most of the dramatic roles and left them to our imagination, thus creating a really flat life. ** (soft spoiler) You can see how the beloved Mahmut cries in the toilet, and then goes out without saying a word, but without their struggle; one can see how Mahmut accompanies his mother in the hospital, but not her struggle with the disease. The most dramatic scene in the film for me is Yusuf, laughing out loud at the toy soldier he bought for his niece **, and it was then that my heart almost broke when I saw how this boring, lonely life had broken out so much. /> <br /> With all the little things in the life of weeds, the story gives us a clean inner world of all the characters, their sadness, anxiety, loneliness, regrets ... And when the story unfolded, I kind of finally understood their desperate situation when there really was no way out for emotions if no external things interfered, which is exactly what every single person tries to save at any cost, especially for an irresponsible artist such as Mahmut. <br /> <br /> I just finished my second observation. Last night I sat down on my blanket, took some vodka near my bed and went through the whole movie in a trance. I felt two real lives, one behind the screen, the other behind the screen. I felt free from all this loneliness and anxiety, because the people inside were experiencing it. I just retired from all these things. <br /> <br /> We cannot deny the universal problem of communication, and loneliness even takes us far to her, and it becomes a vicious spiral. I bet Mahmut has not yet found a way to live at the end. That is why he left his room to try to find answers from the outside world, the cold and the landscape.
