I always felt that Miss Merkerson never got a role suited to her skills. Familiar to millions of law enforcement lieutenants, she was spotted in several theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. Lackawanna Blues of HBO is changing this and allowing this talented actress to show herself as a Nanny, a successful entrepreneur in a world that changes from segregation to integration. But the story is actually about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. <br /> <br /> The plot can be developed in any large African-American community of the 50s and 60s, from Sweet Auburn Atlanta to Harlem in New York. But the angle of integration and segregation is a barely noticeable flaw in the vibrant lives of people in the nanny's boarding house. The story revolves around Nanny's relationship with all types of people who are played by some of the best actors in the business (I didnâ€™t specifically speak black actors - this ensemble is a terrific set of talents that turned out to be black, except for Jimmy Smith. Of course, I recommend this film as funny and colorful look for the long past day.
