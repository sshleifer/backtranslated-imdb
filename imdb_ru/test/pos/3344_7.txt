I probably would not have bothered to comment on this film if I had not been disturbed by the permalinks made to him here in North America as a porn film. Our obsession with what is, or should be, is seen as pornographic remains a relic of the “guides” provided by the filmmakers of the Hayes committee many, many years ago, and now is actually the time when we carried it into the past. Until now, we have not advanced far beyond the limits of creating a somewhat arbitrary separation between the fact that we now have the term “soft” and “hard” porn, as with carrying the same label of pornography. It is time for all of us to recognize that neither the R rating (soft porn?), The release version of this film, nor the non-rated version (hard porn?) Available on DVD were in any way pornographic. <br /> <br /> In legal terms, pornography is determined by its ability to corrupt or damaged. Many classic books, such as Lady Chatterley's lover, Fanny Hill, Women in love, O story or Moll Flanders, were prosecuted for pornographic content, by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition, but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they view as legal ambiguity, and apply a simpler test that is rather harsh when applied to books or films that are very close to the line, but serve to quickly clear most in others from any infection of pornography. Although the Hayes code would rate AIW as unacceptable both for nudes and for describing sexual activities, in practice most people today recognize that when the main idea of ​​a book or film is clearly intended to encourage long-term stable family relationships in which participants find real fulfillment, it cannot be considered as pornographic (this does not mean at all that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relations should be recognized as pornographic, only that nor may need a more complex assessment). In AIW, we have a film about a young woman librarian, who has a rather cozy upbringing, and she keeps her fiancé at arm's length because of the feeling that this is what morality demands of her. After being too upset and threatening to leave her, she falls asleep and dreams of moving her to Wonderland (closely related to Lewis Carroll), where everyone she meets is completely free in her sexual needs. She is shocked, but a kind person who perceives things as she finds them, so she soon discovers that her own prejudices are gradually melting. She wakes up when her boyfriend comes back to break their romance, but her attitude towards him has changed so much that their relationship has fully recovered, and the film ends up living “happily and happily” with their children in a house with a white paling and family dog - the ending is clearly aimed at those romantic who remain very young soulful <br /> <br /> pornographic.? - Hardly! <br /> <br /> Suitable for children? - Well, probably not quite, except that they have very progressive parents. <br /> <br /> R rating? - PG would be more appropriate today. <br /> <br /> Is it entertaining for viewers in most age groups? - Yes, but the film has its drawbacks. - this is discussed in many of the comments here on IMDb, however most commentators clearly appreciated and liked it <br /> <br /> I believe that only pornography associated with this film was reported to the anti-pornography activist "scientific evidence" claims, that the picture magazine Kristin Debell was a photographic montage of images of a ten-year-old face with various body parts of adult models. These and other comments seriously undermined the career of a very promising young actress, but today the film seems to be on its way to a cult classic. Several home video releases in VHS and DVD format have been released; the last was a DVD containing both R and non-rated versions of the film, released by Subversive Cinema in 2007. Copies of this were readily available up to several months ago, now they are almost exhausted, and mail order suppliers who still have copies in stock sell them many times over their original price — a situation that usually quickly leads to a new one. DVD release. This constant interest almost 35 years after the original film was released indicates an almost classical status. <br /> <br /> Commentators in this database are expected to provide fellow audiences with useful guidance on whether to watch a film or even collect — my comments here are aimed at emphasizing the ongoing damage to the industry, which is still is the result of pressure on large studios to comply with self-censorship recommendations emanating from the Heiss Committee. In this database, such general comments are quickly noted by readers as "useless", and I rarely make them; but, fortunately, I still have a place to add that, in my opinion, this film is rather unusual and worth watching or even buying. This is a mistake, but Christine de Bell gives excellent performance, and the film gives a rather unique and rewarding viewing experience. In general, I would rate it at 7 stars and will buy a copy of the next edition on DVD if and when it appears. If Mrs. DeBell is still alive today, I would like to hear her comments both on attempts to suppress this film, and on the late recognition that he gradually achieved.
