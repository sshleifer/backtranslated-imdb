Well, this film is definitely in line with modern times. There are no happy ends, superheroes or miracles. It’s just a mundane fiction to stimulate our minds along the line of terrorism, and what if. Kudos to Percival and Mikeri for the excellent script and excellent direction of Percival. Such films are needed to keep us informed of what is happening there. If every peace-loving man and woman on earth reported clearly suspicious actions, I believe that terrorism cannot flourish. This film showed how difficult it is to actually undermine these terrorists, even with good intelligence. Although the film is a bit propagandistic against Islam (the Muslim policeman is used as the main character), I think it was completely realistic. In the bombardment incident there should have been a shock value. As a very clever tool for identifying the humility and humiliation of people caught up in such an attack, they demonstrated the total nakedness of disinfecting women after an attack. It didn’t take me long to realize that this should have further impressed the viewer, who thought, that is, we do not control everything in such a situation. Although it happened in London, with the usual high-level British acting, it makes a statement for any part of the world. Great movies do not have to be an epic blockbuster, and this film is very, very worthy of viewing.
