I'm really fed up with sitcoms; You feel that you always know what is happening, so it stops being funny. On the other hand, Hi de Hi, you rarely know what is happening, and it is funny to laugh out loud. I just bought the second set of the series (series 3-4), and I'm surprised how much I like it all - again. I have nothing but praise for writers or actors (or many unseen members of the crew), because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait. for myself. Croft and Perry created some pure gold, part of which shines through Hi de Hi.
