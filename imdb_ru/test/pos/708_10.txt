When I first saw this movie, I was a kid. I was ten years old when he was released, but since my family never went to the cinema, I saw it on network television. I remember watching him alone and then crying. It was only the second film that banned this answer (Rocky was the first), and since then there haven't been many of them. I cannot say why; Larry "Rain" Murphy did not deserve more victory than Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know that I admired Murphy not so much for what he did, but for how he did his time. Stoic. He did not need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity. He ran because he could. He did not need another reason. I have a rule today that when I see this film late at night on cable television (the only time most people will meet it), I have to watch it, no matter what I do the next morning. Fortunately, he doesn't play as often as “Shawshank Escape” or other favorites, so I slept anyway and never get tired of telling about the unrepentant imprisonment of one person and personal victory.
