I tried to track down The Age of Kings for many, many years. My theatrical life was filled with the actors of this series. At that time, in 1960, I could not keep track of all this, since I myself worked in the theater, a lot of night work. Now, in retirement, I MUST have this and keep it with me. Please, please, whether it can not be released on DVD, I do not mind what it costs. I see that there are others who feel the same. What can we do to do this? Something as great as this should not be sent to oblivion. I have to write two more lines. Well, I can do this by saying that I want this show more than anything else. Just to be able to watch as one of the best actors of our age plays the best words of our wonderful Shakespeare. Isn't that enough! Uzmen
