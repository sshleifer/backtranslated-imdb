Ironically, what makes the film “The Thing” by John Carpenter such an interesting science fiction film are elements of the genre that challenge the mystery, uncertainty and rigid structure of the plot. It is a shame for such films as “Aliens” or “Armageddon”, which satisfy the viewer with special effects, and their plots revolve around tricks that underpin the laws of physics, unidirectional testosterone, heroes equipped with enough artillery to subdue Iraq, and pitiful attempts Introduce “meaning” into a screen with “emotional sequences” that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience. Of course, the main tragedy is that such films with a lobotomy are also the most popular. I think there is a reason for this, although this is not very comforting. In our culture, the tendency to passively “surrender” to the mass media is increasing - to dive into the images that we see, without highlighting a single brain cell to understand the statement that the work is trying to do.

On subsequent views, you will notice a noticeable lack of depth in the action, but the tight story line remains irresistible. Of course, “Citizen Kane” is not so, but then again, fantasy has never been the genre of a thinking person ...
