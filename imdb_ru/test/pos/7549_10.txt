I rented this movie, not knowing what to expect, but WHOA was a treat for me! <br /> <br /> For everyone who, like me, was waiting for a good film combining horror and fiction, it's time to rejoice, because the wait is finally over. Write, shoot, shoot and direct - all at the highest level. I hate to admit it, but I actually cried at one moment (when Dracula was talking to the crippled guy). Really emotional roller coaster from start to finish. The shipâ€™s corridors provided the perfect eerie setting for this story, and the actors really were able to revive their fear of me. And cool as a vampire ... very cute! <br /> <br /> And believe me ... no matter how much of the movie ... the final DOES YOU! I know that this film for some reason causes a lot of noise on this site, but I know that NEVER from you foresaw the end. Brilliant!
