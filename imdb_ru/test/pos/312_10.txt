Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all time (Spielberg, Kopolla and others are named there). The greatest controversy was about Spielberg and whether he is a great director. The problem with Spielberg is that, although he is a master technician, most of his films lack depth. Ryan’s salvation is really outstanding from a technical point of view, but his message is boring and, although very entertaining, it doesn’t make you think about anything. AN is the best film I've ever seen, because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical view of many things, starting with the war as a whole, the clash of civilizations, the state of a soldier during the war (soldier or hero or murderer? Brando says that he is not the one Frenchwoman says that he is both ...) and many others. The problem of some people is that they are trying to argue about whether these points are true or false. But a great film and a great work of art as a whole should cause controversy, and not solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right, but maybe not, no one knows the truth anyway. You can watch this movie for its external beauty, amazing scenes, great game and catchy quotes, and you will be completely satisfied. But what really makes this film a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can't help but compare with the recent Fahrenheit documentary. Both Kopolla and Moore solve similar problems, but while Kopolla poses questions from an external, objective point of view, Moore takes a very partisan position that really jeopardizes the whole point of view. documentary ... It's really a shame that a movie like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like Cannes. But in any case, if you want to understand a little about the Vietnam War, the Iraq War, the Second World War and any war in general, you should definitely see this film, and not another one ...
