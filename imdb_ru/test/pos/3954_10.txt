When I saw this film at the festival a few years ago, I was very impressed and began to look for it. Nothing can be done, neither in cinemas, nor on DVD, nor on Blue Ray. Absolutely nothing !!! How is this possible, can this really happen ??? The direction is NECESSARY, the story is intriguing and was filmed in a very original form, the music is beautiful, and James Franco is damn hot! this is the right life !!!!!!!!!! This is really a very good movie that people should see, and it deserves another chance !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Edward
