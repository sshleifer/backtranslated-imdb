I just started watching this show. It was broadcast in Ireland at the moment on the Irish television channel RTE1 at 12:30 pm (as of July 26, 2006). <br /> <br /> This program literally makes me laugh out loud, and I can't brag about it on most Sitcoms (except for the British “Office” with Ricky Gervais in it). <br /> <br /> Today’s episode of TKoQ (July 26, 2006) was when Carrie started a new job, invited her friends home and left. to make coffee, and Doug wants Carrie not to have “external” friends, so he raises his top and shows his “belly hair”! and licks his plates when he goes out for lunch! But another funny episode was last week, when an old guy (carries dad) won at Bingo, and this episode scared me with laughter, especially when they came out and took a spare fridge, and father Karris stood there, looking at him, and thought that it was new. <br /> <br /> So I don’t know how long it will last on Irish television or at what stage (year of recording) we are, but I hope that it will not end soon, because I am I really enjoying it . <br /> <br /> Summing up, we can say that there is excellent literature, excellent characters and comedians (namely, Kerry, Doug and Father Karris), excellent highlights and good results are a little bold and are sometimes noted beside ( send the kids out of the room!), but I think this American Sitcom is a winner and very funny.
