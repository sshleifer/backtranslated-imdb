This film is very beautiful and slow. There is nothing about Hollywood. It is very Danish and the characters are very real. This is the first Danish film dedicated to this transgender subject. It really is love that has no gender. I would not say that this is lesbian love, although the two main characters (transsexual Veronica and Charlotte) are attracted to each other. This is a story about love and life. <br /> <br /> The story largely takes place in two apartments. Background music is almost absent, which makes it more real and rich. The two actors playing the main characters are great. They really make them seem real. These are not archetypes, but real people who can be met on the street. I think this is the first time I see a transgender portraying it well. Very well done.
