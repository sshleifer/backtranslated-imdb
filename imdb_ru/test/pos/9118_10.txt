Tonight, I watched The D's new film in a special preview, and I was so impressed with its great grandeur that I felt that I had to come to IMDb and tell about it. Admittedly, I was already a big fan of D - I loved the HBO series and listened to their music weekly (there is nothing better to sing with her), but this gratitude actually made me more wary of going into the screening tonight we were all disappointed the fact that we love when trying to jump on the big screen). With the “Stand of Fate” by Tenacious D is not the case. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie sounds harder than anything I've seen, and funnier and grander than anything that Peter Jackson, Pixar, and Will Ferrell could produce together. He tells the story of D before we met them, telling intriguing stories about Cage and Jables education, how they came together and how they were inspired to write songs about things like Lee, Sasquatch and Dio. Most importantly, they reveal the true inspiration of the Greatest Song in the World, “Dani” and how it came about (which is different from the HBO series version). Once you have witnessed this, you probably cannot remember it (hence the Tribute), but your genius will change forever. <br /> <br /> I don’t often go to the cinema anymore because of the high price of the ticket and because of the hassle associated with parking, paid outrageous prices for the concession, etc., but I usually make exceptions when the main role is played by someone I really love, or something like that. "Pick of Destiny" was so good that I have no doubt that I will see him again when he is released throughout the country, and I plan to convince all my friends to go too. Last week we saw “Borat” and fell in love with it, but, frankly, TEN IS BETTER. For those who really love rock music and comedy shine, watch this movie. The talent of these guys is so great that you should not hesitate to support their cause. You will not be disappointed, and the Lords of the Rock will smile at you favorably.
