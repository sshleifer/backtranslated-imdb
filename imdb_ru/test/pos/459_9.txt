“Journey” is a romantic version of the Cold War. This is an English woman (Deborah Kerr) trying to smuggle her former love, a Hungarian scholar (Jason Robards Jr.), from Hungary during the 1956 uprising in Hungary. She is aboard a bus with thirteen other people who are trying to get out of Hungary across the Austrian border. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Russians stop the bus for security checks. A Russian officer (Yul Brynner) draws an Englishwoman (Deborah Kerr) and delays the trip. Of course, the Russian officer knows the truth about the Hungarian scientist, posing as a British citizen, but he decides not to arrest the scientist, because he is waiting for the Englishwoman to come to him. Of course, this all sounds absurd, but watch this funny movie. Despite the romantic dialogue between Mr. Brynner and Miss Kerr, who seems out of place in the situation they are in, the film becomes tense and interesting. A good game rejects some silly dialogues. Perhaps some people involved in the Hungarian uprising would not appreciate this film; they would consider it a piece of fluff. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite role as Yul Brynner. He speaks with his male voice and is very attractive, especially when he becomes vulnerable. This is the second time Deborah Kerr has been working with Yul Brynner since they made King and Me in 1956. They make a very attractive pair. Too bad they never worked again. It was the second sex role that Miss Kerr received after "From here to eternity." Despite the fact that throughout the film, Ms. Kerr was wearing heavy winter clothes, she was very beautiful and sensual. <br /> <br /> A wonderful cast, led by Jason Robards Jr. in his first film role. Some of the international actors were recognizable, such as Robert Morley from England. However, the rest of the actors, whom I have never seen either before or after, were just great in the film. In the background it was fun to see one of the maids, Senta Berger, speak Hungarian. A few years later, in 1966, she starred in the film “Drop a Giant Shadow”, where Yul Brynner was his leading lady. She still works today.
