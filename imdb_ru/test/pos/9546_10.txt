I salivate to continue. I needed something to keep me from going crazy with tension, anxiety (what if itâ€™s not so good?!) And a constant lack of information. I needed something to calm me a little, something to spend time, except, of course, the Matrix. That was exactly what it was. <br /> <br /> I found it informative (as part of Keanu's neck ...), and something was funny. I felt so sorry for Carrie-Anne when she said that there was only one bathroom and all these guys. I found only one problem with this. Considering that 95% of people were actually men, they just somehow let their lips go berserk, and there was a tongue in them. It's not as bad as a curse in Shawshank Escape, but one scene in which Keanu describes a bad day, cover your ears if you're small. > <br /> <br /> It was interesting and it was exactly what I needed. This is what all Matrix fans who go crazy should keep them alone. They mention a little about the sequels, and someone almost gives something, but catches himself in time (shoot!). He gives you almost no spoilers, but it's great if you are a Matrix head like me. <br /> <br /> There is no spoon.
