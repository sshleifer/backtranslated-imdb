I heard an interview with the main actor who said that the film was not supposed to be a horror film, but he himself would call it mental horror. I strongly support this. <br /> <br /> It is not clear why he goes to this place, but everything is monotonous there, no bright colors, no honest smiles, nothing personal. Everything is ordered, and everyone seems to be happy with such a life. Although our “hero” from the very beginning seems inappropriate and feels it himself. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so important and good is the amazing resemblance to life in many major cities and even countries these days. You have to function, you don’t have to tell your colleague about your weaknesses, you brag about your wealth, your car, and so on. And most of all you lack the true love of life that children have. Naturally, in this film you do not see either children or old people - they simply do not fit into the society of strong workers. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to everyone - and made sure that this utopia does not come true!
