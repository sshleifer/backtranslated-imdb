Jane Smiley's novel, freely based on Shakespeare's "Royal Lesson" about the Cook family and its dark secrets. Director Moorhouse seems tamed in her approach, allowing the characters to step forward and bow. And how could you be mistaken with the talents of Pfeiffer, Lange, Lee, Firth, Carradine and Robards?
