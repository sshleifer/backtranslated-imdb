They both betrayed their country for top secret information. <br /> <br /> The director of the late Oscar-winner: John Schlesinger (“Believers, an Eye for an Eye, Midnight Cowboy”) shot an interesting drama about two young men walking the wrong path in life. Oscar winners: Hatton and Penn are both extremely good at the film. The film is even funny at times and quite disturbing. David Suchet almost steals the show as a person working for the Soviet Union. This picture has a familiar cast in secondary roles. It was rather undervalued when it was first released. Despite some great reviews from some leading film critics. This picture is actually based on a true story. There are some shortcomings in telling stories like these two main characters, but in general, this film is worth seeing. According to the novel by Robert Lindsay. Oscar the Winner Scenario: Stephen Zillian (American Gangster, Hannibal, Schindler's List). (**** / *****).
