This film is notable for how unremarkable it is. This is a true story about one woman and one man and their pursuit of happiness among the boring, hectic life of a housewife and "a man from home." It can be any couple, any family, in any city ... but this is what makes the story so touching. It somehow concerns each of us and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking about it ... and what else could you ask from the film, right? Especially the documentary. This is a great movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves documentaries, stories about families like yours, stories about love, life, raising children, losses, expectations, searching for the soul, longing for life, wandering through life and finding a way. , or not ,
