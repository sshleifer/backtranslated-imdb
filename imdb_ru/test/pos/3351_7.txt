The adult version of the classic Lewis Carroll tale is much better than you might expect. Here Alice is a virgin librarian who falls into a rabbit hole and learns to love sex and her own self-image. Created at a time when films for adults were creative attempts with plots, and not just a series of sex scenes, this cute little film looks more like low-budget films of that time. Despite what you think, this movie actually has a good script with funny jokes and good songs. This is a naughty little fairy tale for adults. If you are wondering if my recommendation is good or not, think that the film was largely available only in its non-hardcore version for most of the past three decades simply because the film sustained the floor. This is how I first saw the film for several years back on cable tv. The relatively recent home video release on DVD brought the floor back (in badly grainy inserted clips), which makes it clear that deleting frames was the best choice. If you are an open-minded adult with a taste for something spicy, I can wholeheartedly recommend this short film as a pleasant entertainment.
