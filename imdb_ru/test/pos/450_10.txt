Most people believe that the greatest performance of Yul Brynner was the ruler of Siam in the movie "King and I". Of course, this gave him a wide range of moods to test his abilities, from comic to tragic, from the desire to learn to dominate to the hated. It also showed him an edge as a "talk singer" and dancer. Finally, since it was also his winning performance “Tony Awards” from Broadway, the film also allowed us to capture something from the magnificent Broadway performance. <br /> <br /> But he starred in other films in which his talents and THE THE were shown. The king and me. His comic twist at once with a feeling was rather pleasant. So was his performance in the role of General Bunin in “Anastasia” or “Ramses” in “The Ten Commandments”. Yet he was very close to becoming the successor to Eric von Stroheim in the 1950s as "the person you love to hate." A certain vulnerability in his actions and roles attracted his public attention, even after his best years as a star were left behind, and he retreated more and more, repeating Siam on television and on stage. <br /> <For me, his best performance is the drama of 1959 with Deborah Kerr, Jason Robards Jr., Robert Morley, E.G. Marshall, Ann Jackson and Ronnie Howard. The film takes place in a fairly modern time - a powder keg, which was in Hungary in 1956, when for a short time it seemed that the iron curtain was about to collapse as a result of the reforms of the Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporters. But the Hungarian revolution collapsed due to bad deadlines. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks to quell the uprising (and Nadia and other reformers were arrested and executed). The West supported the situation and allowed this to happen: Britain and France were embroiled in the Suez crisis, and the US scolded them and Israel for attacking Egypt. Because of the actions of three close allies of the United States, it was difficult for the West to condemn the inflection of the Soviet Union. It was an unfortunate situation, and the Hungarians never forgot how they were thrown into it. <br /> <br /> In the film Brynner, Major Surov, a Russian intelligence officer who watches some of the Hungarian leaders. Uprising, one of which is Paul Kedes (Jason Robards). Kedes may receive assistance from some Westerners on a bus tour of Hungary led by Robert Morley (including Marshall, Jackson, Howard and Kerr). The latter are at the hotel while their bus is being renovated, and Brynner mixes with them, hoping to find a place for Robards. But Brynner is a man - he tries to curry favor with these people (everyone sees him as a monster), and, consistently, when he drank a little too much, he poses questions for historians from 1945: How (even if you notice that Russia led by Stalin) that relations between Russia and the West collapsed so quickly? In general, the Allies worked well together from 1941 to 1945, but after Yalta and Potsdam all kinds of mutual suspicions just broke out. They should have? Surov is a good officer, but he is broken in half by loyalty to the communist regimes in the Soviet Union and Hungary, which he supports, and his growing love for Kerr, who hides Robards, but is also ready to point out the more human side of the Russian major. And when the film reaches its tragic climax, we observe how Surov must decide whether he will follow his sense of duty or regret Kerr, Robards and other Westerners who want to leave. It becomes a real fight for him - and one that he can win too late. It was a great film about the tragedy of post-war Europe and perhaps the most brooding role that Yul Brynner ever played.
