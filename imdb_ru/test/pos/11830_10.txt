A rich young man, raised as the Son of God, must confront his Chinese heritage while living in the White World. <br /> <br /> Although the premise on which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility, and the Secret of the plot, revealed in the conclusion of the film, does everything that preceded it, slightly ridiculous, the plot still serves as some decent entertainment. and a good acting game. <br /> <br /> Richard Bartelmess plays the title role as a good-natured Oriental whose life is terribly difficult because he looks like a Caucasian. Barthelmess maintains the serious tone of his game, intently peering into the middle distance (the behavior he developed during the Silent Days) whenever his character is obscenely abusive. He is not trying to repeat his classic performance in the “Broken Flowers” ​​play by D. U. Griffith (1919), and this is his merit. The beautiful Constance Bennett is the daughter of a millionaire who makes Bartelmess unhappy. She, as always, is gorgeous, but her behavior does not attract her viewer, and her terrible disease in the final video, fortunately, is hidden behind the screen. <br /> <br /> The multi-talented Frank Albertson plays the small role of Bartelmess' improvised mate. Serin E. Aline Warren and bustling Anders Randolph play a variety of fathers of leading stars, while Claude King highlights his short speech as an English author who befriended Barthelmess. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers will recognize little Dickie Moore, uncredited. Playing Bartelmess as a tiny baby. <br /> <br /> The original "Technicolor" sequence of memories faded with time to a rosy hue. The picture implying the south of France looks suspiciously like Avalon on Santa Catalina Island, off the coast of Southern California.
