Spoilers !!! To understand what really happened in the first place, you must be a warrior to survive in a real war, to think offline, analytically, critically, and not linearly. Otherwise, you will come to the false conclusion that Major Gray was a stupid or unstable person. Truth is something completely different. He was a solidly seasoned veteran, and Captain O'Malley could kill him only because he wanted her to kill him. That was his way out. He chose this. He was not a man who would retire. If you have never been on the first line, you can not understand it. He deliberately prepares his suicide. At first he seduced Mary Jane, than he intentionally acted like a stupid one, settled a dispute - closing the incident before witnesses (to protect her later, after she did what he wants her to do if it comes to court), than gave her son a bullet (for I am sure that he could load her gun later), came that night, loaded her gun, woke her, put her gun in her hands, acted as he attacked her, after the shot for the first time he raised a knife and shouted "One Murder" to shoot him again, and before he died he took off standby, as if trying to get it back again after the first shot. He also gave her a message with his last cry. “After the first murder, everything will change in your mind and ruin your life; this is the only way for me to die as a person, but being killed by someone I love is my choice, and my only prerogative is war and the army is not.” what you still thought of, finally grow up and save your life until you can. "She left military life at the end. She understood him. And he did not die in vain. The man who helped him prepare all this and then To conduct the test and the results of this test, was Colonel Sam Doran with the help of Lieutenant Tim Macy. Macy did not know what was actually happening and what the result would be, but did what was expected of him. He took photos of Mary Jane and Major Gray on orders Colonel Sam Doran, who gave this order because May Ohr Gray asked him to do it. After she refused to leave the army (which Colonel Doran asked her to do), Colonel Doran persuaded the prosecutor to accuse her of premeditated murder (he knew that she could not be found guilty) instead of manslaughter (was some opportunity to find the perpetrator with photos. Colonel Doran also stops the incident with the termination of disputes, in order to strengthen it, so that the prosecutor does not have any doubts about the deliberate murder charge, but during the trial Island was discovered, which greatly influenced the jury. I do not doubt the results of this test. Why did Colonel Doran do this? Because he will do everything Maj.Gray ask him to do. What for? Because he saved his life on the battlefield. Why did Mary Jane decide to go to court? Because she was a person who has integrity, principles. And that is why Maj.Gray chose her. It must be someone worthy, someone honorable. Keeping her secret about what really happened that night, she will also prove her honor. <br /> <br /> Miroslav
