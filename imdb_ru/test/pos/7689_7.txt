Recently, I was fortunate enough to see, as they say, the last 35 mm, Technicolor, stereoprint, and I found that it is much more alive and more touching than I remember. Also closer to the original material - basically, everything that screenwriter N. Richard Nash did was cut off, greatly changed the recitative for conversational dialogue and inserted one or two transitional scenes (including very funny for Pearl Bailey). The production design of Oliver Smith is informative in the adaptation mode of the 50s “Lee Abner” - “Guys and Dolls”, but it works well for the folklore, unrealistic quality of this work. Stereotyping and racism are present, but not to such an extent as to cause surprise. In addition, for the film of its time, it is quite frankly - adultery, cruel behavior, drug use and self-destructive habits of Som Roe inhabitants are not minimized in the story. But there are debits, starting with all this deviation from the scenic text. Losing so much compromises the brilliance of Gershwin - no wonder the family doesn’t like it. Re-certification, especially material Sammy Davis Jr., defiantly fashionable and vulgar. George knew what he was doing, people; you didn't have to mess around with it. And while Poitiers and Dandridge behave well, and their singing twins sing well, there is a huge gap between the singing and speaking voices of the characters - you are always aware of fiction. Of course, music is really important here, one of the best ever written for the theater. Despite all the tinkering, it survives, and you must be made of stone so that it does not touch. If the treatment is not entirely to the taste of the estate (and should not be), there is still no reason not to spend a few dollars to restore this ambitious Gershwin masterpiece and make new generations more aware of his genius.
