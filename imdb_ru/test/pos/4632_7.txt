This is a charming little film that, like many of its kind, draws its charm in the circumstances, and not in the actual dialogue. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford (as always) is brilliantly comedian in the role of a penniless air force officer in his pocket, after just one day marrying gold mining actress Debbie Reynolds. <br /> <br /> After the first wedding night of passion and change in life, they quickly realize that, apart from the strong sexual desire that they have for each other, they have nothing in common. <br /> <br /> However, when she decides to try her marriage, she realizes that this is just one month of probation and sex. most definitely not on the maps. <br /> <br /> Ford is also unable to cope with its new Lincoln Futura concept car worth $ 40,000 (the future Batmobile), which he wins in the lottery the same night when he meets his new wife. <br /> The car attracts his unwanted attention from the Air Force, who consider it a vulgar growth in American welfare and arouses suspicion of corruption, embezzlement, etc. He also puts him in the tax framework at 80-90% and, despite the fact that he is a beggar, he now faces a tax invoice worth more than $ 17,000. Not the money you should have when your wife is the man who spends more than $ 1,000 on one shopping trip. <br /> <br /> Even when he tries to sell it, it brings him bad luck, as he sells so much. since a cigarette or a pair of stockings is punished by the tribunal by a military tribunal, so you can imagine that a detachment of rifles was actually shot for a $ 17,500 transaction. <br /> <br /> His potential buyer also causes him problems. since he is a disgustingly handsome fighting spanish nobleman fighting a bull, the interest in the car led to a heightened interest in Ford’s wife, aggravated by the fact that a rich jet life was offered, and that’s what she had been striving for. <br /> <br /> With Ford’s sexual frustrations and envy in his growing love rivalry, combined with Reynolds’s materialistic attitude and flirtatious behavior around a Spaniard in love serving to drive a wedge deeper between them, it seems that their whirlwinds are destined to end. <br /> <br /> But can some kind of love and attraction, which brought these two birds of love together, break through them and hold them together? <br /> <br /> This film is not the best example, but thanks to watchable actions based on its principles and a pleasant storyline, it is certainly good.
