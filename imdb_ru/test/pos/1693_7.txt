Apart from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful, and all the prisoners of the camp are too fat, this film rings true in the chaos of the post-war time. <br /> <br /> Beautiful photography and powerful national expression of the Polish national character. <br /> <br /> In some moments it is very slow, but its whole pace is so different from American and Western European films that it is quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Both main actors do a very good job. On the DVD, you can see interviews with the main actors and the film crew, and lead actress Stanislaw Selinska gained about 50 pounds and lost all her beauty. But in 1970 she was awesome.
