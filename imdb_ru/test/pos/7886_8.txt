I remember so much about watching this film during its original theatrical release - the afterglow of Woodstock of peace and love along with the tension to Watergate fear and paranoia. It's hard to believe that thirty-seven years have passed, and I still remember the thoughts that occurred to me while watching a film with my best friend. Just as admiring the characteristics of Peter Boyle in relation to the final cattle, will surely bring him into line with the rest of his career (oh, how wrong!), And how counterculture shook the sensitivity of most of the country. To this day, my friend and I still use Joe Curran’s lines from my summary above when faced with a dilemma; It is curious how such a simple line can stay with you for decades. <br /> <br /> It is curious to read comments about the film from others on this board, especially those that say that the film has an outdated quality and how more upstairs the characters were. However, if you were close at this time, the picture gives a fairly accurate depiction of the polar opposites that existed then, largely side by side, as events in history show. If you really want to meet someone, when was the last time you heard the words of Macy and Gimbel in the same sentence, or a line like Joe's “Come on, get the Pepsi generation”. From a historical point of view, you have this great Nixon poster lingering in one of the background scenes: “Would you buy a used car from this person?” With such minor complications, director John Avildsen captures many subtle, but always present, hints like there was life four decades ago. <br /> <br /> Today’s viewing was only the second time I watched a movie, and I have to admit that I don’t remember Susan Sarandon in one of the main roles, but again, this was her very first movie. Scenes of nude nature and free love were something completely new and bold at the time, shocking in fact, when directors began experimenting with their ability to push the limits of decency and convention. Joe made a big jump in this regard, especially because it was a “mainstream” picture. <br /> <br /> Over time, Peter Boyle impressed me most when he overcame the stereotype about Joe Curran, who appeared in some of my favorite works. I mean, how do you go from “Joe” to this ridiculous “Puttin” performance on the Ritz in Young Frankenstein? And my favorite episode of The X-Files is Boyle as Clyde Brookman in a gentle and tragic, funny and serious image that has challenged Scully and Mulder more than once. And as a careerist, Frank Barone must be one of the funniest characters in television history. Even repeated episodes of syndication are ridiculous when he ... whenever the elder Barone releases one of his observations. He is one actor whom this viewer is already very bored.
