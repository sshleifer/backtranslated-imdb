This is my fourth review of Charlie Chan’s film in chronological order these days in a row. This is also my first comment that I saw earlier, although about 24 years have passed since then, so I don’t remember much. In this film, a detective from Honolulu is investigating a spy ring that was initially tracked by Scotland Yard’s former acquaintance who went missing in the Big Apple ... This is the best of Chan’s records I have seen so far in the current memory with every key connected ( although, of course, if I look at them on closer inspection, there may still be some holes, although I cannot think about any right now). And "Son number 2" Jimmy (Victor Sen Jung) helps a little when he first identifies the poison, which leads to some murders at an early stage, although, of course, he is mistaken a little later. Returning actors from Chan’s latest film, Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum, blonde Joan Valerie as June Preston and Stanley Blystone, John J.'s brother. Supervised the lost Chan named Charlie Chance as an expert on fingerprints. Pleasant intrigue, especially the exciting climax aboard a bomber. Oh, and watch a certain Rick in the police line ...
