I just saw "Gentlemen's League: Apocalypse" at a special show in Manchester, which was attended by Mark Gatiss and Rhys Shirmsmit from the League. <br /> <br /> Peter Kay (who has a short cameo in the movie) was giggling on the back during a question and answer session after the movie. <br /> <br /> The film was complex (in a good way) and very very funny. It follows Jeff Tipps, Hilary Briss and Herr Lipp when they are trying to save the fictional Roziton Vasya from the disinterest of their creators. <br /> <br /> The League plays a variety of characters and themselves (or characters based on themselves)) and is skillfully supported by British characters and comedians such as Bernard Hill, Victoria Wood and David Warner. <br /> <br /> Warner stands out, reminding me of his smooth and sharp turn in Time. "Bandits." <br /> <br /> The film tells about various realities and allows some inhabitants of Roziton-Wazi to grow beyond the usual borders of a comedy film. <br /> <br /> Herr Lipp from “Steve Pemberton” is coming to the end of the film and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life, which at an unexpected moment causes a lump in his throat and surprises with his tender affection for the characters. <br /> <br /> This repeats what Mark and Rees said in Q & A afterwards that the plot of the league, tired of their famous characters, is false, and that the whole movie is actually a love letter for them. <br /> <br /> For a format that began as a radio character - based on a sketch show, these guys really developed the idea of ​​supporting a film that will take you on a journey through fiction, “reality”, comedy, a tragedy and a pleasant journey for two of the less obvious characters carrying the long form of the story of their 70 strange existing creations. <br /> <br /> Fans of the show will love it. It pays off with dedication and attention to detail, the uninitiated may be a little lost, but LoG's joy has always been in the ability to tune in almost instantly to their keenly watched characters and make a stylistic leap in farce and expressive cinema worship. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of fans in this film, including “The Shining” and “La Belle et la Bete”, except for two, which I noticed, and they skillfully demonstrate their love for cinema and history with a segment in England of the 1690s, which makes sense when you are busy with a movie. <br /> <br /> What can I say, I was amazed, stunned, worried, and giggled everywhere, and they definitely realized that many failed. Successful British TV comedy with translation to the movies. <br /> <br /> If you’ve watched the Gentlemen’s League before and enjoyed it, watch it; You'll like it. <br /> <br /> If not, rent / buy a DVD and then watch it. <br /> <br /> Well done, guys, and thanks for the charming and humorous questions and answers. ,
