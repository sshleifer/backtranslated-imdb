Ascent (1977) <br /> <br /> Larisa Shepitko is a name that few people know. Her bright career as a director lasted only one decade and suddenly ended in a tragic car accident. Despite her short career, however, she managed to create some of the best Soviet films of her time. Her latest film, Ascension, is widely known as one of the best Soviet films of the 1970s. However, her work remained in the shadows during the following years, usually available only in rare and bad copies on video. Now this has changed thanks to the guys from Criterion. They released two of Shepitko’s best works through their Eclipse section, Wings, and her penultimate masterpiece, Ascension. <br /> <br /> In the darkest days of World War II, in a snowy rural Russia, two guerrillas cross the land in search of food after their group was attacked by Nazi patrols. Initially, they only went to a nearby farm, but when they arrived, they discovered that the Germans had destroyed it. Unwilling to return empty-handed, they continue to delve into enemy territory. Along the way, they must confront not only the enemy soldiers, but also the harsh conditions of the Russian plains, potential betrayal and their own souls. <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the simplified plot techniques or destinations. He tackles difficult issues with painful rationality. He never goes the easy way and does not give us comforting answers. The second half of the film is filled with moral dilemmas. Shepitko shows us the hidden horrors of war due to internal conflict between fellow citizens - those who collaborated and those who resisted. Although it shows collaborators as clean heels, it nevertheless also shows why many have turned to such tactics — survival. <br /> <br /> The film contains a number of religious references, especially on the threshold of the crucifixion. This is a spiritual journey into the hearts, souls, and minds of two partisans and those they encounter. Shepitko and her cinematographer captured the journey in beautiful black and white photography. The camera moves in long shots, similar to the work of another great Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. Shepitko, like many others, was clearly influenced by Tarkovsky’s style, and Ascension takes some of its rhythmic notes from Ivan’s childhood. This is a terrific movie, and it does a fantastic job of capturing the cold and terrifying atmosphere of occupied Russia. <br /> <br /> Shepitko's husband would pay homage to her great film a decade later. Elem Klimov made his own military masterpiece with one of the greatest films I've ever seen - “Come and see.” The history and themes of this film were clearly influenced by The Ascent. Although this film is also rather obscure, it has attracted much more attention than any of Shepitko’s films. However, it served as a bridge to Shepitko and became one of the best ways to keep her job. <br /> <br /> “Climbing” is a truly magnificent film, and it should rightfully be considered one of the best films of the 70s. This amazing cinema inspires; his mood is frighteningly authentic; and his lessons are unforgettable. In any definition of a word, this is nothing but a masterpiece. What a pity that Shepitko’s career was cut short just as she reached her peak.
