I did not expect much when I rented this film, as many independent films seem a bit overpriced these days (well, Hollywood films are also in this regard), but this film was fantastic, really great, it was too bad, it did not reach a huge audience because it is simply superb. I really like Aliceâ€™s determination, she really makes me look at my life as a gift, and I see how lucky I was to get an education. But besides all this, this film really proves that a good artist can tell a good story, no matter what budget, this is a great film, and everyone should watch it, he will love it and definitely learn something. I don't need to be Roger Ebert to know that this is one of the best films I have seen in the whole year, and, of course, one of the most truthful.
