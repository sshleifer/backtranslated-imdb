No matter how good Schindler's list is, I found that this film is much more powerful because it is documentary and based on real life. It details the story of the Frank family, and Ann in particular. Although at first he is a little slow (tells in detail about their family life before the war); it becomes very powerful. <br /> <br /> Because of some videos and photos of the camps, I would not recommend it for children, but for adults, this illustrates the horror of the Holocaust as a young girl. Highly recommended.
