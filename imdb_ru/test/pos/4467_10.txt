This is Lucio Fulci at its best. If only all the films he shot were like that. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary film is as intriguing as Dario Argento’s Bird with Crystal Plumage ... <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Argento, but you don’t like Lucio Fulci’s films, such as <br /> <br /> “The Beyond”, “Manhattan Baby”, “The House by the Cemetery”, etc. do with others ... this is what the Italians call "giallo" ... it was would be something like the movie "Who Made It" in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> You won’t know who the killer is until the last moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> But besides this, there is a plot: a maniac living in a small village begins to kill little boys ... Journalist (Thomas Milian), sexy young woman (Barbara Boucher), priest (Marc Porel ), his mother (Irene Pappas) and the witch (Florinda Balkan) are the main characters of this confusing, bloody story. <br /> <br /> Speaking of actors, I want to say that Thomas Milian is great (as always), and Florinda Bolkan is an amazingly rustic witch ... <br /> <br /> You want to know who the killer is? ... <br /> <br /> I can’t tell you ... but I can say that you will definitely watch this movie! <br /> <br /> (10 out of 10) ... of course!
