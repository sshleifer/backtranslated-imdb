As soon as I saw the first trailer of the film “Moan of the Black Snake”, I realized that I would have to see him. I was not disappointed in the smallest film that was written and directed by Hustle and Flow creator Craig Brewer. He tells the story of a broken blues man and a nymphomaniac, whom he seeks to cure, not only for her sake, but also for his own sake ... but it is much more than that. He is complex and rich, and he manages to immerse you in a sandy, sticky, sultry Memphis blue, without making you feel that you need to take a bath later. <br /> <br /> Characters (for the most part) are multifaceted and very well written and executed. Accents and dialogue passed without any complaints. However, there was one weak link in the chain: Justin Timberlake. The best I can tell him is that he can cry ... this is a rare male actor who can cry convincingly. Nevertheless, Ronnie Justin was flat, but as an actor he tried very hard. I would definitely give him one more chance. <br /> <br /> Lazar and Ray (Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci, respectively) have great chemistry and great respect for each other. This is one of those films where it doesn’t matter how good one actor is if the other doesn’t cope with the task, and, fortunately, both actors have done it. <br /> <br /> The music was very good, as one would expect, especially when Mr. Samuel L. Jackson sings the blues. Phenomenal. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, as far as I could see, everything was great. It was well edited, well filmed and well mixed ... everything was great. Character design and scenery were correct, supporting character actors (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) were at their best ... I liked it.
