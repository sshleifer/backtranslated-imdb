Kannathil Muthamittal was just one of the most touching and sincere films I have seen in a long time. the story of a foster girl who, on her 9th birthday, finds out the truth about her background. she tries to learn more about her real mother and finds out that her mother is now a terrorist. <br /> <br /> The greatness of the film lies in its simplicity. Mani Ratnam tends to create unreal and pompous bloated characters in this film, each person seems real, and their interaction is touching and sincere. This is the reason why this film is considered one of his best films. <br /> <br /> The film emotionally drains and makes the viewer think. Kirthana - 9-year-old Amudha and Simran - her adoptive mother. just brilliant. their relationship is the cornerstone of this film. there are some noticeable flaws here, especially the scene where Amudha finds out that she is a foster child, shakes and seems completely unreal. It is hard to believe that such sensitive parents will report such news as they. another drawback, oddly enough, brilliant songs. they again seem forced and stand out without being mixed with the rest of the script. <br /> <br /> Having said this, it is still one of the sharpest and most beautiful films that have come out of India in a long time. This beauty is not only in the script or characters, but also in technical magnificence. Ravi Chandranâ€™s camera work is pure poetry. All characters play decently, and realistic humor, especially in memories, is very interesting. <br /> <br /> sincere 9 !!
