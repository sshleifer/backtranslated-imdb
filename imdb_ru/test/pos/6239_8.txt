Despite the stupid premise, ridiculous plot devices and a small budget, Tourist Trap <br /> <br /> manages to hit. An ingenious, beautifully won film that you definitely need to see. You have to throw rationality out the window to fully appreciate what the director was trying to do. If you can do this, a pleasant surprise awaits you. Also note that this is one of the few semi-classic horror films that has not been spoiled by numerous sequels.
