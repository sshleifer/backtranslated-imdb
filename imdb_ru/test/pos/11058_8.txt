This was my first film about Gaspar But, which I watched, and I must say that I was shocked. I am not against blood at all, but this is not even blood, but a real massacre. For some of you, a couple of scenes cannot be seen, and I mean really disgusting. Leaving aside these aspects, the main ideas disclosed here and the dialogue are quite brilliant. When you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the way it is given, you cannot stop and think about it. The actors coped well with their work, presenting general masks from the hand, which several people found at the bottom of a sick society. The film is full of metaphors, but I will let you deal with them. Do not watch it if you want to relax and rest. I recommend this movie to all those who want to think something or just watch something different from what you see in an ordinary movie theater.
