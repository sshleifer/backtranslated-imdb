This film is not only a great title, but also simply the best drama I've ever seen. The viewer is irresistibly drawn into the film, which involves 5 young people working together to try to overcome insurmountable chances. Sean Astin as Billy Tepper is great along with superb supporting roles from TERussell, Wil Wheaton and Sean Phelan, the guidance and guidance of Gosset Astins characters make the film much better. Over time, the film continues to gain momentum and frustration that none of the young actors made a name for themselves in the film industry after this remarkable film.
