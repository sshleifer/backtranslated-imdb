Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) just kills time to get a job. Her real desire is to marry Eddie and have a baby. <br /> <br /> April (Diane Baker) is too innocent to stay that long, and too easily falls in love, a dangerous combination. <br /> <br /> Greg (Susie Parker) is keen on and wants to become an actress. <br /> <br /> All three are doomed to drama in The Best of All, a soap opera in 1959, a play on morality / sometimes a solid film that is aging for a second. <br /> <br /> Set in the limitless world of paperback books, it’s not as crappy as “Valley of Dolls”, but not as vanilla as “Three Coins in a Fountain”. <br /> <br /> The mix people — Brian Ahern, Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan, and Robert Evans — are mostly sleek, well-dressed, and useless. Aherne - a persistent sex offender - will pinch everything that passes and makes unwanted advances left and right. His character is damn outrageous, but he is not played seriously. I think the prosecution has not yet been discovered. Boyd works there too, although you never see him do anything. He is too busy being older, wiser and drunker. Evans is abroad, just so that Diana Baker can stylishly suffer - he is a rich child who brought her "trouble", so instead of marrying her, as promised, he takes her to the "operation". <br /> <br /> Jourdan is a filmmaker who has a love affair with Parker. They have a common battle scene, which in any case is prohibited in such a film, but the scene is ultimately destroyed by Parker's histology. She ends up almost chasing him, and she really didn’t deserve such a lousy fate, despite her bad play. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford breathes fire like Amanda Farrow, a resident "witch" who is automatically rude and dismissing any of her legion of secretaries. Well, they are younger, aren't they? Isn't that enough reason to hate a person? Caroline does not think so, as she perfectly opposes Miss Farrow at every opportunity. Crawford can be released only once, when she says to her married boyfriend: “You can, your wife with a rabbit face can go to hell,” and claps on the phone. You will never see a poor soul who dares cross it. <br /> <br /> Martha Heyer’s “storyline” is, as it were, extremely weak and painful as an unmarried mother. Except that her cardigan was wearing a huge letter “W” (for “whore”), she walks like a miserable mess, most of the time on the screen. Worse, she is not given courtesy when everything is “tied up”, one way or another, at the end. It will not matter much, but still .. <br /> <br /> It hurts that all this happened in a completely different world. People were more pleasant to each other for the most part, and the work was not a burden, but something exciting, for a girl from New York anyway. <br /> <br /> In addition to one unconvincing drunken scene, Nadezhda Lange helps her to seem quite real, as Caroline, who at least has more than one side of her character. <br /> <br /> I admire the fact that women have an opinion, a chance and a choice. Not that it is not wrapped in a good bow, but it makes some points for equality. In 1959 it was probably noteworthy and possibly contradictory. 7/10.
