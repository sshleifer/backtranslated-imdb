I especially liked the finale of this film - I really felt what the characters had to feel, which I consider to be a sign of good direction. I was amazed how the new rental in the record store turned out - an excellent character development, although its “role” will probably be considered secondary. <br /> <br /> I was also impressed that the entire film, while dark in its subject matter, was free from unwarranted nudity, profanity and violence. Sadness, sexuality and darkness can be transmitted (often better) by what remains unsaid, but it seems that this is often unique to truly “cool” films and actors. Glory to the filmmaker for this.
