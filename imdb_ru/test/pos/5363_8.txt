This touching and understated romantic story, taking place shortly before the Second World War, is largely based on real events. <br /> <br /> This refers to the German rocket scientist Gerhart Zucher (Ulrich Thomsen), working in the UK at the Coming of the Second World War. Fearing that Hitler might call him back to Germany to help him prepare for war, Zucher and his slick assistant Heinz (Eddie Marsan) were evacuated by British authorities to a remote Scottish island. They were given the task to build a box with a rocket that will allow islanders to communicate with the mainland. <br /> <br /> Mocking and mocking the islanders, they arranged a house with a local girlfriend Catherine McKay (stunning Shona). MacDonald), with whom Thomsen begins the novel, but it becomes difficult when a call comes to Germany ... <br /> <br /> The central romance between Zucher and Catherine is subtle and sincere, and the auxiliary staff is a colorful bunch with many Dear Scottish characters, including Gary Lewis and Clive Russell. <br /> <br /> Beautiful cinematography and a brilliant central thematic song performed in the local dialect complete this film. <br /> <br /> Smart but undemanding, it's good for a relaxing evening at.
