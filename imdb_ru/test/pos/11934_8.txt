I first watched this movie about a year and a half ago, and I liked it, I decided to buy a DVD last year for my birthday. It has so much necessary voltage, action movie and drama. This film is about a preparatory school called Regis School and its overflowing rebellious children, in which one child William Tepper (Sean Astin) is difficult to adapt due to previous refusals from other schools because they could not control his rebellious act, and now in school Regis commit more actions as a result of the uprising, the school randomly seizes the school, and the real reason is that the father of leader Louis Cali (Andrew Divoff) was sent to prison, and the leader will do anything, including killing students, setting bombs and so on to get your father back. <br /> <br /> Along William Tepper, his rebellious friends at the Regis school, in particular Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton), in which this guy is going through a vague past living in a mafia family and being sent to Regus School because of that he hates his father for who he is, and that now he must deal with these terrorists who have seized the school, so William, Joe and his friends must unite to stop these terrorists from violent acts and dangerous tactics. /> <br /> This movie was really awesome, and I believe that people should notice it more, because when people think of a good movie for hostages, they say “Die Hard”, and although I have to agree with them, they have to admit that Toy Soldiers was a good thriller, my heart was probably beating because students of my age and I would be afraid to resist such terrorists if they capture our school ... But overall this film is really worth a good 112 minutes of your time, and if I had the decision to rent or buy it ... I would buy it! I recommend this with a lot of hype! 8/10
