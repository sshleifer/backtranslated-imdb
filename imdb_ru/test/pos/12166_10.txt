This little short film absolutely fascinates me. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have seen so far is the work of Sam Brakhaig, the creator of the Dog Star Man. However, when Brahaga tries to unnerve, “making us learn to see again,” and gives us dizziness, causing bright colors and flashes (which I still dig completely and perceive as high art ...), I would characterize the film relaxing and hypnotizing. The usual use of rotating objects / cameras from Man Ray does not create dizziness, but causes a warm stream of feelings, mixing with the gravity of the moving world around us. <br /> <br /> Interesting vanity This very short job is that over time the objects become more recognizable until we finish on the naked torso (of which I feel the least womanly, round breasts that I I have seen). The circles and spirals of shadow and light above the torso make it an object of surrealistic beauty, something that you could hang on the wall and plunge into it forever. It was because of this and the other images in this film that I had to watch it again and again (eventually only seven times) just because it completely enchants me. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
