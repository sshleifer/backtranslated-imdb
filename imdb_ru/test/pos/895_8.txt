Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There she is met by a couple and other swinging couples. All of them stay in this huge, very tourist hotel with a giant swimming pool. Once they have a pool party with real dancers. This is very politically incorrect and very kitsch. Later, Emanuel finally has a photo session that ends up in one of those safaris “stay in the car”, although the photo is gorgeous. Throughout the film, Emanuel pursues every man he meets. The photo is very well made in this film. There are scenes with cascading waterfalls, jumping giraffes and ancient ruins. The film is worth watching only for Niko Fidenko soundtrack.
