Thank God for the database of internet movies !!! When I first got this film, I watched it every night before bed, and each time I got something new. But no matter how I cut it, everything turned out to be alarming. Black and white and all these twitches really scared me. You look at the screen, unsure of what you are looking at, and as soon as you think you got it, it becomes clear, and this is something completely different. Images VERY disturbing, twitching and straight razors do not suit me in any film. However, every time I watched it, I interpreted it in a slightly different way (no dialogue, I know), so I decided to check IMdB for the plot summary. The boy who throws me behind the noose, I had no idea that there was to be God. Now I am going to watch it with this in mind and see what happens ....
