Unconditional love is one of the best films I've seen lately. This is an emotional rollercoaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk tells Grace that he does not want to go to the pub, because he does not like the villagers, you expect the worst. When the old woman raises her glass and says: â€œIn memory of Victor Fox, and the whole pub follows his example, I wanted to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! Julie does this in her typical Julie Andrews style. Jonathan Price is excellent as Victor. Grace - one of the best roles of Kathy Bates. Meredith Eaton steals almost all the scenes she is in. Rupert Everett does some of his best work in the unconditional role of Dirk. A kiss between Rupert and Meredith brought me into another fit of hysteria. On this day and the age of gay rights is being questioned, I think this film should see everything. Being gay at the age of 40, I saw people lose everything when a loved one dies. So thanks to everyone who contributed to this movie.
