As most other reviewers seem to agree, this post-funeral adaptation is really very good. Always one of my favorite stories about Poirot, I was worried that she could be “spoiled”. Well, it was a bit, but ONLY a bit, and in the end the result was completely interesting. David Suchet continues to be almost flawless, like Poirot, and (as others have noted) the other star of this show is Monica Dolan, which undoubtedly cannot be turned into Miss Gilchrist. I also really liked Fiona Glassscott, who was in the role of director Rosamund Shane, but in fact, the casting was completely flawless! <br /> <br /> Adapters cannot resist not shoving too many revelations in the last fifteen minutes. Business with will and household chores was a bit unnecessary, although I did not mind how they tightened the structure of the Abernathy family (in the book, the family tree is really quite difficult). The last moments, when the killer is revealed, are really incredibly good, and I found the end, when they all leave Enderby, very touching. This is truly one of the best series of Poirot.
