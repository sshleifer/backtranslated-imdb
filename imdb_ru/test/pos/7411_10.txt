"Army of Pharaoh" does not give in to the formula. Instead of selling clichés and big stars, he fully relies on a great game from a strong cast, the power of a well-written script and an exciting and bitter story. The result is a raw and realistic film that moves quickly, with a strong emotional course. One of the best I've ever seen about civil war, and I think it might be connected with the pleasure of being an independent film (if you like this film, try watching the equally brilliant indie film about the civil war "Evil Spring" ) and). <br /> <br /> “Pharaoh” just tells a true story about a small expedition / fodder team of Union people who go to a Confederation farm to get provisions, but ended up stuck there because of an accident. one of the men. Tensions boils and relationships are made and broken. Nothing happens the way Hollywood would have written it; This film comes from the mind of the one who really cares about the quality of the film and the story. An excellent dialogue and plot exposure move through a film that looks very professional, but often it doesn't seem like you're watching a movie, but rather listening to a story. <br /> <br /> The film boasts an incredible performance by Chris Cooper, who demonstrates amazing versatility in exploring his role. It is transformed, but always at the height of likelihood and easily emotionally related to it. Patricia Clarkson is equally stellar and realistic in a role that many actresses might fall in love with. She shares an interesting chemistry with the character of Cooper, and where she is the harsher of the characters, it is still easy to identify. The rest of the cast is quite capable and copes well with their roles. <br /> <br /> Artistic design and scenery are wonderful, and I personally love cinematography. All this is reminiscent of a photograph from the period of the civil war with a camera showing strong contrasting colors and shadows and a metallic tint similar to tin, but always preserving the naturalistic look of the village setting. It seems they used natural light, but everything they used works great. Everything looks as if it belongs to where it is, it feels like a period, something that I find rare in American films of the period. The actors act of the 19th century, and not like the people of the 20th century in old clothes. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film is very personal. I think that as an indie, he can afford it. The film is almost flawless with an outstanding script that easily creates and explores the attitudes and personalities of these characters and allows them to develop in the same bad situation. He does not refuse to convey his point of view, and he conveys his point of view without the usual and overly used methods that are used in all war films in our day. It is bold. He relies on his characters, a fantastic scenario, human emotions and the cold, harsh fact that the Civil War was not only CGI, big stars and hoop skirts.
