Venetian Merchant 8/10 <br /> <br /> (This review assumes a basic knowledge of history and can be considered as containing spoilers for those unfamiliar with the plot.) <br /> <br /> As a version of the film Shakespeare's famous play “The Merchant of Venice” does what was done with the adaptation from the time of the rather sandy Macbeth Polanski: he takes the spirit of the play and reveals it not only in this way, but also better than one play could readily prepare. to reach. <br /> <br /> Peter Jackson, director of The Lord of the Rings, says that when adapting a book or a play, there are three options: try to reproduce the original as accurately as possible, use the original idea as a source of inspiration, but accept the full license for cinematic changes or (the one he frankly preferred) to adhere to the original as much as it is cinematically viable, but to make such changes as are necessary for the film and remaining true to the plan or spirit of the original. /> <br /> In Macbeth, Polanski used beaches wet from the rain, realistic rape and murder to show what a bloody and terrible period the performance was staged in, recalling the terrible context in which the characters do such evil deeds. recommended solutions. This is different from (say) Hamlet Brana, who has reached new heights of faithful performance, but otherwise suggested a bit of new. Macbeth, on the other hand, may have allowed an audience new to Shakespeare to appreciate some of the fullness of the drama without careful study; In the same way, a more familiar audience can find greater depth than an unarmed performance on stage. Such an interpretation plays a vital role if viewers want to fully, not only intellectually but also emotionally, interact with what Shakespeare wanted to do. <br /> <br /> This is the adaptation of the Radford “Venetian merchant”. It requires decisive moral dilemmas related to religious fanaticism or the observance of promises, and, with minimal intervention from the holy volume of the Bard, faithfully conveys them in the spirit of the original story. <br /> <br /> The first of these, religious fanaticism, gives meaning to Shylock's otherwise outlandish behavior. We see that Jews of that period were sent to the ghetto, walled, and can only be admitted with a red cap. Without the right to own property, one of the few ways to make a living is lending. This makes them both useful to their Christian oppressors and at the same time the object of their condemnation. The idea underlying (both the old and the new testament) biblical bans on usury is probably not to make a profit by helping your friends. Christian fanatics extend it to curse those whom they spit on (we see that Shylock not only spat, but like-minded Jews who are thrown into the waterways for sports - in an atmosphere that can only be called threatening). <br /> <br /> The film’s relevance is curious, since the fanaticism of right-wing Christianity (represented by the Americans following Bush) turned full circle, as they are now the main proponents of Zionism, and Jewish political leaders bite their Palestinians Neighbors as Shylock trying to bite Antonio (when he thinks the law gives him the right to do it). Psychology is self-evident - kick the dog several times and it will become vicious. The circle continues easily, as the victims of oppression themselves easily lose their sense of moral values ​​and become oppressors. <br /> <br /> Severe manual dexterity, which the disguised Portia uses to rescue Antonio, has some virtues, both clever and clever. Interpretation of the unsophisticated law that the Venetians play so sorry, and also as a moral index. Shylock may "have his pound of flesh" in accordance with his contract, but may not have any blood. A simple analogy can be drawn with regard to war and terrorism - it is much easier to justify a fight between combatants or attacks on villains if the victims are only soldiers or villains - when there is huge collateral damage, for example, when innocent citizens including women and children are dying by the hundreds, arguments the warmongers of war (whether Israeli, Palestinian or American warmongers) have much less popular support. <br /> <br /> It has long been a lot of controversy about whether Shakespeare was anti-Semitic in this story. I wonder if he should have adapted the ending for the majority of the Christian audience, which had little to do with the Jewish people. Far from teaching him the greater good, the ending imposes Christianity and Shylock's humiliation - a course that can simply perpetuate pent-up indignation. Both camps look just as bad - one just has more power than the other. A slight improvement in judgment simply gives Christian judges the best public image, or, as Bassanio, so keenly (watching, choosing boxes and solving riddles to win Portia's hand): <br /> <br /> In religion, that damned is a mistake, but what sober forehead. Does it bless and affirm it with the text, Hiding rudeness with a fair decoration? There is no such simple vice, but it involves some sign of virtue in its outer parts. <br /> <br /> Of course, fanaticism refers to organized religion (and not to spirituality), especially when it is organized for political purposes, but one that easily induces ordinary god-fearing people who do not have the habit of splitting hair. Kindness, mercy (“Chesed” in Judaism), which is just as important for true Christianity, in Judaism, as in most other creeds, is just as well practiced. Jewish faith makes a distinction between kindness and compassion, ways to practice and effectively, and ways to make it part of your being, and not just external manifestation. Both Shylock and Antonio are fanatical and use their beliefs to insult believers of another faith. While Shakespeare may have pointed out the chasm between the kindness prescribed by various confessions and her lack of practice, the film version reduces most of the window for interpreting anti-Semitism and brings a greater degree of realism to psychological reasons. <br /> With the fulfillment of promises (men and their wives) do not cope as well as with the comic elements inherent in cross-plots. Bassanio, no matter how much he loved Antonio (are there homosexual elements there?), Can't make sound moral judgments when he expresses his gratitude to the “judge” and therefore violates his promise (for which Portia forgives him, showing triumphant character , not only extremely clever and witty, but also more merciful and attentive to others than her fanatical male colleagues, including her husband.) <br /> <br /> Some of the actors' performances are few unnatural and too many regio cial (English) accents, but overall Merchant of Venice offers a fresh and healthy processing of Shakespeare. I liked the game, as well as the very beautiful soundtrack of Haley Westenra and others, singing ballads composed by both Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe. In general, Venetian Merchant is an important achievement of the British cinematic tradition (as far as any film of a certain nationality can be said today).
