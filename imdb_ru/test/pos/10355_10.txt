This film revolves around the Arab leader (Amir), who is dying and wants to live on. Thus, Dr. Lloyd Trenton is paid for transplanting Amirs’s brain into a “willing” participant. But in the basement of the Doctor, his assistant gnome Dorro (Angelo Rossitto) drains the girls' blood for doctors. Meanwhile, Dr. Lloyd pays the man to kill people who helped Amir into the country (Reed Hadley, Grant Williams, and other unknown bodyguards). Grant - the only survivor when his car falls off the road. While this happened, the doctors sent another assistant to Gore to get the body for the Emir, and it hurt him so badly that Dr. Llod could not operate. Meanwhile, Grant finds Amir's “girlfriend” Regina Carroll and tells her her story. Grant sees the man who drove him off the road, and Dorro kills him. Then, since Gore could not get the body, Dr. Lloyd places Amir's brain in the disfigured body of Gors. Then Grant and Regina are sent to the laboratory of doctors. <br /> <br /> ------------------------ SPOILERS ------- - ---------------- learn his secret. Soon, Amir (Gore) jumps around killing people, and in the confusion, I think, of the plot, Dr. Llood has a brain pistol that wounds Amir on command. It turns out that Dr. Lloyd wants a country in which all scientists can work without the law. And then Regina dies. and at the end Amira’s new body (I think) says that it will be a new country, blah blah. <br /> <br /> I still don’t understand the ending, but overall it was a very nice piece of smelly cheese. In this film, Grant Williams starred in the second and final film. I recommend this for any Al Adamson fan or if you like Brains.
