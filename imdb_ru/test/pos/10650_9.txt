This 1925 film tells the story of a mutiny aboard the battleship Potemkin in the port of Odessa. The film celebrated the 20th anniversary of the 1905 uprising, which was viewed as the direct predecessor of the October Revolution of 1917. Following his theory of editing, Eisenstein plays with the scenes, their length and how they combine to emphasize his message, in addition to using different camera angles and revolutionary lighting techniques. The plot of "Odessa steps" in Potemkin - one of the most famous in the history of cinema. The baby carriage, which descended the stairs after her mother was shot, was later recreated in the Untouchables by Brian D'Palma. It is clear that the film is one of the best ever created, given its time and innovation, although you need a little patience and be a real movie enthusiast to pass it 70 minutes.
