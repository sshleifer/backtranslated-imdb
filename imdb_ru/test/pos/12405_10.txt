This film was so successful that I didnâ€™t think I actually blinked while watching. One tense situation after another kept me glued to the set. However, I would like to see Corey Feldman much more in this picture. He simply steals every scene in which he participates. This could be my favorite adult performance of Corey. The ending was clever, and unlike other films that separate cute characters from body parts, this movie goes for it! I liked that it was not graphic blood and blood, but left the viewer's imagination more. Bravo. I literally had to wipe the sweat from my forehead during this particular scene of torture with a shredder. Ultimately, the film works because of its cute main character and the amazing presence of my favorite bad guy, James Remar (48 hours, remember?), I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to sweat. <br /> <br />
