If I ever wrote films or made them, I would like one of them to be the same as this one. I like the senseless sense of humor and jokes contained inside. This film does nonsense without looking like that. The names of places and characters are priceless, a general New York secondary school, squid squid (sister George), and so on. Genius. I saw this film so many times because it was the main product of cable television when I grew up, of course, I didn't get all the jokes back, but it was still funny. This film is classical music without time.
