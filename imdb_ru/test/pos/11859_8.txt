I made this film without hearing (or reading) anything about it. What a disgrace! This film is smart, witty, funny, fast-paced and really funny. Characters can develop without relying on cliches, tired stereotypes. It was a pleasure to watch. I could not resist the idea that marketing would help to transfer this not so common film to the mainstream for hungry and clever comedies. The quality of the dialogue and the ease with which actors perform a huge amount of embarrassment, heartbreaking and comedic events are so rare these days - I felt that the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something so rich. How did it happen that the Treasure of the Nation was number one on the checkout for three weeks in a row - it is too weak to mention too much. I think I'm just happy that films like "See .." are still being made somewhere there.
