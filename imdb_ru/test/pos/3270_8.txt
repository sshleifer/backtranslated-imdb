Jimmy (Heath Ledger) gives Pando (Brian Brown) a simple job, a thief in law to deliver money to a specific address, but when no one opens the door, Jimmy decides to swim at the beach to spend some time, but he notices that his clothes on the sand is spoiled, and 10 thousand are gone. Jimmy calls Pando to tell him about the problem, but he doesn't want to hear it. Pando and his guys are trying hard to find Jimmy, which means that Jimmy will no longer be there if they grab him. So now Jimmy is hiding to organize a bank robbery in order to return the money to Pando. Also throughout this mess, he meets the innocently beloved Alex (Rose Byrne), and together they set off on a fucking trip through King's Cross Sydney. <br /> <br /> “Two Hands” - just a thrilling puppet of a lively, thrilling and incredibly fresh film What you got here is a largely urban gangster movie with a wretched background and violence in your face ?? what, how is it fresh, you ask? Well, because it takes us to the underworld, where Australian culture shines with criminals wearing thongs (slippers) and tight shorts, dressed cars and a can of beer in hand ?? and don't forget the Australian sense of humor, dry and sarcastic. You can say that he owes a lot to such genres as “Pulp Fiction”, “Goodfellas” (my favorite) and “Lock, stock and two smoking barrels” for his inspiration, but for me it still stands on its own. The film has a real mixture of frivolous moments, but also a mean strip to it with some unexpected shocks and black humor that can really bother. You just do not know what is coming, and it has a pleasant light irony (especially the final) and a great time with humor. I am sure that in one of the scenes related to a bank robbery, you will have stitches. The plot is a story of adulthood (or an unclimbed road), with the addition of a piercing love story and then a gangster element to complete it. Most of the auxiliary plots were thoughtfully constructed and interconnected, maybe it could be without the supernatural element associated with Jimmy's dead brother, but in the general context, it seems that all the various plots are combined. An intense, natural and clear dialogue filled the incredibly colorful script with quick punches of Australian slang / ringing - I am an honest dinkum! <br /> <br /> What really made the film was that Brian Brown played Pando. He simply gave his character such an insidious charismatic / nasty person that when he was not on the screen, his presence was still felt. He gave his character two sides - one of them was a shot, and the other was such a nice guy. Young Rose Byrne glows with her nervously sweet / quirky character Alex. She looked great radially and added a sparkling personality. Then you have Heath Ledger, who fits like a naive Jimmy. Awesome cast including Suzy Porter, Tom Long, David Field, Steve Widler and Steve Le Marquand. Such rude actions are achieved, and from this you get exciting, funny and believable characters. A rich rock soundtrack bursting at the seams with players like Powderfinger and Alex Lloyd create a cool atmosphere. In addition, shooting on the spot at King's Cross in Sydney really helped him survive, leading his own life and showing the Australian way of life. The tricks with the use of sliding cameras perfectly captured the urban background, especially the piercing nightlife. It was a film that, when it ended, was completely satisfied with what I got. All in all, a crime thriller with a smooth pace that achieves what it was meant to do ... a fun, clever and crazy ride on a roller coaster with exciting sensations and excitement. <br /> <br /> I say that the Australian is successfully coping with the task of “Lock” “Stocks and two smoking barrels” by director / writer Gregor Jordan in his debut film. If you come across this, feel free to try.
