I like this movie. More than I expected. It has enough actions, intrigues and locations to make it worth it. Although I canâ€™t see Mark Wahlberg as a leader yet, he's good enough to be a trustworthy manager, and that's fine. <br /> <br /> Superhero movie - Mini Cooper. It has the speed, agility and muscles to cope with any job. And deal with a driving maniac, such as the character Charlize Theron.
