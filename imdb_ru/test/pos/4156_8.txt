A few days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian with criminal precedents attacked and tortured to death a middle-aged woman returning home after noon shopping. A Romanian girl who saw everything reported the incident. <br /> <br /> Therefore, a discussion began about the excessively intensive outflow of immigrants from Romania, who called them criminals indiscriminately. <Br /> <br /> I'm only 15 years old, but I thought: what idea of ​​abundance does Italy give these poor people? How do they think we are the Land of Plenty? Last night I finally saw NUOVOMONDO, and my question was answered. When you have only a donkey and some goats, these propaganda postcards, showing the United States as a country with dairy rivers and huge vegetables, make that impression. <br /> <br /> NUOVOMONDO is a film that you definitely need to watch. He balances ethereal symbolism (milk rivers, the game of views, hard and rocky mountains, the name and character of Lucy / Lucy) and cruel realism (a mass of encouraging people on the ship, procedures on Ellis Island). There is a mixed cast, going from the angelic Charlotte Heinsburg to the realistic Vincenzo Amato, to the bitter and crushing Aurora Quattroke as the mother. But was it really so difficult to enter the New World?
