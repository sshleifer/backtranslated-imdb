With an introductory segment that mimics the music and cinematography of "Safe Todd Haynes" (1995), David Lynch uses a dream, a myth and distorted perceptions of reality to tell a shattered story about an unsuccessful Hollywood actress / waitress, Diana Selvin, let down by fame and her own demons and obsessed with Camilla Rhodes, who is engaged to hot director Adam Kesher. <br /> <br /> The film effectively unfolds in the head of Diana, filled with drugs; we are witnessing her crazy distortions, her fulfillment of desires, regrets, obsessions and fears. Using the dream narrative as a way of representing the two concepts of reality in conflict, Lynch does not simplify the opposition of reality and fantasy, but rather actively confuses them. The last 45 minutes are as fabulous as before; and the restless atmosphere of aloof, otherworldly ambiguity still permeates, destroying the seemingly safe distinction between reality and sleep that we expect to see in nightmare and dream films. <br /> <br /> Lynch's film borrows from many films, old and new. , but in the end it’s a film unlike any other, with the exception of Lost Highway and Blue Velvet’s own directorial program. He constantly makes the viewer interpret what he has seen, not only intuitively, but also intellectually. And yet this is not as pretentious as one might suppose, because Lynch makes us sympathize with the main character, despite her murderous deeds - an element that was missing in all his other films except Straight Story. He does this by introducing Diana's Alter-ego Betty as a healthy Canadian farm girl destined for fame. Lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that confirms and denies equally. Are Camilla and Diana really lovers or just friends? Who is the blue lady? What does she mean? Who is the ass behind the Winkies? What is the significance of the rotting corpse in Sierra Bonita? Does Aunt Ruth really exist? Is Silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self-referential look at the status of a film as fiction? Lynch is not ready to answer any question he asks; instead, he decided to present his “love story in a city of dreams” in the form of a set of interrelated abstractions and motives. <br /> <br /> High-level acting, especially Naomi Watts as Dian Selvin / Betty, who has not yet eclipsed this performance. Laura Harring has the necessary charm of Hayworth in the role of Camilla / Rita, while Adam Theroux in the role of Adam brings to his role the free arrogance and sublimated paranoid aggression. It was a stunning and serious injustice that not one of them was even nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> This film requires careful study and analysis. The mystery behind the film remains in Lynch’s hands, but half the fun is finding the consistent ideas from the maze of seeming discrepancies that he represents. On closer examination, a certain sense of the puzzle arises, perhaps an incomplete puzzle, which teases us with isolation, but denies the imaginary completeness of the narrative connectedness. Ultimately, this is Lynch's key film.
