It’s worth going crazy over the Hindu pantheon before watching this movie. The three main female deities — the wise Sita who cultivates Lakshmi and Kali Transformer — as well as the three main male deities — the tomb of Rama, playing for Krishna and Shiva Ender — all hint at this. Knowledge of folklore, as, undoubtedly, every Hindu viewer, gives richness to the narrative of modern history. In fact, one fairy tale is performed first on the stage, as part of a spirituality lesson, and then in the “real life” of the film. “Fire” opposes misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers belong, and does so with beauty, which weaves the message into several levels of awareness of the viewer, making it a deeply satisfying performance. This is the best film I have seen in the last ten years; highly recommended!
