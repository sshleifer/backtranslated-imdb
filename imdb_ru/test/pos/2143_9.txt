I first saw this film when it came out in 1980. From other sources, I learned that the only release of the 219-minute segment was in New York, after which it was sharply reduced to 149 minutes. So, I think that I first saw a shorter version, which, it seemed to me, was very interesting anti-Western at the time, albeit a bit confusing ... <br /> <br /> So it was with even more the interest that i finally got the full version dvd. I am glad that I did, because this second review confirmed for me that the film is a real classic, and the critical vitriol cast on Michael Cimino was at least unjustified. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a long film, but there were many others. For example: Once in America (1984) at 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; Ten Commandments (1956) for 220 minutes; Spartak {restored version} (1960) in 198 minutes; Gone with the wind (1939) at 222 minutes and others. Thus, there can be no fact of running, which made so much froth at the mouth when the Heavenly Gate appeared. <br /> <br /> But pay attention: in all these films there is everything to do with strengthening myths about history and heroes. <br /> <br /> The gates of heaven are not so: in this narrative, the American West is shown in all its gloomy and inexorable cruelty, injustice and poverty. And this is probably the first reason so many people didn’t like this film: it described the circumstances of the Johnson County War in Wyoming in 1892, showing how the Wyoming Gardeners Association hired 50 murderers to track down and kill a large group of accused immigrants from Of Europe. the rustle of cattle; and all this with the help and complicity of the authorities, even the President of the United States. For an essay on this war, with a background and what happened, there is a reference to a war in Johnson County on Wikipedia. <br /> <br /> Very few people like to remind about the really dirty periods in the history of their country, and who are confronted with what the country should be. If it were a documentary, it would be hardly acceptable to most; as entertainment, it almost inevitably went bankrupt and was torn to shreds shrill and shameful. <br /> <br /> Leaving aside the sociopolitical diatribe, for a moment about which Cimino began here, what about the narration ?? the story of the three main characters? Well, for the men of that time, it was likely that it was unusual to fall in love with a local prostitute, just as now, probably, there is nothing unusual. This is a fairly standard love triangle, in which Ella must choose between two men, and ultimately solves the issue with a younger man, Nathan, who, although not inclined to resort to cold-blooded murder, when it suits him, shows more spirit and commitment, than the elder James (or Jim, as most people say in the film). For some, this part of the story develops too slowly, perhaps; however, in the context of the broader narrative of the war, I think this is completely appropriate. <br /> <br /> This war is depicted graphically, viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are elegantly staged and edited without any complaints ?? although in the final massacre between the Association and the immigrants, I am sure that some scenes of wagon rupture recur. Minor point, possibly caused by the recovery of the 219-minute segment? However, no matter how you look at him, he strikes you in the face with noise, dust, chaos and confusion of war ... <br /> <br /> What causes me another criticism from others: noise and dust is, that it is often difficult to hear the dialogue and even see clearly what is happening. I admit that at first I thought it was a bit annoying, even if you go back to reproduce parts, to try to catch an image or words ?? until I realized that in reality there is no need if you accept the director’s intention: life is chaotic, it is hard to hear and see in crowded situations, and in war it is an indispensable condition of this mise en scene. In short, you seem to be present inside and inside the scenes ... <br /> <br /> And what of the name? From Shakespeare, does this refer to figurative proximity to God, and therefore, if you equate God to the natural world, the stunning landscapes that permeate the film? and this is stunning, intrusively tantamount to that of Dr. Zhivago David Leane (1965) ?? useful metaphor. However, I tend to think that Cimino had something else, namely the idea that brave immigrants ?? God-fearing salt of the earth ?? was denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build their lives on earth, which is a champion of freedom. <br /> <br /> Was this the intention of Cimino ?? dispel the myth of the American West? To show how in America only the rich become rich, and the poor, in one way or another, are killed throughout history? This is something new? Not really, as we all know. However, in reality it hurts - to show that America did not exist, and, as a result, this is not a country of the free and a brave home. Instead, after studying this narrative, we have the impression that the reinforcement of America is more connected with the land of deprived slaves and home to the scammers ...
