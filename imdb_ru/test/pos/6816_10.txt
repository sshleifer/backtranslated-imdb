For the film of the first director, this is simply an amazing little film, although I have to admit that it is a bit difficult to watch and will probably offend the feelings of many who watch it, since the film takes a certain position in favor of suicide with the help of. However, what I liked about the film was that I had no idea what was going on until the film was more than half finished, and by that time I was hooked. When I talked about this subject, I was amazed at the very professional style of the film - with some of the best cinematographic works I've ever seen in a short film. In addition, this camera work so well with the music and images that made the film just beautiful. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a controversial film. I myself struggle with what I think about this discussion, but the film has managed to make a statement in such a competent and clever way that I really should respect the team that made this film.
