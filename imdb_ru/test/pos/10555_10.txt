I think this is a great and VERY funny movie. The story is so funny. Daughter Nicole leads her father Andre to some very awkward situations. To impress the boy of her dreams, the daughter pretends that her father is her lover. Heigl is beautiful, as Nicole is perhaps too sweet; I'm not sure why she should lie to someone? Gerard Depardieu In this comedy film is very cool playing, so fun to watch. If you like comedy and romantic film, you just have to see it !!! I think you can watch this movie many times and you will still laugh. <br /> <br /> To impress the boy of her dreams, the girl pretends that her father is her lover.
