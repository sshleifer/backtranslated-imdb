Darr (1993) was an incredible film. In my opinion, this is one of the best Bollywood. The film itself causes a feeling of sympathy, fear, confusion, happiness and sadness. The role of Shahrukh was incredible, in fact, he gave obsession a new face. The innocent and girlish character of Juhi Chawla contrasted strongly with the fiery and passionate character of Shahruh. The role of Sunny Deol made the role of the “good guy” look like the role of the “bad guy.” The fact that Shahrukh, not Sunny, captured the attention of the audience, proves that everyone has this helpless inner incentive to strive for what is really not in their hands. Although the film is already several years old, it surpasses any recent one. The song "Tu Mere Samne" was full of passion and meaning. His personality is perfect for the role. He should seriously consider withdrawing the title role in a similar film.
