Dear readers, 2001: “Space Odyssey” is Kubrick at his best ... although I really can't say that “Space Odyssey” is his only film I've ever watched. But still it is a good movie. Strange, but good. <br /> <br /> The film in three acts is very similar to the novel ... which is not surprising since the author wrote the script. Anyway, at first we will start with a simple but impressive discovery, in which “Sparach Zarathustra” also sounds loud. Then comes the boring “Dawn of Man” sequence of boring beyond belief. Then there is the strange sequence “In Search of a Monolith” on the Moon, played on Strauss’s Blue Danube. Finally, things are going well with the scenes of the Spaceship and HAL, going crazy and killing people. After that, everything subsides, and we have the “Entry into the monolith” sequence, which was TOO LONG and ultra-strange ending. Although 2001: Space Odyssey is a good movie. This is not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator or Abyss, but it's cool. My congratulations to the chef, Mr. Kubrick. <br /> <br /> Signature, a regular DVD collector
