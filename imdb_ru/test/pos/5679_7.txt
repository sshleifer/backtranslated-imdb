Like most, I thought "another movie with crocodiles." While we had Primeval and Rogue in the last 12 months, what can they do, what's new? Where both of these films were about action and violence, this one about fear and tension. <br /> <br /> The performances are not Oscar-worthy when nothing happens, but in times of distress or terror these people suffer like torture. There are holes in the plot, and perhaps crocodiles don't really behave as others have pointed out, but fear is so effective that you can say that you will like this movie. It will make you feel as embarrassed as the Passion of Christ.
