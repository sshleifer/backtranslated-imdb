I saw this performance on TV and recorded it on tape. My daughter played it over and over. I borrowed at work, and everyone just liked it. This is just a brilliant physical comedy. Bill appeared here in California (he worked and lived in New York), and performed "Flight of the Flight" on the stage. I was able to take my daughter and her friend to see this brilliant performance. <br /> <br /> Bill was awarded by the Federal Foundation, and my daughter wrote him a congratulatory letter, and Bill was so kind as to write her a note back and attach a photo. <br /> <br /> People ask me, and I can't decide if he is a comedian, actor or clown. In fact, he is all three. I really want it to be on DVD, my tape is lost.
