The other day I described Woody Allen’s “Manhattan” as perfect for someone, and she thought it was a strange way to describe a film ... <br /> <br /> I only saw a few films that I would call perfect. , Manhattan is one, McCabe and Miss Miller from Robert Altman is another, and Once Upon a Time in the West, Sergio Leone is another film that I think is perfect. There are several others, but besides the fact that I do not find any mistakes in the three mentioned by me, I must also admit that all three directors have tastes. <br /> <br /> If there is one film that I could stand behind and argue with the house, that anyone I show it to him will consider it impeccable is Leverage. <br /> <br /> City lights, the Great Dictator, the Gold Rush and even the Lombard - the 10th, but not only Chaplin do everything right in this film, everything he did is ridiculous and touching to a level that cannot be explained .
