The Scandinavians are very good at making me laugh at the gloomy nothingness of my soulless life, yes. <br /> <br /> Shooting here was incredibly scrupulous, every frame, every deadpan look, every element of the color palette, every fragment of the muzak or whooosh of those street cleaners was there to bring home this peaceful emptiness of the world. <br /> <br /> Actually, I think that I could find a general sense of imperious emptiness if its absurdity was not really funny and sociable. For example, when Andreas tells his boss that he misses children and looks up, and the guy smiles halfway out the door, this is a kind of sad but true reflection of working with people, spending 7/8 hours a day with them, seeing more about them than about people you love, but in the end, knowing that deep down they don’t care about your problems and you. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was the film that the Coens did if they were born in Oslo and not in Minnesota. I think their humor is more aggressive and more muddled up in the past of cinema, but they have the same mastery of technique, and their films have the same feeling that life is rather insignificant. <br /> <br /> I’ll stop before I convince myself to take the bus to the winter desert.
