This is Showtime! Showtime is just a hit in the career of Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro. It is an entertaining film and a pleasure from guilt, but not quite by the standards of the actors, especially Robert. Show-time director Tom Day and a few small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Def. <br /> <br /> Two completely different policemen participate in Showtime, Mitch Preston (De Niro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One is serious about working in a restrained, quiet manner, and the other is more relaxed and wants to have fun in the back seat than criminals. They both pursue the same criminal for a huge cluster of televisions, video recorders, etc. Then they cross paths, and the television station wants a new reality show to fight crime while on television. Mitch hates advertising, while Trey loves her with his line "This is Showtime!" Their TV antics and methods are shown on TV, and they are the new show "Policemen". The fun begins. <br /> <br /> In general, Showtime is a funny comedy. A good film, but not entirely consistent with the expectations and standards of the actors. However, it rolls as it goes and parodies reality TV. A good break in shows like Cops. True at the end, just guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
