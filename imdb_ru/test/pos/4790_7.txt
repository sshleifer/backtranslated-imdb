Nazarin from the famous surrealist Bunuel, obviously, is an attack on the Catholic Church and its loss of values. This is not a visual film, and I think that it would play better on stage. Bunuel leads us through this man, the Nazarene, who lives as Christ lived; a true follower, i.e. in poverty, without concern for property and what the next day will bring. Some may call it a parallel with the story of Christ, but any follower and practitioner of the word, life must be in some sense similar to Christ. But, in fact, Bunuel also explores the eyes of human egoism and the need to sin, and how good can save us all. This is a bold statement that can animate or recall a film for some. In truth, the Nazarene is also selfish, because he gives, not wanting in return and not asking for it. His selfishness is his folly, and the two women who follow him represent the sides of a coin with the same face on each side. Many people represent the sides of the coin in this film, all with identical faces. But the film is not entirely memorable, as soon as it ends, and many of its ethical perforations and effusions could be attacked as part of the film’s own doctrine. Not a first-class “Bunuel”, but a “surrealistic” sequence of dreams, which unfolds in “Bunuel”, in which the message about the film is made, and it is worth noting, because it shows the capabilities of the director Bunuel.
