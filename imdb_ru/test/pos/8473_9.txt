Jamie Fox's masterful performance is just one of the highlights of Ray, the 2004 film, which also starred Kerry Washington, Regina King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau and many others. film. <br /> <br /> The film has several main directions: firstly, Charles’s childhood is the drowning of his brother George, who has been chasing him for years, the glaucoma that blinded him, and the strength that his mother taught him - do not bend, do not break never be crippled. In the end, she sends him to a special school where Charles’s musical gift is revealed. The next direction is the creative evolution of Charles as a singer from Nat King King Cole, his arrangement of evangelical music, his forays into country music and the unique sound that was Ray Charles. The third area is the personal life of Charles - his marriage to Beah, his many affairs, his heroin addiction and possible rehabilitation. <br /> <br /> Since Charles lived for 74 years, much has been missed. Although Charles was orphaned in adolescence, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, the film does not. While he is featured on the Chitlin circuit and refuses to play in individual clubs, his almost death from starvation as a musician is not covered. At some point, he found a jar of jelly and tried to eat it, but the jar broke. He was this down and out. Beah is shown with him when the state of Georgia, which banned him, in 1979 accepted as his main song “Georgia on My Mind” and welcomes Charles in his home state, but in 1977 he and Bea divorced, which is not mentioned. , However she was probably there. In addition, she was not his only wife - he was married once before he met her; this marriage is not covered. In the film, we are told about one illegitimate child - there were 12. There would be no way to get all this and more in the film. <br /> <br /> What is not missed is his great music, which seems to continue throughout the film, constantly enhancing his genius and artistry. <br /> <br /> Charles’s story is irresistible and arouses the interest of the audience. Those who laugh at this as a film made for television do not deserve to deserve. The direction of Taylor Hackford gives Luch a good pace, and the film has a lot of atmosphere and perfectly captures various decades. <br /> <br /> Like Ray, Jamie Foxx populates the character and makes you forget that he plays the comedian Except. Fox wore dentures, played the piano, and spent a lot of time with Charles, preparing for the role. He nails him, but this is not an imitation - he is a man of flesh and blood with hallucinations, standing in the water and finding his brother's body; a person who is full of denial of his addiction, who hates the word drug addict and believes that he did not catch; and he denies his home life, thinking that his wife does not know about his various affairs and illegitimate children (in the film, a child); and the man took advantage of his terrible advantage early in his career because of his blindness, which refuses to go on. He demands that he be paid $ 1 each so that they can be counted; when he discovers that he is a gravy for the owner of the club and her partner, and he was almost deceived by the record deal, he makes a deal and leaves his job. <br /> <br /> There’s nothing to be surprised so much. Fox’s performance also takes him as Ray from the first time he appears on camera. <br /> <br /> This is a great biography, which, like "Walk the Line", is permeated with fantastic music by the artist. Whether you're a Ray Charles fan or not, “Ray” is something you need to experience.
