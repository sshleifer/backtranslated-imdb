I just reviewed the 08th MS Gundam a second time. This is much better than Gundam Wing. I can't wait to get a DVD and see what has been edited from the series. It is wonderful to see how the Gundams really clumsily move on the ground. Someone really thought about writing this move script. <br /> <br /> See today.
