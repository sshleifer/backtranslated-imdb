Two people living in the same residential complex find that their partners are in relationship with each other. When they try to put together how it happened, they also go on an emotional journey that requires a solution ?? <br /> <br /> Based on his previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express, Wong Kar Wai gives us this rather old-fashioned and amazing story of awakened passions, longing and unrequited love. <br /> <br /> In Mood for Love, not everyone likes it. He pretty lazily sets in at 98 minutes: not particularly long for a movie, but it appears longer, because in reality, not so much happens. But this lazy feeling hides a fairly densely built film. Most of the story is cleverly woven around a series of role-playing games in which the characters play out the supposed scenarios between their spouses, trying to understand how the romance began. I say cunning, because, of course, it prevents viewers (and characters) from saying that they are “in the role” and that they are authentic. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds more like art and self-consciousness, then it is because it is. Shamelessly so. And two of the best Hong Kong musicians, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, play beautifully with the great support of Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Peng. <br /> <br /> This is also Wong Kar Wai’s masterly performance. which refers to the audience with a sensual and sensual overload. The unification of Christopher Doyle (who later used his lush, overripe Hero style) and Pin Bing Lee (whose perfectly understated style can be seen in Springtime in a Small Town) was a cinematic genius. It has all the brave beauty of Doyle, to be honest, without Athens, the poster of his work on the hero. The music, as always with Wong, is outstanding. From Nat King Cole, singing in Spanish, to the fascinating strings of the main theme, it blends perfectly with the eclectic beauty of the images. <br /> <br /> In general, the best film, whether it be the plot, acting, cinematography or soundtrack. Similar, but more accessible than Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, is a beautiful, old-fashioned story of lost and regained love. <br /> <br /> And beware of hotel rooms in Tony Leung in 2046, which anticipated Wong’s recent film of the same name.
