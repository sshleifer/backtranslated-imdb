That's right, the hospital scene with Holly and Shannon was brilliantly completed, it all starts with Piper-on. Gurney looks very wounded, the doctors drive her to the emergency room, and they move her from the gurney to the bed, and Prue is holding her hand from this point, it is obvious that Piper has a lot of breathing problems and her lungs do not work when she turns. to ask Prue not to leave her side, she breaks: â€œDon't go, I love you, and then her pulse drops, and she enters a cardiac arrest and the monitor shows a clear flat line, and the nurses switch to full injury and enter a defibrillator. Prue backs away from the bed in horror, because the doctors are desperately trying to shock her dying sister's heart, but there is no answer, and she tragically pronounced the dead man is a good great scene well done
