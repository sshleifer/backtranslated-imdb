This early Warner Brothers "Son of the Gods" (1930) is devoted to the racial intolerance that Anglo-Saxon Americans show towards the Chinese. Chinese Americans are treated as second-class citizens, and whites hold them only with contempt. <br /> <br /> Screenwriter Bradley King bases his screenplay on Rex Beach's novel about young impressionable Chinese Sam Lee (Richard). Bartelmess of Angels Only Wings, who is experiencing racial prejudice when girls, who are invited by his college colleagues to a party, talk about their racist feelings for Sam when they learn about his legacy. Sam goes to his father, Li Ying (E. Elin Warren from Gone with the Wind), who is a wealthy Chinese with offices not only in New York, but also in San Francisco. Sam feels deeply wounded by racial slurs and wants to leave New York and go to a place where Americans cannot harm him. His patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life, and tolerance is the only solution to the problem of racism. Sam has yet to learn this lesson. He refuses to take more money from his father and catches a ship in London, England, peeling potatoes while he is on board. <br /> <br /> During the trip, he meets the British playwright Bathurst (Claude King of Arrowsmith), who needs help writing a play about the Chinese. Sam and he make friends, and Sam gives him cultural information about Asians. While they are resting in France, Sam meets a beautiful young woman, Allana Wagner (Constance Bennett from “Two Faces of a Woman”), who falls madly in love with him. It seems that Allan and her rich father are resting in the same motel. Everyone at the motel knows that Sam is Chinese, with the exception of Allana. Being sensitive to his racial heritage, Sam keeps Allan at arm's length, until she convinces him that nothing can change her mind about him. They fall madly in love together. Allan's father drops a bomb on her when he discovers that Sam is Chinese, and all the memories of living in San Francisco and how to communicate with coolies have flooded Allan’s head. She bursts into the dining room in a motel and publicly smacks Sam on horseback in front of a room filled with spectators. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sam is terribly devastated by this change of events. He thought that Allan loved him, but she did not. At about the same time, Sam Lee's father Ying was seriously ill, and a sort of secretary, Ying Eileen (Mildred Van Dorn of Iron Man), sends Sam a telegram about Yin's illness. As expected, Sam hurries home to New York to be with his father. After public humiliation, Sam vowed not to show kindness to Anglo-Saxon Americans; Eileen is an Irish Catholic and probably one of his few white friends. Lee Ying dies, and Sam takes over the management of the business, and he practices his anti-white racism until he finds out that he was an Anglo-Saxon foundling, whom the San Francisco police officer had given in tact to Li Ying and his wife to raise. The policeman forgot about this until two white social workers wanted to take Sam from Ying. Sam learns this revelation around the same time that Allana arrived in New York and fell ill. During her illness, she repeatedly says his name in a dream, and her faithful father goes to Sam and asks Sam to visit her to help her recover. Unbeknownst to Allan, Sam visits her and she gets better, but she has no memories of his visit, just a vague idea. In the end, Allana learns the truth that Sam is not Chinese, and that they are getting married and living happily ever after. <br /> <br /> This socially conscientious issue of the Warner Brothers / First National Pictures Release frankly and firmly talks about the problem of race first. An hour before the revelation that there is no Chinese blood in Sam's veins, he is taken by surprise and him and the viewers. The reconciliation between Allana and Sam inspires confidence, despite their selfless, immortal love for each other. However, in the name of a happy ending that would erase all the negatives that were before him, they find themselves in each other’s arms. <br /> <br /> Surrender on the racial issue with the revelation that Sam is not the Chinese are damaging part of the moral force of the film. Incredibly, “Son of the Gods” is a film created in a pre-code format that seems almost tricky; For example, Sam is American, not Chinese! Constance Bennett beautifully acts as an annoying ornament, and she gets your attention when she hits Sam with her top. Claude King is as good as Bathurst, and Elin Warren is as convincing as Li Ying. Interestingly, Warren made a career portraying Asian characters. Richard Bartelmess is flawless like Sam; It provides a very nuanced performance. Despite his age, "Son of the Gods" - the son of a good movie!
