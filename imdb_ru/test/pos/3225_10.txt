I absolutely fell in love with this girl. Let me tell you something: I'm from Romania, and here is only the sixth episode, launched every other day, on American television. I check the internet and download it from there, so I follow the rest of the world. I can't believe how deep I am on this show. I learned absolutely everything about them, I looked on the Internet, what is Rory's car, what are their middle names and the like: Rory is also Lee, and Lorelai is Victoria. I can't understand why, but my boyfriend doesn't love them, and I try to make him see how beautiful they are, but without success, but he understands me and lets me be with my "obsession" with Gilmore girls. I adore them. I really hope that if someone sees, it will give them a try: you will not regret it
