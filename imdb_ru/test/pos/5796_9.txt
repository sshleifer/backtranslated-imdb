Forget about every spy movie you have ever seen - such was life in the USSR, and still in many places in Russia and the countries of the former USSR. Vera dreams of leisure, as she sees the West; its reality is completely different, with a bitter mother, a cruel father and omnipresent alcohol. And its future prospects are not much better. She finds a man, and they try to establish a life together, but he suffers from the same environment, both socially and physically - the scenery in this film is brilliant, it is convenient to sit in the company of post-apocalyptic films, but obviously, with special effects; they just came in and filmed everything that happened in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Forget about your stereotypical, cold Russian spy movies. This is a real bargain: people are passionate, energetic and present in ways that you will never see in a drama from the West.
