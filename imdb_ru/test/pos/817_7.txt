I first saw this film when Quentin Tarantino showed it to many of us in the dramatic Alamo House in Austin. He anticipated this with how awesome he was, how he was, and how it was ridiculous, and in the context of his explanation it was HUGE. I see how this may hurt some viewers, and the topic is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that made me laugh so much that I decided to pee. They do not come until they have gone half way, but when they come, oh God ... you die. Oh, and Jim Brown is great. He is not in many films, but when he is there, you know whose film it is. Naturally, the best line in the film (and the funniest) is his; you will know it when you hear it.
