"Meatballs" is an ode to the summer camp. Those of us who need to go to the camp will see many scenes as we remember them or would like them to be. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray plays the boys' senior adviser Tripper Harrison, who actually leads the camp. He reminds us of the funny classroom employee everyone loves. Young tourists to him, and if he speaks to you, you feel that you are a family. This is one of the best roles Murray. He leads the film with his one-liners and commercials. <br /> <br /> Chris Makepeace plays Rudy, a lone tourist who was taken under Tripper’s wing and escaped from his shell. <br /> <br /> The rest of the camp and the staff in the film were also great. <br /> <br /> The overall theme of the film is an outsider overcoming obstacles to final victory. From Rudy to Spaz, to Camp and even to Tripper himself, the losers of the film are stars. The film has a heart. <br /> <br /> The film is funny and funny, but at the same time it is not cruel and not hypnotized, like some modern films for teenagers. The actors look and behave like real people. <br /> <br /> Comedy and heart attract you to the fact that at the end, as in a camp, you are sad to leave. <br /> <br /> In my summer camp experience, we had underwear running flagpoles, mysterious meat, trying to get into the girls' cabin, crazy stories with hooks around the fire, pulling sleeping people out of their cabins and placing them in another place. But we also had dedicated camp staff who helped us to be the best we could be. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is “Night” when they canoe across a lake singing a silly song. The only line that strikes me every time is when Tripper announces going out of the light the evening before Parents Day and ends: “Tomorrow is Parents Day, and you must look rested, otherwise Morty will be sent to the state prison.”
