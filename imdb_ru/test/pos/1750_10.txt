When HOPE IS IN THE CITY, he discovers nothing but bad news for his little insect neighbors in the Lowlands. Can this honest, good-natured grasshopper save his beloved, Miss Honey Bee, from the machinations of the evil C. Bagley Beetle, as well as bring her friends to a safe new home - before it is too late? <br /> <br /> Although this is not one of the wonderful animation functions (a completely new art at the time of the creation of this film), HOPPITY is a pleasant film that should be a pleasure for uncritical viewers. Technically, this is well done, with animation usually of high quality. The main drawback of the film is that none of the heroes really have a “heart” - they don’t “come to life” on the screen, as Jimini Cricket did a year earlier in Pinocchio. <br /> <br /> However, it is ultimately unfair to compare the results of Fleischer Studio with the results of Disney. Max and Dave Fleischer had their own star; their contribution — and it would be significant — would be in the field of a single-drum cartoon. With their POPEYE and BETTY BOOP series, they have created alternate realities as viable as any other cartoons. HOPPITY was their second experiment with the animation of a full-length film (after GULLIVER'S TRAVEL in 1939), and henceforth they will again spend their strength on the short theme of the cartoon. In fact, the first in the well-known series SUPERMAN has already been published. <br /> <br /> The story of HOPPITY owes a lot to Frank Capra, thanks to her energy, to fight a hero against powerful social forces. Indeed, the original name of the film was MR. ERROR GOES TO THE CITY, which immediately recalls Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart and their adventures in Capraesque. <br /> <br /> Jack Mercer, known as Popay’s voice, speaks here of two completely different characters, the old Mr. Bumblebee and the flies. Filmmakers must be able to catch veteran voice actors Pinto Colvig and May Questhel in both roles. There are some nice songs by Joagi Carmichael and Frank Lesser, of which `Be My Little Baby 'Bumblebee” is the most familiar. “We are a couple in the castle” is a beautiful romantic melody that deserves to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the original animation of the film, swept from heaven and past the depth of the New York horizon, is hidden behind the opening captions.
