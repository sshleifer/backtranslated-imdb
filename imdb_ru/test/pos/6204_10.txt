I watched in awe at Sleeper Cell, worrying about whether terrorists would be famous. This fascinating series was not only responsible for the subject, but also created depth and essence for almost every character. Oded Fehr simply absorbs the screen in every scene he is in, and although his character is the charismatic leader of the terrorist jihad cell, he still has hypnotic appeal. Michael Or felt good, although in some scenes I wondered why he was not shot dead on the spot because of the frown he wore on his face. <br /> <br /> The pluses of the series are the two leading Fehr and Ealy, well-written characters - all of which were believable and tragic, and troubling issues touched upon in history. After I was married to a Muslim, the atmosphere created was quite realistic. The flaws, for me personally, were that the female T & A was redundant - most seemed useless, like some sex scenes. Despite this, this is a rough and exciting series that will make you think. Someone gives Feru more juicy roles like this one and lets him work with him. He has an incredible presence on the screen and a strange power emanating from him.
