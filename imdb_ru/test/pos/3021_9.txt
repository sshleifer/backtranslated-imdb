The terrific and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, Catherine Dean (Jennifer Lopez), who is desperately persuaded by two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) to use her therapy on Karl Starger (Vincent D'Ofornio) The serial killer who (using the strange and terrifying tactics of torture) is in a coma by the feds. What Novak wants in return for Dean is the location of Starger's latest victim, and if she is alive. As soon as Dean gets into the head of Starger, who has a look and atmosphere resembling the colorful combination of David Lynch's Dunes or Blue Velvet and A Nightmare on Elm Street by Wes Craven, the adventure begins. Dean sees a lot of strange people, ranging from Carl in his youth (charming Jake Thomas) and ending with a man like Freddy Krueger, with the exception of razor claws. I do not want to give the ending, but the film is great in general, except for dynamite performances, creepy musical accompaniment and direction by Howard Shore (Tarcem, who shows here that he can direct).
