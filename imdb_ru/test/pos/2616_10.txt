this episode is not incoherent as the other person said. the source agreed to help because he was not going to keep his word, if you pay attention ... he speaks after she (Phoebe) agrees to stay there in hell: To worry about them in the future "... and also, he Cole was not allowed to warn the sisters as a fob given in exchange for accepting a deal, therefore PRUE DIED, because she received a blow harder than PIPER and on the head and this time there was no Fob to call LEV, WHAT SHE HAS ALREADY GOT THE MOST KILLING Pay more attention next time! And after this episode there will be the words "CONTINUE TO CONTINUE ..." this is the end of the third season, and in the fourth season they cannot show anything from PRUE because she owns the rights to this "PRUE", so the producers will have to pay her for everything This is the last episode in which it is located!
