Apparently, this film is based on a true story. I'm not sure how accurate this is. But it really reminded me of how, when I see someone being killed in the news, it's amazing how much this does not affect me. Of course, I think it's terrible, but to be honest, I don't care. I move on. It seems that the murder is now trivial. This is what the edge of the river shows. No one seems to care about this girl and her death, not even the killer. Then what's the point? <br /> <br /> The killer in this story is John, and for most of the film he hides with another killer named Fek, played by Dennis Hopper. Fek is older and you can see the generation gap. He says he loved the girl he killed. When he asks John if he loves the girl he killed, he simply replies: "She's all right." The film offers only one solution: life is more important than death. The character's life is saved, people get a second chance, and one hopeless case is killed. <br /> <br /> The game is really good. After watching this movie, I could only conclude that Crispin Glover is either a brilliant actor or a terrible actor. I still have no idea. Although he was my main reason to watch this movie. But the best result was obviously given by Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the mods are really 80s and the characters sometimes mention current problems, I still think that River's Edge is as relevant today as before. > <br /> My rating is: 10/10
