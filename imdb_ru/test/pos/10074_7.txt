I saw this movie on its opening day in New York, in Siegfield. At that time, Madonna was not exactly a cultural icon than she is now. She had a few hits, she was very good at Desparately Seeking Susan, and I had tickets to see her at a concert at the Giants Stadium. <br /> <br /> "Who is this girl?" gives Madonna a real role, which is not just a change of her own personality. She makes routine crazy / heroine better than you think. Griffin Dunn is very good in the role of the person around to witness all the machinations. <br /> <br /> This story tells about a huge cat named Murray, the future bride who slept with every taxi driver in New York. test and key. There are a lot of car chases and cops chasing them. All the elements of the worm comedy are intact. <br /> <br /> Sir John Mills is seen for a while. He shares a glass of champagne with the hosts and has the largest apartment on the Upper West Side, full of rain forest and everything else. <br /> <br /> Compared to most Madonna movies (which I still endured), this is fantastic. By itself, this is not so bad. 6/10. <br /> <br /> PS The concert was lousy.
