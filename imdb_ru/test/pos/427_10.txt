I only saw three episodes of Hack with David Morse, and it looks like I missed 37 episodes! well, if ITV 3 shows them in chronological order. I just watched Misty Blue (episode 38). I really enjoyed these 3 episodes, but then I am a fan of David Morse (especially St. Elsewhere). For anyone reading this, Hack is great. It is a pity that he is being broadcast on ITV 3. The cast is strong, although I can't get used to David's idea of ​​playing a bent cop, but we all know that he is a good guy who is mistakenly accused. I see Gary Cole starring as a guest, what happened to Midnight Caller? Just be surprised if the hack is available on DVD (for now). Love it. Greetings.
