I was really surprised when I first saw this film directed by Ian Softly; It differs in many ways from the usual Hollywood mass production. The plot itself is simple - Kevin Spacey plays the mentally ill Prot, who claims that he is from the planet K-Pak, who arrived on Earth with a ray of light, while Dr. Powell, played by Jeff Bridges, is trying to help him solve his errors. .. First of all, I have to admit that the cast is right: Kevin Spacey is really great in the image of the intriguing character Prot, always walking on the fine line, convincing us that this is real, and then forcing us to wonder whether he is crazy or not ... Some of the precious scenes include the one where Prot innocently eats the whole banana (even a peg) during a session with Dr. Powell; or an observatory scene where he confidently demonstrates his knowledge of the K-Pax system to astounded astronomers ... Jeff Bridges, on the other hand, is the delicate, rational side of this film, and he perfectly demonstrates it. There are a number of great actors (for example, Saul Williams' convincing performance as Ernie) that make this film truly useful. <br /> <br /> K-pax has it all, comedy elements; Sci-fi, even a psychological thriller (about Proth’s personality), but most importantly, it can be categorized as a heartbreaking drama. The main premise of the film is quite confusing, but the director never lets him break away, he always keeps it believable and at the same time bilateral. Camera and photography play almost an important role here, continuing the basic idea of ​​traveling into the world, great attention is paid to the play of bright shadows, lighting settings - one of the most memorable scenes where Dr. Powell keeps a crystal figure in his office, refracts light in a beautiful way As he always suspects, can the idea be true? <br /> <br /> Thin and slow, intriguing and enjoyable, K-pax is a real gem to watch, one of those films that may not be for everyone, but those who see it can fall in love with it.
