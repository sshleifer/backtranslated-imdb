Animated shorts are not much better than this wonderful Canadian film. This short article is replete with Canadian references, and therefore this film will surely be appreciated by Canadians the most. But the main story is universal, and the writer Roch Carrier tells it with love. This is a funny story that I know for a long time, and recently I was lucky to see her again, so I just MUST write heart recommendations for her. This is a masterpiece, and be sure to see whether you are Canadian or not.
