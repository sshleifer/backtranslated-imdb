I read a lot of unflattering comments on this film, and the only thing I saw that they all have in common is “boring” and “unreal”. <br /> <br /> First of all, they used a real deception. 'crocodiles! How much more realistic can you become? No CGI, no animatronics, no thumbnails. Just a crocodile and a piece of meat. Have fun guys! <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this film starts slowly. The development of the character, that they had little, somehow, takes a little time, and I think that this particular film is not enough. <br /> <br /> However, when the film starts, I found the action to be matched. dramatically. I do not want to say that there is a lot of action. In any case, there are still moments when the crocodile is not visible at all, and people are just waiting. However, we know that there will be no relief, and that the crocodile is just waiting for its time. It was like the horrific sensations of other films that reach their horror by inaction, such as Open Water (another film that some viewers criticized for being “boring”). Personally, I think that spectators who are not able to feel the tension were removed at intervals of surgical attention at birth, but this is just me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the characters feel real, and the situation is such that it can really happen to everyone under the right circumstances. In addition, deaths are absolutely real, and from time to time it is a bit difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a winner.
