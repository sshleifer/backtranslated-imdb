LCDR Tom Dodge, despite his reputation among submariners as a renegade and individualist (* note to reader: Maverick does not mean "Tom Cruise". Maverick means "nonconformist.") his submarine fleet. Vice-Admiral is concerned about our old friends, Russians, who hold sales on their old diesel fleets. Countries like Libya, North Korea or Iraq would like to have this child and put a nuclear warhead in Norfolk Harbor or Mayport, Florida.

Dodge takes command and instantly inflames bad news. I mean his pretty group of submariners in warriors. Despite the tattoo "welcome aboard" on his member, he is a competent and fair commander, he does not choose the favorites and in a responsible manner transfers authority. The US Navy could not come up with more subtle propaganda for recruiting than this beautifully made undervalued gem from the creator of the Police Academy.
