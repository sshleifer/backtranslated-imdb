The death of Visconti in Venice is considered one of the most beautiful films in history. Observing, we recognize that we are in the hands of visionary genius. There is certainly an infinitely rich Death in Venice; but in other important aspects it is an unsatisfactory film. Thomas Mann writes with a scorn and from a distance literary career and creativity von Ashenbach; his domineering manner, his layer upon layer of programmed, self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio appears and an obsession arises, it becomes obvious that Ashenbach has no idea who he is below his attributes of the Gilded Age and the carefully lived life. In fact, after seeing Tadzio, “The Lonely,” as Mann sometimes calls him, splits into two parts. Ashenbach No. 1 absorbs the gaze of a beautiful 14-year-old boy, and then tries to intellectually process a dizzying surge in blood pressure, as if he were a work of art — a “divine” work of art. But Ashenbach No. 2 acts as a stalker who takes control and then replaces the rational Ashenbach No. 1. Like the original Ashenbach, his sexual counterpart is discouraged to establish human contact with the object of his obsession — and thus Tadzio remains a distant ideal. . Thomas Mann does not have mercy on this game. Each piece of self-knowledge comes too hard and too late; the excitement of the sexual tide is too great to resist. The fact that Venice is seized by diseases means nothing to Ashenbach, except that his game now has higher stakes. When he finally whispers under his breath: “I love you,” he knows that everything is lost, and the abyss is waiting. Is any of this removable? Perhaps, Visconti creates a visual feast, from which it is impossible to look away. But there are mistakes: he and Dirk Bogard create Ashenbach as a sympathizer; Mann again did not. POV Ashenbach dominates the film, and we have to determine. But nowhere on the screen is there a person bursting from the inside. Bogarde easily switches between sublimely controlled and ridiculous temperament - but what is under it? Bogard's reactive activity is not moored. Mann writes a character who, in his imagination, performs the Dance of the Seven Veils, all too well aware of the consequences that such freedom causes, but not in power and not wanting to resist. In addition, the Visconti script creates a character that is not in the original — Alfred, Ashenbach’s friend — to dramatize Mann’s discussion about art and artists. These scenes are poorly written disasters, and the actor who portrays Alfred is hard to watch. In addition, Ashenbach Visconti is a Teutonic gilding composer who, I think, works for a film; and the symphonies of Mahler, replacing the novels of Ashenbach. Unfortunately, the great music of Mahler is poorly recorded and very poorly played. Thus, Death in Venice, as Visconti conveys to us, is not a complete success, which it could be, but as a purely visual experience, its power cannot be denied. All film students, especially filmmakers, will want to take a look.
