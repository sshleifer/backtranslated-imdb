"In the Line of Fire" is one of those Hollywood films that is often shown on TV, but although I have seen it several times, I usually end up watching it all again. What for? - Good! Clint Eastwood, as usual, is great, and the character he plays is interesting and more concrete than usual. The character, secret service agent Frank Horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he was on the details that failed to protect President Kennedy in Dallas, and now he has to stick his mind with a professional killer who openly declares that he will kill the president, Nevertheless the film does not make him a depressive, thoughtful and obsessed character. He is charming and personable, and realistic as a guy who has experienced a lot in life and feels comfortable in his own skin. He is even very persuasive when he flirts with a rather young agent, played by Rene Russo. The killer, whom John Malkovich played at his best, is cerebral, deliberate, and loves to play games with high stakes of life and death. He even bears the name of another presidential killer, John Bout. <br /> <br /> The film invariably gives pleasure, and it presents all the goods - the unknown, the action movie, the melodrama and the drama - in the proper quantity. This is a fun movie that really helps great actors!
