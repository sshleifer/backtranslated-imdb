A really great movie ... I stumbled upon it in the video store and filmed it, because Aaron Eckhart was in it (in the company of men, your friends and neighbors), as well as Polina Poritsova ... The beautiful model of the former SI swimsuit is really exposed , but this is only one of many reasons to shoot it ... It's very exciting, and character development is fantastic ... Eckhart is one of the most underrated actors working on a film, and he steals this film ... It's very dark and cruel but I enjoyed immensely ....
