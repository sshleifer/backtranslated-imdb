When I was five years old, it was my favorite TV show. I remembered that it was on channel 11 at 2 pm every day. The idea of ​​the show was simple: Carol and Janis were leading this children's television show. They sang songs and read stories to us in childhood. This was done in a studio with only 54 episodes that were broadcast over and over. I remember Sherlock, the puppet, in a tree. The show taught us how to count, add, subtract and alphabet. Thirty minutes a day I learned something new with Paula and Janis. I remember these days as pleasant memories, and now I hope that today's children can learn to love simpler things, such as listening to stories, inexpensive props, riding on a swing and talking with dolls. The set was perfect and simple, but it was Carol and Janice who were worth the time. I miss my childhood and the days when the most important thing was to watch the Magic Garden. Life seemed so much simpler and better. I hope children will enjoy the show today.
