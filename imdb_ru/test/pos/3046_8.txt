Martin Ritt seems to be a director who has always been interested in social issues (as the son of immigrants, he had all the incentives, especially because he was on the black list in the 50s). "Conrac" is based on Pat Conroy's "Water is Wide" novel, about his own learning experience in 1969 for impoverished black children about the outside world, much to the chagrin of the right superintendent (Hume Cronin). A cultural and historical context has been added to the strength of the film: Conroy (Jon Voight) is disappointed to tell another teacher how many children do not know about Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, the Vietnam War, or even about where Vietnam is. He continues to explain to them about all these factors. <br /> <br /> Somewhere I read a complaint that when Conroy played music for children, he only played white music. In truth, you can't blame the movie; It was based on the actual experience of Conroy. In any case, the film is a real gem.
