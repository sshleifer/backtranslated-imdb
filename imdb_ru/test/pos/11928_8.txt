I have not seen this for years, but when I was about 6 years old, I first saw it on VHS and must have watched it at least 10 times. Now, as I said, some time has passed, so I could ruin the conspiracy, but I remember how some Colombian terrorists took a preparatory school hostage for demanding the release of the main terrorist (the “master of desires”) from prison. Now I could just check out the plot here on IMDb, but I'm sure this is correct. anyway, a group of boys at school decides that they will not just sit and wait to die, so they decide to fight back. this film has always been in my head. There are so many images that I have not forgotten, like the scene of Joey's death (I think?) Or Billy spitting into the sandwiches of terrorists or one child (I don't know his name), a fake asthma attack. just a great movie. it could be films like this, which gave me my tolerance for the film press, because, if I remember correctly, this film is quite graphic. the guys were trimmed because of the machine guns of helicopters, the guys from the special forces were shot down by a grenade (not sure about that, but it seems to me that I remember something like that to the end), and the bloodiest of them was the main terrorist who was beaten in the head . Great action, great humor, good acting, great movie impressions. I have to watch it again after all these years!
