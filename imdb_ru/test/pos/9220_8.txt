Hmm, hello .. Rainbow Brite ... one name is hard to take seriously, as if she might be Strawberry Shortcake's cousin ... but when you're a child, this is definitely a serious thing. <br /> <br /> So this nasty, snotty, pampered girl wants Rainbow Brits belt, that is, the light of the whole universe, and Rainbow Bright and her friend Chris are bound and determined to stop her. As I recall, Murky and Lurky played a minor role in this performance. Maybe they wanted too much money? <br /> <br /> Anyway, a snotty, angry girl has a powerful jewel, and she gives her strength to take the Rainbow belt ... imagine? But somehow Rainbow brings his belt back and energizes him with “star splashes” and kicks the bad girl's ass with Chris and his prism bracelet, and they also save the whole universe in the process. <br /> <br /> So good triumphs over evil, good triumphs over rudeness, and Rainbow Bright and Colored Children are safe again to spread color and joy to all of humanity.
