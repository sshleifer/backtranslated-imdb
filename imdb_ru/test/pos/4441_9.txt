Documentary films in which sons and daughters seek to understand the parent, and, as a result, their own life is not something unusual. There are also frequent results that reflect the lack of talent, the failure of introspection, the abundance of narcissism, and perhaps the awkward search for publicly naked revenge for countless past offenses, real and fictitious. What is unusual is a brilliant, honest and fascinating portrait of a charming parent, and “My Architect: A Son's Journey” is a rare achievement. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child, his face irreparably. and severely traumatized by accident. He and his parents settled in Philadelphia, where a talented young man loved art and music. Soon he fell in love with buildings and decided that only his career as an architect would respond to his creative abilities. <br /> <br /> Kahn was an architect, but, as the film shows, it took a long time before he caught the attention of the leaders of his field. One architect suggests that he was the victim of a “yellow bandage,” this anti-Semitism, which, along with a biased attitude toward women, has long remained an indisputable aspect of the American profession of architect. <br /> <br /> When he nevertheless remarked, He was quite clearly visible as a self-confident workaholic prophet, who declared uncompromising demands for the realization of his vision and only his vision. This inflexibility was the reason that, while he painted wonderful plans for many buildings, he built only a few. An interview with an elderly gentleman who fired Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a reformed city center, where people left their cars around the perimeter and went to the city. Fun. <br /> <br /> Kahn was a born teacher and some of the extensive archival videos show him with students, his voice is steady but passionate, their views are respectful and intense. <br /> <br /> Many architects interviewed Nathaniel Kahn, director, writer and honorary project manager, the only architect. a son. Some are world famous - I. M. Pei, Robert A. M. Stone, Moshe Safdie, Frank Gehry, and still active Negenarian Filipp Johnson. Their comments paint a vivid picture of this idealistic but ultimately financially unsuccessful building designer who mixed castles, fortresses and stately buildings of past centuries with designs for the present. Cana’s buildings are among the most impressive - Salk Research Laboratory in La Jolla, California. For me, his style has a neo-romantic atmosphere, overshadowed by too much empty space, which is more likely to repel than attract human interaction. <br /> <br /> But Cana’s son was not just the story of his father, the architect. For many years, Louis Kahn had three families: a wife with whom he had a daughter, and two long-term relationships, one of whom gave birth to a daughter, and the other a son. Kan would often visit his son at his mother’s house, but at the end of the evening, mother and son Kana would be taken back to the family home. Nathaniel clearly wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships, but it didn’t seem to scare him, which certainly was a strange affair for a little boy. <br /> <br /> When Nathaniel was a little boy, Louis Kahn died from a severe heart attack in the men's room at the New York station in Pennsylvania after returning from India, where he presented one of his large-scale projects, another one that never was built. At that time, his Philadelphia firm had a debt of at least $ 500,000, and if he had lived on a trip to a federal bankruptcy court, it would probably be not far off. <br /> <br /> Kahn left behind several monumental buildings, the government building of which is located in Bangladesh. obviously the biggest. The tearful local architect hails Kahn for creating a building in which democracy can (and, hopefully, will) flourish. <br /> <br /> Colleague-architect Moshe Safdi believes that maybe something suitable in the sufferings of Kahn from a fatal heart attack Railway Station, given his incessant traffic. I disagree: unfortunately, it is ironic that Kahn must die in the faceless replacement of one of America’s true architectural treasures, the old station of Pennsylvania, destroyed to make room for a sterile replacement without character and without continuing civil memory. <br /> <During the journey of the younger Kahn, several emotional moments were shot, including with his half-sisters and mother, but they are real and touching, not combat and staged. Historians of architecture will always study Kahn. His son found reasons to remember him as vicious, but very iconoclastic and, ultimately, a private person. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
