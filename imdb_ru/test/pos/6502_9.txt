Wow — most of the audience seemed to be just shaking their heads through most of this documentary about the sheer magic displayed on the screen. <br /> <br /> The transition from the early days of the New York black-American phenomenon to the Present days as a racially diverse subculture (and mainly based on the West Coast) is well represented. <br /> <br /> The modest player is not given due attention to any traditional musical instrument, but it can be much more versatile and technically complex. These DJs take the necessary skills for any musical instrument - agility, rhythm and time, among other things - and apply them to a new technology with several additional variables. <br /> <br /> DJ Qbert's comment that he draws what “music” should sound like on advanced planets, and then everything settles, at first glance seems silly, it becomes more and more logical when you watch these guys go and spew out a multitude of sounds that no traditional instrument could ever create! <br /> <br /> Some critics say that this film is too focused on certain “stars” and misses the opportunity to talk about the wider hip-hop culture. One film at a time, people!
