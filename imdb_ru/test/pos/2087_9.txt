This film is probably one of the best I have seen so far. I would say that this is just the second place in “All About Lily Chou-Chou” because it kind of gives me the same vibrations ... “9 souls” is about 9 prisoners who just escaped from prison to find fake money kept in time capsule in Mount Fuji Elementary School. Later, they learn that there were not so many, and went their own ways. The first half of the film is just a time to introduce the characters and to determine the main points. This is a comedic but serious part of the journey. The second half touched me to tears. In the course of the movie, each character goes and tries to fulfill his dreams, but, unfortunately, ends badly. in the end, only 2 of 9 runaways remained. the way in which each character left the scene was very sad, and you will probably feel tears in your eyes. beautiful film, filmed fantastically. This is a film for people who like other Toshiaka Toyoda films, such as Blue Spring.
