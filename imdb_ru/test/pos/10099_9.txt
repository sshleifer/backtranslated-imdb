Every word of high praise did not reach the height of this film. This film is a true example of what a psychological horror movie should be. <br /> <br /> When you first view the plot it seems a bit confusing, but it will definitely explain a little about what is happening, and you really want to watch it a second time. But after the second viewing, you will begin to combine the fragments, and then you will understand how amazing the film can be. <br /> <br /> Advice for fans of slash movies to stay away from this movie. This is not your movie with slasher teenagers, where you just turn off your brain and sit in front of the screen, just to see big b ** bs and lots of blood. <br /> <br /> If you want to reinforce the psychological horror factor of this movie, then watch it alone with the help of a great home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without any of your poorly educated friends joking over a really tense situation. And do not forget to turn off the lights. <br /> <br /> My comments on various aspects: - <br /> <br /> Direction = 9/10 Actual = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total = 9/10
