I saw this in the Accent Underground release with short films. At first, the film seemed to me boring and old-fashioned, and I turned it off after the first hour - I was a little drunk and tired. <br /> <br /> I went to bed, and without a joke I had a nightmare about this film. within half an hour and falling asleep. I couldn't stop thinking about why, so I got up, turned on the TV again, loaded the DVD and watched the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Well done, Alex Freyn, sir, you managed to implant your film into this old, cynical head of the audience, and it takes effort. So 10 out of 10 to you. <br /> <br /> I cannot say that I “love” this film of yours, but it had a lasting impact, despite its shortcomings and low budget, etc.
