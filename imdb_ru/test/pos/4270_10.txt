As an English teacher, I appreciate films that tell more than a story. Good movies, like good literature, make you think, reflect and predict. This film made me do all three. Mr. Jansen takes risks and uses omens, symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters. I also like the fact that, in spite of the choices that the characters make in the film, their choices do not look as young or criminal as in other films that I've seen. The acting is pretty good, and the actors seem to share good chemistry with each other. Great soundtrack with songs that you do not hear on the radio. It is a life reconciling / spontaneous film about a trip that deserves more than just a second look.
