Pretty stupid little movie you might just love. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that sometimes he looks rather trite and cliche, he nevertheless works and brings pleasure from pure and pure pleasure. Five teams take part in the hunt for scavengers and fight with each other and with their wits to win the competition all night long - just for the joy of "knowing that your team is the best." <br /> <br /> Several screen debuts have been recognized, including David Naughton’s first role in a movie after his ad for Dr. Pepper’s “Be a Pepper” and before his major 1981 hit American Werewolf in London. Also Paul Ruubens is depicted in what I consider his first shot by Pee Wee Herman-Esquire a year before he became known for it. Last but not least, Mr. Spin City and Alex Keaton himself, Michael J. Fox, get their first movie role here. Fans will remember Stephen Furst as Flounder in Animal House. In addition, there are no names, but there are all funny characters. <br /> <br /> I doubt that he ever got on DVD, but there are still probably some copies of VHS, and you can even see late, late shows sometime. If you do, it is worth your watch. You may hate it, but it may also become an unusual little film that you will love.
