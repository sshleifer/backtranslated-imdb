This documentary is as unique as its subject matter. And while D'Amato's main product was erotica, the film managed to show some decent clips from movies you can recall from the old time, late night Cinemax ... One problem ... Joe did hardcore porn sometimes mixed with erotica erotica, even mixed in his bloody films. Bloody films are a cult classic, for $ 20 apiece for a duplicate copy on the network (not peanuts for 20-year-olds, guys.) I want to understand why this is a cult classic. In addition, no matter how sweet Joe seemed (he seemed more elegant than one would expect), the dude loved to shock. Both “Caligula: The Untold Story” and “Emanuel in America” show us cruel rape, snuffiness and brutality (in both cases you will be surprised how far it goes in Caligula II with this, if you can trace the uncut cut.) Although these scenes can be unpleasant in a documentary film about a person's career, hey, he did it ... Also, I would like to see more interviews with people Joe worked with ... Maybe it was just me that I wanted to see how Laura Gemser looks these days ... I'm still thinking That she is a goddess and one of the sexiest women to ever grace the genre.
