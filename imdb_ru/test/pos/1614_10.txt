I first saw Death in Venice (1971) about 15 years ago, I found her deeply touching and often thought about it. After seeing it again a few days ago, I realized that it was close to the top of the great works of the cinema. Almost without dialogue, he fascinates the viewer with excellent cinematography, excellent play and, above all, Mahler’s music, without which the film simply cannot exist. <br /> <br /> “Death in Venice” is a stunning adaptation of Lucino Visconti by Thomas Mann's short story about a famous composer (in the novel he was a writer, but makes him a composer in a film, was a great idea that works perfectly) based on Gustav Mahler), who travels to Venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures. His search for beauty and perfection seems to be complete when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty. Ashenbach (Dirk Bogard) follows the boy everywhere, never trying to get close to him. The boy, Tadzio, belonged to a very rare creature with a mysterious and incomprehensible power that captivates you, enchants, conquers you and makes you a prisoner. Ashenbach became one of the prisoners of Tadzio's charming spell. He became addicted to him; he fell in love with him. Was it a blessing or a curse to him? I think both. He died of an unattainable, impossible, but beautiful love, the goal of which was perfection itself. The last image captured by Ashenbach’s eyes was the silhouette of a boy surrounded by the sea and golden sunlight. Nothing can compare with the beauty and charm of the scene, and taking it with you to the grave is a death that you can only dream of. If he could, Ashenbach would probably say: “I could testify one of the persons of perfection, I could not bear it, but I was chosen to find out that it exists here in this world, and now I can die in the world because it happened to me " and summarizes the thought that as soon as you are blessed to meet beauty, you I can come up with hundreds of films that perfectly use classical music, but nothing compares to “Death in Venice.” I dare to say that Mahler’s music is her main character — it will change and sound differently in depending on what is happening on the screen. It sounded triumphant when Ashenbach returned to Venice, to what he considered his happiness, but turned into his death. It sounded gloomy when he first entered Venice from the sea. You can hear so many different feelings in it - tenderness and adoration, confusion and self-loathing, worship and longing, but always - LOVE, which gives the purest happiness and breaks hearts (literally). The film for the viewer is similar to what a boy was like for an aging composer / writer / artist. We are fascinated and fascinated by his strength and beauty, just as Achenbach was the boy's mysterious charm.
