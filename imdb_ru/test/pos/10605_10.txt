The film Haggard is one of the funniest films of all time. It features the cast of CKY (movies) and also has an excellent soundtrack. If you have seen CKY or Viva La Bam, you will notice that all (of these two) are in it. Including Bam's parents and many other people. <br /> <br /> The story of how Ryan Dunn Glauren’s girlfriend (Jennifer Rivall) cheated on him and he is trying to get revenge on her. He does this when Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dikamillo) destroy her house. There are many different characters with many different stories. <br /> <br /> Great music on the soundtrack. Groups like Him & Her, CKY, Gnar Kill, Daniel Lioneye. Iggy and puppets pop, and a new order. <br /> <br /> If you don’t like Viva La Bam or CKY (movies), I doubt you will like it. If you really like this stuff ... this film is great.
