I watched it because my friend said that we can try it when my father asked if we would watch it. I didn't want to, because it was such an old film, how could it be good? I finally looked with this friend and my father. my friend and i loved the movie. the songs are great, the actors were great, and we are crazy about that. I think it shows, although it is from the time of the pope, it does not mean that it can not be a good movie. I bought the film not so long ago, after seeing it on TV, I put it on a lot and sang along with the songs. I even watched it with my classmates at my birthday party. It is a good, good, and sometimes funny movie. <br /> <br /> If you do not try, you can not say that it is bad. even if you think not, I'm not going to watch a movie from the time of my father. Try the first part of the movie, which you can always stop watching if you don't like it. I really recommend it, it's great !!
