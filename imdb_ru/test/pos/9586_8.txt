I always like to watch this cartoon when Sylvester tries to catch Tweety on the train, not in the grandmother's house. This is actually a standard fare, but interesting, especially when Tweety pulls the emergency stop cord. One of my complaints about this is how carelessly the animators were on the train. When you watch it again and again, like my little boy (who loves trains, which is why he liked it so much), you start to notice some things. <br /> <br /> In this short statement, the Baggage car position changes on the train, on the 3rd, 4th or 5th, but not at all in long frames. The engine has either the number 651 or 814, or it does not exist at all. The coal tender has either the number 99 or the letters "S.P. & Q.R." on it or not numbers or letters at all. Trainers carry "S.P.Q.R." without “&” in long frames, and then in close-ups - “Southeast and West”. <br /> <br /> All this does not interfere with the history, but the details of the production were clearly not dealt with very carefully. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, this cartoon is one of my favorites with Sylvester and Tweety.
