Remember that this happened before the First Gulf War, which gave us the “Lessons of Darkness” by Werner Herzog. <br /> <br /> Le Dernier Combat is not “Sci Fi”. This is more like a judgment. I watched it at least a dozen times. This is truly a worthy companion to the Duke's "Lessons of Darkness": "And at this time people will seek death, but they will not find it, because death will run away from them." <br /> <br /> Someday Alas, maybe today, in Iraq. <br /> <br /> But back to Le Dernier Combat and be sure to follow up to the very last second of the film. I would not call it an “unexpected ending,” but this is what you will miss if you just assume that the end will not be anything more than what you have already seen.
