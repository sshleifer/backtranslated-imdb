It is not often that the show captures me right away; The recent random download of the pilot for the Surface made me stick to my chair for the full episode, after which I immediately went in search to find out everything I could about this wonderful series. To my chagrin, I learned that it was canceled after just 15 episodes, despite its high marks and extremely favorable reviews. Such a shame. <br /> <br /> Since then, I purchased the remaining episodes and found that the first 5 or 6 were among the best TVs I have ever watched. Just fantastic from beginning to end, and as another reviewer commented, I LOVED how they ended each episode with a huge finale. I imagine that I watch it every week, I would scream from the tension and just be captivated, desperately waiting for the release of the next episode. When I was growing up, I always heard that this was how television films were shot before, ending with a huge high-end to bring the audience back to the theater for the next episode. <br /> <br /> Well, it seems that for some reason or another costume decided to kill it, and, obviously, the people behind the show should have seen the inscription on the wall, because after episode 6 things will definitely turn to the worst. I would not say that the episodes are actually getting boring, but many plot elements are getting a little more boring, and I must say that the last episode really left me cheated. I just wish the show creators got a fair chance. * ONLY * another show that made me feel that way was the first season of Stargate SG-1, which just got a huge response, feeling very "truthful", inspired and made from the heart. “Surface” was a great show, and maybe one day a TV lover with good heels would see all the outpouring of emotions about canceling the show and bring it back. Hopefully at least. :)
