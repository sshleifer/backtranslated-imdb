Dirty War is one of the best political, state, and well-written television dramas in the past 25 years. <br /> <br /> The acting is great, the script is impressive. <br /> <br /> Diry War reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a nuclear, biological and radiological terrorist attack here on American soil. <br /> <br /> Dirty war should be turned into a major motion picture - it is so good! I highly recommend this great drama to anyone who wants to know the truth. <br /> <br /> This TV drama tells how British intelligence (MI5 and MI6) is trying to uncover a terrorist conspiracy and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims due to Englandâ€™s participation in the Iraq war. <br /> <br /> Scenes from different parts of London, England are also impressive. <br /> <br /> Dirty war is a must see !!!
