I am from Texas and live very close to Plano, where the real deaths occurred, so I can be a little biased, saying that “Lost” is a film that is simply impossible to get out of my head. <br /> <Stral, Phoenix and Paul play their characters very realistically. You sincerely believe that these are ordinary high school students who just turned out to be addicted to heroin. The drug content is also handled very graphically - although everything that happens in the film serves some purpose, and every moment the characters move down is heartbreaking. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone. As soon as you watch this, it remains with you!
