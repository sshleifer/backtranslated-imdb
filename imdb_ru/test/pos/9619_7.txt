I recently saw Grindhouse and viewed several films in Video USA that could be played in real cinemas in the city center in the 1970s. Hong Kong fighter "Five Fingers of Death" seemed just such a picture. Sound-like cartoony sound effects and quick transitions at first seemed a little distracting, but after a while I was so carried away by the story and characters that didn't bother me. Parts of the musical score sounded like the TV song "Ironside", which was later used in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill. Some scenes involving the hero's fianc√© seemed to border on a parody, but they were so short that they didn't spoil the movie. The most exciting parts include the tournament and several venues after that. Worth a look at kung fu fans!
