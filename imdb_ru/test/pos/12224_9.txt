I am constantly amazed by the networks in the USA. What's wrong with them? Another very promising show released after 15 episodes, and we don’t know what the hell is happening to everyone. I really enjoyed this show, and I am so annoyed that we will never know what happens to the characters and “monsters” from the depths. This show was all. Humor, suspense, action. What else do you need. Why pulled this stub? It just does not make sense. Buffy continued the series 7, as Charmed, and they were enjoyable, Surface, Invasion and Dead Like Me were even better. The fact that the show is not receiving terribly high marks does not mean that it is rubbish, and if they gave it a little longer, probably more people would catch it, and as a result they would get a big blow in their hands. One season simply does not give him enough time to gain popularity, and the networks are not yet ready to break free. They need to understand that, like fine wines and cheeses, they need time to mature. <br /> <br /> Bring the Surface and the Invasion back - P L E A S E !!!!!!!
