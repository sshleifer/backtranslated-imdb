I can't describe the feeling when about 20 years ago I had this stupid VHS roll in my hands. Somehow, I made my father rent it for me, and I watched it twice with my younger brother. Yes, we have nightmares. This film was originally rated as a PG in the USA; in many other countries, including Finland, it was limited to 18 or 16 years. The movie was intended for teenagers, but it must be the worst PG rated movie ever. There is no bad language or nudity in this, which is always the case. Originally made in 1981, it remained on the shelves for several years until release. <br /> <br /> This is an A-class B-film, a real, well-made 80s horror movie. A group of college girls decides to spend the night in a mausoleum, not knowing that supernatural evil is waiting ... <br /> <br /> You can almost smell the rotting flesh and feel the atmosphere of this film. This is obscene, totally stupid, but they just can no longer make these films. In this horror genre of the 80s a certain feeling is definitely felt. This one still remains rather creepy and interesting after all these years. <br /> <br /> Effects just seep by Ellis Boorman Jr. and Thomas R. Boorman. The effects of makeup play a big role in this film, otherwise it would be just a boring teenager slasher. <br /> <br /> Now it's finally available on DVD, and this is a special DVD release that also includes some additions. The track with comments is interesting. <br /> <br /> (Actually this version is not so special. Below the average transfer level on DVD, some glitches and scratches here and there) At first it was going to release Blue Underground, but unfortunately it was canceled so the Shriek Show released it without restoring the imprint. So sorry!) <br /> <br /> Great date-movie! <br /> <br /> Recommended !!! <br /> <br /> Note! I gave only 8 out of 10 because of “nostalgic values”, otherwise 6 out of 10
