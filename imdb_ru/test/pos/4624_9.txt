2:37 is an intense and exciting drama that has some similarities in pitch and plot with films such as “Hooligan”, “Elephant” and “Children” (although, from my point of view, 2:37 is an excellent film for these three). Before watching. In the film, my expectations were neutral, but in the end I got a very good impression due to the intellectual script, the excellent direction of Murali K. Talluri and the excellent performances of a group of young actors. <br /> <br /> Sporadic incidents of school violence around the world have inspired many films, TV shows and books that claim to find and predict the external or internal causes of these unbridled expressions of insurrection, discontent ... and especially insanity. Some people may say that it is 2:37 too late for this artistic movement; however, I don’t think so, because this delay allowed the film to make a more artistic analysis, focusing on a situation with greater sophistication and intelligence instead of the obvious reaction of cruelty and longing that has soaked other films with similar stories. /> <br /> On characters 2:37 we can find cliches from children's films (from director and screenwriter John Hughes - RIP films to horror films for teenagers): a beautiful “princess”, a clumsy “nerd”, antipathetic athletes and t . e. It would be very easy to make them turn into empty caricatures, determined by their function in the script; but surprisingly, the script goes beyond stereotypes, turning them into real people with serious problems that, to a greater or lesser extent, can be found by anyone on their way to maturity. <br /> <br /> 2:37 This is a great movie, the only disadvantage of which is that the ending feels a bit affected, but which compensates for this with a lot of positive elements. It will be very interesting to see the next projects of Talluri, as he debuted with this film.
