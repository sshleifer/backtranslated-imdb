Well, this film was released on a workday at 230 in the morning. At first, the cute little actress who played Billy caught my attention, and after the first 15 minutes I was captured by the TV until the very end. It makes you stand on the edge of your seat, and then throws sly comedies during the most intense episodes. <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that the story was not significant enough to fill an hour and a half of the film. , causing some sequences to drag a little. However, it was still very interesting, and I recommended it to all my staff the next day.
