The warmest, most attractive film in its genre, “Those, Lips, Those, Eyes,” made me smile and cry, reminding me of the work needed to fulfill a dream, and the pain of disappointment. Hulce and Langella are great, and the story seems to be written by itself. David Shabera's brilliant screenplay (one of my favorites! - see “Warriors and Night Hawks” for more information ...) and beautiful scenery, shot on the spot (I think) in the summer theater where the story unfolds. You can not watch this movie and do not want to drop everything and get into the theater! Please check out this video if you can find it.
