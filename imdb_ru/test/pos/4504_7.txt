Can a movie be too true to the book on which it is based? Judging by the lengthy adaptation of the huge Khaled Hosseini seller in 2007, the answer is rather ironic: “yes.” Like many, I was delighted with the book, an impressive first attempt by an Afghan-American writer / doctor. So, obviously, were director Marc Forster (“Stranger Than Fiction”) and screenwriter David Benioff (“Troy”), who pay meticulous attention to the most significant details of the story during the 127-minute length of the film. Nevertheless, the solid tapestry of spiritual events in Hosseini’s novel often appears episodic and truncated, because Forster and Benioff sincerely try their best to remain true to the whole volume of history during time constraints. Part of the problem lies in the way Hosseini carefully used symbolic acts to provide literary, then and now symmetry to what is essentially a story of three actions, a technique that may seem somewhat contrived on the screen. <br /> <br /> However, the filmmakers do the most important things correctly, in particular, giving the viewer an intimate look at the hidden culture that is still being conveyed in CNN news reports, providing authenticity, forcing the characters to speak the Persian dialect of Afghan Dari language, and capturing the emotional intricacy of a complex narrative. The first part of the film was shot in Afghanistan in 1978 before the Soviet invasion and the possible capture of the Taliban. The focus is on the relationship between Amir, the son of a wealthy businessman named Bab, and the devotee Hassan, the son of a father’s servant. Bound by their mutual love for kiting, they are both thick as thieves, until the tragic event separates them irreparably. Unable to find the courage so natural to his father, Amir is crippled by a sense of guilt for not having saved Hassan from an unspeakable act committed by a trio of local hooligans. Forster makes the ethnic tension between Hazaras and Pashtuns in Afghanistan particularly palpable. <br /> <br /> After the invasion of Soviet troops in 1979, Amir and Baba flee to the United States, where the story develops after nine years. Fremont, California, a suburban enclave of Afghan immigrants. Baba boils down to working at a gas station and operating a flea market kiosk. Amir meets a local Afghan girl and marries. This is the least interesting excerpt from the film, since the Benioff appeal gives a brief push to supporting characters such as Amir Soraya’s wife, and, most importantly, Amir is portrayed as necessary as a restrained young man leaning down to her self-esteem. The last section breaks out twelve years later, when Amir, after the publication of his first book, returns to Afghanistan, dictated by the Taliban, in order to save the son of Hassan from the Taliban, as a means to atone for his cowardice a few years earlier. In this part of the story, real anxiety and fear arose as shocking revelations and old acquaintances returned to haunt Amir during his journey. <br /> <br /> British Egyptian heritage actor Khalid Abdullah (the main hijacker in United 93 plays the central role of Amir as an adult, and this is a difficult role because he has to fully express his constant sense of shame and reduced self-esteem. Other professional actors live better - Sean Toub (savior Tony Starka Insan in the current Iron Man) as business partner of Baba Rahim Khan, who holds the key to the truth; Atossa Leoni quietly touches Sorai; brings to Baba honors and dignity. Three young non-professionals were hired from the school system of Kabul to play key children's roles, and they are all pretty good. Ahmad Khan Mahmudzade with sad eyes will break your heart like a young Hassan, especially in a destructive scene in which grenades are thrown. It’s fair to say that his performance is on a par with young Enzo Steiola in classic "cycling orah "Vittorio de Sica. <br /> <br /> Technical aspects are well done, in particular, pure cinematography by Roberto Schaefer (convincingly shows western China) will replace Afghanistan), Alberto Iglesias spectacular score and even CGI effects demonstrating kites in a stormy flight. There is a 2008 DVD a solid set of additions, starting with an insightful commentary from Forster, Hosseini and Benioff, although some of their dialogues seem rather compelling. It includes two functions: the first is the 14-minute “Words from the kite runner”, which are devoted to Hosseini’s connection with the history and development of the novel, and the second, the 25-minute “Images of the kite runner”, a more standard backstage look at the production. The complements original theater trailer, several announcements and PSA from Hosseini on how to help the Afghans in their current time.
