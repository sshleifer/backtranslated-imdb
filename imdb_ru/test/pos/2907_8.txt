It appeared earlier than the “Ten Commandments,” “the land of the pharaohs,” “Ben-Hur,” and today it is overlooked. How unfair! Judging by the giant novel of Micah Waltari, it does not reduce the price of it! did it right (i hope it will be done someday). Valtari, whose message is essentially Christian, remains intact (the other of his books The Secret of the Kingdom (first part) takes place after the death of Christ in the Holy Land). <br /> <br /> “Egyptian” is an uprising of monotheism, close to Christianity, long before Christ: Pharaoh (Wilding) is a kind of Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that there is no true kingdom in the material world : he asks to return good to evil! And he has students who will eventually turn into martyrs (the scene when Simmons and other fans of the Sun God visually stun, looks like some kind of pagan ballet). the priests, on the other hand, this new religion will mark the end of their influence on the masses, and that is why they are looking for a strong (mature) person who could lead the army against the Hittites, as well as against their dangerous compatriots. Another religion, or, say, non-religious, is Shinouhe (Purd), who does not believe in anything for two hours (the sequence of grains of sand is absolutely sensational and raises the entire film much higher than the average Basques !!) <br /> <br /> There is another exciting side: the film looks like a bright melodrama. only for the script (in particular, the last revelation of Sister Faro (Tirny), which precedes the “ten commandments” by two years), but also the magnificence of cinematography: Viviani in his book about Curtis speaks about the atmosphere of Madele, blue and gold, especially in scenes, in which the prostitute (Darvi) participates, who reflects on her reflection in the water of her bath, the highest narcissism. Around the hero, all the characters appear, disappear, appear again, but when they appear again, they go their own way, and all the plots are combined with an unsurpassed skill. In addition, as often happens in “modern” melodramas, the story is a long memory, framed by two short episodes in which Shinoukh recalls an old man who remembers. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful sword and sandals, which had a strong influence not only in America, but also in Europe, especially in Poland, where Jerzy Kavalerovich sent a fascinating "Pharaoh" (1966), who was much obliged to Curtis.
