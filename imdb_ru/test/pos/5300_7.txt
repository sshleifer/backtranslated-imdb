The last and eighth Hayao Miyazaki film for the studio Ghibili "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the rock by the sea) - a surprisingly cheerful and creative look at childhood. At a time when Disney / Pixar’s CGI masterpieces seem to dominate the animation of the movie, it’s nice and pleasant to know that Miyazaki still relies on traditional cartoon animation to tell her enchanting and charming stories. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the friendship between the magical sea sprite / goldfish and the human child she encounters during a curious journey to see the world of people. The human child, Sosuke (Doi Hiroki), lives in a small house on a rock overlooking a small port city in southern Japan (on Seto island), where he lives with his young mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko). Sosuke calls the strange golden fish "Ponyo" and delivers her to the kindergarten / nursing center where Lisa works. Nona is definitely not your typical goldfish, and soon it begins to adapt and take on human aspects (it develops human speech and an appetite for ham meat), taking blood from a cut on Sosuke's finger. <br /> <br /> However, as soon as Sosuke and Ponyo begin to develop a connection, Ponio is taken by her father Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), a former man who rejected the surface world and is now trying to collect and develop magic elixirs taken from the sea that help him restore and rejuvenate the oceans of the world. <br /> <br /> Ponyo’s desire to become human has become so strong that Fujimoto can no longer contain her, and she takes on more of a human appearance and breaks out of her water world home and returns to Sosuke. <br /> <br /> During his breakthrough, Ponyo unintentionally releases the cache of Fujimoto's magical elixirs, which releases all sorts of magical sea creatures that cause a violent storm in the seas surrounding the city of Sosuke. Desperate to allow the revolt of Pono, he soon turns for help to his beautiful wife, Pono's mother - the water element, Mother / Lady of the Sea (Amami Yuki). <br /> <br /> Similar to his previous films, Miyazaki’s Gake No Ue No Ponyo covers various topics on ecology and environmental protection, this time with an emphasis on the health and vitality of the world's oceans. The opening sequence sometimes sobers when Ponyo encounters a submerged ship that cleans the ocean floor, revealing mountains of trash and rubbish. One can understand the anger and frustration of Fujimoto, who has tried his whole life to repair the damage caused by civilization to his oceans, but at the same time find it a difficult and almost fruitless thing. <br /> <br /> Enough can not be said about the wonderful animation in this film. This is sometimes strange and outrageous, but at the same time charming and curious. Obviously, Miyazaki wanted to grasp the meaning and style of children's imagination. The artistic style looks like pencil / pencil drawings and is amazingly colorful and whimsical. This is similar to how a children's color book comes to life. <br /> <br /> Children's actors Nara Yuri and Doy Hiroki do an excellent job in the role of Ponyo and Sosuke. They bring charming charm into their roles. Nara Yuri, in particular, sounds so damn cute as Ponyo, which is not surprising that Sosuke Doi falls in love with a magical girl. The former girlfriend / campaign model and actress Yamaguchi Tomoko (Shichinin No Otaku, Machaon) is also very good in her role as a modern mother Sosuke, Lisa. At first I was a little embarrassed by her character, because at first I thought she was Sosuke's older sister. It also did not help that Sosuke continued to call her “Lisa” and not his mother, but I think this is probably a sign of the times and an indicator of the modern Japanese family (in the anime series Crayon Shinchan, Shinnosuke also refers to his mother name). The 80's comedian Tokoro Joji sounds completely different than the serious Fujimoto, but wisely doesn’t make his character seem like a caricature or stupid. While we don't recognize his character anymore, former pro-baseball player and actor Nagashima Kazushige (who portrays Sosuke Koichi's father) also provides good voice acting. The opening theme of "Umi No Okasan" by Japanese soprano Masako Hayashi is simply beautiful and exciting. Unlike Fujimaki Fujioka and Nozomi Ohashi "Geke No Ue No Ponyo", the theme is easy and fun, and evokes images of traditional Japanese nursery rhymes. During one brilliant sequence, the soundtrack acquires an almost Wagnerian opera sound with music that sounds like Die Walküre. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not perfect and suffers from moments when the central story of Ponyo and Sosuke overshadows some of the stunning fantastical images of Miyazaki. I also wanted more time to explore the history of Fujimoto and the relationship between Sosuke and his father. <br /> <br /> For example, Kiki / Mayo No Takkubin Delivery Service, Howl’s Moving Castle, Princess Momonoke / Momonoke Hime and My Neighbor Totoro / Tonari No Totoro, Gake No Ue No Ponyo "- This is another classic Miyazaki, which is a wonderful feast for the eyes. As a modern tale of the day, the film tells about the eternal story of friendship and love, which will surely be appreciated in the coming years.
