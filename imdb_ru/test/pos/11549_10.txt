I tried to agree on why there were so many bad reviews about this film, while the vast majority of reviews were rated from 7 to 10. The reason may be that this film is difficult to describe in a positive review, although few have done it quite well. This film is confusing, depressing and has no happy ending. I still gave Pola X a rating of 10, because for me itâ€™s mostly literature and art combined into a movie. This is really my favorite form of filmmaking. I have only seen two Carax films: this one and Mauvis Sang. As in this film, I am somewhat pretentious when I call it one of the best films of Karax, but this is so. Carax has a minimalistic style. If this type of movie you do not like and boring, it is better not to watch it. But Pola X was less minimalist than Mauvis Sang, so it was intense enough for a thriller - at least for my taste. I found it quite interesting and exciting. The two main roles perfectly coped with the acting. (I mean the main role and the young woman, whom he considered his half-sister.) Catherine D. is always gorgeous, but her role was not very big or significant in history. But everything worked great. I thought the cult things were great. Perhaps it was not very believable, but this is due to the fact that it is rather abstract. There is a lot going on in this movie. This is a very Freudian psycho-thriller.
