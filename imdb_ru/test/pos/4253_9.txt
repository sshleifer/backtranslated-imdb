When someone refers to the independent film industry in the United States, it is often concluded that this means that the filmmaker or the people behind the project had much more creative freedom and did what they wanted. This, in fact, is not always the case, unless someone is a firm “author”, and creative freedom is still accompanied by a warning that you need to find distribution in one of the independent divisions of major studios or when it is somehow selected for some kind of. low level deals at a standing film festival. But Putney Swope, Robert Downey Stra's film about a tough African American accidentally promoted to the head of an advertising guru in a production company, is * independent cinema, work combined with such things or “Night of Romero” The Living Dead and Cassavetes Lix at the same time do not get any typical studio spread, but cause waves, kick ass and take names in the movie world. For all his moments that are rough and rough, this is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> This is also a funny, very and painfully funny movie. Sometimes a sense of humor is just so ridiculous that it is almost impossible not to laugh, from the mere appearance of President Mimeo with his wife to the lines of dialogue from the advertisements that the Swap team brings together, like “I can't eat air conditioning” in a real “soulful” voice. He’s as smart as the audience he wants: anyone who has two brain cells can see that this work is not insulting or * too * shocking because it is meant to thunder in a cell, and she does it pretty well in the first five minutes. After it passed, Downey Sr. continues a kind of excitement, because he is a cinematographer who has nothing to lose: his main character is Fidel Castro, partly Isaac Hayes around 1972 (and yes, this is 1969 in the film) and partly harsh advertising an agent with a shooting lane, so that Mr. Spacely on the Jetsons looked kind. And do not forget these side characters, dear God. <br /> <br /> There are so many memorable lines and moments that are difficult to track. From maybe the funniest killing attempt in any movie to a Face-Off skin cream ad that includes lines that give South Park money for dirty mouths, or just a little with one guy from Jack W Hill’s films are played by the Muslim, who continues to destroy the Swap, and that boy with a nun who curses the storm and hits the Swap with a quick hit. This is a fairly direct message about the media and advertising, but there are also many strong moments when he just hits his head with a nail about racism in America, sometimes without having to do something more than a gesture, and sometimes with something HUGE, like black Types of panthers reaching this way around the Swap ad mode. And for low-budget production (I mean super-low, hence the comparison with the Night of the Living Dead and Faces) Downey got some really good non-union actors, and it's hard to imagine what some of them could have here for the first time. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that Downey's style does not make him perfect: he is rude, and sometimes too crazy and outdated for his own sake, and I am sure that I have not done so. I don’t understand which of the basic humor in advertising is because I’m from generation to generation after these ads went on the air (although Miss Redneck Jersey was definitely not lost to me). In general, although it is one of the best periods of time, it is a satire that stings, and a peculiarity with a predominantly black tint that knows all too well what is derived from excess energy, regardless of skin color. This, as someone might say, "good s ***".
