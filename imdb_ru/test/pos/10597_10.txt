Haggard doesn't even need to be rated, since he was never meant to be rated like films that won an Oscar, and it was never supposed that he won an Oscar (obviously). if you just look at some of the things that Bam and Bran tried to use, such as quick shots, this will be a movie that has something more than just a chock or a donkey (although this is also cool). For pure pleasure, I definitely give this film 10; almost every scene made me laugh until my sides hurt, like in the movie “Falcon Trail.” If you have not seen this, look and buy. Personally, my favorite character is Brandon (Falcone), he is so smooth, natural and casual that it is funny, he performs freestyle perfectly (with figures) and makes the most fun things - for example, a diamond mountain bike? Haggard is definitely a film that in general humor competes only with the leader and the dynamite of Napoleon.
