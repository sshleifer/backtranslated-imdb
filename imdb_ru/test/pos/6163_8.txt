The beautiful story of a romantic war that should have received more attention. Czech pilot playing the piano, gives the storyline. Flight recordings may not be enough for aviation lovers like me, but again, this is not really a thriller. Although this has nothing to do with the novel “Hunters” by James Salter, which became a film about F86 sabers pilots in the Korean War, “The Dark Blue World” looked like it, but it has more of a romantic element. In a sense, better than the “Battle of Britain,” since it does not depend on famous actors. Advise to watch this movie with a small amount of Czech beer and several Czech dumplings called kneldniky (sp).
