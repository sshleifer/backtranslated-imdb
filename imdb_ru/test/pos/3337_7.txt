Excellent entry in the RKO Saint series with a well-written original script, good camera work and transitions, good guidance for handling some of the plot twists, good editing to maintain a constant flow and good acting. George Sanders is courteous and witty. Jonathan Hale is just Inspector Farnak. Paul Gilfoyle plays a gangster who goes straight (and drinks milk) because he can't stand the pressure. He will be back in a later recording in the series. The story begins on an ocean liner heading to the US, where the Saint meets, but cannot contact Wendy Barry. In the end, she is inferior to the charms of the saint, but in the end breaks his heart. The saint helps Inspector Farnak to remove his name from the frame. Several bodies fall along the way. Good entertainment and above average for this type of movie. Watch it
