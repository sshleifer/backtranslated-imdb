... and this film easily exceeded my expectations. The fact that it was written and directed by Peter Dalle led me to believe that it was in the style of other films that I used to (and bored) to see it. In any case, I reluctantly went to see this movie and that I'm glad for. This material has humor and depth. 9 out of 10. Look!
