After reading the preview of this film, I thought it would be a disappointment, however after I received my region 1 DVD (the DVD was available before the movie was released in UK cinemas), I was pleasantly surprised that all the actors had strong performances This is a very nice movie. The fact that the script is rather weak means that you are not bogged down in history, and therefore the review factor is higher. I recommend this movie to everyone without exception <br /> <br />
