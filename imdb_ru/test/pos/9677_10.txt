When I first saw this show, I was 9 years old, and it immediately caught my attention when Stewie tried to call Lois by phone at the hotel. I laughed and kept looking. When the episode was finished, I recorded the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly. It separates itself from the Simpsons and other shows, say, the Cartoon Network, because the jokes are more mature, not too much, but this is TV-14 for a reason. A quick movie is cut out after each highlight, and the cute, funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special. Talented Seth MacFarlin is the creator and voice of many characters in the series. A good themed song and a crazy family, in which there is always something funny, make this my favorite cartoon Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Check out this fun stuff.
