Mishima: Life in four chapters is an art house biography about Yukio Mishima, a famous Japanese writer who looks like Paul Schrader Travis Bickle's earlier character (Taxi Driver): both are lonely people who are looking for their place in society and when they realize that the world does not need them, they are trying to destroy the surrounding universe. <br /> <br /> If you want to learn about Mishima's life, then you will not find much information, because it shows that he did not live a very interesting life (except for the last day), but if you want to understand his personality then this is the best film of its kind, since most of the film is a screen version of his novels and also provides guidance to his thoughts. This film shows that Mishima was a man who witnessed the fall of Japanese culture, which he loved very much, and with his final act he tried to preserve tradition and prove to himself that he was a real warrior, but he understood that as a Man, he was just a man not able to change events.
