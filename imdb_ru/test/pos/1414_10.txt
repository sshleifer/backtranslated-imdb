Introspective look at the relationship between Hawking and the space-time contingent. This film tells about the laws of Galileo and Newton and their connection with Einstein's Theory of General Theory of Relativity. <br /> <br /> The film is methodically oriented, revealing the details of both the person (Hawking) and his work (Black Holes). Interviews with his family are too long, therefore, unfortunately, his theories and ideas are less developed. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass's soundtrack perfectly complements the film. Only one person could compose such obsessive star melodies (Jean Michel Jarre). <br /> <br /> In general, I highly recommend this film based on Hawking’s “pieces of wisdom” and his adequate explanation of the event horizon!
