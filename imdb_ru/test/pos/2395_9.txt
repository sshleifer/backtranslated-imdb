Eddie Monroe is Hooooot. He's a great actor, and I can be his girlfriend any time. He is so good. I was so sad at the end. I'm not going to ruin the end, but wow. The girls are so angry. His girlfriend was wrong. If Eddie were my man, I would never neglect. These Thugs were creepy. The moral of the story is - Do not trust anyone. Your friends will hurt you if they can. Oh, and Eddie tell your girlfriend that you're mine, she should move ova! I would suggest watching a movie. What for? Bekasur, I said so. He did not take his eyes off the screen. My sister liked that too, so I’ll see him again, because now my friends want to see him, and it’s worth seeing twice. Peace, happy new year!
