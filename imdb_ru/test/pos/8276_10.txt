I was - unlike most reviewers - not born in the 80s. I was born on May 14, 1994. Despite this, my life was in the style of the 80s. When other children had game consoles, I played Zelda on my NES, etc. Now this film has a special place in my heart, despite the fact that at the time of writing this review I was only 15 years old. Because of my early childhood, I watched many TV shows in the style of the 80s and saw a lot of films that other children have not seen, and this film was one of them and also one of the greatest ones. <br /> <br /> It starts in Los Angeles at the home of Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, Chipmunk’s adoptive father, hurries to get to the airport, going on a business trip to Europe. His taxis are almost there, and the Chipmunks help him collect things. While they are talking, Alvin expresses his desire to come with Dave and see the world (although technically Dave is going only to Europe, so for Alvin, obviously, only America and Europe qualify as “Peace”). David leaves the Chipmunks in the care of Miss Miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. Soon Dave goes to the airport, and the chipmunks stay home with Miss Miller. Later in the local cafe, the Chipmunks play the Around the World in 30 Days game against Chipetts (Brittany, Janette and Eleanor). After hitting Brittany after the crocodile ate his balloon from the sky, Alvin Geth argues with Brittany about who will really win the race around the world. Two diamond smugglers sitting at the next table, Claus and Claudia Fürstien, overhear their arguments and, in need of a safe way to transport their diamonds around the world, decide to deceive the children to deliver them for them. They organized a race around the world, where each team would have to pass a doll in its own image (secret with diamonds) during distribution around the world and get a doll in the image of the opposing team (secretly filled with payment for diamonds) in order to “change They were there". The winning team will receive a reward of $ 100,000. They do this because they believe that Jamal (an Interpol agent who has been wearing high heels several times) would never have suspected them because they are just children (however, this seems superfluous because the children in their travels do not you need to go through no security checks and never interrogate about dolls, I suspect that neither Klaus nor Claudia would have done this if they took the diamonds there personally.) And so the great adventure begins. This film is a classic, and I see no reason why someone would not like it. This is great animation and first-class voice acting, not to mention Kick-ass music (sorry for my French: P). My favorite song without the slightest doubt: "Girls and boys of rock and roll." An amazing rock song that can't be beat. This is also my favorite moment in the film. Other famous songs include “Getting Lucky” (“Extraordinary” for children's films, eh?) And “My Mother”, as well as “Wooly Bully” and “Off to see the world”. Not to mention the main theme of the film during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with “My Mother” still causes tears in her eyes. As for the song “Getting Lucky”, I didn't think about it at first, but when I got older and found out about life, it became clear that this song was a little thought-provoking. This song, along with the fact that animators insist that viewers know the color of the Chipette panty. This is especially noticeable in the scene in Egypt, when people from the Arab prince are chasing the chipsets, when Eleanor is leaning over the basket of a balloon and her skirt defies gravity. Although this does not affect the overall quality of the film, it is one of those inexplicable things, like, for example, why no one in the world seems to mind that chipmunks walk 4 feet tall and speak in unbelievable high voices and belong to them. just like any other child. Anyway, a bit later this scene Chipetts found diamonds in the dolls and decided to go find the Chipmunks and go back home. Director Janis Karman is refining this film because she and her husband Ross Bagdasaryan Jr. know the characters better than anyone else. They even make the Chipuette and Chipett voices. Ross votes for Alvin and Simon (and also for Dave), and Janice votes for all Chipett and Theodore. Speaking of male characters voiced by female actresses, Nancy Cartwright appears in this film (voice of Bart Simpson). She plays the role of an Arab prince, a very small but important role. The ending is, of course, happy. The scammers were caught, the loose ends are tied up, and the film ends when Children, Dave and Miss Miller go to sunset, Alvin complains that he did not receive his $ 100,000 reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he finally screaming '' ALVIN! '' And the screen turns black <br /> <br /> Classic ending, by the way. I hope you found my review of this film useful, and if you have not seen this movie, give it a watch, it costs money. This nostalgic classic of the 80s gets 10 points out of 10. <br /> <br /> “Go ahead”, don't you know! we will never stop believing now "
