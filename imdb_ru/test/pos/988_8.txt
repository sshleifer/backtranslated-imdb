This is the workshop part of filmmaking, with many themes that boil and occasionally simmer in these warts, and everyone learns the bohemian, self-indulgent years of the poetâ€™s war, which cover the aerial bombardment of London and the outer calm of the Welsh coastal retreat. - the boundaries between friendship, lust and love, devotion to art and experience in comparison with practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egoism against heroism and self-sacrifice and many others. A mature, subtle scenario that offers and sometimes focuses on the dramatic accents underlying tensions is well served by ideal actions (except for the strange inappropriate smile that Keira Knightley is inclined to, although perhaps under the guidance of this time, as often characters)). But above all, the exquisite visual design of every moment with inventive and elegant use of close-ups, camera perspective and lighting, including pointillistic scenes from an artificial home cinema, is a miracle and a joy to contemplate. You look at Bertolucci as well as you look at Bertolucci, but the relationship here is more convincing, and the story is more interesting than some of the works of this master. Nowadays, this is a very rare type of film - it holds attention and evokes emotions, without giving up artistic integrity and yielding to manipulative surface labels.
