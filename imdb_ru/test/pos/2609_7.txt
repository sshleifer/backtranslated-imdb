I could not believe that the guys from the Adult Swim came up with this character. I laughed for days, just thinking about this show. Finally, after seeing the pilot, I think I will stay for a few more episodes. Assi is pretty funny, and the whole team of police show characters is near, but Assi is hard to understand, and that is a little frustrating. Much of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a walking ass, in which there is nothing but legs that wear athletic garter socks and feet with traditional wing tips. Assy drinks too much and "plays by the rules," you guessed it. The only other fun moments are the Assy, which takes many, many people and spends time at home in the bathroom. It's not funny with squid, but itâ€™s worth a look.
