Italian Work is a real blast to watch. This is really an entertaining movie that you watch just for fun. It is not hard with drama or emotional arm twisting, there are no cosmic statements about life in it, and this is not violence and not a layman. This is just a fun movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers flying through the crowded streets of Los Angeles and the fascinating performance of a stereotypical computer scum (playing Set Green), I had a lot of fun watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Special thanks to background music. They really set the master tone for such a film, so thin, but keeps you on the edge when necessary. Apparently, many musicians have contributed to the music, and I think this is the coolest part of the film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Not impressive, but a great movie that can be watched at the end of the movie. lousy day at the office. <br /> <br /> Barques
