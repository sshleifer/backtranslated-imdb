My mom as Gone with the Wind, as far as possible. She has collectible plates, Madame Alexander Rett and Scarlett dolls, GWTW Christmas decorations and even the GWTW cookbook! My sister and I saw only fragments of GWTW, but we knew the whole plot by heart. On a whim, my sister bought this mini-series, thinking that my mother would like it, and we asked them after we had flipped through the novel a little. <br /> <br /> Yesterday we decided to look at Gone With the Wind and Scarlett. We started GWTW around 2:30 pm and finished it at 6:30. We started Scarlett right after. My mom usually goes to bed around 10:00, she finished with us before 1:30 to finish it! We were chained! I love how the movie starts at Melanie’s funeral, right where Scarlett stopped saying, “I’ll think about it tomorrow.” Scarlett does not stay long in Georgia, she runs to Charleston in her quest to bring him back. Rhett is unhappy when he finds Scarlett in his house, so he goes to the family plantation. Scarlett, being Scarlett, follows him, and they finally agree to postpone their quarrels for a while to keep the gossip at bay. Rhett begins to enjoy her company again and takes her in her boat. A storm comes and they drown. He helps her swim to the shore of some island. Frightened that she died, Rhett is worried until she wakes up. When she does, they both become visible and make love. Scarlett wakes up the next day back in Charleston, but Rhett is gone and writes that he thinks it will be better if they never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Scarlett is heartbroken, and when she does, she does something stupid, in which case Ann Hampton sees her, going to the hotel room alone with Ashley. Nothing happens, but her reputation is stained, so Scarlett goes to Savannah with her two aunts. Soon, she discovers that she is pregnant, and decides to wait for the right moment to inform Rettu. While in Savannah, she meets many of her relatives, O'Hara, and becomes like a cousin, in particular, Father Colum. Soon, she receives a divorce notice from Rett, and then decides that she will never tell him about her child, just to make fun of him. Typical Scarlett. <br /> <br /> She decides to go to Ireland to make sure that Rhett can never find out about her condition. She meets many more relatives and buys the beautiful home of the ancestors of Ballyhar. During this time, Rhett cares for Ann. On Halloween, when Scarlett finds out that Rhett remarried, she begins to work that night. <br /> <br /> The film moves a year later, and Scarlett is very happy with her beautiful daughter Kat. She is being pursued by Lord Richard Fenton, who is truly an evil man, forcing a young girl named Mary Boyle to sleep with him. Scarlett meets Rhett and Ann again at a horse fair. After the traffic accident, Scarlett talks to Ann and learns that she and Rett must have a child. Frustrated again, Scarlett leaves and goes to Dublin with Fenton. There, she develops a relationship with him, as I said, she does nonsense when her heart is broken. <br /> <br /> Mary Boyle discovered that she was pregnant and went to Colum for help. The priest convinces Fenton to help the girl, and Fenton kills him after Colum threatens to tell Scarlett. Fenton convinces Scarlett to go with him to London to avoid her grief over the death of Colum. Mary asks to go with her. Returning to Charleston, Ann died of yellow fever. It became clear that she had never given birth to Rhett. <br /> <br /> In London, Scarlett sees the true colors of Fenton after he hurts her when she is not in the mood to sleep with him. Fenton rapes her after she tells him that she never wants to see him again. She falls unconscious after and when she wakes up, Fenton was stabbed to death. Scarlett is accused of killing him. <br /> <br /> Rhett hears about this and rushes to England with Sally in tow. Fearing the gallows, Scarlett has no choice but to tell Rettu about their daughter. Rhett is angry with her for keeping such a secret, but remains to help her. Mary Boyle, the real killer, could not be found. Scarlett is found guilty, but Mary finally comes to declare her innocence. After promising to help Mary, Scarlett leaves with Rätt for Ireland, because, as he says, “the time has come to meet my daughter.” The scene where he sees Kat for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, Rhett sees how much Scarlett has changed, and they finally completely reconciled and admit that they still love each other. <br /> <br /> When I saw GWTW, I would say that yes, Vivian Lee was Scarlett’s best, but I liked the Scarlett character in this film than in the first one. The reason is that in GWTW you don’t know why you like Scarlett. She is so cruel to Rettu, haughty and spoiled, but you like her lively spirit. In Scarlett you see how much she has changed. Oh, she is still on the lap of luxury, but she is no longer arrogant. You see how she becomes a real mother for Kat and a generous man for the poor people of Ireland. Joan Wally copes with this new Scarlett game. Timothy Dalton is not Clark Gable, but sometimes you swear you see the original Rhett in him. <br /> <br /> If you just sit back and don’t compare Joan Wally and Timothy Dalton with Vivian Lee and Clark Gable, you will surely enjoy this movie. This is a chance to compare Scarlett yesterday, with which she becomes after "tomorrow."
