My friend asked: “Is it necessary to be pro-euthanasia in order to love this film? Is it a mistake of the film that most quadrileggies want to commit suicide? ”Interesting questions. <br /> <br /> As far as I understand (correct me if I am mistaken), there is only one sick four-footed who wanted to end his life in “The Sea Within”. I think Ramon Sampedro also talked about this in the film. It is he who wants to die. It is he who fights for his right to decide his death. He speaks for himself, not for other four-legged ones. Although his innovative work, depending on someone else's perspective, may prove useful or harmful to four-legged in the future, his main goal is personal. But the one thing that this film does (my opinion anyway) is that it makes us viewers ask themselves the leading questions my friend asked so briefly. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing of The Sea Inside, I went home in a controversial blur. I struggled to come to terms with this annoying concept; why does ramon want to die? Considering the love, care and sacrifices that so implicitly shower Ramon around the people around him, why does he stubbornly cling to his disastrous decision? Then, on my second viewing, a common thought between Ramon and the lawyer entered my mind. This threw a noticeable observation: "... complete dependence occurs due to proximity." Most people crave such intimacy. Of course, how much we value such “needs” depends largely on the person. <br /> <br /> As a person with sensitivity to the family, I strongly sympathized with the educators in this film. Why can't Javier consider sacrifice and love from his family and friends? Is he blind to all this? I think not. Therefore, the miracle of the Sea inside is his insightful image of a very humanistic tug-of-war. When we are faced with the care of a healthy but incapable loved one who has expressed a calm, conscious and rational intention to die, what then to do right? Is the care and maintenance of this loved one against his will a pious gesture? Does it show the value of our love? Or does it just soothe our "selfish" fears of irreparable loss? With such a great understanding that caregivers are inherent, would not their invalid accusations, subject to the complete dependence of other people on survival, also be a forgotten act of the victim? Rhetoric or not, how much is "dignity" for a person? To live (or die) with dignity - is it a privilege or a right? If we really care and love a person, should we also respect their possible decisions in life (as in the case of death)? A stream of questions that the film may have asked, the answers to which I am not able to give. <br /> <br /> In our striving to intellectually differentiate the virtues for life or choice, we run the risk of ignoring the gray sea, which covers the most affected people, those who care for them, and those they care about. Therefore, the “Sea within” tried to present a subtle, but complex dynamic of relations between them. Intuitively, this film understands one thing; that the nature of the "victim" is never one-sided. In this tug of war, we must strive not to win the controversy, but carefully observe and, I hope, determine who is the “stronger” side who will make this sacrifice. <br /> <br /> “The Sea Within” is a sobering film. This opened my eyes to things that I did not want to see. And for that, I'm grateful.
