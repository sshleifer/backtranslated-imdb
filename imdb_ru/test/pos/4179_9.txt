The fact that this film failed at the box office, and still struggling for the recognition it deserves today, is a pity, but still quite appropriate. Commercial suicide Monkeys, committed as a result of the creation of this film, is reflected in the metaphorical suicide that they commit on the screen. So brutally ruining their carefully constructed image as a useful American alternative to the Beatles boldly to such a degree of rashness, as well as the recognition that they are just pawns in the entertainment industry, literally trapped (in the film) in their own. artificiality. The television series Monkeys was not so ordinary, but HEAD is completely plotless ... although, in the end, there is some kind of circular logic in all of this. A surreal series of events, unbridled by a genuine storyline, in turn, fun and rather alarming. The biggest irony is that the Monkeys actually signed their death sentence as a commercial force at the time when they reached their artistic peak. Their psychedelic research has reached its zenith thanks to the HEAD soundtrack (all the songs featured in the film), which is one of the tentative albums of the sixties. The monkeys began to disintegrate after the failure of the box office of this film, but the HEAD serves as a noble heritage.
