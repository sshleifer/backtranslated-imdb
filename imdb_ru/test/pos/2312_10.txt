I lost count of the time I watched this movie, but I love it and find it very funny every time I see it. The facial expression, humor and time of jokes make it gorgeous. Characters, especially "Nitro", "Sonar" and "Stepanik", funny. I thought Grammar Kelsey, Rip Thorn and Bruce Dern did a great job. Actually, I think this movie was a great one. I think it should be released on DVD before I render my version of VHS.
