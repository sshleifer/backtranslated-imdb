I originally saw it at its premiere in the UK. I was hypnotized by this, and all this time I began to cry. I removed it from the TV for storage, but over the years it has been worn out. And the TV never shows it. Therefore, it was nice to know that True Movies own the copyright and show them on their channels. This time I burned it on a DVD to enjoy it again and again. <br /> <br /> Lucille Frey (the beautifully played Ann - Margret) discovers that she has cancer and is fatal. Her husband has arthritis, and although he loves, he is an alcoholic and will not be able to take care of his children after she leaves. Therefore, she needs to find new homes for each of her children before she dies. <br /> <br /> The game is at the highest level, the music is beautiful, and it has stood the test of time perfectly (it still makes me cry)!) If you ever had a chance, you would be silly to miss it. This is a wonderful movie! Must see for everyone !!!
