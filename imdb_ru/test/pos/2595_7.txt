... And there were quite a few. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t like this cartoon like so many others, partly because it was created during that period. I really prefer cartoons with Duffy and Bugs, which are about fifteen years ago. Many people will like it, especially to people who always find violence funny, caricatured or not. <br /> <br /> The main plot is quite well known for Looney Tunes: Elmer goes on a hunt, Duffy leads him to the Beetles and Duffy is shot instead. Also included are pretty clever and very interesting jokes (some do not improve the episode), ugly shooting and animation, which is a bit mediocre. The plot is mainly based on jokes - each joke supports the continuation of the episode. This way of plotting is not so unusual in Looney Tunes (of course, if you are very much like the coffin of Looney Tunes - or an avid lover - like me, then you already know that). <br /> <br /> For people who love everything about Looney Tunes and Daffy Duck and love the sound of what I said about it, enjoy Bunny Spice! <br /> <br /> 7 and a half out of ten.
