Despite the fact that HBO is made for cable cinema, it is a pleasant film and a breathtaking look at the snooty and duplicitous world of television. Allowing the viewer to look behind the scenes of the so-called late night talk shows in the early 90s, when Jay Leno and David Letterman fought for their desired place as the host of the Tonight Show. Katie Bates Bravo plays the role of Leno's mercurial manager Helen Kushnik, and you can feel sympathy for what Leno / Letterman endured at the hands of television crews. This is just as timely, given the recent events related to the unsuccessful ABC attempt to replace Nightline with Letterman. No matter how many times I have seen this film, I still enjoy the pleasure of watching it the same way I did it the first time. If it will ever be released on DVD, I would definitely add it to my collection.
