Golden Boy, in my opinion, is one of the anime sleeping / lost treasures. A sexy comedy about a young man seeking to find a niche in life, and he comes up with all sorts of odd jobs that for some reason make this pretty sexy girl who ultimately falls in love with him, but he really doesn't realize it! This is really something that you can easily skip if you are by name, but once you look at it ... it will fall for the comedy / stupidity that lies inside. Truly, the crime was committed, as a result of which only 6 episodes of OVA and a pilot film were released. However, be unique like this. I am surprised that it survived to produce so much. If you want to laugh with high-quality anime (100% CGI for free), watch this anime. A boy who can save the world one day ... or maybe not.
