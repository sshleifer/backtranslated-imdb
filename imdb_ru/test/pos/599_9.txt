Who doesn't love dolls ?! It is impossible to watch them without feeling warm, fuzzy sensations inside. So, I think the important thing is that this film seemed to very successfully capture what makes the dolls so special. I don’t remember the plot details very well, but I remember the different moments and characters in the film with love. In fact, the whole movie reigned nostalgic atmosphere, but, nevertheless, he was not shy. Refreshing for someone who may be too obsessed with meticulous details and technology; "Magic" surpasses all other things. “This is really what movies are made of. <br /> <br /> How does the film achieve these goals? Hmmm, good question! I'm at a dead end? We'll see. In fact, I feel that everything is quite simple. The filmmakers believe in their material and do not take it too seriously. I probably would not say that there are many truly inspired moments in the film, but there is a certain life in it (oddly enough, what many “real people” films lack). Zest You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. They also have a certain innocence about them, which makes them even sweeter. <br /> <br /> As a rule, I get the impression that the people who shot the film were simply not afraid to try what they thought was right for the time that gives it all quite freely. It seems like a really affordable and enjoyable extended jazz session. A lot of talent, little predictability and a lot of warm personalities. Cameos were, of course, a bunch of pleasant surprises, for example. Perhaps I do not feel that I have something to say about this, because I was half asleep when I saw this (and / or when I write this review). In any case, I sort of repeat myself here, but I really liked the feeling of the family that was in the film. Full of love, I suppose you could say. Again, there is a feeling of nostalgia, which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly. <br /> <br /> And once again, one of the best charms of the film is its very calm and hospitable atmosphere. As Nathaniel Hawthorne’s quotation that happiness is (like) a butterfly, so the film “Muppet” is doing very well, partially not trying to do it. The same with beauty, which is best not to reveal, not to touch, not to force or something like that. In any case, if it sounds stupid, I also think it was quite fun. <br /> <br /> In general, this film was very funny, touching and it was difficult not to smile with it. In addition, there is a lot of great music in it! It is strongly recommended to all people, both young and young in the shower.
