Recall that the version of "Blue Lagoon" in 1949 is not an original film, as many say. <br /> <br /> This story was filmed in the UK in 1923, immediately after writing the novel. No matter how much I wanted to see the 1949 version, I would really like the opportunity to see the real original release of this story on film. <br /> <br /> Of course, the 1980 film with Christopher Atkins, Brooke Shields and two young men were shot with beautiful cinema. The game did not seem so great when I first watched this film, but after I watched it several times ... it becomes obvious that two children growing up on the island without the help of adults will really have a simplified approach to life. ... whether in language, appearance or daily activities. <br /> <br /> Although some were lucky enough to watch the Blue Lagoon of 1949, I can't help but wonder if there is anyone living who can remember the release of this story in 1923 for the film.
