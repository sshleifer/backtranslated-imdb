The Australian public and the Australian film industry often hear complaints that there are not enough good Australian films around or that they are all the same. <br /> <br /> Well, in this case, this film is not an exact copy. other australian films. It is unique - it makes you laugh out loud, it makes you cry, and it makes you feel really good. <br /> <br /> The cast of this film is great, and the cast is second only to no one. Scenario and photography (color / light, etc.) Remarkable. But more importantly, this is a great movie. I do not want to talk about the plot, because I think that it is best to watch the movie, knowing as little about it as possible. Suffice it to say that this film will appeal to a wide range of viewers. Take your girlfriend, take your mother, take your friends - for a great evening. <br /> <br /> 10/10 !!!!
