This film inspired me to become a better person. In life, you do not know who you come across, and sometimes our prejudices make us mistakenly prejudice a person. I learned how to give a person the benefit of doubt thanks to this film. I also learned that tough love can build a strong person. Now I want to know where to find the soundtrack for the film. There are songs in this soundtrack that I have been trying to find for years. Can I comment on the game for a second. Jamie Foxx was outstanding. The man grew up to be an actor cast. Also Regina King's performance was amazing. If I can make a woman look at me the way she looked at Ray ... I can only dream. I took $ 18.00 for this movie, and I donâ€™t have much money, but I want to watch this movie again and again. This movie touched me.
