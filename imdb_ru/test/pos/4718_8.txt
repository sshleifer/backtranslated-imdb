It has long been time to make a film about a situation in an Asian country as ignored as Myanmar, and Hollywood is “Beyond Rangoon”. At first, I thought that Hollywood would dramatize the events of the 8888 uprising and would add to the traditional Hollywood spice of love like "Titanic" between the main character and the Burmese man, who turns out to be an old man. Fortunately, nothing like this was in place, which may also explain why the film was not financially successful. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film was honest before God and I was pleased with the accuracy of the events presented. Besides the fact that the filming was done outside of Myanmar in Malaysia and Thailand and that I missed exotic Burmese languages, I could not find many flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> You cannot blame the film for the desperation of people and the ensuing suppressive actions. This is after all the real events of the civil war. Hans Zimmer’s music is definitely a tragic USP adventure for people who have nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> I was only a year old in Rangoon (now Yangon) in this hectic time. When I heard that in my real life experience a film was made that I was too young for perception, I had to take a DVD, and, of course, I had no complaints about it, since this is a revelation for me. ,
