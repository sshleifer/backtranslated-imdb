A great party movie after the adventures of Bill and Tom, two school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum. Bill (Eric Stolz) prefers to live at ease, while his friend Tom (Chris Penn) does not take anything seriously except parties. When Bill leaves his mother's home to live on his own, he faces many problems — from his girlfriend, to his brother and his master. Meanwhile, his friend Tom is approaching to lower the rent, but continues to turn Bill’s life upside down. This film is a non-stop comedy from beginning to end, and my personal favorite. Throughout the film, the soundtrack features guitarist Edward Van Halen, as well as rockers Lee Wing and Ron Wood. 70s Pornstar legend Kitty Navidad also makes an appearance! A classic film from the 80s is worth a few views. Now all you need to do is the long-awaited DVD release! If you liked this movie, take a look at The Last American Maiden, similar to Wildlife. I appreciate both.
