There were numerous productions that talk about the development of the atomic bomb. Robert Taylor's film HIGHER AND OUTSIDE (really interdepartmental propaganda flag waving; if you believe it, you think that the army air corps represented by Paul V. Tibbits ran the whole show!) A little closer to the goal), and the BBC-TV series OPPENHEIMER with Sam Waterston in the lead role. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes the same approach as the BBC series, but expands it; he avoids the “Gee Whiz” technology of the Manhattan Project and focuses on human aspects; personalities involved in the work. Instead of focusing on Oppy, he covers a wide range of mythical, but rather typical people who were part of it. <br /> <br /> With reservations, Dwight Schulz coped well with the role of Oppie, introducing the dreamy academic Ivory Tower. he tries his best to link his contribution as a physicist with his inclinations to view the world in a wider social and moral context ... only to win this struggle through the primary thirst for personal power and glory. ON THE DAY AFTER THE TRINITY, it became clear that Oppenheimer saw himself as a “superior creature” by virtue of his vast, all-round intellectual skill. In the end, it was the fall of Robert Oppenheimer; he considered himself to be a kind of "Philosopher / King", a moral and intellectual leader who could (and rightfully MUST) "wisely" prescribe what is best for the rest of the world. development and deployment of nuclear weapons. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, wisdom does not dictate the actions of nations or the direction of events on a global scale. Wisdom does not bestow temporary strength. When he tries to use such a non-existent force (as Oppy discovered when he opposed the development of the “Super” hydrogen bomb), wisdom is ignored and driven out by those who REALLY possess force. <br /> <br /> I found myself guilty of the nature of Schultz in one way; his Oppy too closely and personally exposes himself to the Manhattan Project, despite the doubts and fears that have broken with his intellectual foundation. The real Oppenheimer would have to go the other way; at first he would have to come to a firm decision that the project would lead to final benefits. The ugliness that it produced on this path would be a side price that must be paid to achieve this ultimate good, and should be ignored ... at least until the end of the project, when there was free time to evaluate the profits and losses. Oppy clearly did this, and this led to his controversial post-war claims that science now knew sin, and that was knowledge that she could never lose. <br /> <br /> Although the project continued, such considerations MUST have been discarded if he wanted to maintain his sanity. <br /> <br /> Because of this ambiguity, the character of Schultz looks weak, scared of a little boy who NEVER could serve as the “Quick Break Coordinator”, and Oppenheimer unofficially called his post. <br /> <br /> Paul Paul Newman on General Leslie R. Groves is amazing, and the performance on bravura, if possible, is a LITTLE IMPACT. <br /> <br /> Groves was a civil engineer by education, but first of all he was a SOLDIER and a general to boot! He was used to DEMAND that everything went HIS ... an intensely movable, spoiled, spoiled child, who has hysterics under the hood of a hat, who respects his country and is not too proud to fall on his knees and pray. In other words, it is very similar to REAL (i.e. non-civilian engineers) soldiers, otherwise George Patton! Grove's MISSION is not only in the first place, it is his ONLY consideration ... be damned by feelings and ego, except for his PROPERTY, of course! <br /> <br /> Groves could not admit this, but he knew perfectly well that he needed Oppenheimer; The military rank of ANYTHING did not mean in the world of theoretical physicists. Oppy was a necessary link between the two worlds that he had to cross. <br /> <br /> Again ... I have to blame the script for this and the same reason. <br /> <br /> In reality, Groves is already OWN Oppy; if he had not done this, Oppie would never have been selected for this post. The story tells of MANY cases where other scientists, some of whom were as stellar as Oppenheimer, simply left the endeavors to Groves. At some point, Groves was so desperate that he offered to DRAW the physicists he needed! <br /> <br /> Groves' attempts to maneuver and control the Oppie movie were NECESSARY ... they only exist here as a dramatic device that really helps to make the atmosphere of the movie rather ugly. <br /> <br /> “Michael Merriman” Kusaka is a mixture of several real characters, but they are from a different time period. Several research accidents, similar to the one depicted, occurred during the POSTWAR weapon research. <br /> <br /> An overdose of Merriman creates another deformity in the film, but, in my opinion, it is necessary and quite accurate. People with a weak stomach will find it difficult to cope with hospital episodes; they are all TOO TOO real. <br /> <br /> The basic idea, which is met, but not convincingly enough, IMHO, is the big truth of the Los Alamos experience. The subscribed scientists were young, idealistic and naive, as well as talented. Most were on their first campus cover tour. For them, this project was a patriotic adventure that allowed them to practice experimental physics on a large scale without budget constraints or “excessive” bureaucratic control. <br /> <br /> The atomic bomb produced not only their brilliance, but also their young abundance. <br /> <br /> There is something to do here so that a thoughtful viewer would be extremely embarrassed because of this film. Similarly, if you filter out a Hollywood BS (in fact, there are not so many of them), this is probably a fairly accurate idea of ​​the interior of the Manhattan project.
