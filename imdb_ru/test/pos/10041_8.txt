Errol Flynn is at his best in the role of Robin Hood from the West, battling with military red tape, Confederates, Indians and single-wrestling business fraudsters, alone, to his great and final heroic end. Do not forget the ever reliable O. de Havilland as Lady Mary from the west. Never try to connect this story with facts and real people, it will not work. Just enjoy it, because no one ever claimed to shoot documentaries when Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn collaborated.
