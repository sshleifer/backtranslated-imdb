Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother, who has a working definition of the word “dreamer” and her solemn, pragmatic daughter. Adele, wanting to start all over again in a big city, takes them from Wisconsin to California. <br /> <br /> A decent, if not exceptional, or particularly memorable moment, with some serious and sad moments. It pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. The best he offers is a solid cast, and Sarandon and Portman do their job well, even if their characters are sometimes one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Maybe better, maybe worse. > <br /> I gave this seven out of ten.
