Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny tells a fictional story about the creation of the Tenacious D group and their quest to find Pick of Destiny, a guitar pick with supernatural abilities, made from the tooth of Satan himself (played by Dave Grohl) JB (Jack Black ) and KG (Kyle Gass), united by fate, must go to the rock and roll museum and steal the Pick of Destiny to become the greatest band on earth. The film is hilarious and delivers continuous laughter. Jack Black and Kyle Gass have been working great together, being real friends and colleagues for over 20 years. The film is partly musical. All (or most of) the music was written and performed by The D. All songs are new material, and many of them are classical. Soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. This movie will be greatly appreciated by Tenacious D fans, but if you are not a fan of The D, I still think you will like the movie. If you're a D fan, then you should watch this movie. The game is not as bad as you think, and laughter and rudeness never cease. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants their socks to swing and laugh as much as they have laughed for a long time. Beware of camels by Dave Grohl, Ronnie James Dio, Mitloff, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, John S. Reilly and Neil Hamburger. Also, stay tuned for the extra scene after the credits.
