The first episode "Man to Man with a Dean-Student", which just went on the air, was at least zero with most of the episodes of "The Dark Place of Garth Marengi" and brought me to My House. Hope this supports good fake horror work on my TV. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new breed of “alternative comedy” (I hate this phrase, but I'm too lazy to think of another.) Today comedians are on TV. I am glad that on a trip of local DVD vendors today, “The Dark Place of Garth Marengi” was sold out in all directions. Even from his short stay in Nathan Barley, I knew that Aioad was a serious talent, and I’m sure he would be great like Dickson Bainbridge in Mighty Bush. In the spirit of these programs, I also found it necessary to expand my review to ensure a place in this public domain.
