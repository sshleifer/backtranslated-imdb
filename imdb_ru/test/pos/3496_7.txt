Ali G's character works brilliantly in a comedy show, but it doesnâ€™t work like that in a movie. <br /> <br /> Don't misunderstand me - this is a very funny film Full of sharp, witty dialogues that beautifully depict modern British chavs, while providing the viewer with a fun, albeit unreal story. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with this film is that the script and content is fantastically brilliant, or it is awkward to watch. When I say embarrassment, I don't mean ridiculous embarrassment a la Office or Extras, but rather, you would like them not to include it in the final version. One example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the end of the film to the tune of "This is how we do it." Whenever I watch a movie, I stop the DVD when it talks about the end, and leave it at that. <br /> <br /> In general, Ali G Indahouse is a good movie worth seeing a couple of times. The script is pleasant to some extent, and there are no problems with acting. However, refinement is the key word here. <br /> <br /> Ali G is the best TV program. Borat is the best movie.
