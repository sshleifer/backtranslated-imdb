A refreshing black comedy featuring the best Australian characters. Just like Lok Stock and 2 “smoking barrels” captured the funny side of the London gangsters, two hands burst through the underworld of Sydney. It would not be so funny if it were not so close to the bone. <br /> <br /> Australian classic. If Australia could pull more of these rabbits out of her hat, she could really have a film industry to watch out for.
