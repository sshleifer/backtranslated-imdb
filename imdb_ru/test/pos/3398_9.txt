This commentary discusses the "Book I of the North and the South", referring to the period 1842-1861. <br /> <br /> 19th century US history is most often identified by people with a civil war (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion, because it was the civil war that put the Union to serious test; it was a civil war that made Americans understand how precious it was to live in peace; finally, it was this period that finally put an end to the shameful system of slavery. <br /> <br /> From the very birth of movies, people appeared who adapted this time to the screen. D.W. Griffith, in the early 1900s, made his unforgettable Birth of a Nation. However, the most famous film about the collision between north and south is still, I believe, Gone With the Wind (1938). Unfortunately, fewer people know the great series based on the novel by John Jakes "North and South." This is the best TV show ever created, and the time spent watching it is really valuable. I recorded it on my video from Polish television many years ago and since then I returned to it with great pleasure. What for? <br /> <br /> First, the whole story is deeply rooted in historical reality. Two families, Manes from South Carolina and Hazards from Pennsylvania, represent two completely different lifestyles. Despite this, friendship unites them. However, what they are experiencing is the struggle of all people: friendship that was attacked by the “truth” of “political correctness”, love that was attacked by hatred of the “legitimate spouses”, and softness by the power of “social heroes”. Orri Man (Patrick Swayze) - my favorite character - one who finds love and quickly loses it; someone who cares about friends, but political fanatics get in their way and destroy much. Finally, he is the one who sees the tragic future of his land, but he can do nothing with the inevitable fate of the south. His friend, George Hazard, is in many ways similar, but sometimes he has a stronger character. It is he who shows Orry that, although there are tragedies, he must get up from despair and live, because life is the most valuable thing we have. Although they represent two different lifestyles, their friendship is stronger than any prejudice, politics, or conflict. <br /> <br /> Other characters are also particularly well developed. There are villains such as Justin Lamotte or Salem Jones who are truly evil, but most people are ambiguous, as the nature of humanity has always been. Charles Man is at first full of rebellions, prone to fights, but later he learns to be a true southern gentleman, for whom southern pride is not bold words, but above all bold actions. Virginia Hazard is the most fanatical side of the abolitionist movement, seeking to condemn slavery and punish the owners of "black tribal farms." Her marriage to Grady seems to be a symbol of equality, but also a symbol of rejection of the politics of the south. Two interesting characters - the sisters Orry, Brett and Ashton - sisters, in whose veins flows completely opposite blood. Brett, in her gentleness as well as naivety, believes in absolute fidelity. She marries Billy, although he is a northerner because she really loves him. Brett is the representative of all that is valuable in any young woman. Ashton, however, is a vamp, a tigress, a woman who does not hesitate to do the most evil things. A clear picture of their encounter with a world view is their conversation about men and family ... an unforgettable moment and how universal it is! Most characters strive for their values ​​... but the war is unfolding, and they will have to postpone a lot ... <br /> <br /> Secondly, the performances ... someone said that not all people behave naturally, I would not say that. Rather, I would say that all the actors cope very well with their roles: from the main characters, which the younger staff portrays to guests consisting of famous stars, including Liz Taylor, Robert Mitchum and others. Patrick Swayze as Orry does an excellent job with his work. I consider this role one of the best. Lesley Ann Down as Madeleine is also very memorable. Perhaps her participation entails too much suffering, but she manages to express all sorts of feelings very well. Kirstie Alley is very attractive and truly remembered as the abolitionist Virgilia Hazard. Philip Kaznoff deserves attention as the terribly ambitious Elkana Bent, as well as David Carradine as a monster husband, a disgusting Justin Lamotte. And, unlike him, mention should be made of Gene Simmons, who is truly excellent, like Orry's mother, whose heart beats for the glory of family life and the union of union. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the memorable moments of the North and the South are left in the memory of the unfading trace. Who can forget the first meeting of Orry and Madeleine - how lovely, how tender in this scene! Or can you miss the moment of Madeleine's father's death? I found it really powerful, at this moment there is a real drama, a drama about a woman left by someone who really loves her. I also liked the episode of Churubusco, and George Hazard was so worried about the life of his dear friend Orrie. Then his meetings with Constance are amazing. The Virginia Speech in Philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance. And the last moment of the first part: although the North and the South may separate, their friendship will never die. Orri and George symbolically joined hands as the train moves on. There are simply so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it is impossible to mention even half of them here. And these great Bill Conti tunes are shot in gorgeous landscapes. Music in the “North and South” is very touching and memorable. <br /> <br /> What to say at the end? “North and South” is a really necessary thing on DVD, just a terrific series about the victory of everything that is valuable in us: love, friendship, loyalty, honor, truthfulness, absolute loyalty. 9/10
