The keys to the VIP are BS. <br /> <br /> Rob Cavalier vs. Justin in the second season. <br /> <br /> I went to school with Rob Chevalier and Adriana Doria. You can remember her as the last girl he picked up. it was when the “evil friend” came, they sorted out and “left the club together”. They were good friends with the bressani chs father at Woodbridge. <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether he was planning a robbery or they asked him to do it, men should know that what they see is not real, and the guys here are shower bags especially this episode. <br /> <br /> one more line to fill the space.
