CAUTION, SPOILERS! Do not read further if you are not ready for some spoilers. <br /> <br /> I think this film had a lot of things under its shell. In addition to the obvious links with Oldboy (and other Park Wook films), I was very worried about the incestuous relationship in this film, as well as the subtle erotic theme that hung over all the vampiric, physical action. <br /> <br /> The main actor, Kang-ho Song, amazingly plays the role of the priest Sang-Hyun - by coincidence “Sang” means “blood” in some languages ​​- who really loved Te-ju, who was played by OK- bin Kim. Their relationship reminds me a lot of the relationship between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in Badlands, where the girl looks like a psychopath and the man basically twists her finger. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is one thing, but the girl’s mother is completely different. While driving, she is tough, one-dimensional and tight, but paralyzed, she says, without moving or blinking an eye. <br /> <br /> Park-wook really, really mastered his cinematography in this film and owes Stanley a lot to Kubrick; Many beautiful frames are scattered in the film, some for simple effects, and some require several looks and, perhaps, repetitive looks to fully capture. <br /> <br /> The music is fairly standard, mostly strings are used for accompaniment. thespian main reaction; it's very good that the character is as closed as he is. Although he does very little and loses in doing so, he seems like a man who thinks a lot. While his love interest says and does a lot, her actions show very few thoughts behind it. In my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> In general, a very disturbing film that is not made for action, which is not even in the same dimension as most things about vampires these days; it is gorgeous, and repellent at the same time.
