This is not the best movie you have ever seen, but it is still very refreshing. Of course, he has his flaws, he has his own humiliating moments, but at the same time he is different from everything you are used to, and funny in the sense that only a Frenchman can give you that. You can learn a little bit from Ameli's masterpiece when you see the hole. I give it 7 out of 10, but I still recommend it to you if you are tired of the usual boredom that you can rent in the video store.
