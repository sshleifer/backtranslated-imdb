I really liked this movie. The actors were great, especially Potent, who is different in each role; FÃ¼rmann, who can also play anyone; and Loos, who encourages things (she is also a talented singer - she sings the song "My Truth", which is heard when one character turns on the stereo in the laboratory). <br /> <br /> Anatomie is a good horror movie that draws attention to its characters. It is also very bad at times, and the scenery is innovative. It is a pity that they had to make a sequel, which is far from original. <br /> <br /> Two more things are worth mentioning. The DVD is not dubbed, which improves the perception of the film. Also, be sure to keep track of the final credits.
