I saw it when it first appeared, and found that it was the work of some genius; but I must confess that at that time I was clearly in the minority. <br /> <br /> For me, the progressive insanity of the owners of Guest House Paradiso is getting better and better throughout the entire movie, with one of the most fun climaxes of the movie. <br /> <br /> But I would not recommend it to my mother. <br /> <br /> Comic-lovers of rough humor will appreciate this film; hidden jokes are hidden, but usually they are quickly smoothed out by a comedy skillet. Rick Mayall and Ed Edmondson are superb, and imperturbable, unsuspecting guests are also superb.
