I can not believe that Bostock's Cup is not yet on a suitable video or DVD. I saw it only once, on a quirky copy taken from the TV, and, despite the fact that I was not a fan (in general), I thought that this was one of the funniest things I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The famous oblique pitch, wherever he is, an ignorant bus driver (“Ponti-it, Ponti-it”, “I will take the next exit”), meaningless plot; all this was due to the painful side. <br /> <br /> I'm stuck in the USA. I desperately need a good British humor, but this is not enough to spend the amount requested by the production company. Come on, put it on a kosher DVD without delay.
