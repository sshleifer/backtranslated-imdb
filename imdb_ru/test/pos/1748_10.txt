Usually I am a typical “creepy” girl, but after watching this movie (of course, on YouTube) I have other perspectives. And also I did not know that my favorite animation studio - Fleisher shot another film about the community of insects whose home in the city garden is threatened by people (lighted cigars and cigarette butts, feet, etc.) And as a brave young grasshopper named Hoppiti rescues the day and conquers the heart of the honeybee; I love beautiful Miss Hani. You know, after watching the movie, the beetles reminded me of some of the “bug beetles” from Don Bult's “Thumbelina”. And from the songs in the movie I love "We are a couple in a castle"; when I sing this song, it almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> This wonderful film was the second (and last) feature that appeared in Fleischer’s studio. Initially, the film was supposed to be released in November 1941, but since Fleischer’s rival, Disney, released Dumbo weeks earlier, Paramount changed the date to December of the same year, but Mr. Bug, unfortunately, fell into an, then still unconscious, trap terrible time. After an unsuccessful discovery two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mr. Bug became a financial disaster and led to the expulsion of Max and Dave Fleischer from the studio, which they founded in 1919, and reorganized the company as Famous Studios. Another important factor in their departure was the fact that Max and Dave Fleischer no longer spoke to each other because of disputes (sadly). In general, I love both films from the Fleisher brothers. - Gulliver and Mr. Bug.
