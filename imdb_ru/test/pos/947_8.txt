First of all, you should look at this only if you do not mind the lack of subtitles, pornography, curly sex and complete, terrifying and truly shocking perversity. I mentioned strange sex, but to call sex in the second half of the movie “strange” would be a great understatement. It's more like a slap in the face if you are not ready for such a disease. At the same time, I can return to the consideration of this painful fragment of pseudo-snuff tobacco that our compatriots brought us. <br /> <br /> The plot seems rather simple, almost non-existent: the girl is hired for performing in an amateur porn movie. Do not expect much in the first 30 to 40 minutes. There is some dialogue - if you don’t speak Japanese, it will not mean much to you - this seems to be a casual chat between a girl and the crew and a performer, that is, some porn (direct sex), and after the scene ends, the performers and the film crew rest. And then ... it starts to happen. <br /> <br /> It seems that the girl is being persuaded to play another scene - this time tied with a rope. The mockery begins: flogging, slapping, hot wax ... In the end, the girl breaks down and cries. They unleash it. <br /> <br /> Then we see the performers and the team sitting at the table as if nothing had happened - except for the girl. She is visibly shocked and looks like she wants to leave. She goes to the door, sits on the floor to put on her shoes ... and then hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> She beats on the head with a baseball bat, her wound is treated, she is tied to the bed. What follows can be briefly described (I am not going to spoil everything to you) as rape during the dismemberment. Think of "Flower of flesh and blood," mix it with porn, and you get an idea. This lasts for about 20 minutes or so. SFX are very good makeup too. Everything is shown, without mercy for the viewer. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I thought "The Visitor Q" was a very sick movie. After watching “Nick Daruma,” he looked like a fairy tale to me. This film is so sick, so depraved, so perverted, so disgusting that the harshest words turn pale compared to the final. It is a pity that it is released only on VHS, so there are no subtitles available. But the film still works without them. So, if you suffer from extreme illness, extreme sadism and other beauties of this favorite genre, check it out. I hope you don’t have nightmares .8 / 10.
