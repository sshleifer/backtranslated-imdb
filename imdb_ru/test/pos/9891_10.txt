I understand that "Checking Out" is likely to be released in US cinemas in June 2006, and on DVD in November 2006. I recommend not to miss "Checking Out" !! This comedic film will entertain everyone who touches the characters, family relationships and a variety of social issues that are depicted. “Checking Out” will make you laugh all over with fast, fiery, smart humor built into almost every line, and can also make you cry bitterly in a touching, positive way. <br /> <br /> The topic of suicide is treated comically, which at the same time can help people considering this to understand what impact this act can have on those who have been touched by their lives and on those who love them. Hopefully, “Checking Out” can have a positive impact and prevent those who are thinking about suicide from playing it, especially in the age group 16-25 years old, which has the highest suicide rate in the United States. <br /> <br /> The script is beautifully written, well molded, and filled with synchronicity and meaningful memories in time, the meaning of which becomes more apparent throughout the film and especially at the end. I believe that the screenplay is worthy of an Oscar nomination for "Best Screenplay, Game in Cinema" (the Phoenix Film Festival won the "For Best Film" award "<br /> <br />"). loaded with great actors who make themselves, and have a great track record of great performances, acting nominations and victories. I feel that Peter Falk's performance in “Checking Out” is worthy of an Academy Award nomination and is the most complex and diverse in his career. Laura San Giacomo's skill and chemistry with Peter Falk, since her father was a master, were awarded at the Palm Beach International Film Festival with the Prize for Best Actress. <br /> <br /> Even teenagers in the film shine and are played by young actor Dan Bird (films: The Cinderella Story with Hilary Duff; 3 nominations for young artists, winner 1) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (TV show: Monster Island , Lake of the Wolves, Passions Affected by the Angel; 2 Young Stars of Nominations). <br /> <br /> Directed by Jeff Hare and producer Mark Lane wonderful develop characters, their relationships and the storyline of this entertaining, enjoyable, but complex script. <br /> <br /> Editing a movie The tempo of a movie moves fast, only slowing down in sharp scenes, so that the public will never lose interest from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie, which you can take the whole family to see and everyone will like.
