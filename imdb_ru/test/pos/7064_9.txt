Meatballs have been a staple in my family for over 26 years! We saw this film when it first came out, and since then we have seen it dozens of times. Bill Murray is at his best and most touching in the scenes where he appeals to a lonely teenage boy and befriends him, at the same time bringing his CIT to a once-harmful scheme after another! The composition of the characters is funny and funny, and you really care about them and their relationship with each other. This is not just another sloppy, stupid, teen sex festival. This is funny, cute and just fun. Anyone who sees this will enjoy it. This is a must see. Watch out for Spaz - he is definitely the best character! (Especially during the camp - while Bill Murray shoots it on camera - just watch Spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he chooses to dance with!) Certainly one of my favorite comedies of all time!
