What can happen in the summer in a boring Texas town? Well, a group of teenagers learn that several things can and do happen. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the Mexican werewolf of this story is nothing but el Chupacabra, and the film, unlike the title, suggests: this is not a remake or a counterpart of American werewolf films, but something completely different. <br /> <br /> Overall, for a clearly budget film, this is not bad! Some clever camera work, pretty decent looking traditional creatures and blood effects, and this time not all-knowing people who can and make mistakes, for example, shoot a colleague who thinks that this is a big bad beast and are confused they may not know. <br /> <br /> Sit down in anticipation of a million dollar blockbuster, and after a while you turn it off in disgust. Sit on it, expecting a bit of entertainment and a relatively simple story, and this is pretty good! In general, he gets 8/10 from me for his creativity, good play and doing a good job for the budget that this film had.
