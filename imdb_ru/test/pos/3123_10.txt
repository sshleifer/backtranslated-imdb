I don’t think I really have any spoilers here, but since I’m describing a couple of funny scenes, I’ll check the box saying “may contain spoilers” to be on the safe side. Now ... <br /> <br /> I hardly know where to start. By now you know the main essay of this story — the horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) take the lead of the Mormon train west to their “promised land” and meet many interesting and interesting characters before The whole Clegg family is outlawed. <br /> <br /> Anyone can enjoy this movie. You do not need to be a fan of westerns to love this one. First, Johnson and Carey are the two most enjoyable characters from all the films. Carey, in particular, is lively and sociable, almost like a big child, while Johnson is a bit calmer and wiser, like the figure of an older brother. I enjoy the scene where they sell the sheriff one of their “gentle horses” for ten dollars; then tell him that the horse has "some peculiarities - you could say that there are failures" ... Travis elbows Sandy, who lets out a sharp whistle, sending a new horse to the sheriff for a wild fit with him in the saddle. The expression of his face, when the horse finally throws it and gallops, is priceless. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the music ... even if you never thought you were a fan of the Sons of the Pioneers, listen to "Shadows in the Dust" when the trailer moves along with several people walking between the cars. This is a really beautiful song - it's a pity that only half a minute or so in the film. I want to hear it all sometime. <br /> <br /> One thing that made a big impression on me in this film is that a lot of this must have been almost as difficult to do as the real situation he portrays. Teams of six horses pulling in wagons along steep mountain paths trying their best to make the top — this was not a simple or easy film. It must have been risky for actors, stuntmen and animals. In this film, there are many authentic actions associated with the movement of the train. It should be noted that both Harry Carey Jr. and Ben Johnson were extremely competent riders, having many years of experience in skating, riding on ropes and performing all sorts of cowboy things. Carey grew up on a ranch where a lot of Navajo worked in his family, and in fact he learned to speak Navajo before he learned to speak English. There were no cowboys with rhinestones in this movie - “Travis” and “Sandy” were real through and through. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene as Miss Denver throws a pot of water out of her van, hitting Travis's horse. in the face ... the horse begins to twitch, eventually throwing him from her. Look at the expression on Sandy’s face when Denver tells Travis: “I’m sorry you fell off your horse.” Another favorite scene of mine is when Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) quarreled a bit with one of the Mormons. They work back to back, preparing their gear, and after Sandy has an aversion to the other guy, the two of them get into the back fight, which quickly turns into a fist fight with roll on the ground. Even after the Elder (Ward Bond) rises and separates them, the two fighters continue to try to find each other. Mormon (nicknamed “Jackson” in the film) gets one last hit at Sandy so high that he hits his shoulder. This is a really fun scene from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I don’t know what else I can say about this film, except that it has a good story, very interesting characters, beautiful landscapes and a lot of action, balanced with humor and a small amount of drama. Oh, it was painted, at least in the version I saw; not the most beautiful color film you have ever seen, but I think I prefer it to black and white. I give it a dozen, and I do not give many dozens. Without a doubt, one of my favorite movies. And judging by other comments, I have a lot of company in this assessment.
