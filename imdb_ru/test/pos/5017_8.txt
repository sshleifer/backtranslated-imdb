What is it about some films that cause such polar opposite reactions? <br /> <br /> Some people here call the high-rollers "disgusting." Some people call it “extraordinary” (as I really am). <br /> <br /> Why? I think this is because such films do not make heroes from idiots or glamor from degeneration, and some people simply cannot cope with this emotionally. They need a hero. And I would add that if they are poker players or players, they may feel betrayed when their existence is not justified. <br /> <br /> Highroller in the movie NOT poker. This is the film PEOPLE. It is not perfect, but it looks good, well written and acted remarkably. And, most importantly, it causes an emotional response and inspires reflection. <br /> <br /> And perhaps this is what some people are so damn angry about.
