"The Devil in the Dark" - a favorite episode of William Shatner. This is also one of my favorite episodes. The program is pure Star Trek, because it deals with one of the main topics of the series: respect for other forms of life. I do not think that one could get a clearer example of one of the most interesting ideas of the show. In this episode, Kirk and his team must confront a monster that kills miners on a distant planet. This story is a justification for exploring the right of people to destroy creatures that are a vital part of the environment. Today's environmental problems make the show more relevant than ever before. It is extremely well written and performed with pleasure by our favorite cast. One unforgettable sequence involves Spock connecting to the monster's mind. The great tension between Spock and Kirk (they want to solve the problem with different methods) adds fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy do some of their best work here.
