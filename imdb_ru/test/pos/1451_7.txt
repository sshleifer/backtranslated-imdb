Instead of going to the set and making a realistic film about drug addiction in the City of Winds, opposite director Otto Preminger decided to go the other way and make his film as artificial as possible, thus defying fashion set by people like Kazan , Houston and Zinnemann, who made their paintings around the world. Nelson Algren, whose novel is based on the film, said he despises him. I wonder what Preminger was up to and why he made the film that way? <br /> <br /> The plots in the film are so minimal that they give rise to an idea about the cartoon of Mr. Magu. Louis, a drug addict, dressed like a gangster who was drawn by artists from Mad magazine. Arnold Stang, a wonderful comedian, whom he seemed inappropriate in a serious picture like this, and his very appearance, topped with an exaggerated and oversized baseball cap, causes laughter. Robert Strauss, another actor best known for humorous roles, is also out of place, as his large, chin-like face and runoun style of lines seem more appropriate for the Jerry Lewis film. Despite all this, the stars Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Eleonora Parker are forced to work overtime to keep the viewer from laughing. Sinatra is nervous and manic everywhere, suggesting that a person is not comfortable with himself, and therefore he is well suited for the role of an addict. Miss Novak, looking like a plant and sublimely imperturbable, is responsive and seems to be the product of artfully dirty slums, which she gracefully shoots in the film. Parker is pure Hollywood and very hardworking, like a crippled and cunning Zosh. She is never convincing, but the film too. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to anyone interested in a realistic depiction of the lives of drug addicts in America. Only Caligari sets make it incredible. Preminger may have sought to have a sleep effect, as cardboard backgrounds give the audience a surreal sense of a nightmare operetta, possibly returning to Preminger's early days in Vienna.
