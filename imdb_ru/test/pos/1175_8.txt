8/2008. When I originally wrote my comments, shortly after the first viewing of this film, I critically evaluated them, feeling that Lemmon and Mattau basically “phoned” their performances, which paired them the way they did it several times earlier. br /> <br /> But when he saw it again, everything looked different, especially given the fact that neither of the two main megastars lived much longer after its release. <br /> <br /> With the exception of Spiner, all eight directors are performers with significant experience, as well as inevitably much longer in the teeth than we have seen in many of their other films and television shows. Job. But isn't it all? <br /> <br /> To see it again, although it will by no means become a “class”, it is a funny movie with a lot of interesting scenery. <br /> <br /> From my point of view, it reminds me that many films, performances, etc., can often be viewed either from a very critical point of view, or instead of looking on the bright side without expecting the film should be another "citizen Kane", "casablans" or (from the point of view of two passages), another original "strange couple". It will also provide ongoing nostalgia for Lemmon and Mattau, as well as other actors.
