No one will ever doubt that the director Leos Carax is a genius, but what interests us is that he is a mad genius? So many people hated this movie! Usually I’m the first person to blame many French directors for making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (such as the terrible recent film L'Enfant and senseless and offensive Feux Rouges). But oddly enough, I actually think that “Paul X” is an amazing film made by a master of his craft with great skill and passion and containing wonderful performances. The film carries a melodrama of more extreme length than I think I have ever seen on the screen before. But then, Carax is extreme that we know. The film also contains what I consider excessively Trotskyist or anarchist fantasies and wet dreams, that with a mysterious group of young people learning to fire machine guns on the bourgeoisie between playing Scott Walker's rather exciting music in a group that records in an abandoned warehouse are filled with squatter and fires old steel barrels. Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in the castle (whose stepmother - Catherine Deneuve, and he, by the way, wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bathroom). But he suddenly completely "clicks" when he discovers that his late father, a well-known diplomat, had born an illegitimate daughter, which Deneuve had in fact saved from inconvenience. This is due to the fact that her sister suddenly turns into a kind of Romanian refugee with wild disheveled hair, an expressionless face and a weak ability to speak French. Depardieu then turns into the “class hero” of the extreme left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in poverty and extreme poverty, while despising a huge legacy. He then begins an incestuous sexual relationship with his half-sister, who is shown in the explicit sex scene that has offended many people, although I don’t mind this because I think that people are too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where, apparently, it never happens. The intensity of acting and filming makes this incredible script a vivid, though depressing, hyper-melodrama. The differences between Carax, creating an extreme film like this, and numerous extreme French films, which, in my opinion, are pretentious and disgusting, lie in the fact that (1) Carax is an excellent director, and (2) he is seriously trying to explore a meaningful, although agonizing, extreme emotional state in which a person disintegrates and turns against the background of his past. Many will say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous, but I disagree. I believe that Carax was genuine, and did not do the painting of exploitation at all. It is very difficult to protect a person who has gone so far and who, as far as I know, can be a complete lunatic, but I think he deserves protection for this remarkable cinematic achievement.
