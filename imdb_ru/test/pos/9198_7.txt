I heard interesting critics on this film. I thought it was a love story, but I wasn't sure what the plot was about. So, when I finally saw this, I found myself in the middle of a love relationship between former prisoner Isabel (Isabel Ampudia) and drug addict Rufo (Sebastian Aro). So, a love story, but probably not what I expected. <br /> <br /> The film is about Isabella when she tries to return to society. She does not want to return to her area, and she finds herself without a home or somewhere to go. So, although she only experiences those first hours of freedom after being released from prison, she stumbled upon Rufo, her long-standing excuse, which, while she was there, became a drug addict and lives on the streets. Not having where to go, and not having money or a possible source of income, she decides to join Rufo at his residence: a closed area on a deserted street. <br /> <br /> The story itself is moving. This explains how the impossible relationship between Isabelle and Rufo grows deeper until the film becomes almost final. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is worth seeing. Sebastian Aro is great in his role as a drug addict. A man who can be both innocent and gentle giving man and ruthless street scum. Just depending on who he is dealing with. I believe in his role. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I do not quite believe in the role of Isabel Ampudia. Although the film tries to show bitterness inside her through several scenes, she is not able to make me believe it. She is too sweet and too honest, as one would expect from someone in the same situation. <br /> <br /> The film is trying to show love in a hopeless situation. This is a nice movie. But the feeling that I feel when the film ends is that Isabelle, with her way of thinking and acting, would never be in that situation. In her role, partly because of the script, partly because of the acting, it's hard to believe. <br /> <br /> I especially like the final, and because of this I raised my rating by one or two points. I liked his bitter sweetness and the fact that sometimes the instinct of self-preservation surpasses other more spiritual considerations, like love. <br /> <br /> Summing up, an interesting film, but there was not enough punch in it for him to “see”,
