Incredible performance! This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I know that they talk a lot about it, but I bet that you will not regret watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It's great from the very beginning to the last second. The acting game (especially the mother that Judith Light played) is so convincing that I didn’t see so many other films that could compare with it, and it seems that it’s impossible not to feel anything about the people in this drama. br /> <br /> A lot of movies are made every year, but if you just need to watch a few of them, make it one of them.
