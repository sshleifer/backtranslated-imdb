The Power Kid hour consisted of two segments: Hero High and Shazam. let's start with Hero High. <br /> <br /> Hero High was supposed to be the new cartoon Archies featuring their superheroes: Pureheart the Powerful (Archie), Captain Hero (Jughead), Superteen (Betty) and Evilheart (Reggie). However, Filmation could not get the rights to it, so they tweaked a bit and came up with it. Here is the distribution of characters: Captain California (Archie), Glorious Gal (Betty), Meteorologist (Jaghed), Dirty Trixie (Veronica), Rex Ruthless (Reggie), Chief Samson (Mr. Weatherby) and Miss Grimm (Miss Grandi). The show featured live sketches as well as adventures in cartoons. Humor was typical jokes about filming, but at least it was funny. It was funny enough for the children, although it didn’t fully meet the previous standards. <br /> <br /> Another segment was Shazam !, which was very devoted to comics, unlike the previous live show. All the main villains appeared, as did the whole Marvel family (including Marvel Freckles, in at least one episode). Uncle Dudley had the correct WC Fields voice and shadow character, as well as his permanent "Shazambago". Burr Middleton, a 70s television veteran such as Fish, was voiced by Big Red Cheese, while Alan Oppenheimer (Rudi Wells in the early episodes of $ 6 Million Man and Skeltor’s voice in He-Man) worked with Dr. Sivan. > <br /> Marvels always had a whim, so their adventures required few changes to meet the requirements of standards and broadcasting practices (censorship). As such, the stories were very creative and inventive. Among the villains that appeared were Dr. Sivana, Black Adam, Mr. Atom, Mr. Mind, Aunt Minerva, Ibak, and crocodile creatures. Mr Tawki Toney also debuted on screen. <br /> <br /> Hero High should be released from BCI, but Shazam! still in limbo as well as live shows. I hope the proposed film will help loosen them on DVD. It is worth it to watch and deserve treatment from the DVD.
