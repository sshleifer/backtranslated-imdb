Leaving aside the words “I’m so sure” and “utterly gloomy”, this is one of the sweetest and most realistic novels depicted on the film. Deborah Foreman (where is she now?) In the role of Julia and Nicolas Cage in the role of Randy are just as classic as Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria, Jake and Samantha ... You can't help falling in love with them. plus the soundtrack - plimsules, sparks, furs, flirting and, of course, modern English is also outstanding. for fans of films about young love, I would recommend in a recent film all the real girls of David Gordon Green.
