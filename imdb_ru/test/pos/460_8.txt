The plot in Hungary in November 1956 is the story of a group of foreigners who tried to leave the country during the uprising. <br /> <br /> After the airport closes the title journey, the bus starts delivering them to Austria. Obviously, they stop on their way, where they encounter the almost flawless Yul Brynner, whose military might as a major of the Red Army was marked by loneliness, his internal struggle between good and evil, his search for truth and he needs to feel emotions towards other people. He was saddened by the fact that his work pushed him away from friends and enemies, and he longed for social contacts. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley plays the typical, stern Englishman, who, no matter how serious, plays a role, he maintains an almost carefree logical outlook on life, while Jason Robards has a terrific movie debut that explains the reason why he has so many roles throughout his career. Deborah Kerr, as the leading lady, shows grace and femininity with whom we communicate, but at the same time manages to find the strength and determination necessary for her character. <br /> <br /> The film is experiencing a very turbulent time in European history, but it never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us, and you can never fully judge a book by its cover. The fabulous writing of the script ensures that, for all the seriousness of the subject, there can still be excellent plot lines and comedy examples that add rather than distract from the film. Chemistry in the cat-and-mouse game between Kerr and Brynner makes it possible to understand why they appeared not only in one film. <br /> <br /> In general, an exciting movie, which I will definitely watch again. 8/10
