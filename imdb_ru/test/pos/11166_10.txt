Great movie about a great man. Thomas Kretschmann, as well as in all his other films, is magnificent. I would never have introduced him as Pope John Paul. This speaks volumes for the director of the casting. Why do they continue to use him as a German officer in the films? And he only attracted everyone's attention after the "pianist"? Of course, he looks so hot in shape. I know a lot of girls drool on his beautiful face. But this guy is a wonderful actor and has such great potential. If you do not believe me, go watch "Stalingrad". I hope that in the future he will get many great roles with a lot of variety. Otherwise, what a heartbreaking waste of great talent.
