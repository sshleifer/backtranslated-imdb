The fires on the plain made by Kon Ichikawa and written by Shohei Ooka and Natto Wada is a film about the Second World War, in which, finally, not allies fighting the axis powers but the Japanese fighting and fighting for their lives in the Philippines are shown. The main character is called Tamura, played by Eiji Funakoshi, and he is a soldier leaving his regiment due to his illness. All he has is a hand grenade, his gun and some potatoes. That's how he tries to get to the hospital in order to get a doctor and medicine for his illness. But since the hospital turned its back on him and was destroyed, he has begun a long journey. Throughout the film, Tamura remains a bit cowardly, but very polite, when other soldiers become more like animals, using their basic instincts for survival. Tamura still remains a man and does not degrade. The scene that really influenced me to think positively and differently about this military film is when Tamura ends up in a Filipino village that is completely deserted. There, he fights with a dog and finds many dead Japanese soldiers who were put in front of the church. This makes Tamur think and even fear more than he is. This shows that the soldier is not a brave killer, but a servant of higher beings and people, which is most important. After he turns away from the corpses, two Filipinos (couple or brother and sister: a very close relationship) return to the village to return their salt reserves. The protagonist of the film first wants to be friendly, although he approached them with a pistol, but shoots a woman when she starts screaming. Then her brother / boyfriend / husband runs away in fear, and after a moment Tamura follows him and shoots the Filipino running wildly. He doesn't beat him. After Tamura takes a bag of salt, something very valuable, he throws a pistol into the river. This gesture is very important for understanding Konoy Ichikawa / Shohei Ooki Tamura's profiling and war. Comparing this film with other films of the Second World War, it is far from typical. Of course, in all the films there are suffering heroes, but their heroes are more heroic than Tamura. He expresses everything that is human: he manipulates, he is weak, he is scared, he has hope. This is typical of Japanese films about World War II and Japanese society. Since World War II is not discussed in Japanese society, the Japanese are likely to put the Japanese in the Second World War as a victim. This victimization is also very visual in this film. One example is Tamura, the other is the folded bodies of Japanese soldiers in front of the church, and another important example is when Japanese soldiers try to cross the street, and the Americans are already waiting for them there and shooting everyone. Japanese soldiers who have the worst equipment and eat worse do not have medical equipment or anything like that. In my personal conclusion, I must say that this film is worth seeing in order to finally see the film from a different side than usual. There is also no nationalist propaganda that can be easily embedded. As soon as you fully watch the film, you will be able to see the horrors of the Second World War in full.
