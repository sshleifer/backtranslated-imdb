Fabulous film, which I watched several times since the purchase of the video just four days ago. Yes, I am a fan of Colin Firth, and Colin was his usual talented, natural, magnificent person. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matthew Field) and Fissy (Sammy, Nimi’s 7-year-old son) was very special and so natural to see. They were hilariously funny together and also touched the strings of my heart. The scenes that I liked the most were Sammy and Matt sitting on the wall chatting and then Matt having fun falling apart from the wall (I will not reveal the content of their discussion so as not to spoil the plot). It was also fun when Sammy asked Matt about sex, Colin and Fissy were perfect in this scene and did something that could be a clumsy thing between an adult and a child, so natural. The words of Colins and the face at the end of this scene were so delightful and they said everything! just wonderful. Of course, one should pay tribute to Fissy Roberts for his amazing image of Sammy. He played such a sweet and daring child. These two actors were just perfect together. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matt) and Nia (Nimi) was perfectly balanced, and I could not agree that the chemistry between them was wonderful to observe, showing love, tension, and of course passion. It was interesting to observe how their delicate flowering romance gradually unfolded, and also showed how their cultural and social differences influenced their relationships, and it was nice to see Colin and Nia very sensitively depicting Matt and Nimi, discovering, accepting and overcoming these differences. It kept me tied to the TV and guessed right to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Colins portrayed Matt’s vulnerable and youthful side, and also so beautiful that it was hard to watch Matt being so angry and childish towards Sammy because he (Matt) felt that Sammy was getting in the way his novel / relationship with the sams mother Nimi. One could not help but feel very disappointed, angry and upset about Matt because of such an attitude towards Sammy, and this in turn threatened to ruin Mats' special relationship with Sammy and Nimi. Colins' special talent - to “get inside the character’s head” and show the different sides of the character to the viewer, was here very obvious and pure magic for observation. I must also mention that Colin also has very good relations with young actors (see also “My Life So far” is a wonderful film that should not be missed). <br /> <br /> I also loved the relationship between Matthew and his wife Jenny, both showed the audience the dark side and the tension in their marriage perfectly, and that not all seemingly “happy marriages” are what they are may seem from the side. <br /> <br /> I must not forget to mention the Reverend, whom I consider very funny, in serious form! In addition, Mother and Family Them were cheerful, and also emphasized the importance of Them’s culture and its situation. <br /> <br /> The downside is that I cannot find the opposite side, but to be objective in the film and give credibility to my review, the only negative comment I would like to make is that the script writers did not explain in sufficient detail, why Matt collapsed in the car, there was only a vague suggestion from Them that something was wrong with him. his heart However, this does not diminish my pleasure from the film. I just had to rewind the tape a little for the second take. <br /> <br /> I felt that there was everything in this film, entertaining I cheered up, and I liked the rich colors and the sunny landscape. The film warmed up a cold winter day and made me smile :-)) All the necessary elements were there: laughter, love, tension, sadness, anger, drama and warm feeling. A good factor, yes, yes, a lot of delicious moments of Colin Firth, including very absorbed Colin. in Wet Scene, which no fan should miss, what more could a girl want ;-)) <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this film, especially to all fans of Colin Firth ;-)
