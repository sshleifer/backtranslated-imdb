If you have ever been, have a friend or a child who once skated, then watch this movie! I have seen it several times, and every time I see it, I get something new from it. It reminded me of why I started skating at all (a long time ago). It reminded me that skating brings a person, and I found that it would also help a person who does not understand why skaters, well, skate. Of course, in everything seen there is a very dark side, which the film slightly affects. But it tends to focus more on what lies at the heart of skating. It's just that the person on the board does it because they like to do it. This film was so inspiring for me that I skate again (I'm 32 years old) and I haven't been so pleased with myself for many years ??
