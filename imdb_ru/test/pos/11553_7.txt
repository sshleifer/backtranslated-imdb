I agree with Jonlvis, who said that a lot of things happen between the lines in this movie. Although I think that the pace of this film can be improved, I think the complexity of the relationship between the characters is charming. <br /> <br /> Examples: <br /> <br /> Pierre is going to marry his cousin, although his love for her seems like a very cousin? <br /> <br /> Pierre and his stepmother have a rather ... curious relationship. <br /> <br /> Pierre, Lucy and Thibault seem to have triangular relationships, and the actual points on the triangle are not quite sure ... <br /> <br /> Lucy's brother is a little eunuch, or is he? <br /> <br /> And Isabel, who is she really ?? <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it was worth my time. An interesting film, and one that makes me want to read Melville.
