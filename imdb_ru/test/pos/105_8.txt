For a moment, let's put aside the cultural aspects of this film, even if this is its very important side, and let's consider the simple fact that it is a very good love story. Two people find themselves in a difficult situation caused by two selfish husbands. They must survive their sad days without a ray of hope. If each of these two women were one, imagine what kind of life each of them should have taken. They found each other and fell in love. The fact that this love contradicted all the social, religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant. They loved each other, found relief in each other, that was enough. The reaction of the people around them is only a small fact that they must accept, even suffer, and then they can continue their life, their life. Very good.
