Wagon Master (1950) Director: John Ford <br /> <br /> Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> John Ford takes the joint-stock company to the Utah desert to make a western film, and comes with this minor classics. No John Wayne, no contradictory antiheroes, no psychological research, no fireworks, just a jewel of the picture. <br /> <br /> In this ensemble, the stars Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy) are nominally shot. ). These are horse traders who come to town to do business when a group of Mormons led by Ward Bond show a way out. The group is about to set off on their own settlement, but they know that the odds and the harsh terrain are against them. Therefore, they hire Travis and Sandy as vans masters for their trip. Along the way, they encounter and take along a traveling salesman and his two female cohorts (Alan Mowbray as a doctor, recalling his appearance in “My dear Clementine” and Joann Drew as “daughter”). Voltage is added when Clegg’s murderous gang bumps into a carriage. And there is also an atypical (for Hollywood) meeting with the Navajo. <br /> <br /> Much of history and humor are due to the clash of ideals / cultures; first between Travis, Sandy and the Mormons, between Ward Bond himself (he constantly tries to suppress his desire to curse and become a reformer), between the doctor and his ladies and Mormons, between baggage and criminals, and finally, everything and Navajo. There is also the classic Ford scene of hooligan dance, in which one of its characteristic themes of civilization approaching the border is expressed. <br /> <br /> Again, there is no duke here, but I found Ben Johnson, especially the young Awful Ben Johnson, to have an attractive presence screen. He comes with his backstory, with this agony, and also when you see how he performs the whole trick traveling by himself. He is great here in one of his early titles. Harry Carey Jr., although by this time already a few years, is still quite rude at times, but he is pleasant. Ward Bond - his usual amazing, noisy me. I discovered that Joann Drew is the one in which I see her, but here she is, fortunately, unobtrusive. Other familiar faces include Jane Darwell, Francis Ford and Hank Warden, playing "stupid," as he would do in the Seekers a few years later. There is nothing more funny. <br /> <br /> Freelance Ford employee Bert Glennon (Bert Glennon) offers completely exciting black and white photographs. Not only is there a typical master class on landscapes and horizons, there are also some blossoms in a handful of scenes with shadows and (sunlight) light. The soundtrack presents the legendary country group The Sons of the Pioneers. Can't get more cowboy than that. <br /> <br /> *** ½ of 4
