Well ... The end of this may be a bit of a disappointment after what happened before ... And Klaus Kinsky should have cut his 10-second appearance ... But from the fact that this is a really great atmospheric European thriller ... I can't believe that I've never seen this before ... It's nice to know that there are films that still need to be tracked ... And this is really ... Stunning visual effects ... Ghosts ... And creates amazing atmosphere ... Florinda Balkan is perfect as our heroine ... A scene on the beach with Nicoletta Elmi - one of the most relaxed and perfect games that you could see ... Leela Kedrova is known as one of the visitors of the city who may or may not be who she seems ... If you miss hay the days of Euro cinema, then chase it ... A decent widescreen print goes around ... And please post it to someone on the restored DVD ... They did it with the directors of "The Fifth Cord" ... And this film is much better
