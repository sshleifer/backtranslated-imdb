Kite runner is undoubtedly one of the most amazing books I've read in the recent past. Perhaps I had very high expectations from the film, but nevertheless the film was good, the whole situation seemed realistic. nothing was invented. the dialogues were not very attractive or powerful, they were just the right ones. The film was not a bad experience, especially in the last 15 minutes, when it became very emotional, and even the most difficult person probably cried. But my imagination was much better than a movie ... I cried more when reading a novel than to watch a movie but in general a good movie for those who are not readers. but readers - the novel would be the best experience, so if you want to watch a movie at all, first read the novel, and then compare it with the movie.
