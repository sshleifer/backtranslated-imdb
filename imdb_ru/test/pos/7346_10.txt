The relationship between the main characters seemed to me very realistic. The way these two were involved is plausible. There is no such “oh yeah, right” as in most Hollywood movies. Not to mention too much how they captured the sexy, beautiful and painful side of the trapezoid. I am a student of a trapezoid, and I like that they showed how heavy it is on the body, hands and, yes, these burns on the fabric are cruel! Definitely need to see the relationship, as well as the art that is made in the film. I like it! I am pleased with how the film ended, but I definitely wanted to see more. Be sure to sit still through loans for special enjoyment hehe. Great scene!
