What this film is not: Cool, Entertaining <br /> <br /> What kind of movie it is: Visually interesting, Hard to pass, Intentional <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this film puts the viewer ( ready) through the length of time when they experience a world without language. Very similar to how animals should learn the world. You don't actually watch this movie as often as you see a horrible series of events that “feel” like in real time. <br /> <br /> Consistently, it lasts much longer than is convenient. This movie can be edited up to 20 minutes and it will be a completely different movie. It would be cool and interesting, but the experience would be lost. I've seen a lot of cool movies, but never seen one. If you can get your head in the right place for this, you should be able to truly appreciate (but probably not “enjoy”) what they have achieved here. 10 out of 10.
