A new killer is free, and he is doing God's work. Yes, right! This killer makes Jason Wurhes look like a dummy, and Freddy Krueger looks like a rag doll in the background of this dude. This is Jacob Goodnight (Glen "KANE" Jacobs from WWE), 7 'monster with ax, hook and chain. This weapon means nothing to him, its real finisher pulls out the eyeballs from the victims' sockets. It is completely methodical! When the meeting took place 4 years ago, Jacob killed a police recruit and crippled a veteran by inserting a bullet in his head. How the hell did Goodnight survive after 4 years? Now he is in a convicted hotel called Blackwell. And this hotel has a lot of stories to tell. I thought this film is haunting as well as interesting. I liked the part where Goodnight checked one of the girl's tattoos on her back. And Goodnight himself is really crazy because of his manic mother. If you think that Friday the 13th was something, better think again. This movie will leave you at the edge of your seat. And I think the tearing of the eyeball was terrible. This film proves it, and it was not a waste of my time. I enjoyed it. The name does not lie! Rated 2.5 out of 5 stars!
