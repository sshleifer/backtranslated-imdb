This is one of the few films that I was really recommended as absolutely brilliant. If you give this movie a low note, then you really miss the point. You could describe Fosca as manipulative, but what if it is really serious that she fell ill when the love in which she is sure did not get an answer. But what would you do if you are sure that the other loves you and is “only” rejected by the fact that you are ugly. Could you fight for that. At least, I think it is better to fight for it, to die bitterly. And it reminds me of how I, as a man, at first glance, fully respond to the physical disgrace of Foschi and do not look further at the person she is or can be. This film confronts me with very serious questions about respect, trust, a sense of manipulation, and so on. How am I now, if someone manipulates me or just tries to make contact? What I consider the most outstanding feature of this film is that Ettore Scola made it absolutely believable that Giorgio fell in love with Fosca.
