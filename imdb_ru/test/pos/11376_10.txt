It was the best film of 1998 and one of the best 90s. Yes, this is Goodfell robbery. But as they say, good poets borrow, great poets steal. And PTA brilliantly stole from some of the best, plus added some ingenious touches of their own. I gave it ten (which is very rare for me). <br /> <br /> Although I am commenting on this (because I could just rave all night), these are all the people who saw this on VHS is a standard problem ... what are you thinking? It deserves a FULL SCREEN experience. Look at the ratio in which he was shot! I saw it 5 times in the cinema and did not bother to watch it on video. <br /> <br /> Nuff said!
