American film is a wonderful documentary. It follows the trials and tribulations of a very determined independent director when he struggles to finish his first film. <br /> <br /> The raw cuts and insightful content of this film is an excellent example of how documentaries should be produced. I also feel that the film can be very inspiring for those of us who want to become a director on our own.
