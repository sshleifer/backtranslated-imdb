Version "Flipper" (1996) from Universal Studios is a great soul movie for the whole family with good values ​​and sentimentality. This is the story of Sandy Ricks, a teenager from Chicago who reluctantly spends his vacation with his uncle Porter Ricks in the Bahamas. This ultimately changes the life of a teenager, and he grows in the process. He learns to value nature and respect the environment. I grew up in the 1960s, and the NBC television show "Flipper" was my favorite children's show. Elijah Wood played great in the role of the 1990s Sandy Ricks and gives excellent performance. No matter how much I liked the NBC TV shows and MGM theatrical films with Luke Halpin as Sandy in the 1960s, I liked this feature the most! I feel like Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. As for Luke Halpin, I feel that Elijah Wood has a lot of acting talent and more acts as an actor, which makes his performance superb and more believable. I think Elijah Wood is the best young actor working in movies today. Director Alan Shapiro also wrote the screenplay and did an excellent job with both the author and the director of this film. Paul Hogan gives a funny and nice presentation like Uncle Porter Ricks Sandy. The speech of Mr. Hogan perfectly compensates the role of Elijah as Sandy. I'm a big fan of underwater movies. This film was beautifully shot in the Bahamas, like The Thunder Ball (1965 UA). The director of photography was Bill Butler A.S. who shot the film "Jaws" in 1975. Mr. Butler is a very talented cinematographer. Underwater photography director was Pete Romano. He coped well with underwater cinematography. I liked the movie score by Joel McNealy. This good film showed Crosby, Stills and Nash among other talented artists. This film was shot in Panavision, as “Thunderball”, with an aspect ratio of 2.35: 1. If possible, try to see this film in the bulk version, originally created and conceived by Alan Shapiro and Bill Butler. Another very nice thing is that Mr. Shapiro gave the “original” Sandy Ricks (Luke Halpin) a small role in this remake. In this film, he portrayed "Fisherman Bounty number 3." It was a very kind gesture from Mr. Shapiro! As you can tell, I'm a real fan of this movie. Unfortunately, this beautiful film was met with harsh words from most film critics. I originally saw this film on my birthday, May 31, 1996, in a movie theater. It meant a lot to me. I have it on numerous video versions. Versions of VHS are in pan and scan mode. Version with a laser disc "letterboxed" 2.35: 1! I even have a VCD of 2.35: 1 from Hong Kong, which is a “mailbox”. But my most valuable asset is the “original” 16-mm theatrical print, which I will appreciate until the end of my life! Thanks to Mr. Shapiro, Elijah Voodoo, Paul Hogan and everyone who contributed to this unforgettable film for me! <br /> <br /> P.S. I must add that the quality of Universal DVD is superb! This is the best quality DVD I've ever seen. Color and resolution are impressive. The soundtrack is great. I think Universal must have used the same DVD transfer as the laser disc version. The 35mm imprint is Mint, and Alan's film does have a great view. Great tribute to a great movie! DVD resolution even exceeds the quality of the laser disc! It's just awesome! Thank you Universal Home Video for excellent quality control and transfer. Thank you very much for the excellent work on this wonderful family movie. Also thank you very much, Alan, for all your extreme kindness to me !!! It is an honor to know you !!! (Review revised / updated June 27, 2005)
