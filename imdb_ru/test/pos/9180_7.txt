When a man watches romantic comedies, he knows what to expect; we have seen them many, many years to know how they go. There is a formula that almost always generates films that are becoming popular among the audience of the genre ... not always due to their actual quality. How to play with it and create something more interesting? This film has a suggestion ... and it works relatively well. Instead of simply following the example, we skillfully follow him, helping unhappy men, those who do not have an attractive facade, which would allow them to reveal the invisible good qualities they possess for women in love with them. The plot follows Smith when he is working on his self-proclaimed most difficult case; Kevin James Along with his help from James, we also follow Mendez, who are fed up with people who lie to get what they want (one particular scene that inspires great respect for Smith's character - he meets one such jerk and puts him in place). After Smith helps James in a disaster, we see him with Mendez ... and, despite his talent for helping others, he is spoiled ... badly ... with her. Making amazing remarks about love, and how love affects us. For a romantic comedy, this basically avoids such pitfalls (sometimes almost bordering on feeling like a parody of the genre), although the last few scenes have the sweetness and emotions of this type of film. Whether they follow the formula will not be shown in this review. The pace is pretty good, it never slows down and rarely moves too fast. The acting is great, as almost everyone goes. Characters are well developed and look like real people. Humor does not always work ... there are random jokes, performed less than fortunately, and one or two jokes that seem violent. However, for the most part, the film was funny. I recommend this to anyone who loves romantic comedies and anyone who is in love or in love. Those who do not believe in love will have a hard time with the latest scenes. 7/10
