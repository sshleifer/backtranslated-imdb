This is very silly humor ... but I liked it. Jean Dujardin is a great actor in this film. Berenice Bejo is cute. It makes fun of all the secret agents, such as James Bond: refreshing !!! This is probably the most fun movie I've ever seen. I have already seen it three times, and I still want to see it again. Buy a DVD as you can. You will not regret it. This is a movie in which you do not need a great script, because it is a parody. The only drawback is that the OSS 117 is too short. This is a jewel. It is not often possible to see a French film succeed in the United States, but I think it has everything to succeed. Trust me!!!
