At first glance, this is one of the most classic entertainment / comedy / romantic films I've seen in a long time. He reminds me of the old pleasant films “Saturday Day,” in which there was a right balance of unexpected turns, timely humor and complex actions. In addition, however, there is our knowledge of the context of this film. He has the same elements of "Casablanca", but is conceived just before many characters really understand the seriousness of what is happening with their country (and world) and the consequences of some of their own behavior. This adds a strong touch of irony to humor (we feel that one of the female characters has a radical change in hairstyle in her future). This is a movie you will not regret.
