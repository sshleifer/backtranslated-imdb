Easy, inspirational and exciting movie. Watching Irene Dunn is a delight! When you look at her, she ceases to be Irene Dunn and becomes in all respects Hollow Wharton. <br /> <br /> I liked Irene Dunn in every movie I saw, and that would be almost all of them. What a pity that most of her films so badly need restoration. I really hope that the film Irene Dunn will be restored before it is too late, they are such treasures. Thank God, this does not apply to more than 21. Be sure to take a look if you like superb acting and witty comedy with serious overtones. I agree with the previous commentary on The Peace and Apple Pie, this was one of the many highlights of the film. I read somewhere that Irene Dunn helped write this speech with director Vidor (Irene Dunn was a very good and charitable person in her personal life), and it certainly shines through her films!
