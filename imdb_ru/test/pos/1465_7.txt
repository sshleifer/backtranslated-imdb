"Soap" is an interesting film, very brilliant in parts. You have to watch out for his strong characterization and the risks that the plot takes about two people in love with problem people. You should know the story through various other reviews, so let's talk about what is brilliant in this film. <br /> <br /> First, the two main characters are so real and such intriguing personalities. First, it is a woman who has abandoned a four-year relationship and is evil enough to sleep with anyone who meets her. The second is a man who always wanted to be a woman whose pain and loneliness appear with such sensitivity and brilliance. You hate the first, and your heart bleeds for the last. <br /> <br /> The second thing in this film is the concept of love for who you are, regardless of gender. So, would you still love your partner if he or she changed their gender? The film explores this idea, and it is beautiful. <br /> <br /> But there is one moment when the film fails. I would like the relations between the main characters to develop better. What they feel is love does not reach the end. But look and leave your thoughts here .......
