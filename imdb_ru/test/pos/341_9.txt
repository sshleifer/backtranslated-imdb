In Sri Lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-Sangala government and the separatist organization Tamil Elam Liberation Tigers (LTTE) has claimed approximately 68,000 lives since 1983. that as a result of the war, more than a million people became displaced, homeless or living in camps. The impact on children and families caught up in the conflict is keenly dramatized by the famous Tamil director Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film “Peck on the Cheek,” which won several awards at the National Film Awards in India. While civil war is just the background for the story of the discovery of a young girl, the human costs of war are extremely clear, and Ratnam gives battle a universal context, pointing the global arms dealers as the source of wrongdoing. <br /> <br /> Beautifully photographed by filmmaker Ravi K. Chandran in South India in a setting that reflects the landscape of Sri Lanka, the film tells the touching story of a 9-year-old girl who is about to find her real mother in the midst of fighting in Sri -Lanke. Played with deep feeling and expressiveness. Keerthana in an unforgettable performance, Amudha was raised by a middle-class loving family with two younger brothers after her natural parents Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (JD Chakravarthi) were forced to flee when fighting began, leaving her in the Red Cross Camp. In the fond memory, we see that the adoptive parents of Amudhi, the father of Tiru (Madhavan), an eminent Tamil writer, and the mother Indra (Simran), the TV presenter, marry to facilitate the adoption of a little girl with dark skin. <br /> <br /> Young Amudha does not suspect that she was adopted until she suddenly appeared on her ninth birthday, according to the prior agreement of the parents. While she plays, Tyru tells her almost believably that “you are not our daughter,” and the answer is predictable. Distraught, she asks who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she left her, and so on, but so far there are few answers. Amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her real mother, now a fighter for Tamil separatists. Immersion of the family into the reality of civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions, which are mainly made with the skill of Ratnam, although the sequence in which the family came under crossfire seemed amateurish. <br /> <br /> A Peck “On the Cheek” is, of course, a Bollywood film, which means tons of music and melodrama. Melodrama did not interfere because of the strong speeches of leading actors; nevertheless, I discovered that the musical performances of A.R. Rahman’s songs contradict the mood of the film with their elegant, high-performance technologies and fast editing in the style of a music video. Yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told go beyond the limitations of the film. Tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even domestically, as too cliché and commercial, but Peck on the Cheek is also an entertainment film, and it deals with serious issues. The fact that it successfully closes the line between art and commerce is not a failure, but a tribute.
