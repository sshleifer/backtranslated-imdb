This is one of the best lesbian films I've ever seen! This series brought joy and sadness of true love. Work in the 1800s was an amazing look at the lives of lesbians and the desires of lesbian women. The cast was higher than expected! Rachel Sterling is an amazing actress, I have never seen her other works, but her image of Nan made me feel her emotional pain, pain and love. One thing that I consider the most important is the connection with the characters in everything that I see. If anyone has doubts about watching this movie ... Think twice! This is a must see series. Well done again on the BBC! We need more lesbian films that show true love and pain, like this one. Living in Canada, I imported this DVD and I am so glad I purchased it.
