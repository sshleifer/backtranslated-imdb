Genius or total madness? It depends on your interpretation of this movie. I responded to this at the level of a self-aware “parody of a police film,” and I sincerely hope that this was an intention, since I don’t see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for one seems to chew on the scenery and really imbued with the spirit of things! Is this film supposed to mark the departure of Rudd from his main background in the comedy genre? Any insane attempt to invent him as a cool action movie? I think no! <br /> <br /> With a silly, almost awkward game, a low-budget effect and crazy action scenes, it all reminded me of that old TV show “Sledgehammer” FUN !!! :-) <br /> <br /> Of course, maybe I misread the movie. If in fact it was an attempt to remove the "direct" fighter, then this is certainly an amusing failure !! <br /> <br /> Watch with lots of alcohol and a few companions !!! ;-)
