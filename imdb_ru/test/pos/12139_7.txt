I agree with all the strengths mentioned in other reviews, but here there are some rhythms that firmly hold him in the genre of crime drama or film noir and restrict him from turning into a great drama beyond the “elements” that make up the film noir - not to mention that the film’s great noirs are not / cannot / should not be great dramas either, but it’s not. <br /> <br /> Another note: the film is rarely used, but I would say that it is used to emphasize the action more often than the elements of the wife. <br /> <br /> An excellent setting for this film, by the way, with an unexpected endless ending, which either just the right or the hang-up depend. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow some features. <br /> <br /> A big turn in history involves what children see as their mother dies, or it must be a big moment. But children never react anyway. Neither cries nor asks his father what happened, the children are good actors, and the reaction of the father, I suppose, matters, but this is a big mistake. This is the essence of the story, and children mostly remain empty in their reaction. In fact, they simply do not exist; in the next scene, they look as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> Similarly, a connection arises between the characters of Belmondo and Ventura. Belmondo says that he knew a partner who was killed - but this is never explained and does not have a significant impact on Belmondo or anyone else. Belmondo's romantic plot also inspires confidence, although it has acted convincingly. The Ventura character simply allows Belmondo to involve a complete stranger in his escape plan for no reason. He does not even comment or does not seem to notice. Another space. <br /> <br /> The ending of the film, and I will not spoil it. The end happens behind the scenes with a careless voice to tell you what happened. I suppose this is trying to make him feel more believable, but again, like these other mistakes, leaves drama behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> What is the point of not solving these problems? I do not know, except that, perhaps, the film’s objectives were limited to giving the audience what it wanted from the criminal melodrama - to offer deeper elements, and then go on to ignore them. <br /> <br /> Too bad that there is a lot to recommend this film, Ventura is very, very good, but too bad that it could be a great drama, as well as a criminal story - as is the case with your favorite IMDb film of all since THE GODFATHER. This film had potential. This could serve as a good remake, although if it were done in the USA, the film probably would have been more troubled, but in the hands of the right director it would be a good remake, although it is doubtful that Ventura's performance could be higher. <br /> <br /> So it's worth a look, but generally upsets
