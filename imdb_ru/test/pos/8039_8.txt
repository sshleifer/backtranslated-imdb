Christian Duguy directed this little spy thriller at the beginning of his career. He plays on TV quite regularly, although with horrible scenes of violence and sex, unfortunately, curtailed. I finally took the time to view the theatrical version on a $ 3 cassette at a local video store. Naval officer Aidan Quinn was recruited to impersonate the notorious Carlos Jackal, and he got too carried away with this role. Donald Sutherland's Ben Kingsley plays the older Quinn, and Sutherland is a real fan, and Kingsley's more balanced. The first half of this funny movie shows Quinn, trained and familiar. In the second half he is in the field, making love with a woman of the Jackal and shooting at her various enemies. The idea is to make jackals look like defectors for Russians and let them take care of the most notorious killer in the world. Things are not quite as planned. At times, I almost expected the cast to laugh at some trite dialogues, but they all play very straight. In the end, this is one awesome little thriller that deserves your attention. Jackal's former mistress, teaching Quinn very correct and very married, to find fault with her, lick blood from her face, and then fall on her, one worth that price.
