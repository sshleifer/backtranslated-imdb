Deep blood ... This is one of those films that you are about, and you are not talking about any other Italian Jaws! Well, Deep Blood is far from that. It's cheap, because the movie can become popular, but on the other hand, it is also creative. In Jaws and in all the other shark films that we all saw or tell that they all use artificial sharks, in the Joe D'Amato film he uses a new approach, using all the video materials for his shark scenes. This is one of the many reasons why I like Deep Blood so much because she didn’t use video footage. <br /> <br /> In Deep Blood, an ancient Indian spirit terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark, in Joe D'Amato’s classic book Shark, Deep Blood. <br /> <br /> It seems that an Native American elder once warned a group of young people about this great evil in the sea, and years later, friends are forced to face their fears when one of them will be killed by a shark in a series of attacks along their coastline. Now the remaining few have to be sure that this monster is killed, even if it means to go to sea to do it. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato shot and made this film under his company Filmirage, released in 1989, later used in Bruno Matthew’s Cruel Jaws: Jaws 5, as well as in many other films about sharks. Joe D'Amato's Shark is a great movie, and any Joe D'Amato fan watching a shark should try it.
