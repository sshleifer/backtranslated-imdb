I personally did not know either Karen Carpenter or Richard in this regard, so I have to go the way the film portrayed her. I think that the best person to ask for his accuracy would be her brother Richard. However, from what I saw and learned about Karen, I felt her pain, shared her sadness, and she was a very special person for me when I was growing up. I know that I was not born until 1965, so I did not recognize her as much as some of you old fans, but I definitely grew up listening to her music, and I still have fond memories of her music. I remember the song about “Radio” (every sha la la la, everything, well, well, okay), etc., and I remember: “We just started! In fact, I remembered many, many of her songs. ” and some people (quite a few) tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to her !!! (I'm not kidding about this). I was also anorexic in high school and in college (1978-1987) to be accurate and weighed anywhere from 82 pounds to 120 pounds in 1987. I had some pretty serious health problems because it helped me identify with the actress Karen in the film. Mother (Agnes) was MUCH very similar to my mother in many and I could also feel the pain that Karen must have experienced. My mother was often insensitive, critical and disapproving, like Agnes (if that was true for accuracy). The film was useful for identifying and getting to know Karen on a more personal note — not just hearing her music, but also seeing what she went through. ultimately, depict a person’s entire life in 2-3 hours and accurately count every detail, so I must say that there is probably no such exact biography. I will give this story 8 though! I wish I knew Karen personally! I would die to meet her! I would love to shake her hand, hug her or talk to her. I feel her warmth and love every time I hear one of her songs, and I really miss her.
