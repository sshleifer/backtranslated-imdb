It was a very nice movie for men and women. Lots of nude nature / sex, but without the common delusions that you usually find. They could not have done a better job in the casting, as the whole ensemble was stunning. Believe me guys, if you want your woman to be in the mood, turn something with Bobby Johnston into it! And I'm sure that beautiful Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies will do it for any heterosexual man. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share the stage together, and if you know about the film where they do, please write me in PM! I'd like to know. The photo was much better than usual. So was the story. Predictable, but pleasant, good-natured and romantic. At least it wasnâ€™t one of those annoying predictable murder puzzles filled with bottle blonde women with huge fake breasts. I give it 7/10!
