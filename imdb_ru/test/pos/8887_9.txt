Today we live in sad times, when it seems that every comedy film and TV show is horribly unfunny and lacking cheap, rude or bad humor. Most people don't know what it means to really laugh at a comedy, and these people desperately need to watch "Throw Mom from the Train." I say without hesitation that this is one of the funniest films I've ever seen, from beginning to end. The comedy is so unpredictable and perverted that it makes us laugh out loud many times. Do not be deceived by the murder plot. The plot is not serious enough to make us worry or worry about what will happen. The story tells about a young man (Danny DeVito) who wants to get rid of his annoying, grouchy mother (Ann Ramsey nominated for an Oscar in a role that I think was completely perfect), and does this by killing Billy Crystal's wife. wanted to die for the theft of his novel. I do not want to spoil the jokes and jokes in this film, but all I can say is that you should watch this film if you want to laugh. Prompt and sincere, a real feast for comedy lovers and the type of film that you just do not see today. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
