Patricia Arquette plays the American doctor Laura Bowman, who leaves for Burma in an attempt to heal her spirit after killing her husband and young son. She stayed in Rangoon during hostilities and left the city with an aging man who works as a “guide”. But he is not a simple guide; he is a professor who introduces her to life outside of tourist traps ... the two of them are drawn into political upheavals, and Laura sees with her own eyes how the government betrays and oppresses her people. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites. Firstly, it is informational (describes some of the injustices that occur in Burma). Secondly, we are talking about the women's struggle for the search for the meaning of life after an incredible loss. Third, it is about compassion and sacrifice, and people come together without even knowing each other to endure pain and fear. <br /> <br /> Almost every beautiful scene in this film is important; nothing is missing here. This is a serious and touching film. There is also a very emotional score, compiled by Hans Zimmer, which perfectly complements the scenes. <br /> <br /> A definite recommendation, especially to people dealing with human rights issues ... and people who want to know: “What purpose can I serve? "<br /> <br />
