One of the best TV shows, if not the best. What for? Simply: he has the courage to show us real life in prison, without any cliches and predictable turns. This is not "Prison Break" or any other show, in fact, compared with "Oz" show "Soprano" look like a children's story. Abusive language, swearing, shots of sheer violence and drug use, disgusting scenes of male genitals and rape ... all this and more in Oz. But this is not the best part of Oz; characters are the strongest side of this show; they are all excellent and not annoying, even though we are looking at violent criminals. The actors are great, my favorite actors are playing Ryan O'Reilly and Tobias Beecher because they are so unique and completely change their behavior. And most of all ... they have no remorse for their actions. Overall ... Oz is a terrific show, the best of all. Forget about CSI and the show about stupid doctors ... this thing ... OZ!
