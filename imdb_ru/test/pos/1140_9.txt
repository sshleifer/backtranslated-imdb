This is a type of film that may need to be watched several times in order to capture all its beauty and intelligence (like the 1959 Frankenstein Curse). If you do not like strange non-core films, stay away from this masterpiece. For me, one piece of art in this film is worth the purchase price of videotapes. The storyline is a little fantastic, but it seems to be becoming a reality in our world today. The film, filmed in the 1980s, is a prophetic view of what will happen to the Big Government and Big Brother, who wants to control and control us. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of slow sections, and the dialogue can be quite difficult to catch in many scenes (that's why I watched it 6 times now), but if you can digest all this, it may be worth your while. <br /> <br /> The film is mainly about a world where people turned into robotic machines that have lost their individualism. They are interested only in accumulation and reproduction. The hero of the film did not succumb to this disease and was not "marked" and controlled by an older brother. His mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply that will change the way of thinking of human robots and allow individualism to become part of humanity again. <br /> <br /> Yes, its budget is very low, but for At one time, computer effects and sound effects are very unique, and the pictures are just adorable. If you have an open mind, this film should make an impression, and its prophetic visions scare.
