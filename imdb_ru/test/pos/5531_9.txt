It is not always clear that by mixing comedians together, you will laugh. Comics should love or admire each other, or be prepared to put up with each other's vagaries. GO WEST together with Marx Brothers made Buster Keaton write the script as a gag. Groucho didn’t value Keaton’s ideas too much and embarrassed him at the scriptwriters ’meeting. And although some of Keaton's gems still appear in the finished film (for example, a gun that turns into a brush that turns into a gun), the film was one of the weakest Marx brothers ever made. <br /> <br /> A best film, but also affected by dueling comic egos, was WC Fields and Mae West in MY LITTLE CHICADE, which threw the script for a series of duels from one liner between leads. But one liner was equally funny, so the film remains successful. <br /> <br /> But Six Types is an example of six comic books that worked well together. The reason is simple: in fact, three comic teams work together: Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, George Burns and Gracie Allan, and V.S. Fields and Alison Skipworth. In the 1930s, Ruggles and Boland were merged into about half a dozen comedies, usually with Boland as a somewhat domineering wife, and Ruggles with a nervous breakdown of her husband. The fields (as a rule, one act) were paired three times with Skipworth (TILLY AND GUS and if I had one million there were another two times). Skippy always figured out how to control or resist the thieves of her man - in this film she takes action with stolen money that is wanted (she knows that the local sheriff Fields is not the one to trust this). As for Burns and Allan, they manage without much effort to get involved in putting on Raggles and Boland on their cross-country drive in a car. <br /> <br /> Ruggles quickly realizes what a mistake it was to agree to travel with Gracie - at some point she manages to make him fall from a cliff and hang from a branch. He is relatively helpless when she insists on 1) taking a picture of him on a perch and 2) correcting his grammar. The presence of a huge dog George and Gracie (the so-called "Ran Tan Tang") does not facilitate the trip of Charlie and Mary. <br /> <br /> Fields has a few choices. When he insists on screaming at a quartet, he says that he is allowed to do it - he is a sheriff! He also explains, during a pool game, the incredible story of how he got his undeserved nickname “Honest John.” You should listen carefully to the story, as he is interrupted several times by his attempts to play billiards (once accidentally hitting a billiard ball), but it does show that there were objects that even Fields would have no reason to steal. <br /> <br /> Oh, in the Summary Line, I mentioned a forgotten actor named Bradley Page - he was the man responsible for the troubles Charlie Ruggles was suspected of. Bradley should have a reason to leave the city in order to catch up with the unwary Ruggles and Boland, so he calls his girlfriend. He tells her to call back to work and say that he must leave the city because someone has died. Pause. He obviously hears the question, shot by the girl. “NO ONE!” He says - clearly annoyed. Although the main part of the humor in the film is the sextet of the performers, Mr. Page had the most funny unexpected line in the film.
