Bridget Fonda disappointed me several times over the years, but she caught my attention in BREAK UP. It is true that important details are missing in several places, but I just continued to follow the Foundation closely to understand what was significant in this story, and it did not let me down. The look in her eyes in the last scene, when she takes courage, literally putting one foot in front of the other in her uncertain future, is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face action ever. I completely believed her, perhaps because I knew and admired a few “tough women” who had experienced such offensive situations. And they did it without becoming human haters, but this is my own encouraging projection of the character Funds on BREAK UP.
