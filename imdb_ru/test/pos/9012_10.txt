I never had to write reviews for anything, but such bad reviews about such an innovative show made me say something. First, people just need to overcome the fact that voices are different. When you watch an episode, it never comes to mind. The humor is original, and although, yes, some jokes are transferred from the film, they are delivered fresh. Some of them even resemble Shrek - self-referential humor. Many of these jokes seem to target teenagers or original film fans, as well as teenagers and younger. Patrick Warburton and Eartha Kitt are both funny, because they replay their roles as Kronk and Isma, and their nominations for the Annie Award were completely justified. <br /> <br /> This show takes time to fall in love in order to truly get into the “groove” about things, so to speak. If you ignore the horrible musical theme (which really should not justify how you rate the show, as it is only 30 seconds from the whole product), this show is a funny funny joke and it does not lose. any of the spirit of Emperor New Paz.
