This is a very nice, well-played film. It's funny and sometimes fun. The final is a bit disappointing, as he is trying to wrap everything up in a too neat package. The film is best remembered for its priceless vignettes: setting Jane Austen, a hike as an example. B & H does not attempt to reflect the prevailing attitude towards homosexuality and bisexuality. Most characters are quite tolerant of sexual diversity. In this sense, it is a joyful vacation from a homophobic society. And this is a celebration of flexibility, the weakening of hard sex categories - perhaps a happy forerunner of future events.
