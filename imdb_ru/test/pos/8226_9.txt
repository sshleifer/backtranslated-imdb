This film directed by George Fitzmouris, which has shot so many great films, is well in line with its excellent standards. This is a clear, witty, with some wonderful lines, and the inimitable Ronald Coleman in a romantic role. Coleman plays an irresistible charming younger son of a rich English peer. He is financially irresponsible (spending, for example, £ 15 of the last £ 20 in the world on a cute little terrier, whom he calls George), but he is open, wildly generous, scornful and noble, disrespectful in the most politically possible way and hopelessly sentimental. He is so dashing that all women fall in love with him. His girlfriend - the star of music halls, and, therefore, in 1930, a resident of Demimond played with her typical slender, narrow-eyed silkiness of the young Peaceful Loy. Fitzmouris was not a big fan of close-ups, and the gala of that day had their faces half hidden by these terrible clinging hats, so we don’t get as good flashes of faces of two heroines as we would like. In any case, the director seems to be more interested in charming Coleman. Romantic female role - young and fresh Loretta Young, who has not yet become proto-Julie Andrews, as we usually know her, but still was a reddened girl, exuding all the sweetness of the rose garden and having fun and laughing heartily all the time. Obviously, the character with her tremendous sense of humor was needed to appreciate the hypnotic social anarchism of the refreshing aristocratic character played by Coleman. The plot is almost irrelevant, as is often the case with these light and funny movies. It's just so much fun.
