It was good. It was one of those whom we received, but we do not have enough evidence, as long as the plot lines. In several films in which I saw her, I have never seen Stephanie Zimbalist. She is a professional television actress, but nothing special. Here, in this, she was definitely above average, how was the former fed (or was she fed on credit?) Profiler. Her character got along well with the motley group of police officers from the special investigation department with whom she was assigned. In fact, there was no stupid character on whom you would roll your eyes and just despise what was good. It is also good that it takes some time to find out who the killer is ... but when I found out, I was not so surprised. Well. Another thing that was good was the location in Los Angeles. It is possible that if this were done today, they would have used Toronto or Vancouver, but here they were actually filming in downtown Los Angeles. In a similar way (although I half-despise LA), I also liked the film. I don’t know if I’ll see him again, but it wasn’t that bad. My rating: B-
