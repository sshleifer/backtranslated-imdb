This film gives you more insight into how Australians act. Even though The Castle is a great Australian film, it is a bit off. This film is by far the best Australian film I have ever seen (I havenâ€™t seen Dirty Deals yet), and will probably be my favorite movie. The fact is that if you have not seen this, look. If crime / action / comedy is your thing.
