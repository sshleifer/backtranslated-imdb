“Pink Flamingo” is a film that cannot explain a single word. It was as good as I thought. It expands films. Starting with a “multiple” beginning and ending with a shocking, but smart ending, “Pink Flamingos” is one of the best films of the year. Do not miss the opportunity to watch a great movie. Rent it on video or watch me at midnight. But just look.
