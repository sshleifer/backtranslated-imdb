If you like mystery and obscurity, you will love this movie. To tell the truth, basically it was the role of Adrian Paul, because of which I raised her, I knew almost nothing about the film in advance. Plot: Sarah (Carly Pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, begins to play a mysterious puzzle game, trying to figure out the "cause", and intervenes in the "game", solving riddles. Vern (Adrian Paul) - the owner of the store, as well as a fanatic puzzles, which is also entangled in the game. The myth says that if you decide a game, the meaning of existence (referred to as “Design”) is revealed. The character of Brendan Fehr is a type of village idiot sticking around a store that turns out to be bigger than he seems. In general, I thought the film was pretty well made. And this is definitely an original concept, a rare find today! Personally, I like puzzles and puns, so although most of them were not very complicated, it was a funny movie. Worth renting. <br /> <br /> So, if you haven’t yet seen, you will get it! :-D <br /> <br />
