German-born Turkish film director Faith Akin captured in his film an endless variety of different styles of music and songs in Istanbul, a city that is a bridge between East and West, a city that is uniquely located on both sides of the Bosphorus, in Europe and in Asia. Kurdish conductors are represented by Ainur, who performs her own brand of Kurdish gospel music, passionate and melodic. We get acquainted with the gypsy instruments, Orhan Gensbey, who is called Elves Arabic music - the sounds of music are heard throughout the city, when Faith Akin takes us to underground clubs, to street performers and to recording sessions. German bassist Alexander Hakke, who comes to Istanbul to play and learn about Turkish music, quotes Confucius: “To understand this place, you have to listen to the music that it plays.” Akin's wonderful documentary does just that - gives us 90 minutes of music that helps cross bridges. It was especially interesting for me to watch the film, because I recently visited Istanbul as part of my vacation and spent four days there. The city fascinated me with its images, colors, crowds, brightness and visual beauty. Now I can add the sounds of music to the ever-changing portrait of Istanbul.
