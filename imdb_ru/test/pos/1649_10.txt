Many experienced and excellent actors united in the continuing plot of the ineffable portion of World War II on the eastern front. Characters are well depicted and unforgettable. One episode leaves much to be desired. Note the closing credits, which list thousands of battalions of penal battalions. Untold story with the participation of hundreds of thousands of people. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always full of real people and dialogues. Available with excellent kits and camera work. Heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people fighting for survival and overcoming the most terrible time. I want to buy a copy for my own collection to be able to enjoy the show again.
