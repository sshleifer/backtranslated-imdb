I saw this movie on TV late in the evening about 30 years ago in Buffalo, and I can't wait to see it again before I ... well ... you know. The interaction between the main characters after Tigris (Eli Wallach) “captures” his prey (Ann Jackson) in an unsuccessful abduction attempt is absolutely ridiculous. The image of Charles Nelson Reilly, the neurotic dean of the university (?) Or the head of the department is priceless. How many films can you name that can highlight the struggle of humanity for meaning and satisfaction, making you laugh from beginning to end? This film reminds us that we are all in the same struggle, regardless of class, race, gender or religion. And who can forget the scene of a suburban homeowner who, in his arms and knees, attacked those few tiny weeds that dared to appear on his ideal manicure lawn overnight!
