I first watched this movie in the video store and, being a fan of Bam Margera, I had to rent it to see what was going on. Since I have a huge and stupid (note the word "stupid") sense of humor, I found this film absolutely ridiculous. Some pieces are meaningless and random, but that makes them so funny. You need to think that things like a slap in the face and a cut on the watermelon's head are fun to appreciate this movie. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by the acting skills. These people really did a good job. Nothing worthy of an Oscar, but good enough to pass the level of an amateur. Teenagers and young people are likely to find it more interesting because of the modern slang and situations used. I would not advise to watch this with your parents, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Overall, the acting was great, the script was fun, and the story is really something you can relate to.
