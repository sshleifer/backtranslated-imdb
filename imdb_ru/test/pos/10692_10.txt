Wow. I have never seen or heard of this movie. He just came on TV (2 am), and I'm in complete fear. Installation: a bunch of rich fat golf cats. One hammers the ball in the bumps. It lands ninja !!!! Fit tuxedo to pick up the ball. Ninja grabs him. Crushes it in his hand. The man pulls the gun. Ninja pulls out a gun. Ninja blows a dart into the barrel of a pistol. WEAPON EXPLODES !!!! This is only the beginning of greatness, people. Everyone should see this movie. 10 big ol thick stars from the faithful.
