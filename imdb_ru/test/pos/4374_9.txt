Unfortunately, this is the last recorded HBO Karlin concert from the series, which lasted more than 30 years. Although this may not be his “best” work, it is excellent, fun and makes you wonder. This recording is also slightly different from most of his other concerts in that it is slightly longer than most of his other concerts. <br /> <br /> Over the course of his long, fruitful and influential career, Karlin moved from more observant humor and farting jokes to a more “humanitarian” point of view of society and culture. His attention to English and euphemism has increased over the years and ends with this performance. Although I would say that his audiobook “When will Jesus bring pork chops?” Best demonstrates his huge mind regarding language, euphemisms and parting our values. This is bad, because Ya. Is very indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer. <br /> <br /> If you are insulted by obscene language or humiliation of the church, you probably will not like it when someone from Karlin gets the material up. However, if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and tolerate language and blasphemy, you will probably enjoy this concert very much.
