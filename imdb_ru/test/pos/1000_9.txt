I was lucky to attend the London premiere of this film. Although I am not at all a fan of British drama, I was deeply touched by the heroes and the BAD CHOICE they made. I was in tears by the end of the film. Each scene was fascinating. The attention to detail and great game were quite impressive. <br /> <br /> I would have to agree with some other comments that ask here why all these women threw themselves at such a disgusting character. <Br /> <br /> ******* SPOLSTER WARNING ******** I also hoped that Dylan would have been killed by William when he had that opportunity! **** END SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley did an excellent job and radiated beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was the performance of Sienna Miller that was truly Oscar-worthy. <br /> <br /> I am sure that this product will be nominated for other awards.
