Forget some whiny (and meaningless) comments left here by some. This series is well-played, well-filmed and makes a refreshing change to most movies on television. <br /> <br /> Any fool can find fault with anything. However, in this show, the characters are believable, the storylines are intriguing and irresistible (but require some intelligence from the viewer), in general this is pleasant, and it is the British !! (Sometimes we come up with a few gems, and this is one of them). <br /> <br /> Each performance lasts one hour, and I think that there are four of them together (at least I only saw four of them). The show clearly impressed some American TV channels / directors who shot longer TV shows that were far from being so attractive, despite the larger budget. <br /> <br /> If you like soap films and reality shows, you wonâ€™t like or understand the Eleventh Hour.
