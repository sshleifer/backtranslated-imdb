I really love this movie. I have to get it on DVD. I have 2 copies of VHS, but the quality is so bad that you cannot read one written joke above the door of the chamber. I'm always surprised that Blankfield did almost nothing after that. He made both Dr. Jackl and Mr. Hyde completely believable. <br /> <br /> The film suffers because of its limited budget. (One brutal editing goes to the middle of the word and was described on Siskel & Ebert.) But there are a thousand jokes, circuses, elusive references that more than compensate. I often quote lines (or sing “I have nothing to hide”) and from time to time I fully describe the scene that corresponds to some conversation. There are at least six scenes that are some of my all-time favorite comedy episodes. <br /> <br /> Viewers who do not have a history of cocaine use can miss a lot of jokes. <br /> <br /> "Here, take this." * A visual look at driving, when he waves, butt to the window. * "I said," Is this seat taken? "" A good burn! »Visual information about guys, headgear, bandage and fins. * "Yes. I'm right handed." * "I! I!" says a woman trying to sell nads. * "Bernie will like it." * "These are my legs, Jack." says black feet. * "Why should we tell you?" ... "IT'S IN THE SUPERMARKET!" * "Ivy!" in the PA supermarket. * Loading the entire basket in an ambulance. * etc.
