I had the pleasure of watching this film when I was 10 years old (with an existing interest in Egyptology). I know that there are subtle mistakes in artistic direction and costumes, but overall this is the best film to date with the appearance of the 18th dynasty. <br /> <br /> The film only brings closer to the film “Egyptian” by Miki Walteri. ", in the plot. A good part of the text never got to the cinema, since we must take into account the duration. <br /> <br /> The notes of B. Hermann and Alfred Newman are wonderful !!! The following performances. The late Edmond Purdom performed well in the role of an orphan child adopted by parents after the birth of a child.He declares that he is in control, has the best education available and admits that he is quite an emotionally distant person, considering his upbringing and high intelligence. <br /> <br /> Jin Simmons is good as a modest maid in a tavern; loving and sincere. Bella Darvi, people complained about her accent, well, she's a Babylonian. In the film, it's not so obvious why Xingghu is so madly obsessed with Nefer Nefer Nefer. Her correct name. In the book, Xinghue enjoys her carnal fruits and revenge early conspiracy, leaving Nefer Nefer Nefer Nefer along with the workers of the House of the Dead. <br /> <br /> Gin Tierney as Bucketten is gorgeous! When she tells Xinhue that he is Pharaoh, she looks like she can eat him ( in his weakness). She is bright, brilliant and coolly beautiful. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding is painfully tragic in his mission so that all people will know his one God. I believe that we are looking at Anhnaton through the prism of Egyptologist A. Weigall. The presentation at the time, which, before the Messiah, was a premonition for Anknaton's vocation. Has monotheism influenced the Jewish people? Notice psalm 104. and other Egyptian images in psalms? <br /> <br /> Mr. Peter Ustinov provided an alter-ego Xinghue. He is street wise and cunning survivor. Great game, as always. <br /> <br /> Mature never thought about his game personally, his Horemheb is beautiful as an ambitious “super patriot” who ultimately kills Xinghu more than one person in his quest for power (Walteri book). <br /> <br /> I felt that the ending of the Egyptian was confusing, since Xinhe's personality changes too easily. He has a living son (He dies in the novel), power is transferred to him through the half-sister Buketaten, he now understands the world and has control over international affairs. So he became enlightened? He could change the Amonic Priesthood as much as he could. <br /> <br /> But NO! Does Xinhue give up everything, including the future of his son, to become a ragged beggar, preaching monotheistic love? <br /> <br /> This change was too immediate and the main drawback of the script! <br /> <br /> Again, the film’s appearance, color, most costumes (Nefer Nefer Nefer’s golden dress was too luxurious because she was more richly dressed than the royal family), the music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I will watch this movie again easily. <br /> <br /> PS I know that you probably know that Horemheb did not directly replace Anknatan, but I could not resist, stating this fact.
