When Wallace and Gromit took to the stage in their short contest “Great Day”, they created a new look at the glination. After two more shorts, Aardman’s dynamic duo returned to this very pleasant and interesting film. He has a great voice, humorous jokes and good animation, as only Aardman could have done! <br /> <br /> In this film, Wallace and Gromit run Anti-Pesto, a rabbit removal company. When it became known that the “rabbit-werewolf” eats all the vegetables in the city, madness begins. Of course, Victor Quartermain, a handsome, waving crest outside the city, wants to get a rabbit to impress the beautiful lady Tottington ... but can our favorite duet Aardman save the day before the chaos? <br /> <I have to say that the jokes were fun. One point, the villain, Quartermaine's quiz, showed the prey crack, prompting the character to shout: “BEWARE ... LUNA !!!” Harvest Aardman! <br /> <br /> Characters are clear and funny. Our favorite Aardman team from Man and Dog entertains us as soon as they can, earning them their second Oscar (remember “Great weekend?”). Helena Bonham Carter was amazing, like the beautiful lady Tottington, the love interest of Wallace. Ralph Fiennes was a particularly funny and bad omen, like a sly wig dressed in the hunter Victor Quartermein. But the one who really stole the show was a priest whose antics turned out to be a funny comic relief. <br /> <br /> Hats off to Aardman for creating another Wallace and Gromit masterpiece!
