“Blade” would be an extremely good comic, action / horror “Vampire Hunter”, if not for two small flaws. # 1 I liked to see how invincible blade / snipes make their cuts and cuts, but all this is "Yes!" fist / punch was literally a disappointment. # 2 Bad, not so bad, CGI ?? even for the 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third, but some are scattered around. Well, despite these minor violations, I really liked this film. All the actors did work in the suburbs, and the fact that it now looks like another robbery of The Matrix is ​​funny, considering that it was released a year earlier. So, perhaps, "Matrix" copied the "Blade". In any case, this is a very interesting film for different genre viewers: fans of comics, action movie fans and horror / vampire lovers. So, we have Blade, half man / half-vampire, or “day walker”, and his peer Wiesler (a la “Batman and Alfred”) are fighting undead, which apparently is almost from people. Who knew? In the rare case of humanity (Blade's more antihero), our ninja / vamp sword saves a recently infected (coincidentally) blood specialist / doctor. Meanwhile, trouble is brewing among vampires, because someone wants (you guessed it) a higher power and somehow needs a Blade to get it. This is not the most original concept, if you read what I just wrote, but still very pleasant. You want the Blade to succeed, you will root for it, despite its flaws and manners. And you will know what will happen as this is a typical 1-2-3 act from a comic strip introduction movie. However, look at this without trying to go too deep. Such as the Vampire SPF-1000 "Tanning Lotion"? Indeed? What about scalp? Wouldn't that burn yet? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Well, I'm going too deep. Once again, relax and enjoy a techno-charged, fun ride.
