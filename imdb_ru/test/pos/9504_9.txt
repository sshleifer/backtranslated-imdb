“Icky Flix” is a great starting point for anyone interested in a little resident interest. Most of their classic videos are present (although “Earth vs. Flying Saucer” and “Don't Be Cruelful”, strangely enough, are absent), and the “concentrates” of their various projects on CDs give seductive glimpses of how as they understood that MTV no longer brought them into a strong rotation (or, indeed, a video show). <br /> <br /> All the videos in this collection show striking images and unique music (with a selection of original tracks and newly recorded ones). And two of them - “The Third Reich and Roll” and “Films in One Minute” - are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Check out this DVD and find out why.
