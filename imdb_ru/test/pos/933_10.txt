The final part of the Kieslowski trilogy, based on the colors of the French flag, finds the director in the world with the metaphysical and transcendental nature of the cinematic image. In red, images are paramount, as well as obvious, but clever color coding. However, instead of sticking to empty aesthetic tweaks based on "cinema of sight", "Paint Kislovsky" is a multi-layered tightly planned meditation on the nature of fate and love. In red, love and destiny are interconnected but complex concepts dictated by both human wonders and invisible parallel associations that seem to pass by us. You feel that Red is really an allegory, a re-creation of Prospero's ubiquitous gestures in The Tempest, but it is more than it seems. Red requires countless views, and with each view something new is found that weaves into an already immaculately constructed structure. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that Red stands out as a masterpiece from Kieslowski, it is best seen as part of the trilogy. The elements of Blue and White are marked in red, which will appeal to viewers.
