Love Jones is one of the best films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The main element that strikes me is that it is very well directed. I studied this film entirely - with watching movies more than once, some things subconsciously originate from you - the direction of this film, as well as the script - chic, fashionable and cunning! I'm in love with direction. The scene when Larenz Tate and Nia Long ride a motorcycle through the night north of Chicago is amazing. The director of this film has earned awards for excellent work. <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a stylish and sexy movie. This underlines the fact that we can be people who love, who have flaws, who love to live, study, and just be us without frustration. To be youreself. <br /> <br /> Poetry is beautiful, but the plotline, the dialogue and the scenes really make this film. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be seen. This is a great film for lovers and friends to sit back and watch, or a hopeless romantic (like me) to sit back and enjoy alone on a Friday or Saturday night. Any day of the week when peace, solitude and a little entertainment are needed, Love Jones is what I recommend.
