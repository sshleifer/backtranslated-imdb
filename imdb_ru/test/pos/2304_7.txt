A truly ghastly ghost story, full of chills and sensuality, this film simply does not match what it promises. It seems to be based on the old ghost story and, perhaps, relies too much on a simple premise. He was creative and truly exciting most of the way, but in the end he almost like Oshima simply lost interest in him and quickly brought it to the end. <br /> <br /> The story is simple - a woman and her younger lover kill her husband so they can be together. But their failure of nerves and his returning ghost doom them to madness. His beautifully crafted, with original scenes, and the passion of lovers depicted beautifully. But too often the film does not fulfill its promise, almost as if Oshima lost composure in the same way that lovers do. <br /> <br /> It’s worth watching a movie to see how Oshima combines his skill as a director with some tricks of the movie to captivate an audience, but unfortunately this is not a real classic in films like Onibaba or “Woman dunes ".
