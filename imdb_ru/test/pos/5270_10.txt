I consider this film to be one of the most interesting and fun movies of all time. There are so many intelligent thoughts in it that the one who thinks that the film is terrible did not understand him and is unable to correctly recognize the really deep philosophical themes that exist in him (in all three Schneider films). Several universities in Germany and across Europe conducted research on how Schneider sees things. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and one of the jazz musicians in Germany (maybe in Europe). It is mainly inspired by the great M. Davis and T. Monk. Therefore, if you do not like it, this is normal, but please do not try to convince others that it can be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. Because if you had to face this opinion in the discussion and if you really want to study the art of H. Schneider, you would have to “give up”.
