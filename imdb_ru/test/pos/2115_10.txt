This is the film that I grew up on. This is a great family fun that children love as well as parents. I would like more movies like this to be made. This is a great story about a little boy who brings up the Bull with his mother and sister and shows him right up to the National Grand Championship where he wins! Then he is afraid that someone is preparing a barbecue for his bull, so he kidnaps him and goes home with him. I was very excited when I first saw this film in the theater, and was surprised to see George Strait, Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis in this little film. The music was great with all sorts of huge country titles like Willie Nelson and Dixie Chicks. Anyone who does not love this film has no children or has never been a child himself.
