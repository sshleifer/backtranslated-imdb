Oh, how refreshing the vision of 18th-century England, full of mud, pox and gibbet ... and accompanied by a delightful techno soundtrack for download. This is a story about the oppressed robber Plunkette (Robert Carlisle) and Captain MacLean, who fell on hard times, and how they get together and rob the aristo pigs. Plunkett is a tough nut, but McClean is too polite for this and therefore becomes a “robber gentleman”. He falls in love with Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler) (who, frankly, is the only weak side of the whole shebang) and wants to impress her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are fantastic. Large, colorful, historically characterized by beautiful toads. Alan Cummings gets all the best themes and best features, like Lord Rochester, with very non-18th century piercing. The music switches between cool, glorious choirs and loud bass techno, which is not embarrassing, as you think, this should happen in a historical film. The script is moving fast and replete with modern spoken language; Merchant of ivory, it is not. There are funny parts, disgusting parts, "sit on the edge of your seat and gnaw your nails" parts, but it all puffs forward and entertains you wonderfully everywhere. This is what you need in the movie. Unmissable.
