This is the best work I have ever seen with Van Damme. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is trying to stop heroin smugglers trying to enter the United States. The action in this film is great, and the scenes of the battles are rated as best by Van Damme. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further evidence, check “Undisputed 2”. Adkins is so good that, before I watched The Shepherd, I thought that Van Damme might not look believable by defeating him on the screen. Van Damme has his strength, and although he is not as athletic as Adkins, he can still kick with the best of them. All the scenes of the battles in this film are very well done, and gunfights with above-average weapons for this type of film. The only negative thing I can say about this film is that the story is a bit underdeveloped. I think that the motives of Van Damme's character should have been presented earlier in the film, especially with regard to why he wears a rabbit. The reason he does this is very cool, but you won’t find out until the very end. There are a couple of other things that were never really explained, but this is a Van Damme film, so you know where the priority is in making such a film, not in character development. In general, this is a good fighter that I recommend. So run to the border Damme!
