Well, not much to say about it. But it is really good. Very good work from director Softly, and the film has a good cast. The plot of the film is also believable and ... hehe good. So good is the main word in this case. I just hope there will be more such good science fiction movies. That is why it is indicated in the crowd. I give it 8.5 out of 10
