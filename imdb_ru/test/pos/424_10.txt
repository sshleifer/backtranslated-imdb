I love this show. It cleverly and very well acted. David Morse and Andr√© Brauger have excellent chemistry. Writing is clever, and the plots usually give great comic relief. After each new episode, I always wonder how it makes you think and entertains at the same time. My only complaint would be Donna Murphy's absence, for now, in the second season. As David Morse's ex-wife, Heather, she added such a character to the show. <br /> <br /> I think this show is the merit of the genre of crime / drama. With that said, I cannot understand for all my life why this show has such a low rating. Someone, please, who gave this show 1 rating, reinforce it with criticism?
