I wish I could meet Ida Lupino. When people ask who you are, could you invite 6 outstanding people from the 20th century to dinner, well, for me, one person is her. I think she is now one of the great unnoticed and unprofessional personalities in the film industry. Her life story would make an excellent television film (Hey, Mr. Bogdanovich ........). Ida Lupino was the driving force behind many exciting films about the noir of the 40s and 50s. I remember being saddened to see that she turned into a terrible role in the terrible AIP film in the late 70s. She was bitten by a big worm in the kitchen sink. Ugh. I should have contacted her when she died soon after ... more from that part than from the worm too. From High Sierra, Roadhouse and the extraordinary thriller RKO On Dangerous Ground, Ida Lupino has often been a producer and lead actress. Later, together with her husband Howard Duff, they put on many now endless noir-style dramas, which are still very interesting. One of them is JENNIFER, which, I think, is the last copyright film of Monogram Pictures. Monogram officially changed the company name to Allied Artists in 1953, and JENNIFER has both company names in the opening credits. This is an excellent homely thriller with ghosts, as scary as "Innocent" and "Ghosts", made 8 years later. This tiny film, really scary and very creepy, is the very really good film that Ida Lupino made and was responsible for. Try and find it ... you will always remember it and, as I feel, admire this great and almost forgotten actress / producer.
