(Some spoilers are included :) <br /> <br /> Although many commentators have called this film surreal, the term is poorly suited here. To quote from the Encyclopedia of Britannica: surreal meaning: <br /> <br /> “Fantastic or inappropriate images”: it’s not necessary to explain to the inconceivable how many ways a brave ten-year-old boy as a whole and aspiring to find his happiness in a red Mustang driver’s place could be fantastic: the curious could read James Kincaid; but if you asked what the guy said was, how inappropriate it is to drive a sports car, he would certainly say: “NO!” What fantasies and discrepancies the film offers mostly appear in the first fifteen minutes. After that, we get more iterations of the same, in a coarser and poorer progression, which, by no means irrelevant, soon turns out to be predictable. Not that it was, on the other hand, literally plausible - but it would be unfair to impose on Motorrama, in particular, this disadvantage, when any plausible suspension of disbelief fell sharply on the scale of values ​​of a typical director and director since the Lost Ark Raiders "Became a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Hallucinators: How do we know what a hallucination is, if part of having one does not know that we have it? In any case, some people know that they like “hallucinogenic drugs”, but if Motorama personifies the result of this, I do not understand why someone will take them more than once. There are, of course, random failed trips. The film should be one of those pun and all that. <br /> <br /> “Matching words that struck”: how many times a ten-year-old child can strike you by saying, “Oh my God!” when he likes something or “Damn!” when he doesn't do that? These two interjections are approximately equal to the course with this scenario. Unfortunately, any sensation of surrealism in that which speaks of dialogue can only directly reveal the naivety of a person with respect to the speech patterns of the younger American generation. <br /> <br /> “The world is fully defined and described in detail, but it has no rational meaning:“ The world of Motorrama really does not make sense, but it is about as defined as a caricature in an elementary school newspaper. All the numerous guest stars in the cast play comeo roles, even less intelligent than our little hero who exclaims "Damn!" In the blink of an eye lashes, but it takes a few seconds to come up with a weak lie. And even * his * character, despite the fact that he appears in almost every scene, does not receive significant development. This is a scant reward for any viewer who sympathizes, as I should, enough to want to know him better and understand "where he comes from." Someone vaguely feels a much better story, and the main character struggles to break free. <br /> <br /> “Fully recognizable, realistically drawn images are removed from their usual context and re-assembled in ambiguous, paradoxical or shocking frames.” No, we see a series of stereotyped and increasingly dilapidated billboards, gas stations, snack bars with a greasy spoon, cheap hotels and their inhabitants living on the roadsides, along the country's highways, exactly where they are stereotyped. <br /> <br /> to perpetuate ... the traditional emphasis on content ". In Motorama, from time to time there is little information. <br /> <br /> To sum up: imagine British millionaires dressed as clowns or pirates along the way on a gorgeous costume party, sitting silently and silently, like cautious inch-inch Rolls-Royce drivers, like fragile Scythians, through the swirling sea of ​​desperate humanity, the Chinese, who ask them through the windows and smear blood on the glass. Or imagine a stadium full of abandoned antiques limousines like those that are rusting now, and white pianos ringing with ghosts. Exhausted boy and a sick woman wander into this detritus, for which he clings like a mother’s figure, turning into a girlfriend who falls asleep side by side on the grass. The “white and brilliant” day of 1945 is from a bright flash on the horizon that is not the rising sun. When he discovered that his wife had become a corpse, he first believed that he had witnessed her soul rise to heaven. Later he explains only a little more innocent: “Today I learned a new word: the atomic bomb. This is how God takes pictures. Now * there are * only two samples of cinematic surrealism, surrealism, whose ironies are spread far enough to penetrate the very name of his film: Empire of the Sun. If you are looking for a surreal, * please * do not miss. Alas, no matter how hard he pressed on the accelerator to rush on his chariot across the desert and beyond, no poor scene, so exquisitely strange, rich, sophisticated or magnificent, awaits the poor little Motorrama in his search. <br /> <br /> None of the above necessarily makes up the thumbs up on this film. Although I am somewhat disappointed, I cannot dismiss him, given the respectability of another genre that he illustrates - which, of course, was influenced by surrealism, but also expressionism, existentialism and pessimism of Franz Kafka among the all-powerful power structures. Let's try on the size: Theater of the Absurd. <br /> <br /> Addressing the article by E. B. About this style, I am amazed at how far the Theater of the Absurd is a real artistic style, the above objections against Motorrama disappear like a cloud of smoke. I am tempted to quote the entire text in support of identification. <br /> <br /> Theater of the Absurd is trying to show that “the human situation is essentially absurd, devoid of purpose ... humanity remains hopeless in confusion and anxiety. ”: Immediately reaching his goal - to get away from difficult family life among quarreling parents, Gus turns out to be aimless until he passes a glittering billboard with the inscription“ Motorama ”and decides to win the lottery he promised. As others have shown, this ambition turns out to be illusory: although the game “never expires,” the sponsoring corporation does not intend for anyone to win, and has ways to deceive, confuse and leave any contender for reward depressed. He, like others, is ultimately disappointed with his dream. <br /> <br /> “The absurdist playwrights, therefore, have done away with most of the logical structure of traditional theater. Few dramatic actions, as is commonly understood, although the characters act fiercely, their employment underscores the fact that nothing changes their existence ... an eternal, round quality arises. ” "The language in the absurdist play is full of ... repetitions ... repetitions of the obvious, until it sounds like nonsense." Under the sometimes “dazzling comic surface” we find “the main message of metaphysical disaster”. Gus's obsession with a stupid game, his senseless language, a plot device, in which he guesses a grim future and / or returns to an earlier moment and takes another, but still a grim turn - so much is appropriate now. While a surrealist fan can better cope with some Spielberg films, Motorama fans, as they really are, must find fellow travelers - not instead of, but on, in the works of Beckett, Ionesco and Genet. br /> <br /> But you can't stop here. After disappointment in the game, Gus returns to Phil (that is, to Love), to the first friend he met, and to one man who treated him with dignity, although he also scolded him - at a service station advertising "Be". full filled! ". Under Phil's care, he learns life while waiting for cars. Here it can be noted that the absurdist playwright Beckett called his most famous play “Waiting for Godot,” and for Godot we must read “God.” God is one of Phil's concerns. In addition, as an indirect result of his previous meeting with Gus, Phil is badly crippled and makes a throw, stretching his arms straight horizontally. In the last scene, Gus, now Phil's protege, says he wants to listen to music. We hear nothing, but we see Phil moving his fingers at the end of the outstretched arm, calling Gus closer, and Gus answers. The end. <br /> <br /> Finally, the author I am currently reading is Anglican theologian William Stringfellow. If this rebel attorney is not recognized by the architect or founder of Liberation Theology, which is more Roman Catholic than Anglican, it probably should be. Police brutality and corporate greed are clichés in film and literature, including Motorama, but Stringfellow supports and illuminates such feelings with impressive testimonies from the scriptures, traditions, and reason. <br /> <br /> His most significant work is exposing the earthly activities of those fallen angels, which the Bible calls the principalities and powers. The principles, Stringfellow wrote, stand behind all of our three popular concepts: images, institutions, and ideologies. All of them give themselves to our worship, giving false promises. The deeper he is connected with the image, institution or ideology of any person, the more his personality becomes “exhausted” and becomes his slave. By promising power, control, and immortality, they inexorably deliver helplessness, chaos, and death. Being essentially fallen, defeated forces, they can do nothing more. However, they are deceiving people with this “dominion over the earth” promised by God in the book of Genesis, while in fact none of us control the image, institution, or ideology that is inevitably prone to hegemony and self-preservation. They take on life. "Dominion" is a wrong translation: a more accurate translation of Hebrew would be "management". But this is a niggle of a more fundamental problem: most of us don’t notice that God transferred this power to Adam before the fall. We have no reason to assume that we, his descendants, still use it now: on the contrary, it should be obvious that demonic forces have stolen it from us. <br /> <br /> You can add two comments about C. C. Lewis. First, the fact that the “human conquest of nature” is a simple illusion and a ploy to hide the fact that they really speak about the conquest of some people by other people with nature as a tool; and secondly, contrary to popular belief, Satan is not one of those who have a good time, Charlie. At first, he can be a pleasure, but he is very stingy with them and takes them away from any person who is in his captivity, perhaps leaving his prey sitting in front of the fire, feeling sorry for himself and boiling for resentment. <Br /> <br /> Now, applying these ideas to Motorama, we seem to wonderfully reflect them in Gus's experience. He is, if not a good, at least a cute little boy before falling prey to the game of Motorama. The first signs of advertising shine brilliantly. However, the longer he continues and the deeper he moves to the headquarters of the sponsoring corporation, the more worn they become. He is alone, not dating anyone who plays the game. The stations that dealt the cards have either collapsed or zombies are manned. The people he meets on this path are becoming more and more ugly, deceitful and hostile. (The fact that the principalities correspond to a common dictator does not mean that they can tolerate each other). Gus's humanity is washed out of it, as it becomes not only completely selfish and not paying attention to the needs of others, but also partially blinded ... disfigured ... prematurely aged, at the same time literally infantile linguistically disputed. In the end, even his precious Mustang was taken from him in an accident, and he must continue the crash of the dead. And yet, finally, having done everything that he thought was expected, he presents himself to the principality in his proud tower to receive his prize. Using biblical power to confuse those who built such monuments for their own vanity, his agents evade him, disappoint, insult and finally throw him out of the upper floor. He FALLS long and hard, landing, finally, in the pond. In other words, in classical symbolism he dies. He met the inevitable bad end of anyone who believed in such a deceiver. <br /> <br /> But this fate turns out to be only a warning look into a volatile future. He repents and returns to Phil, and, seeing him, commits the very first generous, selfless act that we saw from him for almost an hour and a half: noting that Phil is now disabled and can barely insert the hose into the gas tank, he asks: “I can Can I help you with this? ”Then, seeing the“ Help Required ”sign, he decides to apply for a job explaining to the motorist with whom he hitchhiked that he expects to get here because it doesn’t look too bad a place to work. <br /> <br /> Of course, this interpretation is conjectural, and it can surprise or even offend the fans of the “cult classics” of the film, who see completely different moments in it. <br /> <br /> If Motorama is not really my cup of tea, I am at least now convinced that this is almost the worst film ever made.
