In the final credits of “Shadows,” after we read “Director John Cassavetes,” several white letters can be seen on the screen: “The film you just saw is improvised,” they say. I always pursue the fact that words are so important in cinema, since filmmakers began to use them, because, in fact, there is no film without a script and for many other reasons. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes pursued the same goal, and he believed in freedom of speech; Shadows is a great example. This is a film without real main characters, without real storylines; these are mostly people in different situations talking. Yes, some situations are connected, but Cassavetes, apparently, is always in a hurry to proceed to the conversation, using fast-forward technique, when the characters leave or run away from someone and do not speak. <br /> <br /> The appearances are all in this film. For example, there is a brilliant score full of jazz influences and lots of fantastic solos, and there is one character who says that he is a jazz musician and plays the trumpet (Ben, the names of all the characters coincide with the names of the actors). However, we never see him playing trumpet or jam with a group; he does not even talk about music and just walks with his friends around the city. They talk a lot, and about everything that they have in mind; moving from how smart each one is to a fun analysis of the sculpture. <br /> <br /> “Shadows” is fun with its intellectual links in parts like the one above, because these friends are not cultural. However, the only important female character in the film (Lelia) wants to be an intellectual. But again, she has one very interesting conversation with an older man at a party, about the book she is trying to write, and how to confront reality; but nothing to do with being intelligent. At the same party, the woman actually makes an intelligent statement, full of complexity, and asks the guy next to her: “Do you agree?”. “Yes,” he says, but you can say that he does not know what she is talking about. <br /> <br /> Another character, the singer (Hugh), occasionally talks about the days of his glory, and we see him perform only once; but there are no references to the music industry. The focus of Cassavetis is the relationship of the singer with his manager (Rupert), which in most cases include chats about trivial things, rather than real "musical" conversations. Thus, the important work of the trumpeter in "Shadows" is the time he spends with his friends; An intellectual girl imitator is her way of maintaining a romantic relationship (one of the film’s strengths), and the singer is having a connection with her manager ?? Appearance. <br /> <br /> The reason why performances are not important in this film is simple. Cassavethis needed people who could master improvisation, no matter if they were really good. I believe that some of them are not, but they probably know how to improvise in the scene, and you can see how well they do it. "Shadows" is not about performers; This is a way to create a movie based on the magic of conversation; and there you can say that the performances mean something. <br /> <br /> That's why in every conversation the camera looks like a stalker, constantly in the eyes of each character, constantly looking for expressions that come with natural speech. There is a scene where the trumpeter and his friends are trying to pick up some girls. There are three of them, so each of them sits next to the same girl (girls, three, two) at three different tables. They all talk at the same time, and the camera shoots the table, and sometimes friends look at each other while they say what they say. It `s naturally.
