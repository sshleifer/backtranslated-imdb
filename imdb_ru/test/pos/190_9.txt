Fairy-tale cinematography from Sergey Urusevsky will help make this an amazing piece. The initial scenes seem to flip through an album of some main photographer, and when the story begins to unfold, we are swept away with the events depicted and with a beautiful view. Everything is well filmed, but there are several whole episodes that are simply breathtaking. It is difficult to describe without “damage”, but suffice it to say that one of them is a very intense scene during an air raid, and the lady and brother of her lover left behind, because the sirens and windows break. The other imposes a spinning ladder and a spinning shot of the treetops and even turns into a fantastic sequence. Soviet film industry of the highest order.
