I saw this film many years ago, and it never leaves my list of the best films of all time. When I first looked at it, I was just starting what became a passion for justice. He gave an interesting perspective on the death penalty, and also gave me a few things to think about. <br /> <br /> When you have such an cast, you are right in believing that it will be nothing short of fabulous. This is definitely the best role I have ever seen in the role of Sean Penn (along with me - Sam). He plays a role without embellishing his actions in doing so. He manages to maintain the level of debauchery throughout the film, which, I think, was very important. Until the very end, he is not trying to be considered as something more than he is. He is a sick man who regrets his past, but is still justified for it. Ultimately, he can gain self-esteem as much as a condemned (and guilty) murderer with the help of Susan Sarandon’s character, Helen Pregin’s sister. Her character taught me goodwill towards others, not making me forget how horrible a person’s actions can be, and not making excuses for them. <br /> <br /> The cast was also top notch. I was surprised to see the little cameo of Jack Black in this film, given the funny person he became today! I liked this film for personal reasons and simply because it was a work of cinematic art. And, in my opinion, this is one of the rare exceptions, when the film has moved far the book.
