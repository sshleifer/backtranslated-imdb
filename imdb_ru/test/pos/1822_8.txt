This film is one of my favorite movies ever, and this is what made me a Nicholas Cage fan for all my life. Back in the mid-80s, I recorded this film on tape (when the VCR was impossible to do with !!) and watched it again and again. Nicolas Cage is just great here. And he looks great and has no “acting roles” (see “Peggy Sue Got Married” to find out what I mean about that !!). I compare all his performances with this. He was played as great as a cool punk guy with sharp friends. The music was GREAT. Plimsula! Psychedelic furs! Modern English! Men at work! Whenever I hear “Melt With You”, they return me to the final of this film. <br /> <br /> What happened to his pretty girlfriend Deborah Foreman? And his hysterical friend Cameron Dai? Of course, took a different turn than Nicholas! Interestingly, a slutty girlfriend (Elizabeth Daily) eventually became the voice of Tommy from Rugrats (she is exposed as E.G. Daily for this terrible show)! Strange! <br /> <br /> If you want to go on a trip to the 80s, watch this movie. It is definitely a classic. How completely!
