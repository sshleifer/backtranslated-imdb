In a really neat circle about Hitchcock, Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny DeVito) lead unpleasant lives: Larry's ex-wife grew rich by publishing a book he wrote, and Owen has the most powerful mother she can imagine. When Larry tells Owen to calm down, looking at "Strangers on the train," Owen comes to the conclusion that they should commit recurring murders, as in the film. And just like in the movie, Larry thinks it's a joke, but Owen is serious. <br /> <br /> I never know how they came up with the idea of ​​“Throw Mom out of the train”, but this is a funny movie. This is not a boring moment. And this ending was a scream. Crystal and DeVito are at their best, and Ann Ramsey is just as bad a girl as in Guni. Modern classic.
