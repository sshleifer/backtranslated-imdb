This is a great family sitcom. Rowan Atkinson appeared on other great sitcoms: Thin Blue Line (better than this) and Black Adder (not better than this). <br /> <br /> Mr Bean is not a talking human catastrophe. He walks in places and gets into absolute chaos, chaos includes: Climbing to the top board for jumping and he is too scared to jump, which takes about 20 minutes, until some children finally throw him off in a washing machine driving his car while sitting on the roof. Bean drives the Mini and he has teddy. <br /> <br /> It was very similar to the series “Bald Man”, in which the main role is played by Gregor Fisher, who speaks very little, but turns out to be in disarray. Episode 9: Bean throws a party on New Year's Eve, then gets things to decorate his apartment, but he has too many things and he has to drive a car on the roof.
