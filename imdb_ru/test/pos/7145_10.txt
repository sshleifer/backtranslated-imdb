This version did not touch me as deeply as the later Hollywood version with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. While it was beautifully filmed and superbly acted, the BBC version was more packed with dialogue, which conveyed the information I found fascinating. This gave me a detailed understanding of the intellectual, theological, and moral considerations that motivated S. S. Lewis. Therefore, it was more interesting and stimulating than the Hollywood version, but not so impressive or spectacular. However, although I did not leave a lot of Kleenex mud in the theater, I used it at frequent intervals. I enjoyed this film as much as the Hollywood version, and was grateful for the increased understanding that I received.
