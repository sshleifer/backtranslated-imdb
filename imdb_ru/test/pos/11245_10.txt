The show itself basically reflects the typical character of average youth; club parties are a party and picking up chicks. People do not approve of the show because of its “perverted” idea of ​​picking up girls using technology and strategic characteristics, but, in truth, almost every young guy does it in a club. In general, the show really attracts young people, as we like to see the result of the “player” performance at the club, since the show offers a comic approach, which was made possible by the panel of judges. <br /> <br /> 10/10; cool, fun and exciting series that allows viewers to truly interact. Good job guys.
