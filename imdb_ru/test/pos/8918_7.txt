I admit that this film was terrible, stupid, sexist, badly dubbed and badly edited, but I still loved it. I first saw this film when I was 14 years old, and since then it has been stuck with me. FYI, this is very close to hard-core porn, as I recall. It certainly made my juices flow. This click gives a completely new meaning to Swedish erotica. This is a humorous look at human sexuality seen by hot, untidy aliens who, I think, are simply looking for sperm for their dying race.
