This is a prime example of outstanding filmmaking at its best. Richard Green (who copes well with the role), looking for his two missing friends, leads him to the Black Forest region and to the castle of the one-eyed Count Bruno (Stephen McNally), his former enemy, whom he had never seen face to face. Incredible film has so many amazing elements, combined (this time) into one movie - the crocodile pit; awkward dumb (played by Lon Chaney Jr.); cunning doctor (performed by Boris Karloff); leopard hunting (VERY well done and VERY atmospheric); love story; Castle; sword fight; sadist, one-eyed earl and his two evil accomplices (played by John Hoyt and Michael Pate !!!); intriguing story that makes the film even more interesting; and more !. The screenplay of Jerry Sackheim does not allow himself to be bound - making a film that is highly recommended for anyone who is involved in unlimited filmmaking with a touch of horror and atmosphere.
