"Seven" looks like a replay of the "French Connection", released two years earlier. Both the late Roy Shader and Tony Lo Bianco, as well as Bill Hickman's trick, appeared. <br /> <br /> But we are not dealing with French drug addicts; instead, we are dealing with a war against different criminals and criminals after a policeman is brutally murdered by a bully. We see trouble and the city of New York before the 1990s. <br /> <br /> I love to watch this movie because itâ€™s a spectacular sight and it reminds of cool time. However, when someone compares car chases, Mr. Hickman participated in three of the most comparable films: Bullitt and French Connection. Each chase scene has its own qualities, and this one is just gorgeous. <br /> <br /> And I'm glad that this title saw the light on DVD.
