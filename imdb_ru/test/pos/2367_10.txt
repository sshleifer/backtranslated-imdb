Many "alternative" comedies in Britain in the 1980s were insular, erroneous, overly political and unfunny, and the worst of the "Comic Gifts" ... things fell into this category. <br /> <br /> But on the other end, this is a wonderful film that works on different intellectual levels. <br /> <br /> Is Dennis the mastermind behind the crime or is he lying? <br /> <br /> Is he telling the truth, bluffing? Double bluff, counter-bluffing what? <br /> <br /> I’ve probably watched the Supergrass 20 or 30 times, and still can’t figure out 100%. This is a wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> In addition to Eide Edmonson, there are other important roles in the early series of comic books - French and Saunders, Pete Richardson, Alexey Sale, Keith Allen, Nigel Glider and Robbie Coltrane. oddly enough, not Rick Mayall. <br /> <br /> All the comic actors - no matter how much I disliked the hidden plans of some of their participants - are convincing actors and turn into magnificent performances in this game on the big screen, While the work of Richardson-Richens’s writing team so often is purely ingenious, with small details everywhere. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this study of crime, criminology and human nature, in all its amazing complexity. And very funny with that. You will not be disappointed.
