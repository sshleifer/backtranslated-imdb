I saw "Forgiveness of the Franklin" at the show "Paramount" and I liked it. I have to be honest, I really didnâ€™t want to go, and I was very upset about the films that are being made today. together I laughed at my ass, it was a great story telling that i could not believe that two guys took it off and put it all together. I thought that if these guys could make such a film with such a budget, imagine what they could do with a lot of money. And then I thought it was an exhausted guy. I think the studios will still be ... This, as they say, thanks guys, I got lost in your movie, and so I go to the movies to forget the world for a couple of hours.
