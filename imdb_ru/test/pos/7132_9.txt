I saw it on display at GenCon in Indie. I had time to kill, and I decided to check it out. He played about 1,000 people in a packed ballroom, standing only in the room. <br /> <br /> Wow, what a trip! The script was tough. The action is intense. The pace is perfect. Character exposure is great. One thing I really appreciated was that you knew that it was not a big budget movie. However, it soon became apparent that the creators had advanced their kits and effects as far as they could, despite their limitations. And that was more than enough. <br /> <br /> It is true that this film was aimed at a specific audience - gamers / desktop players - the creators do not try to hide it. But other directors could learn a lot from them. For, going to the tiers in the scene behind the scenes and not worrying about whether the mother who watches receives “gets it”, they again and again get the biggest laugh. But there is enough versatility that mom will laugh too, even if she is not in every joke. I think that too often I see films in which they try so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common denominator so that most people like them, but the film just tolerates it. <br /> <br /> But not this click. Indeed, this film was so strong that the audience turned around his finger from the opening credits. And, although the audience around me * really * wanted the film to be liked, they were not frivolous - gamers may be among the most critical niche there. <br /> <br /> I am so glad I saw this in a large crowd. At least 10 times the audience had such a good time that they burst into applause at a joke or a scene during a movie. How often does this happen on shows? It should not be a surprise that after the closing of the credits huge applause occurred. <br /> <br /> As for me, I can’t wait for it to be released. After it ended, one of the producers said that they were filming for the simultaneous release of TV / DVD. This date may not come soon enough.
