I agree with other 9 and 10 star reviews. I saw it at the South By Southwest Film Festival in Austin. Of the 20 films that I saw, 7 were really good, and that was the best for me. I love movies that have story devices, where characters go through transformations that completely change their lives. Great game was mostly made by people involved in television, or it was their first movie. It was written and directed by Jay Floyd. This was his debut as a director. Jay's day job seems to be the design administrator for many famous films. Franklin's forgiveness was a complete admiration and extremely funny in places. This is one movie in which I would buy a DVD and watch it again - a really good addition for me. Well done, Jay, yes ... leave your day job!
