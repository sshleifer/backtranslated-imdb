The standard carrier of all TV series of films, a certain good guy - Flash Gordon - against the Bad Guy - Min Ruthless. Although the special effects seem terrible by today's standards, for 1936 they were top notch. But the gist of this story is the battle between Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) and Emperor Ming of Mongo (Charles Middleton). Crabbe and Middleton are awesome in their parts. And the support heroes who play Dale Arden, Dr. Zarkov, Princess Aura, Prince Barin, Vulcan, and everyone else are very good. This series is far superior to the 1980 film, mainly because Crabbe far surpasses Sam Jones as Flash Gordon. <br /> <br /> This series is the standard carrier for all series of films. No questions about this.
