Bill Paxton took the true story of the discovery of American golf in 1913 and made a film that is much more than an unusual game of golf. The film also directly addresses the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches on the deep anti-Catholic prejudices of both British and American institutions. But in the depths of the soul a film that the eternal favorite of triumph against all odds. <br /> <br /> Acting is indicative in everything. Steven Dillane is great, as usual, but the filmâ€™s revelation is Shiite LaBeouf, who demonstrates a disciplined, dignified and very sympathetic performance as a French-Irish child from the working class fighting their prejudices in the New England WASP. For those who are only familiar with his slapping performances in Even Stevens, this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter, like the ten-year-old Caddy, threatens to steal every scene in which he appears. <br /> <br /> An old-fashioned film in the best sense of the word: a beautiful game, clear direction and an exciting story at the end - the final scene, a gentle bow in Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.
