Family Guy - the best show on TV. EVER. He achieved great success, which no other animated comedy series or any show even close reached. <br /> <br /> In terms of animated comedy performances, this era should be called the “era of animated sitcoms”. because there are so many of them, and almost every one of them can be presented on DVD. There are a few good ones (for example, South Park, Futurama and The Simpsons). Each animated sitcom has its own style / technique for creating humor. For example, Futurama is funny because he always comments or acts on what just happened with a touch of humor. The Simpsons is also a great show, because it uses the same comedy technique and style as Futurama, but The Simpsons deserve praise for this because it was aired before Futurama and still remains on the air. using this technique. In my opinion, South Park is the funniest show next to Family Guy, because it uses a clever blend of vulgarity and stupidity as a technique for creating humor. <br /> <br /> But this is enough for other animated shows. Let me tell you what makes Family Guy so funny. Family Guy uses a comedic style that has never happened before in any other show. He uses a technique to make memories arise after every joke. This not only strengthens the joke, but also makes it more funny. It also moves at a very fast pace. These two criteria make it the funniest TV show. You should see the show to believe it, but as soon as you see it, you will most likely agree. (For your information, two funny moments on Family Guy: 1) 5-minute fight with chicken in “Da Boom” and 2) a parody of Dick van Dyck in “Holy Crap”.) Besides, in my opinion, Family Guy is very a modest show, because while other shows create humor, getting to know their jokes / routines and characters, most of the Family Guy jokes are based on the stupidity of current events and pop culture. It also shows that Family Guy is not only modest, but also intelligent, because it shows that there is an understanding in the show. And this technique is extremely effective, because they link the references of their pop culture with the specific plot of the episode in which they occur. <br /> <br /> A family man can be enjoyed by all ages, because while younger children may not understand the references of pop culture, they will be surprised by the cheerful, silly tricks of the characters, especially Peter. The show, however, is a bit more vulgar than the Simpsons and Futurama, but less vulgar than South Park. Thus, from the point of view of vulgarity, Family Guy will take place somewhere in the middle when connected with the above shows, but it will take first place in terms of humor and intelligence !! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was canceled last year, not because it was not popular, but because FOX continued to change its time interval, so no one ever knew when it was turned on. Fortunately, we have sets of DVDs (which, by the way, are sold like crazy) and restarts on Cartoon Swim for adults Swim are available to us.
