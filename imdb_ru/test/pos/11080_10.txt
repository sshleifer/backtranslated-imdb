Falcon and Snowman are based on a true story. Christopher Boyce and Andrew Doulton Lee (title traitors), played by Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn, got their code names from the KGB. What for? Boyce was an avid falconer, and Lee was a head of cola. The film is based on a true story. It is based on the eponymous book. Another reviewer asked what was their motivation? Disappointment is not. Ideology is not. (I apologize for my bad grammar), but I am making a point here. What was it if it was not a disappointment or ideology? In short, greed. By the time of the Boys-Lee affair, money had become a great motivator, not an ideology. You do not trust me? Then look at the Walker Spies Ring, which was broken in the late 80s. Three spies caused the greatest damage to our national security in the 70s and 80s. John Walker, who began his career as a spy in the 60s, Christopher Boyce and Andrew Doulton Lee. All three sold this country for thirty pieces of silver. If you are not familiar with this phrase, I suggest you read the Bible.
