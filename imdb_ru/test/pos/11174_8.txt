Lukasart pulled another beauty from a seemingly bottomless bag of great games. If any additional proof is needed that they rule this game genre, then this is it. Before playing this game, there was some concern about how the authors would keep up the gag tempo after the first two games. There were fears that he would wear a little sparse. <br /> <br /> Play the game and see how quickly these fears are dispelled. From the introductory video with Guybrush in the Dodgem boat (!) To the final stages at the fair, the jokes just continue to appear. I was a big fan of the first two games and other works of Lukasart (Day Of The Tentacle, Sam & Max, etc.), And this game can not provide quality. You will not be disappointed. (Well, I was not.)
