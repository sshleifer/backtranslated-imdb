At 14:37 in the bathroom at Adelaide High School, the student committed suicide, and the different worlds of six teenagers changed forever. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a brutal, honest and exciting movie, centered on the pain of being a teenager. The film tells about one day in the life of six teenagers who are intertwined with each other, and all deal with their own personal dramas. Is there a couple of stereotypes in the mix ?? a beautiful future popular girl who deals with body problems, succeeds, is obsessed with her grades, there are several horrors that are as far from the mainstream as you can imagine, including a social outlaw dealing with a severe disease, and a young girl tries to understand the destructive event in its past. <br /> <br /> The film is blended with documentary character interviews that some viewers may find a bit out of place in the rest of the seamless narrative. The pace is also a little slow, but it matches the feel of the movie. Young Australian actors are all stars in their own right, in particular Teresa Palmer, whose heartbreaking game earned her an AFI nomination. <br /> <br /> The film is very well made, with amazing direction. Some scenes are a little hard to watch ?? in particular, a suicide scene lasting five minutes, but in general it is a film that has a great influence on the audience. He draws you straight from his shocking opening scene and makes you guess which of the six main characters will be in the bathroom. Ultimately, this is a beautiful, but slightly worrisome, look at teenage life.
