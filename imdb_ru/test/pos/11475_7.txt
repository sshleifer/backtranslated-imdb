From frame number 1, do you know a good guy in a suit and tie is doomed ?? He is not lucky (“Sorte Nula”), or he believes in this music in the car radio and in the dubious conversation of his best friend and company employee, who takes him to unknown places along the desert road. Alberto just wanted to be alone, so that the next day he could fly abroad with, well, someone we left to guess. <br /> <br /> Movie goes a long way ?? what do you find short ?? onto the final scene with a man hearing the same music by taxi to the airport. Meanwhile, several lucky ones found different ways out of this story, some die, some are born, others fall into agonizing sufferings. Is he really doomed this time ?? Or is he? The film is a kind of show for one person directed by Fernando Fragat, who left the sound recording and special effects only to other, competent people. Those who usually reject Portuguese films due to sound problems and unclear speech recordings should look for other topics to criticize this time. A car accident (these are not spoilers, the film is too smart for IT) creates an excellent scene and, obviously, was made using cheap equipment. (American studios pay attention: you can save one or two dollars by hiding competent Portuguese directors!) <br /> <br /> Fragata did everything else, from script to dialogue, from camera work to editing. If part of the dialogue was intrusive, then he must again be congratulated for his acting leadership and casting with mostly inexperienced actors. A large number of non-speaking parts are credited, but most of these people were used for the music video and the creation, which were widely used in the commercial for the film. Do you have a dozen actors and actresses in the cast, of which ten are relevant and a huge number of relationships ?? which are revealed step by step, in an exciting, intense way, reminiscent of the best authors of the genre. “Alfred Hitchcock” (see) and “Claude Chabrol” (see) Really come to mind through the game of cat and mouse between the director and his audience and the nature of his characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this thriller and comedy for native speakers of Portuguese and, if the film receives a decent translation of a conversational dialogue, to everyone who loves these genres abroad.
