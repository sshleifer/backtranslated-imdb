After watching the trailer it was easy to decide not to watch this movie. I mean, I don't care about stupid "stone comedies." I am sure that for many people it was also easy to get together, smoke a cup and go see this movie with a guy from the Simpsons and a guy named "Billy Bob". It must have been a good time, but the film is not so funny - itâ€™s too bad that someone had to go and pick them up. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found out that the trailer was misleading after it was already released by the theaters, so I had to wait for the video. I really liked it. Good locations, high-quality production and excellent characteristics of the entire composition. Looking back, the plot twists were not completely unexpected, but I did not find it cumbersome because the premise was so attractive. <br /> <br /> So why was this exciting drama sold as a comedy? Did something happen to the producer, leaving the associated producers to do the marketing themselves?
