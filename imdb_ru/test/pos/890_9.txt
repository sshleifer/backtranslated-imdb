With all due respect to Joel Fabiani and Rosemary Nicholls and their characters, Department S will forever remain associated with Jason King Peter Wingard. <br /> <br /> Most people remember him as this camp, a bright and dissolute detective womanizer in the form of Austin Powers, but it will do a disservice to the character: he has much more nuances than that. <br /> <br /> Jason King is lazy (he often lets Stuart fight all the bad guys and only throws in at the end), he is selfish (his assessment of people is based on whether they read his novels or not), Detective work - this is speculation without facts confirming them, and he sulks when Annabel is right ... and she often is. He is clearly a man with a midlife crisis and drunkenness, but ... Jason King is great. If Wingard played him simply as a dashing hero, it would not have worked, but he often shows King as a paper tiger, led by his libido, love for clothes and a penchant for extradition (and this hinders his detective work). from time to time), but he has some of the best lines and falls in the history of television. And if he does not play his whiter than white, he will be better chemistry and interaction between the three leading characters. <br /> <br /> Having recently viewed it again on DVD, you will see how much Wingard Depth is invested in Jason King.
