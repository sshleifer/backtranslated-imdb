I never watched a file in a language that I don’t understand, just because I wanted to watch a movie, and I could not find it with English subtitles. I don't know how much I missed, but it was a bit. Probably only specific details that sound silly, until you see the emotional level of this film and how the characters interact with each other. I want to mention that The Diceman from Germany has no reason to feel that he “sucks” when it comes to commenting on the emotional power of the film. As I said, I don’t understand Japanese - or, at least, only a very small amount, which I went away from reading a very long novel - probably my favorite book for all the time I couldn’t put it off and took it the next day off from work only to finish reading! I do not know if there is an English dubbed or sub-version, but if there is a film, but if there is, I would love to watch it. The movie in Japanese was incredible, nothing better than cake icing !!
