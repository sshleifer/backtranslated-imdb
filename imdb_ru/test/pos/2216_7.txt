This film was a huge surprise to me while I watched it at Cinequest at the large Californian theater in San Jose. This is a musical that I usually donâ€™t like, but I have to say that this one was different. Robert Peters, who made the film and watched it, did such a wonderful job. During his Q & A, he told the audience that he had only two other people for his team! Most of the dialogue was made on the fly, and he really made the film when he attended another film festival in Germany! I can't say enough good words about this movie, the only bad thing is that you really tend to notice the camera work, and it trembles a little. If you hit this movie - look!
