AAA is my favorite movie ... I saw it several times (I donâ€™t remember the counter now), and every time I just adore it ... This is the best film by Raj Kumar Santoshi .. Comedy, dialogue, and a spectacular performance .. the actors and actresses did an excellent job ... you can't stop laughing while watching this movie ... it's just fun ... Amir Khan and Salman Khan did an excellent job .. and the performance of Pares Raval was excellent as always ... The music is inspired by old Hindi movies (60s music) and is good ... the whole cast of the film did a great job ... <br /> <br /> In general, this is a great Indian comedy film to watch ...
