I'm not sure how I can make ten lines from this question, but I will try. <br /> <br /> When Julie went to the dance, and they danced to slow music. What is the name of the song that played and who played it? <br /> <br /> I love this song! And I watch the movie again and again, just to hear this song. <br /> <br /> I did some online searches and even watched the soundtrack, but I still can't find the song. <br /> <br /> This may be because the song they danced to was not full and partial. <br /> <br /> I would be grateful if anyone knows the name of the song and the band that sang it. <br /> <br /> Thank you. <br /> <br /> Frank
