Such a film as Crossfire, puts another film that spreads around his public consciousness, that is, the recent film Crash, almost embarrassing. Not necessarily because any of them expresses his thought about intolerance more rotten (although I would argue that Crash throws a hammer much stronger than this), but due to the fact that storytelling and tricks never get much in the same way as with crash. Perhaps, in reality, there is no need to compare them, since at the heart of Crossfire lies a deep vein in the film noir, as if it is going out of fashion. In fact, it was interesting to see what director Edward Dmitrik said in an interview on DVD, where he mentioned that the budget for the photo was significantly lower (on purpose), so you could spend more on the actors, and the schedule was coordinated with very fast, fast tempo But what seems unbelievable in the image then is what you can think of, looking at the many lighting settings that took a long time. Just for a small scene, for example, when Keely Robert Mitchum first starts asking questions under the direction of Captain Robert Young - the contrasts of the shadows in the room are impeccable. The fact that there are many other lighting installations that go even further with such a small number of marks as something significant in the area of ​​only the appearance of the noir period. Just look at the snapshot of the characters on the staircase, the silhouettes against them, and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> But back to the main part of the film, it’s really a story that consists of the murder mystery, but the one that we, as spectators, do not keep waiting for a long time to think about the answer. Then it is more about something else than the soul and the murderer, which cannot be found in the overall picture of the crime, since the film for the most part has no “criminals”. Then there is a very calculated risk that the characters may be too thin to support a (worthwhile) message against anti-Semitism. But Dmitri's direction on his acting skills, along with John Paxton’s really amazing script, reveals the characters, least of all because of what they shouldn’t seem to be too thin along with the message. And then what will be noir without any relation to it? Mitchum helps with this, even in such scenes as between him and Young, where he is largely based on the situation of the moment of the story (that is, the plot details), introducing a little tricky wit into some dialogues. Perhaps this is already in the lines, but it helps to make the character more attractive for his scenes. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is Robert Ryan, who in Montgomery stands out as a person who, as you know, is not. ” at first I don’t really like it, only through his bs behavior, but you aren’t quite sure of any of them. Then, as soon as it begins to clear up ironically through the subjective point of view of the suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) in the apartment of the soon-killed Samuels, his performance becomes a great balancing act of shit fullness and also rather frightening in his blind way. This is a good performance when he is also confronted by Cooper, who has real personal problems that he faces and speaks with regret and humility. However, after the end of the film, many people think about it, and while you are watching the film, you need to learn more about the dialogue and the flow of scenes, and the actors move in the sometimes harsh, overwhelming camera, so the message is in a sense secondary. Not that it was not important, especially for a temporary period (starting from World War II), but years later he sees actors, even those who do not receive great tent status, like Gloria Graham in the role of Ginny (a fatal woman, if She had time for something that did not exist, and William Phipps as Leroy (“hik”), pushing one another, which fits very well into a compact script. <br /> <br /> Dmytryk is also very wise in choosing the limitations of a musical score. , it is also powerful, because on very long stretches we hear nothing, and mostly when it is It happens by chance for the character’s surroundings. He could just as easily add musical notes to some dramatic scenes for emphasis, especially for a novice spectator who captured the film. Avoiding this and getting the right views and nuances in frames and actors, he raises the standards of the genre material to a very subtle, memorable level.My favorite scene is likely to go to Finley's story about an Irish immigrant, whom he tells Leroy, where all these elements fit well together. It may not be very high on top of my favorite noir - and I’ll still throw out Murder My Sweet as the director’s masterpiece in such a picture - but it’s certainly better in quality than something like B too,
