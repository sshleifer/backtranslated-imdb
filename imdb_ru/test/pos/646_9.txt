Love this little movie that reminds me of an original Japanese pearl, DO WE DANCE? (not an exaggerated remake of Gere / Jlo ...) Fortunately, I found it and taped it when it showed on STARZ promo weekend, because, as far as I know, it is not on DVD. I will look at almost everything related to Yancy Butler (someone remembers the short-lived television series “MANN AND MACHINE”), and in this she shines positively. She performs a dance with a disco song, which is very cool! He loved all the other characters, especially those who were played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (where has she been all these years?). This is one of those films that I shoot from time to time and always leave, smiling after watching. Highly recommended !!!
