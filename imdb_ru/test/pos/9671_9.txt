Seth MacFarlane is a true genius. He created a show that is witty, culturally spicy and just completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> For those who believe that his “offensive” view of social or cultural themes does not give any meaningful comments, he simply causes “offense” to pay attention to this quote: <br /> <br / > Peter (leaves the stem cell laboratory): How long have I been there? // Security: five minutes. // Peter: Why don't we finance this?!? <br /> <br /> Why it is. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the family for not only the funniest TV show (with the possible exception of a very beloved one who really misses futurama), but also because he is pretty smart for downloads.
