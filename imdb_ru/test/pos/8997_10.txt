This film made me a fan of rugby and coach Larry Gelvix. The characters of the story slipped and fell before they began to grow, overcoming incredibly strong conflicts. It was clear and quite believable. As in life, there were no simple answers to the problems facing them all. Magnificent actors and a great script brought this true story to life. I wish there were more films like this one. These days I look almost exclusively worthy true stories, because they are usually much more interesting than fiction. In addition, it is inspiring, and it teaches us not to leave anyone too quickly.
