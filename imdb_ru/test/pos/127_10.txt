The previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better summary of the plot of the film than I could. Basically, I remember that it was just beautiful, in all senses - emotionally, visually, editorially - just great. <br /> <br /> If you like films that you enjoy watching, as well as emotionally that this beauty matters, I think you will be happy to see this unusual and unusual work of art. <br /> <br /> On a scale from 1 to 10 I would give 8.75. The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is part of the mood. If you are in the mood for a really artistic, very romantic film, then it is 10. I definitely think that it definitely needs to be seen, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so in general it is 8.75.
