He is a young man, very disappointed by the CIA behind the scenes in Allied Australia. Sean Penn, as Andrew Doulton Lee drug addict, is outstanding. <br /> <br /> Schlesingerâ€™s competent and professional leadership, along with a very good game, makes Falcon and Snowman the Spy thriller should not be missed. <br /> <br /> Tuesday, February 4, 1992 - Video
