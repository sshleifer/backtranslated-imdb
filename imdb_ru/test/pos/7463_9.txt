I'm really amazed at how little glory this film has. I think it’s related to distribution companies, etc. <br /> <br /> Don't be an idiot - if you're looking for good entertainment, take this film - this is a very good movie that you can spend a few hours with and music EXCELLENT. <br /> <br /> This is about ... well, about girls and boys, and that between them, not too many stories, but not all films must be HUMAN, is not it? It is cute and lovely and gives a good time. The girls also look very good, and this makes the whole movie even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Why did I give him only 9? Well, the story can be a little more convincing from the middle and on. at some point you start to see events that are a little less reliable. LITTLE SPOILER: The baby is crying, and the father enters and tries to relax him. now I’m not talking about some small scream, but no - a hysterical scream and 30 seconds after that the father goes out and the “child is sleeping” - sorry, when and how exactly did you make him calm down and fall asleep and could leave his room after 20 30 seconds. but ignore this little choice, because the film itself is not Dokudram - it's fun, and it should be missed.
