This film could disgrace the typical Hollywood "tear". Emotions depicted on the screen are suppressed and understated in a very convenient way. The plot is quite cliché with a leading role having a fatal disease (this is not a spoiler, and it was well known quite early in the film) The method of execution was somehow unique from most of the love stories you've ever seen - not even a kiss and exchange yet you will feel a huge flow of love between the two leads. Initially, I assumed that this “limitation of emotions” was something similar to the typical “Eastern values”, but later decided to resist it. <br /> <br /> This film is so understated that if you compare it with such films as “Cinema” Paradiso ", CP would compare itself with obvious manipulation. So this is definitely not for everyone. <br /> <br /> After watching the film, I had a strong feeling that Hollywood loves films (or, to be precise, loves films everywhere) glorifies romance or passion and label it as “love.” I’m sure that we all have our own definitions, and I would not say that these qualities are mutually exclusive. But I would dare to say that the film will allow you to Asking whether there is any additional dimension that you had with your loved one. <br /> <br /> It is quite obvious that I really like this film. Considering the fact that the film is so simple in appearance, it is paradoxical one of the most "cinematic" films that I've seen lately.
