It doesn't matter if you have experienced the plight of older people in America or you are simply ignorant, Uncle Frank and Matthew Ginsburg will give you this hint straight, funny, wake up and smell the roses. By the end of the film, it is obvious that, being completely entertained, you were also educated. Awesome movie, awesome and novice talent in the field of cinema. Matthew Ginsburg is a name worth paying attention to.
