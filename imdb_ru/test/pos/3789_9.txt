Considering all the comedies with the military situation that were made in history, someone had to be the first. It is possible to cite the case when Charlie Chaplin invented this genre in Shoulder Arms. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that then it was a bold step. Considering that some of the best films that featured people like Bob Hope, Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy, did military service and starred during the war, it's just what you take and laugh. <br /> <br /> In World War I, Chaplin, along with other stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, went on bond tours. He was a great supporter of an allied cause unusual for one of his leftist views. It would seem quite natural that the Tramp will be composed and, unfortunately, will stagger and wreak havoc on everyone. <br /> <br /> Many of the things that you see in the service comedies of World War II got their start at the shoulder of the hand. Chaplin no longer had imitators, because a few weeks after the film was released, the war ended. <br /> <br /> But one of the greatest geniuses of comedy created the artistic form of comedy.
