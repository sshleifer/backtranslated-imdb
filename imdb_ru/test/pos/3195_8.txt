I remembered watching this program in the 60s, when I was a little boy in Australia, and again enjoyed it on DVD, like the 50-year-old father of small children. Despite the fact that the bad guys are mostly small characters and is a component of violence, I am very glad that my 6 and 8-year-old children watch this, because the main characters are deep, kind and noble, the Japanese culture shines through, the violence is not terrible, no one admires him, and the program is beautiful to watch. It does not promote nightmares, but instead shows much of the culture, which must have primarily influenced the design of the Jedi Knights in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The quality of DVDs is poor. Video perfectionists will not like this one. It strongly resembles something that rests on a 16 mm film and is projected onto a wall in some kind of basement ... which may well be. The soundtrack also lacks the quality we used to expect from a home theater. However, my children only noticed that it was not in color, and I suspect that they noticed it only because we recently talked about how old things are often like that. The beauty of Mount Fuji is evident even in black and white. Something in the setting of the 17th century makes quality a part of the atmosphere, as if you are looking into the past through some kind of time window. <br /> <br /> In general, this program is better than most things on the air, and a much better advertisement for Japanese television than for Pokemon, but you can consider it insignificant if you have not had the experience to watch it in 60 years My score 8/10 takes into account his age.
