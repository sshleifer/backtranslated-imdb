This movie sold very well. When it was released in '97, during the glory and success of Master P, everything and everyone with his name was sold from the shelves. That is why it is not surprising that this underground city drama sold over 250,000 copies and is still ongoing. <br /> <br /> If you are a No Limit fan then or even now, check it out. He has some old school videos, and don't turn me on with fancy strippers at the Ice Cream Party bonus party. Therefore, what I want to say to all people who do not like Master P or No Limit Records does not watch it, because it is not for you, and you should not vote on it, because you are only going to keep TRU or purchase this video with your low voices.
