As a Wm fan. Faulkner since college, I was especially pleased to see the “Intruder in the dust” for other reasons. My grandfather, also named Clarence Brown as a director, grew up in the Oxford area, born near him in 1888. We attended a weekly family reunion at Oxford in July 1964, just 15 years after the film was shot. It still looked mostly the same as in the film, but went through a period of civil rights coup at the time, like the Ole Miss site. As I recall, that summer he was a pretty little campus, but I was only 18 years old. sophomore and white. I only then began to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice, but I still had a long way to go. Anyway, the film is worth seeing, but the filmmakers must have had to go on a steep rope to do this, and I would like to know more about this story. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, Oxford is a larger, modern college city with all the evils that go along with such things, and I hope to come back again to see how this has changed in the social sphere in the past 40-odd years old. Juano Hernandez certainly should have been nominated for an Oscar this year, but Hollywood was still fanatical for this to happen. Other Faulkner stories have been filmed, so look for them and compare. One of the best was PBS The Barn Burner from about 1985 or so with Tommy Lee Jones in the lead role. It really captures the intensity of the rural southern whites, about which Faulkner so often wrote.
