I really liked this one. (SPOILERS ??) He had a really good storyline, the main woman in this film is really cool. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that she was left alone alive and her beloved dead, it seemed like a ninja scroll. Another movie with ass. ;) <br /> <br /> Watch Japanese with subtitles. I do not know where the idiots who have learned to speak English are, but for some reason everyone gets an F grade in the translation technique. Subtitles are more correct. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Playable: 9/10
