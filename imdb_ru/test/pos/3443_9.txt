Absolutely, I agree with my previous commentator in the description of this exciting, exciting and, of course, beautiful film. There is no need to see all the episodes, since the former are the best and the latter are a bit tiring, but for any person who loves the German language and his good-natured lifestyle, all episodes are worth seeing. In typical German fashion, values ​​are constantly being questioned, even in his murderous Nazi past, recent episodes confront, the rich dialogues are especially interesting. These episodes are recommended to anyone who is going to live or travel in Germany, preferably in the original language !! <br /> <br />
