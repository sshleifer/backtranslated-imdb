This mini-series is a reasonable continuation of the original film Gone With the Wind. If someone considers it on their own (and not immediately after the original), it turns out pretty well. I’m sure most viewers will question Scarlett and Rett’s performances, but hardly anyone else could have done better. Many of the characters here are new to this storyline, so comparison in these cases (Rett's mother, uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Bentin) is not a problem. No one will be Vivien Leigh or Clark Gable. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole performance is the beautiful landscapes of spring Charleston and Ireland. Look at it alone. Obviously, it was a high-budget television miniseries. He follows the book for a while, and then when Scarlett goes to Ireland, he has a completely new storyline. <br /> <br /> The script is trustworthy, if not to say anything special - how I feel for Roger Moore after Sean Connery for James Bond.
