Unfortunately, I can relate to this film, since I am 17 years old, and I still have to kiss, so I really feel for Josie. It has been a long time since I watched this film, but to write this review, I revised it and remembered everything that I liked about it. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is a great actress, and she really liked this role at this time. The chemistry between Sam and Josie was really good, and Michael Vartan was a great actor in that. <br /> <br /> I also liked the storyline - as I said there, I could tell, and you rarely find a film that you can fully relate to. <br /> <br /> It's all over - I liked it. 7/10
