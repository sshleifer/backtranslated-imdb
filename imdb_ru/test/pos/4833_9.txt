This film is terrible and difficult to describe. Despite the fact that it is sufficiently accurate in describing the events that led to the subsequent investigation of the first attempt to destroy the World Trade Center in 1993, which is now seen after 9/11, it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> It would be a mistake to call this film prophetic, but it certainly makes you realize the common play wisdom: “fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice on shame”. <br /> <br /> Our government learned nothing from the attempt on the World Trade Center in 1993 and the subsequent readings of the 9/11 report does not show that many of the mistakes that led to the explosion in 1993 were repeated. <br /> <br /> Some people criticized the First and Fourth Amendments to the US Constitution, which are partly responsible for the ability of Islamic terrorists to carry out their evil plans, but this is wrong in all possible respects. <br /> <br /> Of course, people with such an argument do not support a ban on freedom of speech, freedom of the press or freedom of religion? Of course, I hope that they do not support our government officials that they can break into the home or office of any person to search without a reason or without a warrant. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the FBI, the INS, and even the local police could receive warrants based on the information they had, but they decided not to do this for a number of reasons. In addition, no matter how unpleasant or ignorant it is, one cannot speak ill of America or its leaders. Similarly, one should not forbid possessing arms or praying in the direction of Mecca. <br /> <br /> Think about it, until Lee Harvey Oswald actually fired a rifle at President John F. Kennedy, he did not break any laws. Life in a free society has its drawbacks. <br /> <br /> However, “The Way to Paradise” is a film that you definitely need to watch, and I'm afraid many people will never see it. As far as I know, it is not on the DVD, and in 2007 the tenth anniversary is being celebrated, and there are no known revivals of it. <br /> <br /> I’m not very surprised, people don’t like to document their failures and this film certainly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us didn’t do their job properly and for the smallest of reasons, such as jurisdictional altercations and denial of information. <br /> <br /> This is a shame because “The Way to Paradise” is well done, it captures and, as many have said before, the final scene flies, where Ramzi Yusef (played by Art Malik), the bomber who created the bomb for the truck, used in the first attempt to destroy the two towers, the Past World Trade Center, after its capture and extradition, simply says: “Next time we put both of them in order,” this is the moment of the film that froze in place for a few minutes.
