This is exactly what I expected from this. Relaxing, humorous and entertaining. The acting couple was awesome, as was the scene selection. I personally recommend it. This is a film that can be watched by the whole family at the same time, and no one will be embarrassed or bored. This cute movie will make you smile and laugh. And the action films are delicious. The classic of modern American comedy. And very well done.
