I have not seen this wonderful film for 50 years, but in any case I make a comment to it. <br /> <br /> Although the JACK WEBB film was undoubtedly conceived as entertainment, it demonstrates basic training at Marine Parris Island in a realistic sense as a difficult character building exercise - it was said that the military was afraid that the film would prevent . It did not work out. The film showed that entering the Marines was more difficult than most young people had ever imagined, and (guess what?) The king-size offer was exactly what many guys wanted. I personally knew a lot of guys who joined the marines soon after watching THE DI. The lines in recruiting centers were suddenly so long that the marines had more recruits than they could handle. <br /> <br /> It is. America will always have young people aspiring to become better, while loafers and born-behind losers do nothing. <br /> <br /> In 2007 we will not have films that inspire patriotism, dedication to any duty, positive values, and so on. What we DO are films that inspire us to become sighs, beer lovers to devour beer, other negative values. Indicator number 1 - that the parody young parody and the epic SUPERBAD with the greed of beer is now number 81 in the list of Great Films for all time. Values? What does value mean?
