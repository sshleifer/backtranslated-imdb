I went to see this movie with my girlfriend, who does not like film robberies. But she liked it. I missed all the fragments of the film to the end. This is a story about Edward Norton and his team, who steals some gold, and Norton decides he wants it all for himself. Then the people he betrayed want revenge on him. This is a well-composed, intelligent, funny and fascinating film that I need to watch again ... to the end. So far this is one of my best films about Summer. <br /> <br /> Seth Green plays a big deal in entertainment. I don't know anyone who doesn't like Seth Green, and he adds to the flavor. He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roommate stole him from him. He is a computer genius, which is interesting to watch. <br /> <br /> They say that Norton did not want to appear in this film ... but in my place I would like to subscribe. <br /> The only problem is that it is very predictable. Any moviegoer should be able to say in their mind what is going on before this happens. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint about this film is Eddie Norton's facial hair selection. Thick, but thin mustache and a small pike on his chin ... he looks like an 80-porn star for the sake of the gods.
