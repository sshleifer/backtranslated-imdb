Piper, Prue and Phoebe bring Dr. Griffiths to the Manor to try to save him from the personal killer of the Source, Shaks. While Phoebe is looking for a spell in the Book of Shadows to defeat Shaks, Prue and Piper attack Shaks and pursue him outside. Unbeknownst to Prue and Piper, they were filmed by the reporter and her cameraman, using their powers, and broadcast live on national television. With Phoebe in the Underworld, Prue, Piper and Leo must find a way to reverse the damage. Leo goes down to Phoebe and tells her that the Enchanted were exposed as witches. At first glance, Piper is shot by a manic-imitative witch, and Prue should take her to the hospital. The problem here is that the crowds block the roadway. So Prue must use her magic in the crowd, and they go to the hospital. Piper is declared dead, and the special forces team arrives. Leo finds out about Piper's death and goes downstairs to tell Phoebe. Cole is asked to have the Source reset the time, and the Source agrees; only if Phoebe turns to the dark side. Phoebe agrees, but the deal will destroy them. On the surface, Prue and Piper are fighting Shaks. Prue screams at Phoebe, who, without their knowledge, is in the Underworld. Shaks throws Piper and Prue through the wall and Dr. Griffiths out the window. Prue is not declared dead until in the episode "Premiere 4 Seasons" "Charmed Again, Part One." <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is an exciting episode, and he made me sit on the edge of my chair, It's sad that Prue is dead, but happy that there will be another five seasons Charmed. My voice; 10 out of 10. EXCELLENT
