Kannathil Muthamittal is probably a great movie. I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for a great director and A.R. Rahman for great songs. Working with the camera is simply superb and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I will be shocked if this film does not receive an Oscar for the best foreign film or even for the best cinematography.
