Everyone told me to see "Cactus Flower", and I finally did. What a wonderful movie - the perfect reception for a Sunday night / scary Monday morning. Mattau and Hawn were good, but Ingrid Bergman really made this film â€” after all, it was really about her. Truly great actors can do anything, and Miss Bergman proves it. She shows us - in one film - several people in her entire career. The dance club scene was as hysterical as touching. Even when the film came to an obvious conclusion, I found myself supporting Miss Dickinson, as if she were a Boston Red Sox. Fortunately, she could see (not a pun) much better. ;)
