Palwol ui Christmas is very Korean, if you have been to Korea or you have Korean friends, you should know what I mean. Koreans are very traditional people, they see love very calmly. such a feeling that is not in the modern world. I think that's why this film is so special. Itâ€™s wrong to compare this film with Love Letter by Xunji Iwai, the Japanese are very good, but they can never do something like Palwol ui Christmas. If you have a chance, watch this movie for yourself.
