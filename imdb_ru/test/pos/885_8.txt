I have to say: of all the modern martial arts films of Korea, this one is worth seeing. He was not as epic as Musa Warriors, and did not develop characters, but he had many good ideas. A simple story: an elite soldier, considered dead, returns years later to end the rule of the Japanese in Korea in medieval days. His colleague used to be his best friend, and now he wants to stop him. All scenes of battles with a sword or various weapons and very interesting to watch. The motives of the drawings are revealed first near the end. You may have to watch it again for all the connections to be correct. And to me personally ... I loved the end. I could watch it again and again. Maybe a little pathetic, but the real story of a freedom fighter .... People can be killed, but not the ideas for which they speak ....
