I will start from the beginning, saying, "I like this movie." It's awesome, grand, exciting and fun. Xinhue, a doctor, sits in front of his little stone hut and writes his memoirs. And what a story it is! Taken from the river and brought up by an elderly couple who are crazy about him, he becomes a doctor for the poor. He is friends with Horemheb, who sees fame, and Xinghyu sees healing. And both are faced with the future pharaoh Anknaten (sorry for my writing), who suffers an epileptic seizure. <br /> <br /> This Pharaoh has another "flaw": he believes in one god, not in the pantheon of gods. Then it was absolutely revolutionary. Xinhue and Horemheb grow up. One night, Xinghu sees a woman who makes him lose his feelings. He gives up his practice, sells his parents' house and even their graves to spend the night with her. Is he? I will not say. Meanwhile, Merit, a maid in a tavern that Gene Simmons played with sweet simplicity and power in love with herself, falls in love with Sinhue. She falls under his spell and under the spell of faith in one god. <br /> <br /> Victor Maitre excellently replays like Horemheb. Edmond Purdom is sincere, like Xinghue, a lost doctor (does he find atonement? Stay tuned). Even Bela Darvi, the woman who steals the heart of Xinhue, is not as bad as everyone said. The fact that she was Daryl F. Zanuka's mistress had nothing to do with the casting - right? Yes, right ... nevertheless, she was not so bad - I saw worse. I think that in “Egyptian” she achieved more success than many modern young actresses. I said it before, and I will say it again - I like this movie. I recommend it. It makes you think, despite some actions by Hammy. Have fun with this movie; it's worth it.
