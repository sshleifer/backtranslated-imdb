I saw the film, and I am very pleased to see a film that is so different in character and history from the silly, basic American major productions. This is a film with an interesting background for young and all age groups. Contrary to some reviews, the audience seems to share my assessment, since the film is very successful wherever it is used all over the world. For example, in the Netherlands it took the 3rd place. Negative statements should be respected, but we should expect them to be guided by facts. If you have the opportunity to watch a movie and enjoy it.
