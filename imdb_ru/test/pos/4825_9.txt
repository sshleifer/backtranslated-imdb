From action to Cardone, this new twist on the “already done wrong” topic of a familiar ghost will keep you glued to your place. From time to time it is slower because it creates tension, “what will happen.” Medium is good on blood, but what is pleasantly disgusting there. Spoiler: The death of a jockey and the subsequent feast is a highlight for the bloody hounds. <br /> <br /> The authors wrote an old story, but added turns and re-presented you a typical pursuit. Cardone brings it to life. , er, uh, death. <br /> <br /> Lori Heyring, scout Taylor-Compton and the ever-fabulous Ben Cross are real, no signs of action here. Everyone in the cast is dedicated and truly not what any director aspires to. Actors believe, we believe in it. <br /> <br /> Along with the traditional unexpected story of ghosts, the film is loaded with tons of atmosphere, from the mine, Hank's house and Tunney's house, from the first day creeping frame to the last. <br /> <br /> Horror fans, do yourself a favor and enjoy what is today one of the real horror films. <br /> <br /> I end up with a big kudo for Boaz Davidson (story) Ben Nediwi (script), because without ingenious authors Hollywood would be nothing but an ugly reality show party.
