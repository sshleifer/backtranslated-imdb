I liked this movie when I was a kid. I saw it theatrically. Randy Edelman made a good composition from the soundtrack. David Sevil is the Chipmunks father and record manager. Chipmunks consist of Alvin, who is known for playing the harmonica, Simon, a bright and diligent chipmunk and Theodore, who is the youngest and is always hungry. There is a woman, known as Miss Miller, who cares for chipmunks and has 3 daughters, known as Brittany, Janette and Eleanor, who have the same character as the chipmunks. My favorite songs from this soundtrack include "Diamond Dolls", "Girls of Rock & Roll" and touching "My Mother". Alvin really wanted to see Europe when Dave had to go there on business. Chipmunks meet Chipetts, playing around the world for 30 days of video games, which led them to race with each other, doing real things.
