What a wonderful movie this is. I discovered that she is full of the delightfully unexpected pain of being a single teenage father. And it is located on a tropical island 'paradise', as well. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu brings her special European talent to this story about the divorced father of a teenage girl. They are together on vacation, and she begins to add excitement to the island in many unexpected ways. But you will need to watch a movie for yourself to see all the funny situations that they can find themselves. <br /> <br /> There are several iconic classic works that all teenagers should see. This movie must be added to the list. In addition to “Dirty Dancing,” “Ferris Bueller's Weekend,” “The Great Adventures of Bill and Ted,” “The Rocky Horror Show of Horrors,” and “House of Animals,” “My Father Is a Hero,” must go through a movie Look as if you have a teenage daughter, and you will ride with laughter. Look at this with your teenage daughter and get ready to laugh for months.
