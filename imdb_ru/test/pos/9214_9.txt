I have to admit that I am a fan of the 80s cheese cartoons, but this is one of the best. Rainbow Bright and The Star Thief is one of the most spectacular and fascinating Rainbow Bright cartoons, and it's much better than the TV series. I especially like the relationship between Rainbow and Darian, and I find them very funny. My favorite character, though, is Starlite, which is definitely the most "magnificent horse in the universe"! <br /> <br /> I also recommend Rainbow Brite: New Beginnings, which tells how Rainbowland appeared. Have a good day!
