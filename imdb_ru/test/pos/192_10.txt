The film “The Cranes Are Flying” by Mikhail Kalatozov is a great film. Winner of the golden palm at the Cannes Film Festival, she has excellent cinematography and performance from Tatiana Samoilova, the only Russian actor who has ever received an award in Cannes for a performance. She plays Veronica, a teenager in love with her boyfriend, happy and carefree, with plans to marry. Her life will be turned upside down when World War II begins, and her boyfriend voluntarily goes to the army. The film tells about the influence of war on the love of a teenager and people who stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight, waiting for letters or other information. This is an image of a lost innocence. Samoilova is doing a great job, and her character transformation will break your heart. The camera moves fast with a lot of close-ups, this is a dancing camera. The first scene on the stairs is fantastic, but it is not the only one, later there is a scene when Veronica is trying to commit suicide, and the other, in my opinion, one of the most powerful scenes in the history of cinema, is the bombing of Veronica’s house. when she runs upstairs in the middle of the fire to find her apartment completely destroyed. Just wonderful! 10 out of 10.
