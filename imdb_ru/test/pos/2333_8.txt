There was a recent documentary film about making films, which presented a long list of actors and directors telling what films are about. One common theme was that you could have a great script, a great cast, a better director, and a lot of money, and still make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> “Down Periscope” is proof of this theory. Not original or terribly well written script. Several respectable actors, but mostly unknown, and this film makes you laugh out loud! It would be easy to simply say that Kelsey Grammar carried this film, but this is not quite the case. Other characters, such as Rob Schneider and merry Harland Williams, have greatly added pleasure to the film. <br /> <br /> Acting acting or mysterious “cinema magic” - this is what happened here, creating a film that flows smoothly, has incredibly well-executed transitions and line by line with a well-written and well-executed dialogue. <br /> <br /> An awkward premise, a lot of technical inaccuracies and just planning stupid things that can't happen in the real world or a real fleet, but you just don't care. As a marine himself, I discovered that the overall impression of the film, although not plausible, is also not too far from the goal, as life at sea goes. <br /> <br /> This is a VERY funny movie A good family movie, and especially if you're a fan, a lot of Kelsey grammar, wit, sarcasm and just damn funny.
