Before that, there were films with robberies, and in fact, similar Rififi had an obvious impact on him - but The Red Circle is not just another record in the overpopulated genre, and with this film director Jean-Pierre Melville managed to create something like thrills on the surface and gives your audience something to think about. Being cool is just as important a feature of a modern crime movie as weapons and gangsters, and Melville does so in large numbers; The film's tone is also very relaxed, and Melville allows most of the film to bubble under a cool exterior. The story has several points of view, but Corey is the central character, a thief released from prison. His release coincides with the escape of the notorious killer Vogel, who slips out from under the nose of Police Commissioner Matthew during a train ride. The first thing Corey does after his release is to steal money from his former boss, Rico, and the second thing he does is gathering Vogel and the sniper to help him pull out the gem robbery. But Rico and the police adore thieves' tails ... <br /> <br /> The film is united by four excellent central productions. Alain Delon is calm and calculating, as the film's antihero, while Gian Maria Volonte looks formidable in her role as an escaped killer. Francois Perier is also good as a dubious club owner, while the real outstanding performance comes from Andre Burville in his role as police commissioner. The film lasts almost two and a half hours, and this is not exactly an exciting trip. However, the director makes things interesting by focusing on important elements. There are crime films like filming in the movie, but they are kept to a minimum. The first two-thirds of the film actually just escalates to the tense scene of the robbery near the end. Rififi was best known for his sequence heist - an elaborately designed scene in which no one says a word. The robbery in this film is similar in the fact that there are no words in it, and I must say that I preferred the scene in Riffi; but Melville's mastery in the direction and the calm and composed way it plays makes it good. The film boils down to an exciting climax that perfectly completes it all. In general, this may not appeal to all fans of crime films, since the action is more than a little slow; but “Red Circle” is an excellent film that deserves the reputation of a masterpiece.
