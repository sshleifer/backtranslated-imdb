1st viewed 10/28/2007, 8 out of 10 (Dir-Jesus Ponce): a simple, sweet story about a homeless couple and their daily adventures, who survived in the everyday world without shelter. The film begins with the fact that the woman from the story (played by Isabel Ampudia) was released from prison, but we do not know what she did or how long she was there. She goes through the anti-hero of this story and her boyfriend, who is played by Sebastian Aro, when he parks cars for change. They shackle each other under the old dilapidated building, in which there is nothing but the warmth of each other and a small mattress. He is an addict who just tries to do it from one correction to another, but she has a strange, obsessive attraction to him as a person, which we end up with. He also has some kind of sexually transmitted disease, so thereâ€™s no question of sex for them, but it seems that this is not a problem for both of them. She loves this person as he is, without question, and without him, to change, which is rarely found anywhere. She earns a living by wearing a bucket and washing windows. They eat a bun every day and consider it a holiday. The character Isabel dreams of a normal life, but does not expect this to happen, and does not expect to fit into this role, and therefore does not think about it. Both characters come from extremely destroyed houses, and so the audience sympathizes with them, despite their shortcomings. Without giving up most of the story, the character Isabel continues to persevere, while the person becomes worse and worse in his obsession with drugs. There is a good melodramatic conclusion to the story, which raises it for the masses, but in general it is a wonderful independent film about the relationship between other-worldly losers, which supports you to the end.
