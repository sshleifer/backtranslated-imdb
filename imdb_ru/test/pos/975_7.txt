Much better than expected. Good family movie - catch on repetitions. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Paul Giamatti chews the situation - he has much more talent than the role deserves. Pleasure to look at Inspector Ulya from Illusionist. On the scenes with the blue man I had an 11 year old seam. Cameos were especially fun for parents - it's nice to see Lee Major and Urkel again (mmm, Jalil). It will be hard to come up with 10 lines for this movie, but let's listen to it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and his parents! Amanda Bynes does an excellent job when she becomes part of a bite. I usually hate Frankie Muniz, but he is fine. I take off my hat to the casting director - at least for hiring Jamatti!
