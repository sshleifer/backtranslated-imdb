Pro Skater 2x by Tony Hawk is no different from previous games (except for Tony Hawk 3). The only thing that was added to the Pro Skater 2x from Tony Hawk is a new selection of levels and improved graphics. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x offers a new career mode, and this is 2x career. A career of 2x is mainly Tony Hawk's career 1, because there are only about five tests at a level. If you missed Tony Hawk 1 and 2, I advise you to buy a Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x, but if you played the first two games, you should still try this one. In general, this is nothing new, but still very interesting to pass the game. We hope that this review will benefit your needs. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10 In general, clean visualization is not really one of the main features of the Pro Skater 2x from Tony Hawk. The atmosphere around Tony Hawk 1 and 2 has changed a lot, and the character models look a little better. When you look back at Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 and 2 on the old PS1, the idea that this old graphic is ugly goes through your head. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x graphics are VERY better. Character models are no longer filled with notches, the textures are smoother, but not to the farthest. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x’s visual effects are incompatible with Tony Hawk 3 graphics, but Activision probably didn’t want Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2x to have extraordinary graphics. Overall, the graphics deserve an average score of 7, because they did not use the full power of the Xbox to use here. The graphics are nice and clean, that's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Sound: 8 out of 10 Sound effects do not really help the imagination, but skateboards falling from the ground sound great, The main reason I assessed the sound factor was that you did not have to listen Tony Hawk's soundtrack is below average because there is a special soundtrack feature. The sound effects sound much better than the sounds in Tony Hawk 1 and 2, mainly because they are clearer, and simply because everything sounds great. One of the main reasons why I bought this game is because of the custom soundtrack. The sound effects still sound the same as in the first two games, only slightly corrected. One of the main problems of the sound factor is the fact that if the song is finished, it will NOT go to the next track, and the song you just listened to will simply play again. I do not like the soundtrack in the game, but, as I said, you do not have to listen to it. <br /> <br /> Controls: 10 out of 10 Controls are the best part of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. 2x. Control setting is surprisingly convenient, and easy to get used to. Back in the days of the Playstation, people thought the controls were the best, but it looks like 2x managed the Xbox better. Surprisingly, using a joystick is very easy to perform tricks. Activision did an excellent job with the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x controls. They made the Xbox controller the best for Tony Hawk games. You will not be disappointed with the management style, and this is a guarantee. <br /> <br /> Gameplay: 10 out of 10 Eliminating the fact that Pro Skater 2x from Tony Hawk is basically Tony Hawk 1 and 2 combined, the game is still incredibly fun. The game factor has changed a bit. This time you get a lot more air than in the first two games, and doing the tricks is much easier. In Pro Skater 2x by Tony Hawk, each character has three career modes, consisting of Tony Hawk 1 career, Tony Hawk 2 career and 2x career. Career Tony Hawk 1 is quite simple, because in the first game you will not get anything for the air. Career Tony Hawk 2 delivers the same difficulties as the version for the PlayStation. The only difficulty that relates to a 2x career is finding out where all the items are, but after you do this, 2x career is not at all difficult. In a 2x career, a total of 3 levels, and the first two levels consist of searching for secret tapes, collecting S-K-A-T-E and doing everything that is required for that particular level. The third level out of three is the competition level, where you must score a certain amount of points to get gold. In the first two levels, secret tapes and the collection of letters S-K-A-T-E are shown in both. Overall, the Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x still maintains the old Tony Hawk Pro Skater atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Story: - <br /> <br /> Funny Factor: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2x To date, the most fun game on the Xbox. I played Pro Skater Tony Hawk 1 and 2, and then I didn't like them, but for some reason Pro Skater 2x Tony Hawk is really funny. In fact, there is nothing special to say, except for the fact that Pro Skater 2x by Tony Hawk is the best Xbox game to date. One of the problems is that if you have already completed the game once, you will play it a couple more times, but it will be repeated. <br /> <br /> Repeat value: 10 of 10 Pro Skater Tony Hawk 2x provides high cost of playback. There are a lot of cheats that need to be unlocked, and a lot of character videos. Overall, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x has a lot of replay value, mainly because it's so much fun. <br /> <br /> Best feature: you do not have to listen to a crappy game soundtrack. Worst feature: a custom soundtrack is a bit flawed. <br /> <br /> Final statement: in the past, many have complained that they didn’t like Pro Skater 2x from Tony Hawk, because there’s nothing new in it, but they should stop complaining, because you get a lot of 50 games, 00 dollars. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10. Sound: 8 out of 10. Control: 10 out of 10. Game process: 10 out of 10. History: N / A Interesting factor: 10 out of 10. <br /> < br /> Overall rating: 9 out of 10.
