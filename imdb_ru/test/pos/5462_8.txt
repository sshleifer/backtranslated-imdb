Well, maybe the role models of Jay Leno and David Letterman are not in place, but you still get an idea of ​​who these people are and how they act behind the screen. Bob Balaban and Street Williams are great as Warren Littlefield and Michael Ovitz. <br /> <br /> There are no jokes and raisins in the film, but it's still funny. Kathy Bates, in particular, is gorgeous as a manager for Leno. <br /> <br /> Funny, surprising, interesting, very watchable, this is a good television film.
