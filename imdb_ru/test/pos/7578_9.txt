I liked two of the three films in the "Sarah, Plain and High" trilogy. This final of three, of course, was one of the "good." This is a great family movie with a great game of three adult stars: Christopher Walken, Glenn Close and Jack Palance. <br /> <br /> The storyline is simple but well narrated. The only performance was below one of the children. It was interesting to see how the children grew up from that first film. <br /> <br /> Of all three, this first “Sarah” was best shot with excellent cinematography. This film did not have this, but it had a better story. It had some really weeping sentimental moments and a very good ending. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
