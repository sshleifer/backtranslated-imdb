I like this movie. This is a lot of laughter. The game is good, and the letter is really sharp. I'd rather have watched a hundred of these films than The Three Lords Of The Rings, repeated and repeated. <br /> <br /> This is a low-budget business, and it seems that it was shot on DV, but it looks good, and Jay Mohr and Julian Nicholson are great together. Why do you have at least ten lines? I am not a critic, but simply a patron. <br /> <br /> I very much doubt that Quentin Tarantino could have written such an amusing picture without filling it with masturbative gratuitous cruelty. This film should be shown on more screens than on one. I laughed from start to finish. >
