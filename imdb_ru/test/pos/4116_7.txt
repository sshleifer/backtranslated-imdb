I thought it was a great movie, Richard Greiko and Yasmine Blyth have excellent chemistry in this film. The character Yasmine Blyth plays a woman who was defeated in love with the character of Richard Greiko. They end up marrying, and everything seems fine, except that Yasmine Blyth wants a child more than anything else, but itâ€™s hard to try to conceive a child. Richard Greiko will do everything to make her happy, and will take extreme measures to make her happy. I thought the acting was great in this film, and that makes you guess. It shows how naive a person can be when he falls in love. Yasmine Blyth is a good actress in this, and I wonder why she never did it further in her career. Richard Greiko is a very impressive deceptive husband and plays a very evil role very well. I wonder why some actors do it and some don't. Everything and every great movie that I would recommend.
