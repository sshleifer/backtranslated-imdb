Jean Dujardin nullifies Connery's manners: adjusting the cufflinks at the entrance to the club, when all the women turn to admire it, careless straightening and smoothing the tie, a cheeky, hard walk. It's strange, and you begin to understand how much of Bond in the sixties was the creation of Connery, not the character of Ian Fleming. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is a tribute to those early films, the film basically comes out of Russia with love and a lightning strike. The main joke is how chauvinistic the hero is, not only from the point of view of sexism, but also nationalism and colonialism, and how he sticks his noses out when he is sent to Egypt. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect - about 20 minutes in it, it seems, a movie with one joke, and its fragments resemble one of the fakes of the day, of which there were many. Morcecambe and Wise's The Intelligence Men had suspicious men in fez who also watched their heroes, and this is a bit retreating. Unlike Close Sellers or Borat Baron Cohen, Dujardin does not give his character such a layer of reality or genuine pathos - he is too busy perfecting his Connery manners. This is not enough for titles or a great song, and there is no ridiculous or serious villain, such as Dr. Evil Mike Myers or Nemesis Ricardo Montalban, for a hero to resist. <br /> <br /> But the scene when OSS117 wakes up one morning in Cairo made me laugh out loud at three-quarters of an empty movie theater, and it all looks great, plus you will never have the opportunity to see Operation “Baby Brother” on the screen and women are an ace, very hot. This is a fake Bond, not falling into the crazy sets of scientist / Ken Adam or the routine of funny gadgets. Recommended
