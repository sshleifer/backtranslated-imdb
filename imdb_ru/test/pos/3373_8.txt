Forget about Donnie Darko. I open it because it seems that most of the reviews I read on The Box come down to a simple but weak argument that he does not hold a candle for Darko. Not that I disagree with this necessarily, I just feel that this film is a completely different animal and deserves its own analysis. Of course, there are points of comparison, but these are minor problems, considering that the key to the heart of each film is different. In Darko, the narrative's driving force is existential. In The Box, narrative driving power stems from a moral dilemma. Believe me, when I say that I understand the tendency to compare the innovative films of cinematographers, looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to first approach each new film as a self-sufficient entity, and then expand my view. <br /> <br /> The Box is one of those films for which you have mixed feelings, because he seems to be experiencing some kind of identity crisis. Not always sure who he wants to be. The twists and turns are numerous, but easy to follow, if not predicted. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz play a relatively believable couple of newlyweds who are in a quandary. A box with a “push-button unit” arrives at their doorstep, and a terribly burned person informs them that when they press a button, one person they do not know will die and they will receive a million dollars. One of the things that the Box achieves is to cause this invisible fear that somewhere there our actions have moral consequences. Before pressing the button, it has an eerie and seductive quality, attractive, but ominous. As soon as this goes forward, the events are set in motion, forcing the two leaders to question their own morality and deeply regret their fatal decision. <br /> <br /> The idea that the Box is an experiment is interesting because for me it creates a paradox in the film. If there are external creatures developing an "altruism coefficient" based on data collected by pairs pressing and not pressing a button, then when the plot unfolds, we notice that this is ultimately a forced altruism: be disinterested or the species will be destroyed. I believe that couples do not know the consequences of their actions when faced with the need to make a decision, but they have no reason to suspect that The Box can do something, so why would they choose altruistically? Is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care about it when we are faced with a problem in our own life? <br /> <br /> Psychological barriers are everywhere in this film. Press the button or not, most likely, someone is contacting you. Take the money or not, no one gives out anything for free. Seek the truth, the answers that you find, slowly reveal your demise. <br /> <br /> I believe that the “Box” is an ironic work because it offers a false choice of free will, showing that we are trapped in many metaphorical blocks. You can choose freedom only at the expense of someone else’s life, is it freedom? No, this is just another box, because then you fall into the trap of the consequences of your own morality. We can not avoid, because we live on earth, and this is another Box. That is why the external creatures in the film are ultimately antagonists. They demand that we meet the moral standards that deprive us of our freedom. We got to Mars, and we were burned for it and turned into slaves in a sick game. <br /> <br /> The references to Jean-Paul Sartre illustrate this point quite well. "You can only enter the last camera for free or not for free." Of course, but no matter what form we enter the chamber, it is nonetheless a camera. <br /> <br /> Trevor Nemeth
