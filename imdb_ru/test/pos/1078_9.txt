Business versus personal conviction. Profit versus art. <br /> <br /> As in any documentary film in which capitalist large corporations are opposed to small producers, the viewer must always take sides with one or the other, based on his own convictions. This is the same documentary about the new standardized way of action that globalization brings us, contrary to the old traditional ways, when the character and art of creating things matter almost more than selling a product. <br /> <br /> If you need to remember one thing from this film, this is what the masses can no longer decide for themselves; they simply follow the taste of one or more critics who tend to align and standardize the taste just like McDonald's do for a quick bite (something Parker himself admits in the film against the background of the Burger King sign). “It's all about image” versus content, as another interlocutor says. This is a simple way, a standardized way. It's easier than spending time ripening a good wine, it's easier than working out your own taste, having tried and tried again. Manage corporate taste easier. <br /> <br /> Hope flashes when even some of our overseas cousins ​​agree that several people “align” the taste of wines in order to maximize profits and ensure maximum profits from this are sold to “gray masses”. Personality and differences are sacrificed for an extra dollar. It's nice to see that not all or all lend themselves to standardization, even across the ocean. <br /> <br /> As in many other areas of the modern world, the dominance of the few and the limited freedom of choice affect all of us. ... let everyone decide and decide where to go. Too much standardization kills mind and taste; The difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow you to make a choice - and not only in vacuum-packed “more of the same”. Standardization sells easily and a lot, and brings everyone to the same level - the bottom. <br /> <br /> With this, I'm going to open a beautiful bottle and wish you a satisfying “Santa”.
