Many reviewers prefer the original version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, which I did not have the opportunity to view. The 56 year old version itself is a very well-made film. Hitchcock’s mid-late fifties films (including Back Window, Dial M for Murder, Dizziness, and Catch a Thief, as well as this film) are one of my favorite periods in his career. In "The Man Who Knew Too Much," Jimmy Stewart energetically rushes into his role, as always. Doris Day is very believable as an atypical blond Hitchcock. I thought that there was nothing false about it. Her character may not have been written as much as the original, but it definitely does not come down to the role of the passive “Yes, dear,” the pretty thing on Jimmy Stewart’s hand. <br /> <br /> There were some really clever lines written for Hank (the son of a couple who was kidnapped later) in the debut scene on the bus - it’s too bad that Christopher Olsen reads them so rudely. However, in the 50s you can rarely see a good play of a child actor. Most of the other supporting actors in this film were very competent, especially the killer (played by Reggie Nalder). <br /> <br /> Some of the small touches that make this film are undoubtedly Hitchcockian- using non-English dialogue, especially French (something Hitch did on a much larger scale, in Catch a Thief); the use of foreboding, Arabic music in the hotel, when the killer appears; Stewart and Day talk to each other in church, sing their words to the melody of the hymn; the Albert Hall scene, which, in particular, shows the musicians and the killer's accomplice, watching the score, creating tension, as well as the drummer, preparing the cymbals; and finally, the killer's pistol, which appears from behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it had to be done mechanically (the Hitch effect was also used at the end of Enchanted). <br /> <br /> In general, a person who knew too much is a fun movie to watch. He is not as deep and not as full of symbolism as some of his films ("Dizziness", "Strangers on the Train"), but, nevertheless, this is one of my top five masterpieces of Hitchcock.
