This movie is great. Stylish, fun, plays well. I saw it described in various ways as “Locking, Stock and Two Smoking Muskets” and “Pistols”, both of which are excellent descriptions. The plot is simple, but it does not detract from the pleasure. Carlisle is a brilliant hooligan, and Miller is a great drunk gentleman. The sets and costumes are awesome, and the music and camera work are unusually unusual for “costume drama”. He definitely has no sense and sensitivity !!!!! My recommendation? Go see, sit down with a huge popcorn tank and have a hell of a good time.
