After watching Ingmar Bergman's Scammen, I had a lot of feelings, but I especially felt dissatisfied. I heard so much hype about this movie, but I found it was missing. Don't get me wrong, I can fully appreciate the artistic value of such a film, but as far as depth and emotions are concerned, I was not so impressed. I found that the characters are unpleasant and unreal, which distracts from the dramatic effect. In addition, the fact that the war was a fake made me feel that the emotion was not real. Dramatic war films, in my opinion, are much more effective if events (not necessarily the story itself) really happened. I find that of all the films that are trying to show cruelty, this one falls in the middle, as far as efficiency.
