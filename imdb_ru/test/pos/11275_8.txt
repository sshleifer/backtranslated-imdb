First of all, this is a feature film, and a good one. I liked the presentation and the way it was filmed. Very cool. Certain scenes were one of the most graphic horror episodes I've ever seen. This movie scared me not because of insecurity or shock, but because I was mortally afraid that I would soon see something really awful. This happened in several places, but mostly at the beginning. This film also dragged on and 74 minutes seemed long. However, if you're in a movie, you should see this. To date, I have not seen anything like it. 8/10
