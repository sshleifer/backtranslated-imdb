If this film, at least, is not chosen by the nominee for the best foreign film, I will stop waking up at night, watching the event. Fridrik Thor Fridriksson proved that money is not the key to making a good film, but originality. From the cold of the country comes a warm, but suggestive film about a mentally ill person and his struggle with the insane world. After such an understanding, you are wondering whether this person is crazy or the world in which he lives.
