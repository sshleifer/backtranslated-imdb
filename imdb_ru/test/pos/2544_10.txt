I was very impressed with this production, probably at all levels; from production to plot and character development. <br /> <br /> this definitely belongs to the “realism” genre, because there is nothing here that could use creative imagination, perversion or manipulation of the audience in how the viewer feel, think and donkey. <br /> <br /> Actors are wonderful, especially "small." The chemistry between brother and sister is amazing, perhaps not even as common as in real life. This is a film that looks great in the truest sense of the word, visualizing it. everyone knows when a movie is good, when it just doesn’t want it to end, but in the end everything turns out ...
