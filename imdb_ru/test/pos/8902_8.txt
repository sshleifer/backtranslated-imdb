Being a loyal fan of Asterix all my life, I must say that Asterix and the Vikings is probably the nicest of all Asterix films. There are very funny jokes in it, and the animation is great. As many have noted, in fact he is not very closely following the plot of the comic (Asterix and Normans), but in many ways it’s as good because this book stands out in my head like the one that was poked in the culture of the sixties, and most of it is very outdated today. <br /> <br /> What really struck me was how they included the Disney-style plot in the film, which distracted most of the attention from Asterix and Obelix. We have a misunderstood boy who doesn't fit, Justforkix. We have a girl boy who doesn’t fit because he wants to be treated like men, Abba. They meet and fall in love, but their love is threatened, because the boy is ashamed to be completely honest with the girl, but in the end their love will win. It was the plot of so many Disney films (and, frankly, other studios) that it’s not funny, and the plot was twenty years old. I mean, they even gave Justforckix a fancy engagement with animals. <br /> <br /> I not only found this derivative and clichéed, but it really distracted from the story and left me unhappy. <br /> <br /> I think it tells you how excellent the rest of the film is, that I still really appreciate it, even though the plot was hacked.
