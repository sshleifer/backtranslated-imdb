What makes this low-budget production one of my favorite movies? No kidding, looking already 10 times or so and not getting tired. Is it gentle melancholy in all this? Is it similar to the classic like Niagara? I thought about it for a long time. And I figured it out: I think it is this way: there is no hero, there are only people. Some try to be good. Some have stopped trying to be good. Some of them are hopeless, but they are still human. This is a story about a disastrous motel night on the edge of the world. One way to crash is nothing more than the end of a chain of coincidences. Another way this night reveals the logical consequences of the life of these peoples, because they are in a certain constellation, cut off from the rest of the world. This is something like a fairy tale of Dostoevsky.
