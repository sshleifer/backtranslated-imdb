After a long shoot at the West End, this charming film outplayed Margaret Rutherford as director of “Miss Whitchurch” in this financially successful adaptation made in 1950. <br /> <br /> All internal filming took place at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. London Exterior scenes were filmed on-site at a public school for girls near Liss in Hampshire. During the 12-week break, Margaret Rutherford and Joyce Grenfell stayed at a nearby hotel and often attended school in the evenings, where they would have enjoyed enjoying the company of real school mistresses. <br /> <br /> Although the film script contains only two original lines from the original play, the main roles and supporting actors are in good shape, and you can only sympathize with their predicaments, especially in the final scenes.
