Another fantastic offer from the Monkey Island team, and although it was a long time, and he had to survive the departure of Ron Gilbert, this is another worthy contribution. The only thing that bothers me is that, compared to the previous two, they looked a bit short, although this may be due to the great lack of disk replacement. Roll on MI4.
