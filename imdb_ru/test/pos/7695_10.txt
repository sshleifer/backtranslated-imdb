I was 13 years old when I saw this heavily underrated film in the ADAMS theater in Newark, New Jersey, I bought the program, and later bought the soundtrack ... I still have ... I am now 55+ years old. ... and haven't seen him since (maybe once on network television, in the 1960s ???) One of the greatest actors ever gathered, great music and production, please allow another generation to see this wonderful the film ... It was my introduction to the opera and helped with my understanding of tolerance .. Please, the Gerswhins or Premingers family, release this classic soon!
