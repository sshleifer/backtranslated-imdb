Sick man Carlton Hendrix (Dee Snyder) travels on the lines of Teen Chat in the role of captain Howdy. He pretends to be a teenager and invites other teens to his house for a party. Instead, he knocks them out, strips, sews up his mouth and tortures them (mostly with needles). He captures the daughter of policeman Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). He finds him, arrests him, and he is legitimate. Four years later, he is released ... completely cured. But Lynch Mop (led by funny Robert Englund) attacks him and hangs him. He does not die, but snaps, and Captain Howdy is back ... <br /> <br /> A very sick, disturbing, perverted horror film. Captain Howdy experiences pain and torture and tries to show the children that he is abducting as he likes it. The scenes of torture are not so obvious (you hear more than you see), but what you see is very, very bad. There is no humor and the (muffled) cries of his victims sound too real. I was repressed from the TV during most scenes. <br /> <br /> Actors change. Kevin Gage is not as good as a cop - he is not terrible, but he could be better. Dee Snyder is very scary, like Captain Howdy - his scenes of attack are not pleasant. <br /> <br /> In general, not your typical horror movie. I probably will never see him again (this film is really under your skin), but I recommend it to all horror fans - at least those with strong stomachs. I give him 7.
