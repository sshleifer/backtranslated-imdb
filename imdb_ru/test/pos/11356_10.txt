I think that New York Times film critic Elvis Mitchell wrote the best single-line review, “In the mood for love,” when he said that it was “dizzy from a romantic spirit that wasn’t in the movies forever.” How true are these words! Truly romantic films these days are so rare, while films that have a lot of sex and naked bodies (which are often portrayed perversely and for no reason) abound. Thus, given this cinematic climate, Wong Kar-wai’s latest film seems like a very necessary breath of fresh air. The “Mood for Love” is about a doomed romance between two neighbors (“Mr. Chow” played by Tony Leung and “Mrs. Chan” played by Maggie Cheung), whose spouses enter into an illegal novel because they try “not to be like on them. But after they hang out with each other on lonely nights (when their spouses leave for “business” / “caring for a sick mother”), they fall madly in love and must resist the temptation to go too far. <Br /> <br /> Several factors are responsible for making “The Mood for Love” a new classic among “romantic melodramas”, in the best sense of the word. First, the specific period of the film (i.e., the 1960s in Hong Kong) is accurately recreated with an amazing degree of detail. Clothing (including beautiful Maggie Cheung dresses), music (for example, Nat King Cole) and the general atmosphere of this film are nostalgic for this particular period. Secondly, Christopher Doyle’s award-winning, stunningly beautiful cinematography creates an environment that not only envelops her two main characters, but seems to trickle with romantic longing in each of her luxurious, carefully crafted shots. Make no mistake about this: “The Mood for Love” was the most magnificent film of 2001. (It should also be noted that Wong Kar-wai’s usual hyperkinetic visual style is (understandably) softened for this film, although his pallet remains just as colorful.) she walked in her elegant dresses, Chan and Chow "looked at" each other as they walked up the stairs, and other beautiful scenes that were captured in memory. The main score, because of which her instruments sound like they are literally crying, sounds eight times at different points in the film, and this underlines the sadness and longing that the two main characters experience. Fourthly, Tony Leng and Maggie Cheung are excellent speakers (Leng received the prize for the best male role in Cannes), and they manage to generate real chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned elements come together and work beautifully together to create a film that seems out of time, “breathtakingly romantic” and, in a word, magical. In “The Mood for Love”, perhaps more than in any other 2001 film, reminded me why I love “going to the cinema”. And I think this is the highest compliment I can pay for a movie. <br /> <br />
