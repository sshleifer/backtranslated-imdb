This movie is so cool. He told me to enjoy every moment of life in its entirety. I think Bonnie Hunt (Jerry Maguire) writes well, and I'm so happy that she gave aging actors the opportunity to play such big roles in the film. This is really great, in a society that worships wealth, health and youth, it was nice to watch a movie about normal people. The film very much reminded me of “While you slept” that I really like. If you don't like this movie, you should work on your sensitivity skills. <br /> <br /> Favorite quotes: Megan Dayton: “I'm just saying, for safety's sake, don't shave your legs, because then you definitely won't let it go too far. "Grace Briggs:" Megan, this is the first date. "Megan Dayton:" I got married on the first date. I am sure that you plan to be balanced, but as soon as you are at the moment, the male brain seems, I do not know, everything what they say suddenly seems brilliant. Hairy legs are your only connection to reality. " Favorite scenes: Megan (hunt for goodwill) rides a bicycle. All scenes in the garden. Talk and friendship between a grandfather and friends in a restaurant. Please do not miss this movie, it will warm your heart!
