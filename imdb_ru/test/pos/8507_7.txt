I saw NSNA right after I saw all the films of Roger Moore, and I must say it was so nice to see Connery again. He proves for all times that he is the one and only Bond. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is not really a masterpiece, but itâ€™s really worth seeing. Here the jokes are much better, the effects are funny and interesting, Connery is Connery, and Brandauer is a really good villain. But von Sydow is simply wasted, and the score is not often good, and there are several scenes that seem rather unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 7/10 \ 2.5 / 4 \ 3+ (1+ - 6-)
