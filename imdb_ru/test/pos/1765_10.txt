In this roughly 34-second short film by Thomas Edison, we see Annabelle Moore choreograph Loy Fuller's “Snake Dance” in two different fantastic, flowing clothes. <br /> <br /> Moore was one of the biggest stars of the late Victorian era. She was featured in several Edison shorts, including this one, which was one of the first Kinetoscope films shown in London in 1894. <br /> <br /> Loi Fuller actually patented Snake Dance, which Moore performs here in clothes (as well as entire shots), which are often tinted in the film by hand, anticipating one of the most common symbolic devices of the era of silence. Presumably, Moore's films were popular enough to be redone frequently (including re-filming). The version available to us now may be a later version / remake. Moore became even more popular when it was rumored that she would appear naked at a private party in a restaurant in New York. She later became the star of the Gibson Bathing Girl in Ziegfeld Falsa in 1907. She appeared there until 1912. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it creates movement, especially during the “second half”, becomes almost abstract. This is somewhat similar to the picture of Morris Louis, although it is almost 60 years before the corresponding work of Louis. < br /> <br /> You can find this short film on DVD on a number of different anthologies of early films.
