I am glad that I first read the Sarah Waters novel, because at that time I had my own images of characters in my head. However, the actors who starred for this performance did not disappoint at all - in fact, after I got used to Rachel Sterling in the role of Nan, I think Nina Gold did an excellent job of casting. (Could Keely Howse be more delicious?!) BBC did it again: this is a wonderful production of a very good book, and they made it stylish. If you manage to get it (VHS, DVD), be sure to get the 181-minute version (without censorship). This is an amazing journey, although sometimes a bit difficult, which you will not regret.
