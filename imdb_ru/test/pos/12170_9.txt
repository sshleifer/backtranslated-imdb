These three directors go to a good start. Three stories are remarkably well-made for independent productions and reflect those traumatic feelings of “going out” when you are not sure that this is a good idea. I laughed at those veiled looks around the locker room at Pool Days; I smiled at the thought that the fans of Bette Midler, Judy Garland and Barbara Streisand are supposed to be gay in “Friend Dorothy” (that is, watching music CD racks); and I cringed at the "fun" in "Disco Years", whose memory of sweet sex was now "washed away" by liquor. It all seemed so real. I look forward to new proposals from this trio of directors.
