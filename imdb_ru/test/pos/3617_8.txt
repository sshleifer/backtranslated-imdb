I have to admit that I approached this film with a sense of anticipation and fear. Louis de Bernier's bestseller is one of my favorites, and anyone who reads it will understand that by no means can any adaptation of the screen be 100% correct. <br /> <br /> All along the way, I found myself convinced that the film had failed, and threw the plot of the book to such an extent that it made it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the film afterwards. Nevertheless, the pros (excellent cinematography by John Toll, the excellent assessment of Stephen Warbeck, etc.), in my opinion, did not outweigh my initial negatives (Cage's mistake, a very diluted script). <br /> <br /> But after two days I stood in line again to see Corelli, and, although not perfect, I have to admit that this film is the best thing to expect. Cage is really great in the role that even de Bernier was worried about. He was not a fully rounded character: his carefree spirit, which gives way to repentant repentance, fits perfectly and perfectly complements the magnificent double act of Penelope Cruz and John Herth. David Morrissey calmly acts like Weber, a Nazi officer who tries to reconcile his feelings for his newfound Italian friends and his inborn superiority complex with those around him. And the wonderful Greek-Italian cast brings the dazzlingly lively frozen world of Kefolonia de Bernier. <br /> <br /> After leaving the cinema for the second time, I finally let go of my passion for romance, which prevented me from fully appreciating the history of World War II Cephony in cinematic terms. I take my hat off to John Madden, who, despite the almost expected critical blow he receives from British critics (any director who has achieved such great success as Shakespeare in love behind them, is always the goal for these moaning grandmothers!) a terribly complicated book on the big screen with such a heart, enthusiasm and humanity (in fact, the main advantages of the novel) that he created another classic love story that is likely to be fully appreciated only when the dust settles. years later. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the book, as I am, it is difficult, but try not to make the same mistake when you first view it. Try to erase the book for two hours from memory, take a dip in the magnificent Mediterranean atmosphere and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr. Yannis, as if for the first time (imagine you are watching something made from the original script) and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> In fact, you look forward to having your own copy of this amazing movie on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> 8/10
