The story of the obsessed lover (Shah Rukh Khan) and how long he has been trying to find his true love (Juhi Chawla), which is already married to her husband (Sunny Deol). The film is considered one of the best performances of Shah Rukh Khan and won his recognition from both critics and viewers. The fear that your love cannot be mutual, the fear that you may lose someone you love, the fear that your lover may change your mind. In short, fear is the villain in every love story. <br /> <br /> But in Darra, fear is the ultimate expression of passion, obsession and sacrifice. Darr is the story of Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan), whose love and obsession with Kiran (Juhi Chawla) frees him from all fears of life and death. “Darr” is the story of Sunil (“Sunny Deol”), whose enduring love and passion for Kieran gives him the courage to resist the fear of death. <br /> <br /> And finally, “Darr” is the story of Kiran, between the man’s love and the obsession of another person. She is afraid of one and is afraid of another. One is love, the other is life. In this battle between love and life, the supreme winner is love, because love always wins in life and death. Just “Darr” is one of the best Indian films ever made.
