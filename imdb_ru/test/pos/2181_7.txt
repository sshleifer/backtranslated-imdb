This cheap remake of the terrific five star finale suffers from terrible gameplay. Stars Humphrey Bogart as the manager of a slazoidnoy radio station, which is desperately trying to raise the rating. The owner decides to write a series of moral plays about the famous case of the murder of 20 years ago. Therefore, they hire a fake preacher (Harry Hayden) to hunt down the killer, who was acquitted and lived quietly under an assumed name. The preacher arrives on the day of his daughter's wedding, but the ruthless radio station refuses to refuse to expose the mother and ruin their lives. <br /> <br /> Bogart is always good. Hayden is good as a slimy preacher, and Henry O'Neill is good as a father. All the others are just awful. Helen McKeller does not get sympathy (crucial for this role), Linda Perry is a lousy actress, Beverly Roberts is fine, but always looks old, Claire Dodd and Hobart Cavan have no roles, Carlyle Moore is a loser, like a friend, Virginia Brissac is mistaken the society's mother, Robert Middlemas replays as the owner of the station. <br /> <br /> This book is less than an hour, but is a pale copy of the original, which boasts dynamic performances by Edward G. Robinson, Elin McMahon, Francis Starr and Boris Karloff. But always worth watching Boagrt.
