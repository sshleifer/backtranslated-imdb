I really liked this movie. I read a book ten years ago and was intrigued by how it would be translated into a movie. <br /> <br /> The script is very faithful to the book that fascinated me - this in itself is rare These days. Characteristics were solid and trustworthy, and stroytelling made me shift in my perception, although I already knew the end of the book. <br /> <br /> A smart and well thought out movie.
