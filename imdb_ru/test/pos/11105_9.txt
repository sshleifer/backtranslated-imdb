For the 1980s, this is a very dark movie. At this point, the directors began to act on the assumption that all films need smart comic relief (which, of course, goes to extremes today), vivid action scenes (even more exaggerated today) or vivid sex scenes. /> <br /> Hatton and Penn play a huge role in the role of childhood friends who became Soviet spies. Penn, in particular, is great as the unfortunate drug dealer Dalton Lee. <br /> <br /> You have a real thriller / drama. There is nothing to talk about here, but the story is so convincing and so gorgeous that (I hope) that most people will not miss it. There are a couple of funny scenes, in particular, the one where Penn is trying to engage his Soviet benefactors in a major drug deal. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
