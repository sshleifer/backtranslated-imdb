Although Dr. Sius should be honored for stealing the Horton Hatch's Egg storyline, it was a great movie. This affected both emotion and intelligence. Particularly because of the incredible performance of seven-year-old Justin Henry and the script, which sympathizes with each character (and every predicament), the elements that make you think linger long after the tears of jerks end. Overall, an excellent game from a solid cast, excellent direction and a very powerful script. The right touch of humor helps to avoid that the “heavy” object becomes tedious or difficult to read. Finally, this film stands the test of time and, it seems, is by no means outdated decades after its release.
