“Showtime” is a funny movie with the participation of funny people by Robert DeNiro (“Meet the Parents”, “The Story of the Bronx”) and Eddie Murphy (“Shrek”, Dr. Doolittle). The story is this: At the beginning of the film, Detective Mitch (Robert De Niro) and another detective go to a television store, trying to kill some criminals. When policemen appear, policeman Trey (Eddie Murphy) tries to arrest Mitch, not knowing that he is a policeman. During this scene a lot of fun things happen that come into the view of producer Chase Ritz. She is so excited about their joint adventures that she decides to arrange a TV show called “Showtime” with Trey (the policeman) and Mitch (the detective) in the lead roles. But this is just the fun part. The rest is strict expectation and action. There is a foreigner who sells and produces extremely dangerous weapons. Playing LAPD on the show and doing it in real life, De Niro and Murphy have a real adventure in this story. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give her seven or eight.
