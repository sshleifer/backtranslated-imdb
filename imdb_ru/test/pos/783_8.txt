The British turn in Harold and Fashion, Driving lessons show the harnessed Rupert Grint and overly Julie Walters. Although it is true that Grint is stony-faced, like the red-haired Benjamin Braddock in the first half of the film, this does not deter the dodgy family film — there are things that come from his character’s experience that can create contused reactions. The chemistry between Walters and Grint carries the film, although Laura Linney’s difficult work to make her written stereotype a man is also noticeable. These performances, combined with an amusing pop soundtrack with artists such as Sufyan Stevens, John Renborn and Salsa Celtic, make this children's popcorn worthy of a Saturday evening.
