I watched this show on TV in 1990, and I really liked it (I was nine years old). I bought the first DVD box about six months ago, and received the second couple of days ago (thanks to my dear husband). Damn it ... It was hard to fall asleep with all the thoughts in my head ... what should have happened to Madeline, George, etc. D. The problems of slaves and civil war always fascinated me (25-year-old Finn). I advise Edward Ball to read Slaves in the Family for those who want to look into the past and try to understand what really happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I want to see heaven and hell after so many people said here that it was not very good.
