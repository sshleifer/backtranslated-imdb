If I assume that you know what this film is about, I also have to assume that you came to this review, knowing that you will probably watch it no matter what I say. If all this sounds true - read on - you will probably find some agreement with at least part of this review. If you are undecided or not quite sure about what happened in the late 70s and early 80s in urban and suburban youth musical culture, you should probably read one of the reviews, which instead claims to be objective. <br /> <br /> Although I didn’t grow up in California, the American punk scene was the first music scene I really lived in. In the midst of hardcore, in which I was immersed from about 1979-1981, everyone had a group and a group. The only common denominators between groups and members of their audience were: <br /> <br /> * rejection of conformity <br /> <br /> * tolerance and enjoyment of differences <br /> <br /> * a desire to have fun - hard and fast. <br /> <br /> Hairstyles, politics, hostility to authority figures and brutal dances in Schlame were not an integral part of what I experienced, although, of course, there were cliques or factions prone to intolerance from those who did not dress, spoke or acted "punk" enough. And often, from some of these cliques, a certain amount of unearned credits turned out to be those who really tried their best to justify themselves with the fascist paradigm of anarchic, mutilated, angry young policemen. <br /> <br /> Although interviews with punk audiences in Penelope Spheris’s excellent documentary, “The Decline of Western Civilization”, present a very narrow view of the subculture that some of us enjoyed, interviews with groups, club owners, promoters, and even security personnel better represent, at least, my own point of view and memories of the "scene". nevertheless, for those who approach this with prejudices about what punk is, it is possible to experience this film without disputing their prejudices. It is sad, but the blame for this lies solely on those who promote stereotypes, believe in them or feel comfortable, and not on directors. Do not blame the messenger. <br /> <br /> The music presented here is not for everyone - and not even for the majority. This is not the crudest thing, but it is loud, unpleasant, fast and less concerned with technology than raw energy. <br /> <br /> For me, the early “Black Flag” with Ron Reyes singing “X, Fear and the Circle Jerks” cost much more than the cost of this hard-to-find film. As much as I like The Germs, seeing Darby Crash for a mess — and a nice guy — that he left me a little cold. However, the scenes of Darby playing with his beloved tarantula, while “Shut Down” were buzzing again and again in the background, were precious. The X interview is also great. <br /> <br /> Spheeris’s simple documentary style is complemented by wild panning and zooming during the music segments. During the interview, the frames are used very well to provide a context for everything that is being said. Considering her experience and budget, Sphiris did everything she could with any film. <br /> <br /> Recommended for those who appreciate what this film really is about, and for those who have forgotten these few years of fun. Honest, stupid uprising before the American punk hit another stream in mainstream music, and stereotypes have become more important than the basic philosophy.
