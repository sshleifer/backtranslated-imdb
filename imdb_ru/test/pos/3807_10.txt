I liked this film, I saw it when I was about 8 years old and almost seven years later, I saw it again tonight. I really thought it was an interesting idea, the only thing that upset me was the ending, which I felt was a cop. “It’s hard to find this film, and I was lucky to see it on BRAVO. I also expected to see more Drew Barrymore here!
