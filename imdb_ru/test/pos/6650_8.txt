I really liked this epic of Minghella, which I did not think so much as the “English patient” (modern classic). For the first 20 minutes or so I feel awkward, but when Inman (Jude Law) goes on a journey back to his love Ave (Nicole Kidman), the film develops very quickly and becomes a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. Apparently, it is now fashionable to hate Kidman, but I do not agree at all, and here she is fine. I actually think that the romance between Inman and Ada in the script is poorly developed (they really don’t get much time together to develop a relationship), but Law and Kidman give all their strength and convince. Ada's journey - the essence of the film - she becomes a strong woman who can endure almost everything. Zellweger at first seems to be quite different from Ruby, but she still grows on you and sparkles in many of her later scenes. The film is a beautiful photograph and set design, but it never reflects the true feeling of the historical period. Jack White, in particular, has long curly hair and a pale rocker complexion that looks completely out of place in the setting. Fans of Killian Murphy will love to see a talented Irish actor in an early episode, and Natalie Portman actually proves that she can play in perhaps the brightest sequence of the film. It is a pity that in “Another Boleyn girl” she is so inadequate.
