This is one of the best non-English series I have seen. He weaves interesting single and double episodes of solving a crime along with a personal aspect that you simply donâ€™t get in CSI. All characters have a personal life that goes well with their daily work and sometimes interferes. In addition, all the characters manage to develop naturally throughout all the episodes. <br /> <br /> The cast is great, it was shot all over Denmark, which gives a good example of the highlights that a great country can offer. Unfortunately, only 32 episodes were made, however they are first-class television. We hope that they will think about making a few more episodes of the same caliber.
