I can not understand that you need to jump back and forth to the set and draw the plot. I believe that showing that someone has the skill right before using it offends our intellect. It starts to seem a bit far-fetched, and as if they are making up the vagueness in the first three episodes. A little disappointing this episode. <br /> <br /> Also, using past quirks, such as Lockeâ€™s ability to know when a storm ends, is frankly offensive ... should we oooooooo laugh at the softer side of Locke? <br /> <br /> This episode was everywhere.
