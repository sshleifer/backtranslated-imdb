This show was a pleasant surprise after watching Mad TV on Saturday evening. Spike is a great host who, as you can tell, is still getting used to, but he adapts well to his new job. I can imagine that this is a difficult transition from the writer (Seinfeld) to the host, however, unlike many new talk show hosts, he does not allow airtime to go trying to figure out what to do next. It is fast, and each segment and section smoothly into each other. It also doesn't hurt that he's a little sexy, so he's not as picky about his eyes as Leno or Letterman. I can't remember the exact date of the episode, which was my favorite, but I especially LOVED the Idiot Paparazzi parody with fake J-Lo and Katie Holmes. Great new show !!
