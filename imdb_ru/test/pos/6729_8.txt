I remember watching it as a child at the Children's Film Festival on Friday, dedicated to special films, at CBBC, and recently found out about it. <br /> <br /> Over twenty years since my last viewing of this film I haven’t lost anything. <br /> <br /> This is an atmospheric tale that seduces with Cornish folklore and adds elements of the really creepy images of the ghost of a young miner Billy. <br /> <br /> Filmed in an amazingly picturesque place in the Port-Lo area of ​​Cornwall, the film uses a mixture of rugged coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the situation truly believable. <br /> <br /> In this CFF drama, much has been laid that has long been lost from Children's Television and it’s worth seeing if you can track a copy.
