Vladislav Starewicz was a Russian animator living in France who did incredible things using stop-motion. I have seen a couple of such films before, and they feature his favorite subjects - insects, frogs and various animals. They are extremely realistic and realistic, and even today it is amazing to watch - the quality is fantastic. <br /> <br /> In this game there are lots and lots of frogs. They appeal to their god Jupiter with a request to give them a king. Why should they be a king, Jupiter wonders - their life is now in perfect order. So, in order to teach them an unpleasant lesson, he makes the heron king, and one after another she begins to eat her objects! Then the frogs again turn to Jupiter, who states the obvious moral that it is better to be happy with what you have! <br /> <br /> Although the quality of the animation is incredible, this is a very creepy movie for kids. I think it would scare them both about how real the animals look, as well as the story itself, which is not for the faint of heart!
