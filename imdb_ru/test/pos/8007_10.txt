And the perfect movie to watch during the holiday season, as the winter / Christmas atmosphere that Burton creates for Gotham City is cool. It is strange that Warner decided to release it as a summer movie. This does not fit. <br /> <br /> But what’s even stranger when you look at the content of this film is that it was aimed at families. The family of the highest class throws his mutant child into the sewers, the social-phobic billionaire puts on his skin like a flying rodent, the lonely secretary puts on his skin like a cat, and the freak runs to a political post. Both S & M and slavery are presented in a very perverted way. But Burton got away with it. His visual style in this film is the best. <br /> <br /> This and Batman: Dead End are the only true incarnations of comics. True, the animated series was closest to the original material, but compared to “Batman forever,” and the nameless after that, “The Return of Batman” is the best of the four. <br /> <br /> Darker and tougher than in the first film, the feeling of gothic pathos reaches a new maximum. I was delighted with Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne (don't even turn me on to George Clooney!), He showed the right balance of a strange loner and a tough crime fighter. Michelle Pfiffer is gorgeous as Catwoman (much sexier and more “realistic” like a cat), she wears this leather suit better than Halle Berry. And Danny DeVito was so convincing as a Penguin that his scenes began to interfere with watching. And Christopher Walken is great in the role of creepy Max Shrek (if you think you will recognize Chip Shrek, this is nothing but a very young Leatherface / Butterfinger). <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman's score is also even better than the first time round. His powerful and attractive themes are much better than the slags that followed in the next two Schumacher films. This film - the phenomenon of Batman at its zenith. Forget the following sequels and stick to the animated series after that. Hopefully, Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale will return some integrity to the live action movie Batman with his film next year. <br /> <br /> This DVD was one of the first ever DVDs released by Warner (almost 7 years ago !! !!) and as a result there are no features, and the case is the snapper. Pick it cheap as I hope for the SE in the future.
