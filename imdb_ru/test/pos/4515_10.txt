Kite Runner was beautiful, sharp and very touching. I especially loved the two child actors in the film as well as the actor depicting the father. It really made me want to come back and read the book again. <br /> <br /> Music was a wonderful part of the film. If a soundtrack is released for the film, I will buy it to accompany my second reading of the book. This is also a visually stunning movie. The cinematography was great and really added to the experience. <br /> <br /> The Brazilian word “saudades” very much describes what I felt at the end of the film ... "This is a deep feeling of longing for someone." or somewhere that is very sweet, but with a touch of inevitable sadness ”(definition provided by Antonio Carlos Chobim many years ago). <br /> <br /> I saw this in a small preview cinema. I would really like to see him again on a really big screen with a deceived sound system. <br /> <br /> I can’t wait for the official release. I will definitely recommend the movie to friends.
