Unfortunately, it seems that this film is transferred to the status of "curious." Many people I asked: “Did you know that Monkeys made a movie?” Usually answer “no”. However, if you are one of this large number, I recommend you to see it, but with the following reservations: If you expect humor in style Monkeys, he is there. It's just not everywhere, like in TV shows. <br /> <br /> Yes, they are trying to slightly break their television form by poking fun at it, as a group of teenagers who were already at the short end of a large number of sticks. <br /> <br /> No, you do not need to be intoxicated to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> No, you do not need to be intoxicated, understand this. <br /> <br /> If you love the classics, you will love the interspersed clips. <br /> <br /> If you love the psychedelic era, you'll love some of the cameos. <br /> If you are a Monkees fan, you might recognize some of the jabs that they experience with the intensive commercialization of the band. <br /> <br /> In the almost immortal words of one of my Best friends after 5 minutes of viewing: "This is a strange movie, dude." In fact, it may be better if you do not try to understand this, just sit back and respond to it. It's strange, it's funny, it's a bit surreal, it's experimental (still) ... it's a lot of things. In general, it is an experience.
