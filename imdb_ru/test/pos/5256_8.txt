“Women” is a cute film about women of all ages (but mostly 30+) and their problems in life. Not only about men and infidelity, but also about relationships with friends and family, how to find time to communicate with other people, problems with image, compromise of your values, life achievements and search for what really makes you happy. <br /> <br /> It is also about being true to yourself. Often people will give you advice, but they will not follow them. Sometimes they create an illusion for themselves, and you have to really go the same way or react based on your feelings now? I really liked this movie. Of course, sometimes he tried to look like Sex & the City, but it probably helped me in this. The difference here is that it is similar to the discoveries after the stage of life in which the stars “Sex and the City” were stars - here the majority are married or are already trying to find a man. Now they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and lives. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is not a candidate for an Oscar, but it is interesting and serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> And for men there were an equal number of men and women in the cinema (most of them were with their wives / girlfriends), and the men actually laughed. :)
