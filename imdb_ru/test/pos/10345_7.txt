Ninke is a stylish film shot in the same style as the Character film, which won an Oscar (1997). But this comparison immediately prompts me to add that the latter was much more exciting ... Of course, Ninke is a beautiful historical drama and costume drama (with the fantastic play of Monique Hendrix!), In which you see personal growth 'Nynke van Hichtum' in her marriage to Peter Jelles Troelstroy. The subtitle of this film is "a love story." So begins and ends their marriage. <br /> <br /> But it is here that the director makes the decisive mistake! Ninke's fascinating, independent life began when the marriage ended. She wrote several children's books and traveled the world. What a wonderful life she lived! But Peter Verhoff confuses Ninke, which depressed her and because of which she fought: the thought that only her marriage with Troelstroy was prolonged by her life, being none other than the mother of their children. <br /> /> Let's all hope for the Nynke II!
