I really like the show !! As part of Greek Life, I can say that some things are exaggerated, but overall itâ€™s still pretty darn funny. <br /> <br /> Grow a cute lead character, his roommate is HUGE, and the whole cast is entertaining in its rights. I like that it focuses on individual situations as well as interpersonal relationships with organizations. <br /> <br /> This show covers everything, and they do it without swearing or anything else so bad (how else could this be on ABC Family?). <br /> <br /> My favorites are Cappie (of course), roommate. Grow up around the room and almost all of Kappa Tau. This show is a great launching pad for them, and I'm glad to see what doors it opens. <br /> <br /> Please extend this show next summer, ABC Family. As I said, love, love, love it !!
