I have to say. This is easily one of my favorite movies to watch on Halloween. Halloween party, terrible game, guy dressed up like more from Miami Vice. BIG BIG BIG BIG !!! <br /> <br /> ********************* SPOILERS ************** ****** ******* <br /> <br /> I have a huge place in my heart for random clicks of the horror of the 80s, and this one reached out and pulled the strings of my heart. I always skip this movie in a blockbuster and always laugh at the cover of the box. Now, every weekend, I took a random movie that I had never seen before ... one weekend, Angelaâ€™s turn came. She seemed to be teasing me for months. So I took him home, laid him down and spent most of the film under the covers. <br /> <br /> For me it was terrible and rude. And not only acting skills! Some of the things they came up with for this film were amazing. I can honestly say that the best part for me was that Suzanna (played by another Iowen) put a tube of lipstick in her nipple. It was an accident, and I liked it. Watching the creepy Angela flying through the corridors and hearing her creepy demon voice was enough for me to wake up ALL NIGHT! <br /> <br /> This is not one of the smartest or most successful horror movies. But this is the cheese of the 80s, and it has all the necessary elements. Creepy Goat Kid, Virgin, Whore, Naked Girls, Scary House, Bad behavior, oh, and did I mention the Naked Girls? All the elements were there and were assembled in such a way that they made for one of my favorite films. Glory to filmmakers.
