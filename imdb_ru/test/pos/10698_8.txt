I have always been fascinated by ninzistsu, who would know that it will go further than further. In "Ninja III" it is fun, creepy and intriguing. The police shoot the ninja and use his spirit for revenge. Victim, a beautiful young woman named Christie (Lucinda Dickey). She falls in love with a policeman who participated in the shooting. The love scene, where she pours the V8 on her body, knocked me out of a rut! The death of a ninja attracts the attention of another in Japan by the name of Yamada (Sho Kosugi), who comes to America not only to save Christie, but also to return the ninja to the grave. Just because he put out Yamadaâ€™s left eye with a shuriken (a throwing star). The fighting scenes were excellent. I liked the role when plywood falls on Yamada, and he chops her with her foot. And when he is caught, he says that Officer Christie was connected with this, that everything will be fine. The rule of thumb: never rate a ninja. He killed the other cops without killing them. And he did his job without worry. Of course, Kirsti tried her best to put the ninja in place to use her as a tool for revenge. It was a good film, great for martial arts fans. 3 out of 5 stars!
