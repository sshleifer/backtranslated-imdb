Last week I saw the Venetian merchant in London. Great game of Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins. Compared to other films based on a Shakespeare play, this production made the game so easy to understand and follow. Bravo to Michael Redford for leading such best actors. The costumes and scenery are great, and since they were shot in Venice, they give the film a genuine flavor. I read the play more than thirty years ago at school, and the focus was on the anti-Semitic behavior of the characters towards Jews and the cruelty of Christians. I do not know whether this film will be controversial, but in any case I am sure that it will receive several Oscar nominations.
