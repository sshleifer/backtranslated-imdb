It would be so easy to dismiss an alien abduction film without even seeing it like me, but it’s worth seeing. If you think about it, this is not an easy topic to cope with, but this film manages to suspend disbelief, which in itself is a feat for such an exit from the subject. The appointment of the protagonist as a doctor was a sensible step that instilled confidence in his willingness to believe in the possibility of alien abduction. He plays very sensitively, drawing us into his pain and confusion in the strange events that reach him and his wife. Special effects are used sparingly, but for a shocking effect, and sometimes the film completely captures, but, unfortunately, there are a couple of moments when the plot wanders and leaves some confusion. In addition, after reaching a tense climax, the ending becomes a bit of a disappointment. Auxiliary characters were too weak (alien hunter) or threatening (psychiatrist), which could also distract attention. <br /> <br /> But overall, this raised some interesting questions, among which was an eloquent phrase: animals feel when we experiment with them. ”<br /> <br /> The concept of“ lost time ”also caused thoughts.
