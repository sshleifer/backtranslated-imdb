Luis Bunuel has always been a director whose work was unclear to me. My first experience with him was “The Modest Charm of the Bourgeoisie,” which was often considered his greatest work, and I was so upset and bored that I eventually turned off the recording. Similarly, Belle de Jour, which is almost certainly his most famous film and which is usually considered one of his many masterpieces, did not interest me at all. I did not hate it, nor was it discreet, but I did not like it. Thirdly, I saw L'Age d'Or. I finally got somewhere. Fourth, Los Olvidados is also good. However, neither L'Age d'Or, nor Los Olvidados struck me. Great movies, but not masterpieces. <br /> <br /> Nazarin is my fifth Bunuel, and I like it a little bit more than the other two. This is a priest from Spain, now in Mexico, who refuses to live in the luxury in which most priests live. He wants to be more like Jesus and lead a meek life. He is also ready to forgive everyone for anything and suffer without protest. I’m pretty sure that Bunuel doesn’t sympathize with the character and considers him rather smug. However, I only assume that because of my knowledge of the director, whose most famous quotation is: “Thank God, I am still an atheist”, which he obviously said in an interview about this very film from John Baxter The book about Bunuel, if you are interested). The interviewer who had pulled these words from Bunuel’s mouth must have been perplexed about Nazarin himself. Those who are more inclined to believe in religious beliefs, but also do not know anything about Buñuel, may consider the priest to be a heroic figure. This is especially true if this viewer has his / her own criticism of organized religion. The priest may be a little complacent, but he seems to be mostly a good person. When he harbors a violent prostitute in his room to protect her (and, presumably, save her soul), people begin to learn and assume that their relationship is sexual. His boss assumes the same thing and punishes him for it. He later undergoes even worse punishments from the clergy.
