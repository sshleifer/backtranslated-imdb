Western can be divided into many subgenres. One of the widest divisions between the urban and western plains. Most westerns are a mixture of both, but at one end of the spectrum you have photos like High Noon and Rio Bravo, which occur almost entirely in a settlement, rarely going out. At the other end you have such as the Wagon Master, where amongst the wild nature you can barely see the manor. <br /> <br /> Directed by John Ford usually succeeded in “a piece of both” westerns, removing interiors with an emphasis on the fact that they are small and limited, and then contrasted with wide-open exteriors that seemed both exciting and dangerous. Wagon Master has a typical Frank Nugent scenario, with some interaction between experienced old people and green teens, but he still presents Ford with some new problems. In this picture, the dangers do not come from the sharpness of the landscape, they emanate from a group in the form of Cleggs. Moreover, the lack of real interior scenes means that the appearance may lose its influence over time. <br /> <br /> However, Ford was a real maestro when it came to manipulating space. He shoots scenes from the camp or carriages so that the frame is surrounded, and we get the same feeling of isolation as in the real interior. Moreover, compared to his other Westerns, he doesn’t really open up too much space, as the wagon’s trail passes through the canyons and passes, and does not cross the harsh and empty plains. One of the few moments when he widely reveals the landscape is when the Indians have been noticed and there is a threat from the side. <br /> <br /> There are some surprisingly effective comic relief moments in Wagon Master, and some great contributions from the unusual cast. Harry Carey Jr. turned into a good actor such as his father, and this is one of his best early roles. Joann Drew was disappointing in the film She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, but she looks more at ease as a character with a bit of sass, and in fact she is pretty good. Jane Darwell, who won an Oscar in the film “Grape Wrath” of John Ford ten years earlier, appears here with a single function - to perform a gag in which she publishes a faint old whistle. However, with her beautiful time and movement, she makes the work work. Francis Ford, in one of the many dumb drunk roles he played in his younger brother’s photographs, looks better than anyone. <br /> <br /> And now we come to the role of Ben Johnson. Although he was by no means a bad actor, he never intended to become such a big star like John Wayne. And yet, with his light riding art and easy attraction, he was one of the most truly “western” players around. And that brings me to my last point. It was obviously one of Ford's personal favorites, despite the fact that it looked rather modest. Wagon Master doesn’t have a grand theme or dramatic intensity, it’s just a genre playing for itself. I think this is what Ford loved about it. This is a picture for Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr., not for John Waynes or Henry Fondads. Small in volume, but decent in its class.
