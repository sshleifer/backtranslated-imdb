The description of Stalingrad as a war movie may be a little inaccurate. Of course, this is the center of the longest and most bloody battle in world history, the most extensive theater of the most expensive war in terms of life, money and material resources that have ever occurred. Yes, it contains battle scenes depicting fierce battles and terrible destruction. Nevertheless, the intuitive story-telling and sharp images make it something more than a war film, even more than an anti-war film. Stalingrad instead of a film about absolute and undeniable hell. <br /> <br /> The film is fraught with visual descriptions of the worst war, one that is deeply personal and close, where the days spent in taking one city block only to be taken again in an unexpected attack. An early form of modern urban warfare, which the Germans called Rat Warfare, is depicted in cruel and uncompromising terms. The characters fight in sewer tunnels, at railway stations and from building to building in the hellish bomb shelter of destroyed Stalingrad, but will be defeated by the inexorable Russian winter. <br /> <br /> The film is devoted to the problem of Nazism and the reproach of the Germans in that period, as many other films from Germany and the whole world do. His heroes are a group of soldiers caught in the winds of war and simply trying to figure out with themselves and as many of their comrades as possible alive. Characters do not fight against the Soviets because of ideological hatred between national socialism and Soviet communism, nor because of any great dream of Grossdeutschland or racial superiority. They fight only because if they do not, the enemy will kill them, and if the enemy does not, their own officers will certainly refuse to fight. This image adds another layer to the suffocating shell of captured hopelessness that permeates the film. <br /> <br /> A sort of ground companion for Das Boot, Stalingrad creates an epic struggle of the Second World War in the personal light and from the unexpected prospect of an ordinary German soldier as a kind of hero, which has become tragic in circumstances and cruel government that would pervert his victim .
