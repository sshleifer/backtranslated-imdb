Are you looking for a comic drama with suspense and cast? Well, find this little sleeper. John Lithgow and Billy Bob Torton are great in this little story. Don't forget Jamie Lee Curtis' cameo. The touch of the 60s, the touch of “The Prince and the Pauper” and a feature of this homebrew gold make a little story.
