I really liked the movie wooden camera. I think that the Brazilian film “City of God” had a little influence on him, but perhaps this parallelism between the two directions (crime and art) in the social neighborhood is reality. <br /> <br /> I think the films made by Madiba are really beautiful. I do not think it is unrealistic that he makes such good films, because there are many artists who have no education and can be truly brilliant. <br /> <br /> I really liked the soundtrack. It is adapted to photos. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie ... it's good to show how life can be in a social neighborhood.
