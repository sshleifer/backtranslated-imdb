This is one of the best films I have seen in the era of silence (unfortunately, I have not seen too many, except for the material Chaplin / Keaton). Very visually brilliant, with insanely influential style in editing and composition. Truly unique (especially for its time) camera angles and extremely restless editing. Of course, you need to see what kind of nerd in the film. <br /> <br /> The disadvantage is that you talk too much about his politics (I have no problem with the politics in the film if it is thin or at least somewhat ignored as a back seat to the story). In addition, this is not an "entertaining" film, it is good, but it is not that I am going to watch a billion times. This art, simple and clear, whether you like it or not. <br /> <br /> A + costs only for influence, but, based on personal pleasure, I give him A-.
