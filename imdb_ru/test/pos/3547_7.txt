Robert Altman, Nicholas Rogue, John-Luke Goddard - did you expect a funny movie that the whole family could enjoy? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they did not follow the mainstream, but created it. For those who complain that they did not adhere to the original history of the opera - how often is the music in the film directly related to what happens in the film? This mood matters. I believe that the directors of these films did this: they created a modern mood for old operas. For the most part they succeed wonderfully. With all these operas, who likes them all. We could use more Beverly Sills. <br /> <br /> Finally, what is art (even opera) without a few naked women?
