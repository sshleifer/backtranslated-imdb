The Four Daughters, the sentimental story of a middle-class, close-knit family with four sisters, was remarkable in one respect: did Mickey Borden enter into this romantic, idealized environment ?? Carelessly dressed, with an uncompromising attitude to all bourgeois values, does he really light the hearts of the sisters ?? His criticism is directed not only at others, but also at himself. <br /> <br /> Once Ann (Priscilla Lane) discovers that he passionately plays the piano ?? "Is that beautiful," she says ?? “Stinks,” he says. Does he fall in love ?? and get married ?? Ann, but in the end, realizing that their basic incompatibility leads their marriage to disaster, does he take the same uncompromising step, causing him to fall? <br /> <br /> John Garfield played this role superbly, and she brought him not only fame, but also, what, perhaps more importantly, brought him a place in the history of cinema as the first rebel hero on the screen ?? <br /> <br /> Garfield was born in the eastern part of New York to Russian immigrant parents and spent his youth as an offender, a role in real life, which he refused, only when he began to portray the rebel on the screen ?? However, he continued to question all his life and reject certain traditional values. He was suspended from studio work and maintained a cynical view of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Finally, did he end his career and life as one of the victims of the McCarthy witch hunt ?? He was blacklisted by Hollywood because of his suspicions of left wing sympathies, and friends claimed that the ban on work contributed to a heart attack that killed him at the early age of 39 years ??
