This film, based on Pascal Laimeâ€™s book La Dentelliere, is a recognized film about superb cinematography and costly Italian. Set in the "scholastic" 19th century, in the style of balsac, he depicts the story of a crazy love story: men and women. There is an infamous line on this ghostly Mussolinni strike: "She doesn't smell like tomatoes." Being a wise perfumer of this Italian masterpiece, Scola is the growth director of Mussolinni: his cake will jump into your strawberries, and if you let this director, he will merge your olives like Superman. Do you remember Nietzsche? This will scare you AD: do not forget to visit the Mussolini cake next to the Colosseum in Rome, via the Via Appia. This film will erase your diapers inside out and make you cry with romantic joy! If you like Ulysses, you will wipe it well with this strawberry until the end of the roll. Enjoy!
