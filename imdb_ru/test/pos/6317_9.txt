I saw Le Conseguenze Dell'Amore at the 2005 Rotterdam Film Festival. It was the first of ten films that I saw there. <br /> <br /> Le Conseguenze left the strongest impression of ten films. From the very first shot you know that the film will be special. Beautiful cinematography left me in awe of what can be done with the camera. The music is also on par with the visual elements, complementing the colorful and stylish architectural images. <br /> <br /> Tony Servillo plays a major role in the film, Titta. He is a tax expert who lives in a hotel. Every week he brings a suitcase with money to the bank, and a story tells about it. <br /> <br /> He is always very controlled and almost no one shows emotion; Looks calculated and well dressed. He has a habit of ignoring people who have no meaning for him. For example, Sofia (very well played by Olivia Magnani), who works as a barmaid in the hotel where he lives. Although she has been at the hotel for two years, he never greets her, even if she greets him. One day she confronts him with this, and the next day he sits at a bar, instead of his usual window seat. From here the story really begins and will unfold in a strong story about love, sacrifice and the mafia. <br /> <br /> I won't ruin the rest of the movie. Watch this movie if you like stylish movies like David Lynch, The Godfather, etc. Do not watch this if you are an action fan.
