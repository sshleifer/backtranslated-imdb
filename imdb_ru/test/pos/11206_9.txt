When you watch Far, you know that you are not watching a French film, there is little sex there, and it’s mostly elliptical, and people don’t talk so much here, there are a few lines scattered here and there, and a couple of important conversations, just so that you understand what is happening. He also does not look American, there are no chases, shootings or violence, unless you consider killing a mouse as a bloody act or daily stress associated with a conquered disaster. Sometimes relatively long shots in the middle distance may remind you of the "contemplative" Asian cinema, but simply remind you that the director does not bring things to the radical minimalism of some Taiwanese filmmakers, but again, this is not a Taiwan film, this is a Turkish film. I don't know what that means, I don't even know if it should mean anything. <br /> <br /> There is no plot in the film, and yet these few lines, these somewhat long shots and this often alleviated tension gradually create a sense of something happening, a feeling of “conspiracy”, due to the lack of a better word, which grows on you. By the end of the film, you may get the impression that you will miss those two cousins ​​who have a lot in common, but there are different worlds.
