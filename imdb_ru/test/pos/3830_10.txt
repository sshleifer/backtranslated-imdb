I did not realize how much of this episode was taken from Enemy Below until I saw the movie (since then it has become my favorite movie about the war). There were also a few items that were raised from the Run Silent Run Deep. There is nothing wrong with stealing ideas if you do something great with them. And the guy had Roddenberry and company do something cool with that. <br /> <br /> The story begins when the Romulans violate the 100-year-old contract and cross the neutral zone and destroy a number of outposts of the Federation along this zone. ostensibly to test their superior weapons and stealth screen (and, in their opinion, the subsequent change in the balance of power between the Romulans and the Federation) as a prelude to the total invasion. Kirk must decide whether to risk a war in order to try to stop the Romulan ship, or in fact the greater risk is to release the invaders after they have destroyed 4 military outposts. Kirk wisely chooses the latter. <br /> <br /> This is our first look at the enemy of the Federation, the Romulans, the militant, but in their own way noble people, distant relatives of the Vulcans. However, unlike their peaceful cousins, the Romulans did not give up their emotions, violent and imperialistic actions, even though they were technologically advanced. <br /> <br /> None of this matters to Mr. Stiles, the navigator of the ship and the chief of this episode. an antagonist aboard the enterprise (the Romulan commander has his own problems with a fanatical junior officer). All that matters to him is that he hates the Romulans, and Spock looks like one ... until the end, when Spock saves his life (naturally). This contrasts sharply with Captain Kirk and the commander of the Romulans, none of whom have a personal evil will for another. Both men simply perform their duties. In fact, there is mutual respect. This is the first episode of “Trek”, in which prejudices are directly considered, and he does it deftly (unlike the not so subtle “Let it be your last battlefield” of the 3rd season). <br /> <br /> Like “Enemy Below” We have a classic chess match between two ship commanders who are actually very similar. You immediately see that both of these captains are good .. VERY good. If you went to battle, you would like any of these people to be your leader. Both are honest and decent people who are bound by responsibilities. Nevertheless, even though the Romulan commander owes his homeworld, he still dreams of destruction before he can return home and not start a new interstellar war. However, he still does his best to make him at home, just as Kirk does his best to stop him. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, one of the top 5 tracks. It has everything: a lot of action, tension, excellent dialogue, a great game (I still think that the Romulan commander was the best role of Mark Lenard in Track), and he manages to make his social comments without excessive preaching. It is a pity that Roddenberry forgot about the last part when he did TNG. <br /> <br /> Watch this episode, then watch “The Enemy Below”.
