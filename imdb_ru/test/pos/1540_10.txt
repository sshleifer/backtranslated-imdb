Closet Land was sponsored by Amnesty International and has a lot of political overtones, but there is much more to this richly moving story than this ... <br /> <br /> This is not only political tension The end of the 80s is a personal persecution who is going through a woman as a child who was molested by a family friend. We see a subtle hint at the parallels of the dishonest structure of government / society and the culture of sexual predation, when every fourth young child is abused and every third woman is subjected to some form of rape. <br /> <br /> For me, this raises an acute question about the chicken and the egg: the attitude of our sexual repressions leading to predation creates a political environment of fear and censorship, or does sociopolitical dysfunction nourish the culture of sexual predation? The psychological consequences of even asking this question force us to come to a place where we have to work out our own answers. <br /> <br /> In the end, our young lady writer (Stowe) has a moment similar to the one at the end of Hensen's labyrinth - one fine, brilliant moment she realizes that the idea of ​​stealing her power secret police (Rickman) - an illusion. No one can steal your power - they can only deceive you into giving up her power, and then you have the right to take it back at any time. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that needs to be entered lightly, and you will surely enter it. Minimalistic aspects in combination with children's animation awaken the deepest parts of the psyche and do not leave the viewer unchanged.
