Drama Fellow about the marriage of a couple who is threatened by a young third party who is interested in his wife at home (Watson). Wilkinson plays the role very well, like a restless husband who cannot control the fraud of his wife, and solves the problem. I also really like Rupert Everett in his role as William Beale, a man with whom Watson has an affair. Although I think Emily Watson is a great actress, I had a slight problem with the way her character was written, I didnâ€™t make her too cute (I know that a fraudster should not be cute, but some of her actions and things there was no reason) The script may have been a weak part of this drama, although director Fellows was good, and the performances were also quite good. This film is better than Wrong, but by no means a masterpiece. --- IMDB Rating: 6.7, my rating: 8/10
