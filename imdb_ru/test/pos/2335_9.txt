This is one of those films where critics really didn't hit the mark. This film is practically McHale's navy for the 90s or a police academy at sea. Grammer argues that he can play roles other than Frazier, since he outwitted and outwitted the navy to get his own submarine. Rob Schneider, as usual, is a worm, the same in every role he plays, and Lauren Holly is local sex -pot, albeit with brains. Ken Hudson Campbell, as usual, is fun, almost every line has a catchy phrase. The film has a wonderful intelligent plot and unpredictable script, which still surprises me every time I watch it. Although many of the phrases and terms of the Navy I do not like, but this is a small obstacle to the accuracy and realism of the film and its characters.
