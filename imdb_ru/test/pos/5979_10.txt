Shepitko is the wife of Russian director Elem Klimov, who shot the more commercially known 1984 film Come and See, which is generally considered one of the most realistic war films ever, without exception, known for its burning poetic intensity, but I I think that he lacks the internal complexity of this even greater Russian film, which not only deals with graphic external horrors, but it finds truly inspiring images that focus on individuals or not Olsha groups of characters that represent the absolute madness going on inside these people, which the end is impressive. The bullets fly, and the bodies die in a shootout because of the opening credits, where the intensity of the film never goes away for the entire duration, focusing on the grim faces, worn soldiers who have almost nothing to eat, the frightened population under occupation, starving children with fossilized mothers, everything in the vast landscape of endless white snow. Just as cranes fly (1957), this shows the retreat of the Russian army, traumatic shock at the beginning of the war, when they were almost destroyed. The Russian village was captured by German Nazis, who terrorize citizens, steal what they have, forcing them to become their informative eyes and ears. What the Russian soldiers are leaving is hiding under the cover of the forests, but they are forced to send food expeditions to neighboring farms. This film tells about two soldiers who from the very beginning carry out an almost impossible mission, because somewhere in the middle of winter there is little food left. One is healthy and healthy - Vladimir Gostyukhin as Rybak, and the other, Boris Plotnikov as Sotnikov, slows down with a cough with tuberculosis and, ultimately, a bullet in his leg that almost leaves him to die, but his partner rescues him heroically. When they walk knee-deep in deep snow drifts, crawling in some places with insufficient protection from the harsh elements, like many other Russian films, nature itself becomes their toughest enemy. <br /> <br /> Spoilers !! It comes down to survival. When they reached their destination, the farm was demolished and left in the rubble, moving into the occupied territory of Germany, where the next farm is an elderly Soviet employee who is afraid of Nazi retribution. Guerrilla soldiers consider him a coward, but they leave, where they are eventually captured and taken to the Nazi camp in the neighboring city and held captive along with a proud and protective mother (Lyudmila Polyakova), who helped them hide them. Tarkovsky brave Anatoly Solonitsyn acts as Portnov, an investigator, a teacher of the Russian language from a neighboring academy, who became a supporter of Nazism. Russian torture and execute congeners - this is the depth of war debauchery, and Solonitsyn is magnificent in a disgusting role, for which he is ideally suited. From what we can see, when Nazi officers are having fun chatting in close proximity to each other, he is a stranger even among this group; instead, he is seen as a kind of terrible undertaker in a black cloak who usually sends men to their graves. The audience did not bypass witnesses to acts of torture against Sotnikov, who offers only contempt, while Rybak speaks fluently, hoping to save his life, but both are doomed to die, although Rybak is offered a chance to serve the German Reich as a police agent. A mother, an elderly employee and a child are added to this group, having spent one last night together, where together they discuss the merits of the soldiers' mission, whether it is a patriot, a mother, a coward, or an employee. It seems that each is individually guided by a desperate need to survive, but Sotnikov offers himself as a selfless example, trying to admit his guilt in order to save others, where the successfully chosen title reflects his spiritual atonement. <br /> <br /> Author: The next morning, Portnov looks a little surprised, mocking their sudden willingness to speak, but does not spare anyone but Fisher, who goes to the other side to save his life, thinking that if he alive, at least he has a chance to escape. But there is no way out of this torment. What is happening is demonstrated with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace, as we witness the betrayal of war without firing a shot, as execution by hanging turns into a public spectacle, where the villagers of the village are forced to witness, the pace and agonizing intensity of this film are ruthless, so as never is the moment when the threat, superbly filmed by Vladimir Chukhnov (who died in the same car accident as Shepitko) hung, with beautifully composed landscapes and many Om camera movements, much of it at close range, using portraits, especially a portrait of a young ferocious boy who looks at convicts, who makes a surrealistic connection with the next generation without any words emphasized by the psychologically terrifying music of Alfred Schnittke, which resembles a transcendental, but violently disturbing monolithic Kubrick music of 2001: SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). The sound design of this film is very advanced and uniquely modern, where the use of off-screen sound constantly exposes the raw nerves of every moment, dogs barking, the wind, shooting bullets, the chatter of neighboring Nazis in untranslated German or sadistic laughter over their helplessness, which only increases the disgusting tension to insane heights Largely reminiscent of Joe Ark's “Passion” (1928), Dreyer reveals complete insanity, a relentless realization that you have no choice, but you still have to make it. The nightmarish inner thoughts at the end are expressed silently, where the nobility of the dead speaks volumes, where the voices continue to sound in the minds of the living, like an explosion of an endless echo, but only silence fills the fresh winter air with sorrowful reverence. and a deep sense of loss.
