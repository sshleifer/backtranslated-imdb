This is one of those films that are greatly underestimated. I vote again for an underrated film. This movie has a good storyline, perhaps a little contrived, but it can happen. Sean Astin (one of my favorite actors) again shows us a good performance. The guy copes with the acting, but never gets recognition for his roles. He has excelled since the days of the guna. Not only he, but Louis Gosset JR. doing an excellent job. I thought that maybe this film would have made more money in movie theaters, but who still need money. Everything around is a good movie that will sometimes keep you on the edge of space, and the plot will continue to move on its own. I liked this movie, and hopefully the rest of you too.
