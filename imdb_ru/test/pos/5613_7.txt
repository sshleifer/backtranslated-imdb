I really liked this movie ... and I still watch it from time to time. I used it in my music lessons at the school where I teach. The children seem to like it, although they want it to be colored. <br /> <br /> The best thing in this film, for me, who grew up after Heiftz’s death, is a chance to see a master violinist working with his craft! I was surprised at how “modern” the storyline. Although the references to the "reform school" are outdated. The boy, whose father died, and who is raised by his mother and stepfather ... Most of our children today are raised by adoptive parents, although from the film it seems that most adoptive parents are cruel. I am VERY angry when his mother does not take his side and does not protect his actions against his stepfather. <br /> <br /> In addition, musical choices are hard to believe. I find it incredible that a child who is about eight years old can play the “Minute Waltz”, or that a 13-year-old girl can sing an aria from Rigoletto. <br /> <br /> Other than that, it's really fun, I feel a good movie, and I recommend it. I would like it to go on DVD.
