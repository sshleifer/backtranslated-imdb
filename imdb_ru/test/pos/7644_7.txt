I watched this movie on HBO and had a good time. <br /> <br /> The director did a great job. I found myself completely absorbed in this film as soon as it began. Speech by Norman Reedus is awesome. I expect even more frightening films from him. <br /> <br /> I was so absorbed that sometimes I wanted to grab a gun from Norman and shoot this snake girl. Hehe. I like movies when innocent looking girls play cunningly with men. The ending was what I wanted :)) <br /> <br /> This film is full of surprises. You expect it, but something else happens. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, these massive images of cut scenes were really painful to the eyes. <br /> <br /> Although it was not shown when Norman Reedus changed banknotes? Or was it me standing by the fridge. :)
