This is a great movie. The film had several parts that I liked. This movie is very funny! Visit the Ernest Fun Club website at www.ernestfunclub.com. There are several films such as: Ernest goes to camp, Ernest saves Christmas, Ernest goes to prison, Ernest is in the army, Ernest goes to school, Ernest rides again Ernest Dank and others. I strongly recommend them for family films. All stars Jim Varney are trying to visit again www.ernestfunclub.com Which Ernest movie is the best? In my opinion, in fact there are 2 Ernest Goes to the camp and Ernest goes to prison. So, if you have never seen Ernest P. Worrell, it's time to go and see him. You will find it quite satisfactory "no, what do I mean"?
