His music, especially what we hear here, is very slow. Since Bach’s death, composers have developed ways to promote music slower and slower: a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote plays that are as slow as possible for music. -Of course, you can cheat by writing March 4/4, and then specifying the tempo, say, the semi-quiver = 1, but this tempo will not be the correct tempo. Wagner and Mahler wrote music that CANNOT play at a snail tempo. Given that slowness does not sound too slow in any sense, the “snail tempo” is the wrong expression. The critic wrote the famous conductor Wagner: "He does not beat the time, he beats eternity." As far as I know, it was a compliment. <br /> <br /> I have a feeling that in the early 1970s, directors worked on how to make the slowest films: Death in Venice and Solaris. ". I prefer the first. On the one hand, "Solaris" crosses the line or some line and becomes hypnotic; "Death in Venice" captures from beginning to end. Nothing special happens, but everything happens in the correct sequence, at the right pace, with a photo that you can lose in <br /> <br /> By the way, another way of cheating with music is to write something that is not really there is no pace. Such music sounds slow, but in fact it just does not play, just like many films feel slow because they lack rhythm and form. “Death in Venice” is not one of them. Beautiful in all respects, he will remind you of the timelessness and unconditioned quality. You do not need any theoretical knowledge to respond to the skill of Visconti, as you do, to answer the incompetence of a smaller director. This is a great job.
