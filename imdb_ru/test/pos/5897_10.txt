I am very pleased to see that this excellent film receives such high marks from IMDB users. The best years of their lives remain the best cinematic statement about the veterans returning from the war that I encountered. Easily the best result for the often overlooked Frederick March. In fact, the entire cast shines, including the legend of music Hoagy Carmichael, which treats us all with a subtle version of its classic Lazy River. I would recommend this great movie to anyone who loves movies.
