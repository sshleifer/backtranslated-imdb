Let me just say - I love the horror genre to the extent that I see everyone I can get independently (except for the really low quality horror b-movies, without which I could do), and recently became a big fan Oriental horrors. Little did I know that the Korean horror would be those who would lead my list, defeating such heavyweights as the Japanese ring (or the American ring), or even quality American films such as The Sixth Sense and Others, and the well-known Hong Kong . Kong Horror "The Eye". <br /> <br /> In the past, “The Ring” was my favorite horror, but it seems to me that I prefer the beauty of “The Tale of Two Sisters” on any given day - the story is extraordinary and quite open to interpretation, which allows you to repeat the views, although there is a chance that you will want to watch it again and again just because the film is so masterfully shot ... the story is probably one of the best in the genre to date. Acting at the highest level is also from the whole cast, and the fright when they come can shock you, like something in the Ring - I was glued to the screen at those points that could not take my eyes off. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I am glad that it did not occur to me that Sadako / Samara did this because of the Ring - after all, such feelings are unpleasant, and the “Tale of Two Sisters” leaves you with an unpleasant feeling but one that we hope will not leave you awake, but will leave you satisfied that you have seen something quite special. But remember ... if you do not understand the plot after the first viewing, re-viewing is more than recommended ... I personally did not have time for this, as it was late, so I flipped through the scenes on DVD, some Many times, while I there was no good synopsis in my head and after browsing the network, it seemed I pretty much nailed it to a widely agreed interpretation. And the satisfaction of solving such a puzzle is simply wonderful. <br /> <br /> In general, a masterfully created horror that is unlikely to produce the same “level” remake (bought by Dreamworks) simply because of Korean content, and everyone is advised to shoot it in cinemas or on DVD while they can ... this is one of the best you get. Unfortunately, because of what kind of film it is, there is no way to even tell about this story without spoilers, so the best thing to do is what I did - watch it, not knowing a single thing, except for the “story about two sisters”! And be prepared for something that is unlikely to fit for some time.
