The Return of Batman In my opinion, the first "Batman" from the series "Batman" was only half of the movie in which "Batman returns." In the first “Batman” by Tim Burton, we only had “Batman” and “The Joker”, which Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson played wonderfully. <br /> <br /> In Batman’s Returns we have, I think, the most perfect film about Batman (yes, even better than the Dark Knight). Keaton returns to the role of Batman and is flawless in the role, never going far beyond the character of Batman, which is great in this film when it comes to the two villains he encounters. First you have Danny DeVito, who is delightfully insane like a Penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, who, I dare say, is one of the most interesting and challenging villains in Batman movies. I treat Pfeiffer so much because of how she becomes a female cat, she starts with the rather miserable mouse of Selena Kyle, and then really sinks into the dark side of her mind, and as a result you get a brilliant performance by a woman who from trying to become a hero villain, and then, I suppose, again a hero. Also in this amazing cast you have an evil businessman Max Shrek, played by the amazing and legendary Christopher Walken. Although in the role of the second plan in this role there is something that I love, and perhaps it is the appearance of Shrek in the film that makes his performance even better than it is. <br /> <br /> I have to say that in this story the return of Batman this time is much more than the first Batman. One of the reasons why I loved this story so much is the fact that Burton dared to go in a much more dark and twisted direction than because of Nicholson's main antics. You have a story about Penguin and how he is trying to deceive the people of Gotham to make him a new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Catwoman and her struggle to decide who she really is and what to do with her new persona. When it comes to Batman, I feel that in this he is more the leader of the ring, who holds these two stories together, but, of course, kicked his ass at the same time. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was a dark and atmospheric film, like the story that takes place inside it. Gotham City has never looked as good as on Blu-Ray and HD, so if you have a chance to see it that way, then be sure to do it, because it really adds to the overall experience of Batman Returns. <br /> <br / In general, I really feel that of all the movies about Batman "The Return of Batman" believe it or not for me "The Dark Knight", because while I enjoyed this movie for an amazing performance by Hit Ledger like Joker, I felt that something was missing in the film. Batman Returns lacks nothing, so if you want to watch an amazing movie with what I consider to be the perfect cast, then it's Batman to light the Bat signal.
