I have never been so surprised by a movie that was so old. Only the Treasures of Sierra Madre do a good job of this. As a person who saw heroin addiction firsthand, I was shocked at how realistic this film was. The performance of Frank Sinatra is absolutely uncompromising, realistic and heartbreaking. Otto Preminger's direction is perfect for a film with long shots and a very mobile camera. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak has good performance, like Eleanor Parker. In fact, the entire auxiliary cast works very well, with understated views, as befits the style of this film. The documentary style is part of what keeps this film up to date. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8.0 out of 10
