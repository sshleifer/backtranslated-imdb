This film will never be on the list of the 50 best films of all time, but if you make a list of “funny films,” this is a good place to start. Liv Tyler is delicious, charming and juicy, and everyone else is crazy about their roles. This is the equivalent of the 21st century "Tom Jones" - in other words; just fine, obscene fun. I think it could be Tyler’s breakthrough film on its way to top glory. Without nudity, she oozes sex in this film. No wonder all the boys give her toys. How could they help, but they did it for helpless, innocent, such as Liv's Jewel?
