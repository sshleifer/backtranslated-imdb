Swift's letter really has more in common with Kafka and Orwell than with the authors of fantastic adventures, so it is curious that Gulliver's Travels was considered a children's novel. Happy kids! <br /> <br /> The same applies to this film. There were some really horrible versions of this story, so people are reluctant to look at this version. I mean, this is a television movie, and it comes from mappetter Jim Henson, so how can we expect anything other than attractiveness? <br /> <br /> Look again - beauty manifests itself in the strangest places. Children like this film enough to spend all three hours, but it also takes time to properly understand the dark vision of Swift. I hate special effects, but here they are used to carry the story forward, and not just blind us. Note that the producers have taken the trouble to recruit classical actors such as John Gilgud and Peter O'Toole, who perform their eccentric roles with perfection. <br /> <br /> Dramatic, romance between Gulliver and Glumdalklich becomes touching and sharp, as well as funny (she is a little girl, but twenty times its size). The frame-story has a theme about absent fathers, to which many children will relate. And the Gulliver part of the asylum introduces an element of horror concerning the abuse of power (apparently originating from Bedlam by Val Lewton [1946], another forgotten masterpiece). <br /> <br /> VHS always turns in the store for a few cents, which is an insult to many of the great artists who put it together. I encourage viewers to learn something good by getting this film and inspiring others to watch it. Despite the fact that children have something to offer, adults will find that they stand up to such classics as Aguirre, Brazil, 1984, and other serious fantastic works.
