I was 10 or 11 years old when this film was released, and since then it has been with me for 35 years. When the film came out, all the theaters in the St. Louis area as "bait" were handing out a packet of flower seeds with the name of the film, etc. On the front panel. There are so many words written on the back of the pack ... plant these seeds at midnight. If a white flower grows, you are saved ..... but if a red flower grows, you are doomed !!! Suffice it to say that for an eleven year old child I did not plant seeds, for fear of what might appear. Here's a spoiler: When the movie starts, you see a small toy tank moving in the mud. On a small road, the family leaves the city, and suddenly the camera turns back to the tank, and it becomes full-scale. It rolls on the car, and you see bloody limbs protruding from the wreckage, and then, suddenly, the tank becomes small again. <br /> <br /> The reason why this movie was stuck with me for so long was that I was an exact toy tank, like in the movie !!!! Unfortunately, I do not know what happened to this, but since then I have been closely following this !!! <br /> <br /> Turn off the lights, insert a DVD, make a sandwich and watch this movie. It is very good!!!
