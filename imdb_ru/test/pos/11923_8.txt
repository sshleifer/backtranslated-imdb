It really doesn’t deserve the “best picture” consideration, but as the entertainment goes, it does the job! This is the film that I watched, each time the pulse was quickened at least a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done, and we can recognize them from other work. Those who do not have current name recognition probably don’t want it. <br /> <br /> It was a funny ADVENTURE. Kind of like Little Scammers if they just had to be serious.
