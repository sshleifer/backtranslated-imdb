The marriage of a high-class New York couple with a child falls apart when the wife wants to leave the house (“It took her a lot of courage to get out of this door!”, The neighbor tells us); the busy, distracted husband takes over the “mother” duties and becomes closer to his son, but soon the wife returns. The very manipulative picture does not give us a very realistic family unit (with a young Justin Henry, of course, not like the product of the marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!) amazing classical music, cunning editing and true humor. The Strip character is designed to be a cool, self-centered witch, but I was ready to feel much more for her than Benton probably wanted. All of this should be drawn in terms of black and white, good and bad, so that Hoffman would find out how hard his wife was and get a second chance to become a good parent. The film never deviates from its biased path, and a very good game almost saves him, but I'm not sure where Benton directed the film in the final act, and the final scene is terribly sharp. *** from ****
