Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> This is a film by Peter Watkins. If someone saw his masterpieces of BBC "Callodon" and "War Game", he will recognize the style (and his voice) in a few seconds after the start. Made in 1971, it was installed in a very near future, when the Vietnam War was even more acute and now seems to be affecting China. Nixon is still the president, and civil disobedience and protest are resolved with the use of violence, using tribunals with slam heads (externally civilians, with “ordinary citizens” as judges). Since "the prison building cannot keep pace," an alternative is introduced: Park of Sentences. Offenders can choose between harsh jails and hunting people in a hostile environment, in this case an 85-kilometer journey through the California desert at 100 ° F. If they get to the American flag at the end without being caught by the National Guard or the riot police, they will be released otherwise they will have to serve their sentence (or, as we shall see, be dead). The film is made in a fully documentary style with the participation of three European teams, which cover the tribunal and the course of the already convicted two groups. Scenes jump between the tribunal's tent, hunting squads and those sentenced to hunt. Watkin’s insufficient commentary gives us raw reference information (time, temperature, etc.). The scenes of the tribunal show kangaroos, on the one hand, and a wide range of personalities, on the other, from real terrorists to "undesirable" and obviously innocent (for example, a pacifist who cannot even harm the flies). A lawyer (who is serious about his work) must take action on both sides. What makes these scenes particularly eerie is their similarity to the rhetoric of modern administration in detail. Meanwhile, some sad events in the desert clearly show that the “rules of the game” do not really apply. The question remains whether it is falsified from the very beginning or arbitrariness on the part of the troops because of the events that lead to the outcome (I suspect that this is both). At the end we are again in the first place, and the next group goes to the “Park of punishments” This description may indicate a biased (or even demagogic) propaganda film, but this can be misleading. Behavior (all participants were non-professionals as usual with Watkins) looks and sounds real (scenes of the tribunal may even contain textual material from real modern tests). I would say that it can be sold as a “real thing” without problems. With Watkins “Forgotten Faces,” the reaction was: “We cannot send it, or no one will ever believe in our real newsreel footage (because it is indistinguishable from real things).” With "Park of punishments" should be the same. As far as I know, this is effectively prohibited in the United States, and this must be seen in order not to lose its power or relevance (especially today).
