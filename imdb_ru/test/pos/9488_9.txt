The only Zeppelin video I have seen before this DVD is the 1976 film The Song Remains Unchanged. We used to watch around friends for hours watching this, but I never liked it, and I hated fantastic episodes ... .. <br /> <br /> So what about this DVD? I didn't know that it existed until I looked at the Physical Graffiti disc ..... "When did it happen?" I thought that <br /> <br /> For some reason, I thought that Page was not great a live guitar player, but to say that watching this DVD changed my mind is a huge understatement. <br /> <br /> 1970’s “White Summer” - 10 minutes of guitar magic. <br /> <br /> The 1975 Acoustic Set - the Bron-u-Aur Stomp brilliant improvisation section. <br /> <br /> The performances “In my time of death” and “Trampled underfoot” (also from the 75th year) are breathtaking - Paige and Bonham tear things to pieces like no other. Demonic mastery of cheese !! <br /> <br /> Magic continues in the 1979 section of Knebworth. The performance of “Last Stand of Achillies”, given their various narcotic conditions, simply cannot be trusted! A song with complex guitar overlays, Paige arranged it in such a way that he would just “punk” live - the effect is simply mesmerizing. "In the evening" - I never liked it on the disc, but it sounds here. 'Sick Again' is a great piece of vile stone. The shots from Knebworth are very interesting, they allow you to see the big screen, various stands and bootleg shots with great effect. <br /> <br /> Plant amazes in all performances. Paige, despite the fact that he is painfully thin, looks like a six-year-old child who likes the most in life at a concert in Knebworth, and he looks infectious. <br /> <br /> One thing that puzzled me is “Black Dog” “The performance of 1973 sounds very much“ in the camp ”!! Robert Plant has always loved a bit of “minced meat,” and these jeans are absolutely ridiculous - and they will arrest him these days. Everything is very different from the powerful studio version. <br /> <br /> I like this DVD. It reminded me how good Zeppelin was and still is.
