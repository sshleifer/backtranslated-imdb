ONE NIGHT AT McCOOL'S / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> Blake French: <br /> <br /> According to Harald Zvart, director of “One Night at McCool's”, “This film “- a grim comedy about the power of women over men and how a group of people can perceive different realities. This is the same story, told from three different points of view, and every time we tell this story, we try to reveal a little more about what really happened, that no one really knows. "<Br / > <br /> “One Night at McCool's” is the debut of the director of the Zwart feature film, a commercial and music video director who won numerous awards and started making short films when he was eight years old. I’m always nervous when the director of commercials and music videos transformed into filmmaking. We saw a lot of examples of how these guys think that they are doing another ad or a music video for TV with their productions. Zwart resists this tendency. Seidel's wall, even if he is often a little puzzled. <br /> <br /> Three men participate in “One Night At McCool's”, who talk about their beautiful young woman. In a sense, this film is a comedic version of American Beauty, but in others it is a separate world. <br /> <br /> “It all started one night at McCool,” each of the three explains to his listeners. There is Randy (Matt Dillon), a tender at a local bar, and his cousin, a lawyer named Karl (Paul Reiser), who remains until the place is closed. Detective Deling (John Goodman) arrives when the salon becomes the scene of a dead guy’s crime scene with a correspondingly named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her, as the person treats her with hostility. He stands behind her, and before you can say SEX, they have energetic sex, and she comes close to him. At first, Randy reluctantly says: "Sex and violence overnight is a bit." But who can turn away such a gem as Jewel? <br /> <br /> The jewel changes the lives of each of the three men. For Detective Deling, she has been pulling him out of the pit of grief since his wife died. For Karl, she makes him forget his loving family and cute little country house. For Randy, she ignites several fires, both positive and negative, later convincing him to contact a bingo-playing bounty killer named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to put an end to her deceptive ways. <br /> <br /> I wonder how the film takes three different chronicles - even the Jewel costume compared with the person telling the story. Deling sees in Jewels a wonderful, bewitching gift from God. Carl sees two sexy legs and a lot of splitting in Jewel. Randy does not know what to do with her, awakening his dull road leading nowhere. Juel herself is the most intriguing element of this film, however, Liv Tyler (Armageddon), who has always been delightfully played, is delightfully played. She is not very interested in men, but what can they offer her. Her motives are too simple, not truly devilish or evil; she is just a young woman who realized at an early age that, thanks to her beauty, she can get what she wants from life. <br /> <br /> The film is very interesting with its material. "One Night at McCool's" - from an enthusiastic and entertaining cast to his fiercely cheerful duel - uses most of his humorous ideas. What makes the film even funnier is how the views of the three men differ. The actors also have fun with their characters. Goodman is curious fanciful; The riser goes well with its perverted, winding part; Douglas is cunning and mysterious in one of the most amusing film performances; Dillon endows his character with an arrogant personality, although Randy does not fuss with anyone; Liv Tyler is great. She introduces Jewel with the perfect amount of charisma and tantalizing wit. She reminds us of the intimate work of Mena Suvari in the film American Beauty. <br /> <br /> “One night at McCools” is the first film released by Michael Douglas’s new production company, Furthur Films. This is a creative, authentic and sexual production. Along the way, we often become involved in a winding structure, but this is a natural response to a film that intentionally weaves several points of view into one story. The film ends with a black and comedic note. This is another one of those comedies in which serious events occur with humor; Ie black comedy. Many films of this genre seem either too black or too inadequate. One Night at McCool's is one of the few that really works. <br /> <br />
