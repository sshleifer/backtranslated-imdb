I was shocked to learn that Jimmy Kaan left this show, does anyone know why? I regard James as one of the greatest people of all time and was not surprised that he was on television, what could be better than the shit you see on the big screen. The stories are slippery and the camera is faster than the speeding bullet! Do not forget about the other actors: James, Vanessa (yum!) Nikki, Molly, Josh, Mitch. Also, can anyone tell me why there is a crappy tune on the ground on a DVD, but Elvis JXL remix A little less talk is used in the initial NBC programs ?? Doesn't it make sense to use the melody that you would associate with Americaâ€™s gambling mecca for DVD releases?
