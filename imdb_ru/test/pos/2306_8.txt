Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death govern the dialectic of Life. By the end of the 19th century, in a remote Japanese village, a young man and a married woman older than him fall in love with each other and decide to kill their husband in order to have the freedom to enjoy their love. But they never enjoy this freedom, since repentance begins to haunt them, beginning with the weakest member of the couple at that time, a woman, of course. From now on, in an atmosphere where a dream (nightmare) mixes with reality, the ghost of the murdered husband appears first to the woman, and then to the man. It also pursues the dreams of other villagers who create an atmosphere of suspicion and gossip around the couple, which is exacerbated by the arrival of a police officer who is investigating the disappearance of the murdered husband. But what makes this film more interesting, besides this almost ordinary story of adultery, is the evolution of the couple's feelings in Shakespeareâ€™s deep psychological and dramatic development of remorse, anguish and fear that make their love relationship a nightmare before their final death. Expressionism, so dear to the Japanese theater or cinema, is also present in the performances of the players, but not in an exaggerated form. Just to the extent necessary to more effectively show the deepest feelings of the depicted characters. This is really a solid good movie.
