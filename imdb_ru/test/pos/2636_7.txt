At the time of this writing (January 25, 2006) I was sad to hear about the death of Chris Penn in the last few hours. In addition to Footloose, The Wild Life is the movie that I remember Chris the most. <br /> <br /> I still remember in the film, with a little love, the nature of the fight of Chris and his teammates sitting in their favorite restaurant with a huge plate of french fries in front of them, sunk in a whole bottle of ketchup. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my comment concerns the title track performed by Bananarama. After these many years, I still remember the rumor (Canadian spelling - laughs) that Bananarama was called to a VERY LAST moment to compose a track for the film and that they wrote a song on an airplane tied to a recording studio to record a song and immediately after they recorded the song, they went to shoot a cheap video for their title track. I heard that this whole process (from beginning to end) took 4 hours! If this is true, then they are truly worthy of being the most successful female group of all time. <br /> <br /> In any case, this is just a rumor that I heard that day and still remember a generation later. Perhaps anyone who reads this can comment and clarify. Thank you.
