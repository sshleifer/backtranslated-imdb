This is one of the anime films from the Animatrix collection, one of nine is the only one made in black and white and the only one in which Trinity is shot. Rich texture and excellent visualization in all respects, and the animated version of Trinity, of course, makes it fair. If you are a fan of The Matrix, you will need to include this in your short list.
