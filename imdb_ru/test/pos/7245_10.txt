I waited for ages to comment on this program, and I felt it was time to pay tribute. This is one of the most dark, sinister and attractive works of Christie, not just someone who is killed for money, this is a dark and exciting story about mystery, intrigue, love and murder, corrected by the amendments of the adapter. The level of acting is great, Joan Hickson is great as always! The rest of the cast, including Liz Fraser, Anna Cropper and Helen Cherry, all perform well, but I think the show was stolen by Margaret Taizak, the final scene between her and Joan Hickson is just as magical, acting as possible, scary, touching and absolutely gorgeous. <br /> <br /> Please let me know if you agree with my words. I look forward to a remake to see how good is the version of Geraldine McEwan. Watch and enjoy.
