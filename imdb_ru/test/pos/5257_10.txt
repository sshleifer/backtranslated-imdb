Yes, this film is another remake. Yes, this film can be considered chik-flick. And yes, this film is not perfect. "Women", however, is a modern, clever update on the social behavior of all women, with impressive acting lists, including Meg Ryan, Debra Messing, Annette Benning and Bette Midler. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around four main characters, Mary (Ryan), her best friend, editor-in-chief, Sylvie (Benning), Alex (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Edie (Debra Messing) and a woman extraterrestrial which is responsible for most of the drama of the film, called Crystal (Eva Mendez). Mary is trying to cope with her cheating husband (who was never actually seen in the film), following the advice of her friends and her mother (Candace Bergen). <br /> <br /> In addition to Mary, there is Sylvie, who is torn between her social life and her professional life. She has solutions to test her moral and ethical values. Then there is the writer Alex, who is a lesbian, with a lot of courage, but knows her way with words. And finally, Edie with four girls and another child on the road who loves children and has a heart of gold, with a hidden secret revealed at the end. <br /> <br /> Together, women live for revenge, relying on each other and giving each other life lessons. But these are cametes Bette Midler, Candice Bergen, Cloris Lichman, Carrie Fisher and Debi Mazar, who show the cruel and usual behavior of women. Bergen plays Ryan's mother, she is strong, with a silver tongue, experienced, and yet feels that she could become what her daughter does later. There is Fisher, who shows how to blackmail and test the boundaries of selfishness, morality and betrayal. Mazar, gossip girl, who does not show pity for what she says and to whom she says it. Leechman, who plays the cheeky housekeeper of Ryan, she knows her place, when and where she is needed, and how to deliver a good one line. Finally, there is Idler, who plays Leah Miller, an eclectic lunatic, but a wise Hollywood agent. She is the only character who gives Maria Ryan an insight into who she really is, revealing "what I want." Despite the fact that Midler removed the theft and catchy quotes, she was underestimated. <br /> <br /> But returning to the film, women show the audience what it means to live in the 21st century, not knowing exactly what you want, until the time comes when you answer this own question. He fights with feminism, what it means to be a woman (cruel, ruthless, wacky, sticky, intelligent, cunning, intelligent, shy, proud, shy, shy, carefree, beautiful, strong, independent); and what women want, why women are what they are. It is funny, modern and in no way a masterpiece. But the bottom line is that it is worth spending money and time to see how veterans and young actresses tell us about women.
