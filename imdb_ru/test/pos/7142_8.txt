The 1990s film with Anthony Hopkins and Debroy Winger rightfully showered with praise, and I really liked it, but this television original is just as good, and in some respects a more suitable actor. Claire Bloom is not brash Joy, but she is still confident in herself and throws her cap at her favorite author (Joss Ackland in one of his best performances). <br /> <br /> Quieter, calmer and less emotional than the Attenborough film, it may be, but it is true to what is an amazing game, full of meaningful dialogue. You will still cry for this version, but you may not have musical tips to push you away. <br /> <br /> There is a place for both - and, seeing this on stage, I would say that Acland / Bloom is a little more correct. But they are both excellent.
