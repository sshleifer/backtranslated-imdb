in history. This is a reality mixed with America, and very original. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is a young girl, tired of the boring life and working on the minimum wage in New England. Her sleazy boss offers her - she leaves and takes some money from the registry. A trip from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida is not a short drive, and its Ford Escort is dying. She then meets a cute older couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have an RV and kindly offer to help her - for a girl it is not safe to be alone on the road. Especially I-95. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is very realistic, like Alice, and initially allows Judith Ivy's character to help her; buy her decent clothes, make-up, and so on. First, this is a good vacation for Alice, who hopes to meet her girlfriend who is studying at a college in Miami. There is an interesting cinematography, as the trio leads the RV down to Florida: stops, a soft landscape and eventually the beautiful North Carolina mountains. <br /> <br /> In the end, something is wrong, and the character Ivy obviously has fabricated stories about her daughter, as well as her husband, who now seems a bit ominous. <br /> <br /> I won’t spoil the outcome of this film, but it ends positively when the audience waits in anticipation - this film reminded me a bit about Spielberg’s “duel” - although it was not so threatening from the beginning - the moral of this story is you never know what people think, especially if you are driving over rough terrain. Caution !!. You will love this movie.
