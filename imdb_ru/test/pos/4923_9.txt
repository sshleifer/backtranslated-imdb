I watch this film at the beginning of every summer, and it never ceases to entertain me. Here, the jokes are packed in almost every line of the dialogue, giving you more options than the average episode of the Simpsons. Some jokes have failed or will cause only a little laugh, but others will make you roll, and then there are those who are stuck in your brain ... "The audience is now deaf." the video knows this video and does not pretend to be someone else. It is easy to sit back and let the bombardment of humor begin. A good mix of slapstick, pop culture and mocking comedy ensures that everyone finds something for themselves. I was in sixth grade when I first saw this video, and I have to admit that I still find it funny when I entered college. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to watch in the summer, in many ways, as you can see “This is a wonderful life” at Christmas or “Ten Commandments” at Easter / Easter. Moreover, it's just damn funny.
