I never read Jacqueline Suzanne’s novel, but I also saw the Valley of the Dolls based on her other book. In both cases, I thought the film was probably better than the book, and would improve with age (of course, contrary to the books). The reason is that the film focuses more on a certain style in fashion, design and behavior patterns. And in this aspect, The Love Machine offers quite a lot. Scenography fits perfectly into the story. And all the characters fit too. They are ideal in that they constitute a well-balanced overall picture. They are superficial and do not develop, it is true, but in this film I would not want it to be any different. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings reprises the role he played in Blow Up Antonioni. And this is more than plagiarism. He is a fashion photographer, he looks noticeably old and seems to be starting to mop up a little. Robert Ryan repeats the role he played in the Max Oful film, he is again Smith Olrig, greedy, boring and boring, boring and boring. Perhaps Ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly, on the other hand, he could think a lot about his role and then get a thoroughly studied idea. Whatever happens, it fits the picture. Dayan Cannon is gorgeous (a fantastic wardrobe!), She dominates every scene in which she participates, and participates in two highlights of the film: burning a luxurious bed and knocking down the Hemmings hero with an Oscar statuette. > <br /> The name “Love Machine” is, of course, ironic. Robin Stone is a kind of Barry Lyndon stage era (by the way, the film is a little gimmick). The fact that he chooses a television station to move to the top seems like a coincidence. He sees love (meaning sexual services) simply as a means for personal development. There are pretty scary hints of restless sexuality that are not revealed in the film. Homosexuality is treated very casually, probably not the standard for films of the mayor of the period. The open cynicism of television executives should not be afraid of comparing with other good films on the subject, such as Face in a Crowd, Network or Truman Show. They produce shit, they agree among themselves that this is shit, and they know that he will make a lot of dough. <br /> <br /> I didn’t regret having spent the extra 108 minutes on this film, and I won’t be surprised if he got the cult after he was given a chance (meaning the DVD release).
