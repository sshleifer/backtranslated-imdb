I still can not believe that computer graphics can create 3D images. The moment I heard about it from my friends on the forum, I swear that I will force myself to see it. <br /> <br /> I managed to watch his part in another mall, where they had many Advent Children DVDs and showed it on several laptops for sale. Obviously, I was overjoyed, but this was still not enough. Then I went to YouTube.com to find a movie. Everything I thought up was a dedication to a music video. Until that fateful day ... I found it. I watched it, despite all the distractions, because I knew that I had to look, otherwise I would be called a loser. <br /> <br /> Enough about me more about the film. As if Final Fantasy VII was not enough, they made a movie about it! My favorite part was the end of Sephiroth's life. Cloud OmniSlash could not be better. But I would not completely spoil your show. You have to see it yourself !!! Get the DVD now!
