This is one of my favorite movies. The performances of Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal are excellent, and their performances in combination with the music, scenery and reality of the film are very convincing. Look at the truth, say that this is so, a logging, mountain man who refuses to give up his lifestyle in the name of progress and development. Horseflies music is very unique and adds eerie quality to some scenes. After the first time I watched this movie, I had to go out and buy a video and a soundtrack. All in all, a silent type of movie with panic flashes. Both Thorn and the Cardinal are very believable in their roles. I took this film to the same category as Winter People, with Kurt Russell and Kelly McGillis, another favorite.
