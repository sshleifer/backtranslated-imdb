I recently watched this film for the first time in more than 30 years and was very pleasantly surprised. I remembered the film that caught the mood and mood of Britain in the mid-1960s, not getting into the cliché “Swinging Britain”, which many other films considered necessary to distribute, and my memory turned out to be true. Those who think it looks like a television play are not completely mistaken, but although Andrea Newman should have been famous for her perilous television drama, this film more closely resembles “kitchen sink” films such as “Saturday Evening and Sunday Morning” ” But with a focus on the middle class, not on the working class. Rod Steiger is excellent as a restless middle-aged leader, unhappily married to a depressed and apparently barren wife (Claire Bloom). The beginning of the “Technological Revolution” is the backdrop for a drama in which old values ​​and certainties are contested. This is the scene for the main character, played by Judy Gizon, a role that at the time was a shocking departure from the typical behavior of modern heroines. The change of roles, when the girl assessed her conquests in a small black book, was the forerunner of the feminist movement and was criticized at that time for promoting promiscuity among young girls. The irony of this criticism is traced in the characters Claire Bloom and Peggy Ashcroft, who are both unhappy. Peter Hall made several films and on this testimony is a great shame. Steiger is exemplary and trustworthy, showing why he was so highly valued.
