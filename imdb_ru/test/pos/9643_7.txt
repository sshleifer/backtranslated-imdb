When I type in these comments, I watch a DVD of the movie I just got from the dealer in the mail, and I find that it stands up very well, with strong characteristics, believable situations and well thought out action scenes. . <br /> <br /> A good 45 years have passed, maybe 50 years since I saw HELL BELOW, but the only scene that made an extremely deep impression on me was the death scene of Sterling Holloway, which was mentioned here several other commentators. I have not yet reached this scene during this viewing, but I can vouch for what the other comments have said: as soon as you see the scene of the death of Stirling Holloway in this film, you will never forget it. Judging by how strong the film is so far, I fully expect that this scene will correspond to the memories of it - as undoubtedly one of the greatest scenes of death in the history of cinema. The film is worth seeing only at this moment, but even without it it will be a first-class early underwater drama.
