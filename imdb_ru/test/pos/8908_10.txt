This is one of the best shows that has ever been held, and it gets better with age. <br /> <br /> For me, one of the main reasons for this was the adaptation in English, made by David Weir. <br /> /> A friend from Japan once told me that the original language show was more whimsical and less fun than the version we all know. <br /> <br /> The fact that the show resonates so strongly I think that his fans are not from Japan, thanks in part to the inspired efforts of Mr. Weir and some winning voice acting. <br /> <br /> Great, sir!
