15 PARK AVENUE is the address "Mithi / Mithali" (Konkona), which is searched from the beginning of the films. “Prof. Anu ”(Shabkhana Azmi) is an extremely caring and loving stepsister of Mithi from Mitya’s previous marriage. The film revolves around these characters and looks at the life of a patient with schizophrenia (Mithi). The director tries to explain to the viewer the imaginary world of Mithi, while continuing to chat with Anu and others. <br /> <br /> Konkona deserves not one, but thousands of awards (which I am sure she will receive) for the performance of Mitya in this film. You can see the expression of the patient, written on her face, on the lowered lips and sleepy eyes from the very first scene. Rahul Bose did a good job, but he reduced it to half the film, despite its importance in their lives. <br /> <br /> Keep track of the intense relationship between the characters in the film, Mitya. Anu, Anu, and Mama Anu, and between Anu and Sanjeev (Kanvaljit Singh). Shabkhana Azmi, as usual, gave a spectacular show that was remembered as a sister who sacrificed her life for Mithi. <br /> <br /> This film may not be the usual Hindi, but it can certainly make people look at Schizophrenic Patients in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> As usual, Aparna Sen takes the film to a different final, not a cliché, we can think. Hats off to her for this wonderful movie !!!
