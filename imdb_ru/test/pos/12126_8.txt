very surprisingly underrated film. very realistic and authentic. with a great dialogue. being Italian, I can definitely relate to situations and phrases used. I thought Joe Cortese was great. like a crazy cowboy type mafia, and Pesci and Vincent were great. I liked the actor Criscuolo, who played the boss. He was very authentic. I think that director Ralph DeVito was on his way to great things, but he was cut too early, perhaps because he knew too much. I thought it was great. it deserved more translation and recognition. it was a sleeping movie. a great. fine. it really had good authenticity. it was well done.
