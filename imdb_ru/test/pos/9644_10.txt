The crew of the American submarine discovered that it was HELL BELOW during the fighting on the Adriatic in 1918. <br /> <br /> Despite being almost forgotten, this excellent film about the war still provides good entertainment thanks to a competent script, excellent actions and highly believable fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery and Walter Houston are playing submarine officers in a state of war that quickly diverge from each other, with dramatic and tragic results. Since Montgomery is in love with the daughter of Houston, Madge Evans in a well-played role, the situation becomes even more difficult, both on the shore and under the waves. The viewer is torn between two strong characters, one of which is governed by his heart and the other by the rules. <br /> <br /> Robert Young looks like Montgomery's friend. Sterling Holloway creates a brief, vivid portrait of a doomed sailor. <br /> <br /> Eugene Pallett as the master of torpedoes and Jimmy Durante as a submarine cook create a very funny comedy team and give a lot of laughter. , Durant has many ribs, and his obsession with amateur dentistry leads to some chaotic encounters with British tars. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers recognize the London kid as the fat Italian miss; Maud Abern as the wife of the British admiral and Paul Porkasi as the Italian admiral - all without accreditation. <br /> <br /> MGM provided the film with first-class production performance, especially well-designed underwater episodes. Both the claustrophobic compactness of the ship and the inevitable stress associated with the submarine warfare are accurately depicted. Other moments of unexpected drama (Montgomery and Miss Evans, stuck on top of a stuck Ferris wheel during an air raid) and gaiety (Durante in a box with a kangaroo) skillfully penetrate the fabric of the film to provide a completely satisfactory viewing experience.
