SEPARATE LIES is such an elegant, smart and thought-provoking film, and I could watch Tom Wilkinson forever on the screen. Places in the English countryside, wonderful London locations, interiors, smart closets and, of course, writing and dialogues made SEPARATE LIES an exciting adventure. <br /> <br /> Having said that, perhaps it’s just from the American point of view, because the British are much more sophisticated in dealing with sex escapades, it was difficult for me to watch Tom Wilkinson just stand aside, as his wife is having fun on the way to the sexual journey, which really brings her very little joy, creates much despair for her husband, with Cap Rupert Everett. Yes, I saw the flaws in Wilkinson's character — his desire for perfection, his desire for everything in his place — but in Emily Watson she had to take a deeper look at his true character and firm kindness to understand what she had thrown out. <br /> Tom Wilkinson turns “Separate Lies” into a powerful film, watching him feel all the pain, confusion and despair on the screen when his wife leaves with another man. And he himself travels to a SEPARATE FALSE, realizing his faults, hugging his wife, despite everything that happened, and taking her back to London. Bravo, Tom!
