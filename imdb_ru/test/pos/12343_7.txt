Julie (Meg Tilly) is a “good two shoes” type schoolgirl who, having decided to prove herself to herself, allows herself to undergo the rituals of “Sister”, a small clique led by a mocking return of Queen Carol (Robin Evans). The sisters suggest that for the final test of Julie, she will spend the night in the mausoleum, preparing to lift Julia to the wall, but not knowing that the recently deceased malicious psychic Raymar was buried there and plans to cause damage from behind the grave. . <br /> <br /> Although this debut picture for Tom McLaughlin (“Friday, 13th part VI: Jason is alive” and “Sometimes they come back”) is limited by his clearly low budget, this is what McLaughlin and his team in able to do with it what matters. This is a really creepy, disturbing fare; it could scare me very well if I was less than 10 years old, and even at my current age it still reached me. <br /> <br /> Some effects look stupid.

Other actors do what they have to do quite well; familiar actors in the cast include a no less attractive veteran singer / actress / voice acting by Elizabeth (aka EG) Daily, Kevin Peter Hall, this time * not * playing some character creature, but unfortunately ending with very little screen time, and none other than Adam "Batman" West. The wife of director Nancy, who will play Lisbeth in "Jason Lives", appears here as a space girl in front of an arcade. <br /> <br /> This is decent B-level horror entertainment, perhaps too cheap for his ambitions, and maybe not so clever (hey, McLaughlin * just started), but definitely good for some chills. <br /> <br /> 7/10
