I really liked this program. It is exceptionally well written, with carefully thought-out presentations and clever visual effects. <br /> <br /> This is also very frank and honest, refreshing compared to disinfected information about drug use in movies and on television. <br /> /> Unmissable is one of the best TV shows of recent years, and winning on all scales for Channel 4. <br /> <br /> 9/10
