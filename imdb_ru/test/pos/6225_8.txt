I actually saw the last parts of this movie when I was a kid. Thanks to the site search function, I was able to find out its name. For years I did not know the name, but the film was stuck in my memory. The ending left hope that the protagonist would eventually return to Earth. It was a shame that did not reach the series. This film reminds me of traveling to the other side of the sun. Also known as doppelganger. If you like this feature, you should see another one. This was done before “The Stranger”, but shares a similar plot. Still different. I just shot "The Stranger" from eBay to VHS. I hope they make a DVD, but it is doubtful if it does not come out on a Dollar DVD. Several pilots do it on a budget DVD, and maybe this one will.
