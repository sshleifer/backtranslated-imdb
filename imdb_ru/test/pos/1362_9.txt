I liked it very much, but I have friends who hated it. There is no sex, but in any of the episodes there is very little nudity - and that's good. In addition, Keitaro has a toilet fix, which is examined in at least half of the episodes. (Toilets in Japan are more developed.) Hmm, I wonder why I rated it so highly ...? This, of course, is not that I love naked animated girls. In a sense, Keitaro Oe (the main character) is similar to Johnny Bravo, with the exception that Keitaro is a hyperactive nerd. Or you can think of him as Japan’s response to Larry's leisure suit. It is easier to accept if you watch it with subtitles, and not with duplication, but in any case it will be useful for you if you give it a chance. He is a golden guy. <br /> <br /> The formula is the same for each episode. The boy meets the girl, the boy tries to win the girl's heart, despite the fact that he is a possessed demon, the boy somehow succeeds, in spite of everything. As a rule, the girl does not realize that she likes Keitaro until he was beaten to a pulp and / or did not perform some exciting trick, such as developing a modern operating system in one week or winning the race on a motorcycle with a gasoline engine on her bike . <br /> Episode # 1 shows a rich software magnate. I think that the animation of her boobs has dealt a serious blow to the budget, because she is the only woman who has such an animation. She also dresses completely unprofessional. Most people who rate this negatively probably have not been able to go through the first episode. <br /> <br /> Episode number 2 has a rich young daughter who loves to tease. She is only 16 years old, but this is the legal age in Japan (and in some US states, I might add). Her father is also a cruel type of yakuza who has a reputation for killing guys interested in his daughter. <br /> <br /> Girl number 3 is a cute, innocent daughter of a noodle shop owner who mingled with a bad guy. Besides the fact that Keitaro arranges intervention for the girl and kisses the guy, there are almost no traces in this episode - a sharp drop compared to the previous two. However, Keitaro and the evil guy are really pounding each other. <br /> <br /> In episode No. 4, Keitaro tries to impress a first-class swimming coach. Keitaro seems to be more “frank” in her intentions with this particular girl than any other ... and she is quite straightforward in response ... <br /> <br /> Girl No. 5 is a biker beauty. She is probably the hardest of 6 (although not super-quick-tempered, like girl number 1) and “racial” in terms of sexuality and vulgarity. This particular episode is certainly the most excessive in terms of (lack of) realism. Keitaro had to break every bone in his body at least twice during the race with the baby biker, but I think the producers and writers said, “This is just a cartoon! We can do anything! ”This mistake in realism makes him a favorite among fans. <br /> <br /> Finally, episode No. 6 introduces a new girl (she works in animation), and the previous 5 girls help Keitaro, who is trying to cope with impossible time and resources constraints, to get OAV out of the door on time. From an ecchi point of view, this one is also very tame, but there is a lot of humor in it. All 5 very pretty girls from the last team who hunt Keitaro, who slips away, allegedly with the intention of raping him, participate in the final. Yes, almost everything happens in real life. Someone crossed Ukyo Tachibana (ala samurai Shodown) with Steve Urkel (ala Family Matters) ... <br /> <br /> In general, there is no intermediate level for this. You will either hate it or love it. If you are new to anime, you probably don’t want to start with this. At the same time, if you can stand such characters as Happosai (from Ranma 1/2) or Johnny Bravo ... or you like comedies that are more prone to stupidity, but have very sexual overtones, you should do it .
