Not the best story in the world, but the comedy rules in this film. Kelsey's grammar is wonderful in this film. Another funny guy is Rob Schneider, who will make you deal with his segments with Ken Hudson Campbell, who plays Backman. Lauren Holly plays probably a more serious character in the cast, like Lieutenant Lake. Bruce Dern is a great actor in this film, playing probably the most serious character in the film. The actor that I liked the most was Toby Huss as Nitro, all the electric shots his character takes in the film are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit uneven, about Lieutenant Commander Tom Dodge, who for many years wanted to command his subwoofer. When he finally gets a chance, instead of a completely new subwoofer, he gets a rusty diesel subwoofer from the Second World War - Stingray. His team is no better, the losers of the US Navy. Then he is satisfied in a series of military games, which show how the old diesel engine can withstand the current nuclear fleet. The situation is still not improving when he learns that his diver officer is actually a female officer, to see how women are doing on real submarines. To get the position of commander he wants, he must win the war games and blow up the Dummy Ship. <br /> <br /> The film is going quite well, in fact, I was laughing without stopping when I saw this movie in theaters. I loved it when they were in silence, and Buckman farts, and every reaction to the smell is fun. <br /> <br /> In general, 9 out of 10, this film is just fun to watch, it's nice to have a film like this, I hate films that are trying to be 100% serious.
