Warmly sentimental tale from the author of The Waltons. If someone had to pass the material to me, I would probably dismiss it as too dirty. But the dramatization here costs a tear without the expected embarrassment. Nobody in the 1950s was better at attractive haymaking than Arthur Hunnicutt. His appeal here is put to complete the use as a mountain man stubbornly loyal loyal hunting dog. Their destinies are inextricably linked, like any human connection. Good. I see a subtle environmental message here. All creatures go to heaven, because how can we condemn any poor devil who just follows the instinct to stay alive. In the animal kingdom there is no deception, and yet, how cruelly we often treat them. A strangely satisfying episode that confirms this important message.
