Although I am not happy with musicals, COVER GIRL is a pleasure for fans of classic cinema and especially for fans of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. The film can be dated by today's standards, and the story and the songs can't be anything special, but the musical numbers are superb set, and there is a terrific cast to go with the film. Plus, the film is a worthy introduction for Rita Hayworth's fans ... it just takes your breath away in gorgeous Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Despite Jerome Kern’s collaboration with the film, his music here is not so special or memorable for his songs in SWING TIME (1936), but the songs serve the film well. Dancing is nothing short of excellent, especially from Gene Kelly's solo number and my favorite musical number, "Alter-Ego Dance." Funny Phil Silvers almost stole the film as Kelly's partner. Otto Kruger, Eva Arden and Edward Brophy give good roles in their dramatic support roles. And Rita plays here a sweet, charming girl; a role that is far from her femme fatale in films such as BLOOD AND SAND (1941). <br /> <br /> In general, this is an amazing film that is worth seeing, even if you don’t like musicals, and yet the film’s music could be more memorable if only my favorite songwriters of the period, Irving Berlin or Cole Porter wrote songs for this movie. Nevertheless, Technicolor's gorgeous cinematography and creative dance are real treats when making a film. <br /> <br /> While I watched Rita Hayworth doing her job, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since I saw Moira Shearer in Michael Powell’s masterpiece. ” Red Shoes (1948). Just look at Rita in the GIRL'S COVER and fall in love with her.
