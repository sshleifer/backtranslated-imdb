Wicked Trivia truly separates itself from other zombie films. First of all, all the zombies in the movie are not exactly starting to bite you and tear your flesh with their bare hands. They kill you with a pick or shovel and eat you after the wards. Secondly, they cannot die. In most zombie movies, you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them, but they just wonâ€™t die. Thirdly, this is the main reason why this film is separated. All zombies are children. How exactly did they die to become zombies? They worked in a coal mine, when suddenly they were all killed as a result of a collapse. Now they roam the woods, carrying their picks and shovels, waiting for someone to come so they can kill them and eat them. at night. Yes, only at night. This makes the film even more fun than it would be if they came out in the morning. Despite all the violent and bloody riots in this film, Evil Little Things is a great choice if you are looking for a film about zombie children. Don't expect anything great, such as Dawn of the Dead or Land of the Dead, but expect a lot of blood and violence to make this movie a real zombie fan. give Rob Zombie's Taylor-Compton scout from halloween a big hand to show a great game, like the one she did in halloween. She really needs to start filming more horror movies.
