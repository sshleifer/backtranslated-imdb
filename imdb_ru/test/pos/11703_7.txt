I reluctantly saw this film before reading external reviews and user comments posted here. What for? First, because Mick Malloy's humor can (in my humble opinion) be rather rude and excessive, as evidenced by his ill-fated shemozl of a television show several years ago. And secondly, because good Australian comedy films, unfortunately, are as rare as Tassi Tiger. <br /> <br /> In this amazingly watchable movie, Mick kept his natural comedy abundance. Who would have thought that the Bowls Club would provide a place for one of the funniest Australian films in recent years. The cast is superb with familiar local old timers, all putting plausible performances. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see John Clark play the villain in this play. This is a one-dimensional part, but JC, as always, adds a bit of classiness. It's nice to see that Judith Lucy also gets Guernsey, or I should see the bowls uniform on the big screen. She is a real talent, it is a pity that some of her remarks were curses. Her own material is much sharper. An interesting character though. The reporter's bowls on the local rag. How low can you get a journalistic food chain !! <br /> <br /> Crackerjack may not be the funniest film I've ever seen this year, but it’s definitely a good entertainment to watch. Many other people obviously agree with me, since this year he will become the highest-grossing Australian film. It's nice to see someone finally making a freaky, tender comedy, not trying to tumble from laughter, like many Australian “comedies” in front of him. <br /> <br /> Finally, a little on the little things. If you're wondering which team from Aussie Rules is supported by Mick, check the flag on your workstation. Also notice your old crime partner, Tony Martin, making an announcement in the final scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
