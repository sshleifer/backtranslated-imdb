Relax and let the director of Bharatbala lead us on a visual and sensual journey of the mind and spirit of India. When was the last time you could say that you really liked the movie? This film has a pace and makes us move in directions that can only exist in India. If you did not want to visit India before, this film will certainly make you want to visit it now. In this film, the dancing girls, the chase scene and the mafioso. But it is much more. Thank you, Bharatbala, for taking us to such a funny and wonderful story. I liked the finale. We women do not want illusions in life, we want reality. Postscript I was a friend of Caroline at the Sonoma Film Festival and met you briefly. Good luck with your dissemination efforts, and I am discussing the movie Storm.
