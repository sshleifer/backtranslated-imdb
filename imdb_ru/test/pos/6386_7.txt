An unusual film that begins with the classic premise of a bully who marries a girl who loves him to escape from the country. But the turn soon turns the story upside down. Most of the film gets into the right buttons: the story develops smoothly, the acting is flawless (Sienna Miller's draw is priceless, it really can act!), Chemistry between the two leading roles works, and rotating American rural scenes and weird side characters really create a good time. The mood, starting as light and romantic, soon turns into something more sombre and downright creepy. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, although the pace slows down a little more than we would like, but don't let it stop watching this unusual little cinematic pleasure.
