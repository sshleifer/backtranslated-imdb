If you were "there" and "made it", you will definitely like this movie. I mean, and by "there" I mean underground clubs and home parties, where it is far less often to find people just drunk than to find people completely into ecstasy, speed or LSD. <br /> <br /> By “this” I mean dancing and sweating like crazy for eight hours in a row without a brake, after which comes a long morning without sleep and almost a desire to die, and then a week of waiting until next weekend, to do it all again. <br /> <br /> Therefore, although this film is now one of my favorite, I can certainly understand why some people or most people don’t even like it.
