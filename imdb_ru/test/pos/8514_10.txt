Like most people who watched the James Bond 007 films. Most people NEVER knew that Thunderball was originally the first 007 movie to be released, but after Ian Fleming wrote the story with Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham. Two other authors appealed to Jan Fleming in court and won the case, presenting evidence that Ian Fleming took advantage of the ideas of SPECTER (Special Leader on Combating Fraud in Combating Terrorism). Thus, instead of creating “Thunderbol” they (Fleming, Broccoli, Salzman) continued to do the doctor NO. <br /> <br /> This film was the best of the best: from getting Sean Connery to return again, he was paid more than 5,000,000 for an NSNA. Irwin Kershner and Sean Connery had problems on the set, that's true. But overall, this film was there, I think, with (Thunderball, License To Kill, Dr No), these are my favorites from the bond series. David Drayer was hired for Special Photographic Effects, he worked at Bladerunner at that time, before NEVER SAYING NEVER AGAIN. A $ 100 million yacht makes disco-volante look like a canoe. In this film, the best Willian starred in the movie about the connections immediately behind the doctor No. Klaus Maria Brando held this neurotic affair as a calm manner, with a little wit in his power over the bond. Barbara Carrera was gorgeous as she blushes from fatima. <br /> <br /> Music was better than all scores that did not have John Barry performing music with a background score in most bond films. Michel Legrand is not big in the United States compared to Europeans, he played for many years with Miles Davis and many other GREAT jazz musicians. From time to time it's a bit boring, but theme 007, which occurs about 3-4 times in a film, NEVER TELL, AGAIN NEVER NOT SO cool, I like it more than the original. <br /> <br /> 007 comes back again <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton explained this correctly, I thought that YOU CAN'T BE RELATED TO A SUPERMAN OR SUPERGER, he or she must be a man and have feelings. He certainly was the BEST SERIOUS TRUE VERSION OF THE FLEMING COMMUNICATIONS. But Sean Connery proves that he can still play the role that made him and others to follow him, I bet on 75, now he could play the role of Willian in the film MCCLORY 007, if anyone ever appears. <br /> <br />
