As a former Highland Rugby (HR) player, I feel I can answer some of the questions and confusions that have been put forward. I think I am also able to offer some insight into the club and past stories. Oh, and this will be a long post, I can already say. <br /> <br /> First, people who said that there is no real rugby in the film have the right point of view. The film is full of bad gear, people in the wrong places and more. If you want to know what a real rugby game is, you won’t get the best idea from this movie. But the fact is that anything other than just sitting down and watching the main video or jumping into the game on their own will not be satisfactory. This is Hollywood, not ESPN! Indeed, how many sports films really make you feel in the game? Not so much what I saw. I think it’s important to remember that a movie about rugby players is much more than about rugby. <br /> <br /> Next, Haka is VERY part of Highland Rugby. This is not what they just threw into the movies. Honestly, I don’t know how the tradition began, but the Highland emulates the All Blacks in many ways. The uniform is also based on All Blacks. The film did not help explain the origin of the hack, and, frankly, I do not think this is correct. But I can tell you that every team member knows exactly where he is from and what it means. As for the person from China (?), Who said that only Maori can perform the hack, I would advise you to look at the All Blacks and tell me if they think they are all Maori. Believe it or not, there is a very large Polynesian community in Utah, and much of them love to play rugby for the local teams. I myself am partly Hawaiian. Whenever possible, the haka is headed by Maori. The team does not do this because they think they are Maori, they do it because of some of the problems shown in the film. The concept of unity and “those who left earlier” is a huge part of the culture of HR, and the message for Hack for those who are familiar with it supports these values. This is the singing of the leader, who thought he would die (Ka Mate), and those around him support him, telling him that he will live (Ka Ora) and raising him. How appropriate for a group of white boys is not to do it to me, but this is the ideology behind it, and why it is being done. Kia Kaha is also a well-used team motto, even if it was hard for the actors to say it. <br /> <br /> Also, for people who doubted Highland’s ability to play rugby, I’d just remind you that you didn’t actually watch Highland in this movie. Many of the extras were former Highland players and other teams, but the main characters were actors. Believe it or not, Highland is really very good at what they do and is quite respected in the international community. Of course, some years have given better teams than others (this is what you expect from any sports team), but you don’t accumulate a HR record just by being fine. One year after my graduation, (1998) Highland was one of 12 teams that were invited to the World School Rugby Championship in Zimbabwe. The teams were selected by hand from around the world and represented the best of the Rugby talents of the High School of the time. Highland, obviously, did not win first place (New Zealand did it), but they managed to take third place in the tournament, beating Tonga champions in their last match. And although American rugby may never reach the level of talent that exists in New Zealand or South Africa, the third in the world also has nothing to hang their heads about. The Highland also has a tradition of traveling around New Zealand every few years, and usually returns with more victories than losses. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters in this movie are based on real people and real stories. I watched this film with my brothers, who also played for Highland, and between the four of us we were quite sure that we were able to identify ALMOST every main character. No one knew the white rasta. Of course, since it was not a documentary, Hollywood took some liberties, but to tell you the truth, not as much as you think. The film was in fact quite accurate, showing daily practices of 2 and a half hours, as well as mandatory personal running and weight training. Sometimes it really ran until you vomited. He also showed service and other command actions (for example, a buffet table), which were very important for team unification. <br /> <br /> And finally, the film, in my (obviously, very biased) opinion. It was a pretty good movie. And I think the reason for this is that I watched it as an inspiring sports movie. I did not think it would be a pure rugby film or drama, an award winning academy. It was just an inspiring film about a rugby team, full of morality, encouragement and a good dose of jokes added for fun. I hope that I solved some of the problems that people faced in the film, and I hope that now you can enjoy it the way it was. <br /> <br /> Kia Kaha
