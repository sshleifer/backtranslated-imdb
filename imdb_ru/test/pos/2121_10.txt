Today I went to the preview of the Grand Champion (Dallas / Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and several other cities in Texas). There are so few films suitable for small children ... but this one is, and that's great. Although the plot is a bit “hockey” (in the film also called “Manage”), this is a wonderful story for children. And I also liked it. <br /> <br /> The film fairly well reflects the family life of a ranch in West Texas, albeit a bit exaggerated. Director / author Barry Tabb must do it right, as he grew up in this environment. He called the film his "love letter to Texas." <br /> <br /> Joey Lauren Adams plays the single mom Buddy (Jacob Fisher) and the sister Beat (Emma Roberts). Watch Emma Roberts (Julia Roberts' niece); she is very good and I think she will be in more films. There are also cameos from Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, musicians George Straight, Charlie Robison, Robert Earl Keane, Joe Eli and rodeo legends Larry Mahan and Taff Hedeman. <br /> <br /> If you have small children or you just want to see a movie with good health, see the “Great Champion” when he comes to your city (presumably at the end of this month). You will love everything, and it will make you feel good. <br /> <br /> I think since I'm from West Texas, I can be a little biased ... no, I'm impartial. Great movie!
