Man, I think people have forgotten how to watch a movie. Everyone thinks they are a critic. They comment on things that the ordinary moviegoer does not even know and does not think about. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie. This was what I expected, so I was not disappointed. Stephen gets a bad reputation for putting his views into his films, but this is also a reason to watch. What is even more funny is that people who complain about his films, say that he is the worst, and that we should not watch his films, still watch his films. All so they can comment on how bad they are. Who is the fool? If you do not like his work, do not watch it. Then you will not have to expose yourself to this supposedly painful event. <br /> <br /> Stop comparing movies to other movies and watch the movie individually, and you can start enjoying the movies again.
