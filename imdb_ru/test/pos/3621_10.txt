Incredibly funny Italian Rootsploitation of the mid-70s with a lot of uncoordinated S & M, lesbian sex, gratuitous racial cruelty, etc. Some redeeming cinematic qualities, with the exception of rather steep thematic music with dubbed "African" drums and flute. A brilliant example of dialogue: <br /> <br /> The owner of the White Slave (for the Manager of the White Plantation): “You are so stupid, I bet you forgot to interrogate this ***** midwife!” <Br /> <br / > White Plantation Manager: “I not only interrogated her, I did it so well that she died before I could get any answers from her!” <br /> <br /> All black actors have 70s years, and say "yes, Mass" in a high voice. A woman has sex with everyone on the plantation. 10 stars for lovers of tasteless meanness.
