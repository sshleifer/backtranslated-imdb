This version of Gulliver's stories is definitely bizarre. The staging adds a story about the frame (this is what he becomes famous for) when Gulliver returns to his wife and son. On the one hand, it is incredibly long and sometimes unable to hold attention everywhere, but strange images and a diverse composition will make you look. Mary Steenburgen does the best work of the actors. Danson seems a bit out of place with his American accent. The whole thing about asylum is often terrifying, but nonetheless interesting and well combines travel Gulliver. Danson's character really seems insane, however ... he had to work on being a little more true for everyone, in my opinion. Also confusing comes from the present to the past. Does someone else think that Yahoos is the ugliest thing that has ever decorated a television screen (or in line for it)? Confusing, sometimes boring, but still accentuated by good play, great visual effects and a few nice details. The first of many NBC event films from Robert Halmi Sr. See for yourself to decide how it will be for you, however I give * * * 1/2 (out of 5 stars).
