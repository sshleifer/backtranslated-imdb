You have to be terribly patient to watch a movie with single-line films that are so flat and unfunny that you wonder what was being said when the whistle in the dark opened up for such an enthusiastic audience greeting in the 40s. <br /> In addition to some of the weak line-ups and ordinary shows, the plot is as contrived as the stories of The Fox (Red Skelton) told to his listeners. You have to wonder why someone might think that he can find a real solution on how to commit a crime and get off it. But then, how comedy is unreal. <br /> <br /> But — if you're a real Red Skelton fan and want to look back at how comedies were created in the 40s, you can at least enjoy the friendly cast that supports it. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Gray succeed because of his love interest, and Conrad Wade, as always, makes an interesting villain. One of his more amusing moments is his reaction to Skelton, explaining the secrets of wearing turbans. “I never knew this,” he reflects, struck by the insignificant moment that was skillfully introduced. <br /> <br /> In general, typical nonsense, requiring you to recognize the lack of trust and just accept the plugs, as they are. It is not always easy for a demanding viewer, as many of them simply fail, as many comedies of this era do, because the novelty of shows and one-line players is simply outdated.
