I am the first to realize that the thirst for Chang-Vuk Park is exceptionally well done, but for Tagio (OK-vin Kim) more than two hours is enough for anyone to tolerate such a period of time. Sang-Hyun (song Kang-ho) is a priest who wants to volunteer for experimental studies of those who are ready to undergo strict injections for a particular virus that kills infectiously. Instead of legal dying, Hyun becomes a vampire, always thirsting for blood to support him, to fight off an infectious disease that returns, causing symptoms that began on a straight line (.. blows / wounds, and the body tears blood). Sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes painful death with prolonged exposure to Hyun. Hyun falls in love with Tae-Joo, the wife of the painful childhood friend Kang-Woo (Ha-Kyun Shin). Mrs. Ra (Ho-suk Kim), who was considered a puppy, took over Tae Joo and practically used her as a pet, which could be ordered. Ta-Joo is unhappy in this situation and begins a hot romance that she instigates Hyun, soon forcing him to kill Kan-Wu, forcing him to believe that she has become a victim of ill-treatment. Having renounced his priesthood, Hyeon is rapidly plunging into a relationship with Tae-joo, who soon wants to be involved in the murder of Kang-woo. This incident, which was promoted by Tae-Woo (... using a boat in the middle of the lake, both proceeded to his burial under water, Ta-Wu did not allow him Kan-Wu to ascend again when he tried to return) would be pursued Circumstances arise when Kan-Wu "disappeared" (Hyun got rid of him, where the police did not find his body). Soon, Mrs. Ra happens to have a stroke (although one finger and the ability to blink their eyes contribute to the development of the plot, showing that she is more aware of what they think), and Hyun makes Tae-jo a special birthday present ..vampirism. In doing so, Hyun created a monster. Tae-joo admits (... although she talks about this) that Kang-Woo never actually harms her, and since she longs for blood, it is soon realized that the murder for the sake of delivery does not bother her either mentally or psychologically . Tae-Joo is becoming so complete that Hyeon must take desperate measures if he wants to stop such a threat to society, including himself. <br /> <br /> I’ll say that Thirst is one of the best horror films I have ever seen in 2009. This is the methodical approach that the Park uses, and they lead us along the dark road with Hyun and Taju, as they do terrible things when there is nothing positive about their unholy alliance. Innocent people are dying because of Hyun's love (what was once lust turns into an obsessive love of the end) for Tae-jo, and this will stop if he does not make a painful choice. We see inside their heads, their souls, and this is not always beautiful. 2 hours with them can be quite tedious ... but, thank the director for not pulling on the sly behavior and how the powers of vampirism can be transferred to the wrong people. Hyun, who is considered to be a rather pleasant soul at the opening, takes Tae-Ju to “hell” so that you can consider Thirst for a unique love story, but not quite healthy. <br /> <br /> With regard to Violence, while the Park has a tendency to be distracted from extremely graphic details, there is enough sadism to perhaps turn the stomach a little. At the very least, how violence is perpetrated can have long-term consequences. Sexual situations between Hyeon and Tae-joo can be quite hot and erotic, but also dirty and morally reprehensible. The film, I think, is still a rather complex study of how long to remain attached to the object of affection (passion).
