In fact, I have more question than comment. I loved the Z-Boys and The Lords of Dogtown. I saw the Lords first, then the dock, and although I liked the story, I was curious why Sid was an important character in the film, but in the documentary film he was not part of the team, but only referred to as just some kind of child they knew. Does anyone know the story about this? The story of these boys was amazing. I never experienced the passion for skateboarding, where I grew up, but my kids liked it. What I saw in the local skate parks is what these boys invented. I never knew that. When the film showed competition, and the Z-Boys did their job, they disgraced others in the competition.
