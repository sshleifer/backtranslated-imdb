Francis Ford Coppola wrote and sent this stunningly personal story about the flight of a married woman from her husband and the reality that, perhaps, youthful delight and excitement of her younger years behind her. We know little about this woman’s marriage, except that lately she has felt her independence disappear; she also recently learned that she was pregnant, which further complicated her heart (she does not want to be a complacent wife, despite the fact that on the maternal line she talks to her husband on the phone). During her journey, she meets two men: a former college football hero, who - after an accident during a game - was left with permanent brain damage, and a sexy, pompous police motorcycle that has a lot of trouble in his own life, Clear, clean landscapes (photographed by the very talented Wilmer Butler) are astutely understood, as are the characters. Shirley Knight, James Caan, and Robert Duval each demonstrate strong, exciting performances, especially because they are not very pleasant people in normal circumstances. Some scenes (for example, Knight's first call home from a payphone or her first night alone with Kaan, where they play "Simon Says") are almost too intimate to watch. Coppola plays with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into notes to which we are involved. It allows you to play scenes, but the editing is pretty smart, and the film never gets too heavy (there are at least two or three very sharp moments). This is a reckless effort - so much so that the picture was still shown at festivals almost five years later. Some may avoid Coppola’s inept twisting of events to emphasize the finale with bitter irony, but the strength and drive behind the picture almost erase its flaws. *** from ****
