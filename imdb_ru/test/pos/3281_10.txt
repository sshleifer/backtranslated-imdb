Trey's favorite since the first launch of the 10th season, as well as one of my personal favorites, Manbearpig talks about Al Gore's adventures before going on global warming, and before the movie it looked like an adventure, of course, Al Gore also tried to realize the world About something that can change the Earth, about something really dangerous, this time about something that is half human, half bear and half pig, Al Gore had only one thing in mind: to realize each of Manbearpig and kill him! Al Gore is more than happy here, everyone who sees him is sorry for him, and yes, he may be childishly hysterical because no one believes him, but he is just an abnormal bastard. In fact, four children were trapped in a cave because of Al Gore, but, of course, he does not think about it, there is no room for any other object, it is only Manbearpig, as for Al Gore. These four children are Cartman, Kenny, Kyle and Stan, mostly Stan was sorry for A.L. The mountain, and the four boys simply played Al Goreâ€™s game, without even imagining that Mountain could almost kill them while he was trying to kill Manbirp (funny scene ...) they are just children, damn Manbearpig "). So in this piece we have, on the one hand, everything related to the rescue team, which also regrets for El Gore, and on the other hand, we have a small but extremely funny episode with Cartman, and there are no surprises regarding Cartman after he finds the treasure in the cave, of course, everything related to this treasure is fantastic and fine, because you will see the sick Cartman in both senses, he is really sick of the boys and really sick of us. And in the end, Al Gore killed Manberpip! This character is fantastic, and I flakes! Awesome fun in this episode. 10 of ten
