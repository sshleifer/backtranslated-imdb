Blind Spot is one of my favorite festivals. I was completely intrigued by the idea that the three strangers are looking for a mysterious man who loved and betrayed each of them in different ways. The cast is great. James Franco is especially amazing as a broken-hearted boy from Los Angeles. His diary entries, which we hear in the voice acting, go well with the visual effects and are quite intense. The film has a powerful style. This pushes elements such as the road film and the drama revenge in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening atmosphere of lost love. In several episodes there is a fabulous quality, and the images are imbued with an eerie feeling of tension. Strange. Tense. Look beautiful. Definitely worth a look. I really would like to see it again. Periodically, I check if the blind zone was distributed. I can't wait to see the movie again in the movie or on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Davide Pepe 13/08/2005 Bologna - Italy
