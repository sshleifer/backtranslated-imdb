1904. The North African nation of Morocco clings to independence, as the various European powers - France, Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Spain, and now the USA - fight for influence in the region. Sultan (Mark Zuber) - a weak puppet; his uncle Bashav (Vladek Sheybal), manipulated by the French and the Germans, is the real power behind the throne. Enter the Berber Chiftan Raisuli (Sean Connery), the leader of the reef tribe and the “last of the Barbary pirates,” who kidnaps American missionary Eden Pedekaris (Candice Bergen) and takes them hostage. Returning to the US, President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) threatens to start a war because of the question: “Pedekaris is alive or Raisuli is dead!” - seeing the perfect way to use his “big stick” diplomacy, although Secretary of State John Huston not so sure about that. However, Raisuli has less sinister plans for Pedecarises, who are more than able to handle themselves anyway. <br /> <br /> A great historical film by John Milius, VERY poorly based on a true story (i.e. Pedekaris was a middle-aged man), is a wonderful escapism. He has some amazing scenes of action movies, a witty, well-written script, a wonderful cast that enjoys the material, and he doesn’t stand up to his greeting, such as the films Pirates of the Caribbean or The Lord of the Rings. In fact, this is not an “epic” film in the strictest sense, but it is one of the best clean action films ever made. <br /> <br /> Although the historical context is unsteady, the storyline is interesting, and, as some reviewers point out, beyond, this is even more appropriate today than it was when done. As President Roosevelt says, "America is like a grizzly bear" - violent, strong, but sometimes blind and reckless. During the filming of the film, America had just entered the world stage as a superpower after its resounding victory in the Spanish-American War - and Roosevelt uses this incident as a way to prove America’s value. In real life, it didn't quite work, but allegorically it works well. Although Milius's script is written on the right side, he rather accurately assesses America and its place in the world. He admires Roosevelt and his “big stick” method and rightly admits (according to Roosevelt) that although America can be feared and respected, they will never be truly “loved” by the world, no matter what they do. And there are some scenes - for example, shooting Roosevelt's targets at European leaders and the almost comic surprise attack of the Marines on Basho Palace - that show America’s reckless and cruel side, while others - the climate confrontation with the Germans - show their heroism. br /> <br /> The historical / political context of the film is, of course, just meat on the bones of what is essentially an exciting action / adventure film. There are several brilliantly made battle scenes, such as saving Raisuli Pedekaris from twin tribesmen, where one of the best sword fights in any film are represented. The first entrance to Raysuli and the aforementioned march and attack by US Marines is brilliantly executed bravura decorations. And the last battle, which combines elements of Lawrence of Arabia and the Wild Bunch, while the main historical fantasy (the tripartite battle between Germans, Americans and reefs) is a superbly organized adrenaline-pumping sequence. <br /> <br /> Excellent cast gives excellent performances. Everyone seems to have fun with the film, and it shows. Sean Connery is surprisingly convincing as a Berber with a Scottish accent, but he manages to carry out his interesting, well-drawn and knightly character, who respects his hostage and hates modern, uncivilized war. Candice Bergen, an actress I have never loved, beautifully plays the role of an angry Eden Pedekaris, who is as strong as her captor. Brian Keith is an amazingly convincing TR - you really feel that he was such a sporty, violent, but still practical and intelligent man with a wonderful sense of himself. Roosevelt's boxing scenes and target shooting when discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest “bad ass” moments in film history - and who can forget lines like “Why spoil the beauty of things with legitimacy?” John Houston provides solid support like tired, cautious Haye , acting as the perfect foil for the much more impetuous Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> Among the excellent supporting actors, the best are Jeffrey Lewis as Samuel Hammer, a cynical ambassador at the center of political intrigue, and Steve Canali as a fanatical marine captain who happily favors (and spends) "Military intervention!" as a rough and simple solution to the whole difficult situation. Other familiar faces, such as Vladek Scheibal, Nadeem Savalha, Roy Jenson, Larry Cross, Marc Zuber and Darrell Fetti, also do an excellent job, no matter how small their role. Fans of spaghetti in western countries recognize Antoine Saint-John (“A Handful of Dynamite”) as a German general, and Aldo Sambrell as one of the tribesmen of Raisuli. <br /> <br /> Wind and Lion is all around, a wonderfully made adventure film. He has something for everyone: a great game with weapons and swords, a lot of humor, a tough, furious heroine (and her two cute children), a pleasant (if not complete) novel and an interesting (albeit quirky) political / historical context. This is not a masterpiece, but hey, did not try to be. I give Wind and Leo nine exciting stars and my highest recommendation.
