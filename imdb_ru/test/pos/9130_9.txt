Commissioner Mattei (Andre Burvil) is a loner with a small pistol who loves cats, and his boss at the Paris police department is a philosopher who knows that even the police sooner or later become guilty. This is what the film is about. And a gem robbery in the Vendome district. <br /> <br /> Corey (Delon) brings the plan out of prison, Vogel (Volonte) joins him and helps him against two tough guys who pursue him because he took the Ricos (Andre Eycan) mafiosi money while while Rico had already taken her friend Cory and left him alone for five years in prison. Corey and Vogel find the third man, Jansen (Montana), a former police officer and sniper, who opens the security lock by firing special handmade ammunition into the pit. An ideal plan and cooperation, but they have to sell the loot, and there is Mattei in the role of a disguised buyer. The circle is closing. Running to help each other, they were shot by a cat, loving Matthew and his small pistol. <br /> <br /> It took him 20 years to, in his words, make a film about the robbery after he failed to get a contract for RIFFIFI. Melville wrote the script and starred in the south of France and in Paris last year. The great Henri Decae is, as usual, a lighting operator. This is one of the last photos of Melville, who died after another film with Delon in 1972. <br /> <br /> Melville really wanted Belmondo, not Volonte, he didn’t like this Italian at all, but Volonte-Vogel is a great fugitive and gives the most convincing performance next to Bourvil. But note: Melville notes that Volonte is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very tedious and absolutely impossible on the French film set. Melville did not like him at all, and he no longer wanted to work with him. <br /> <br /> Melville is wrong. Volonte give the most lively character in nowhere not so many interesting characters. You can see how he feels, pursued by Matthew and his small dangerous pistol and all the dogs of France in the winter of 70. Wild actor. <br /> <br /> Also Andre Burville, who passed away close to the time of the shooting. He was also not the first choice, but definitely a great replacement. He demonstrates the instinct of a lonely hunter throughout the entire film and, eventually, gets a chance to become guilty again. <br /> <br /> At night Jansen entered the jewelry store with a rifle and a tripod, but in the end he was taking a risk. Freehand successful shot. When he first meets Delon, we already know that elegant Jansen has a serious problem with alcohol. After the robbery, Montan refuses to take his part of the loot and mentions Delon, who looks at him, that he only got into the red circle because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe. Delon does not understand what he means. Viewers recall seeing Montana in a magnificent scene in his haunted house, battling helpless nightmarish creatures that come out of their wardrobe and attack him. At that time, a very rare scene, I recall a long time later. I can bet that it was ever so difficult to arrange and manage these things at a time that no one could have imagined in the coming days of creating digital cinema. A great work of art when art was done by hand. <br /> <br /> We will surely remember a film crew similar to the actors, however, even after 33 years, this team remains less popular among Melville's six thrillers. What's wrong with it? I'm afraid no one shows any special interest in these three actors (with the participation of three criminals) and their police hunter. We know too little about Corey and his fateful 5 years from his beautiful girlfriend (Anna Doking). Montand is still a great sniper, but that’s why he became a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe. Delon behaves as if he is in the early adventures of the samurai, Volonte is a man in the trunk of an American car, Delonse, who is wonderfully moving, and it is pleasant to watch Mattei, a great actor on the edge of his life. But how could he ever doubt that everyone is to blame? <br /> <br /> In an interview, Melville states that there is no woman in the film. Not in the red circle itself, but I remember well that cheerful beauty Anna Douking (without a future career). We are in the 70s. There, in fact, a woman rises from the bed of the old mafiosi, who wears nothing, and slowly goes to the door to listen to the voice of her old lover Delon. Bardo did something like this 10 years ago. This time Melville was the director. Fine. <br /> <br /> RED KERKL certainly added a few to the history of the film, but not so many brilliant gems. The robbery on the Place Vendome and Montand surprises how the inhabitants of the wardrobe and Volonte run away from Bouvila in white underwear and carefully carry his trousers through the stream. This is too little for a good movie about gangsters and robberies. But those 110 minutes never tire you, and this is a high-level game. And perhaps there are some secrets that you will learn when you watch the movie again and again. None of the secrets is that we are all to blame, and the late Francois Perrier is also revealed. <br /> <br /> Michael Zabel
