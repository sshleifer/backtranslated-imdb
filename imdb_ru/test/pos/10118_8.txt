<br /> <br /> After reading the review of an unemployed critic, I went to the show of Radio, not knowing what to expect. Fortunately, an unemployed critic now seems to me, at least, a disappointed director / film critic. His review is callous and absolutely inappropriate! <br /> <br /> This is a movie that makes you laugh, makes you cry and eventually gives you a pause! <br /> Paraphrasing a line uttered by actor Ed Harris in the final scene for hairdressers "... and all this time when we thought we were teaching radio, the truth is that ... he taught us. He treats us all the time, as if we want us to relate to each other, sometimes! ”Yes, the film draws to the heart. Yes, it is emotionally manipulated, and yes, Cuba Gooding Jr. (in a decent Oscar play) is sometimes a bit overloaded (see Dance Scene of the Nativity), but you know what? SO WHAT! From time to time, the American community needs to be reminded of what tolerance can do for our great country. We need to remind how we CAN be. <br /> <br /> This is a serious cast. I was especially pleased to see S. Epata Merkerson, depicting the mother of Radio, doing something outside of Law and Order. I always wondered if Miss Merkerson was an outstanding actor, or whether this quality of writing was a good choice of law and order. After watching this film, it is easy to see that she is really a very good actor. <br /> <br /> In the role of an actor in the small, but important and influential roles, Alfre Woodard plays the role of director, Debra Winger in his career. - The resurgent role of the wife of coach Jones and Chris Malka in the role of the protagonist, Frank Clay. <br /> <br /> We cannot lose sight of Ed Harris' performance as coach Harold Jones. After thinking about this film and after I grew up in the deep south, it is difficult to truly appreciate Mr. Harris and his contribution to this film. As a trainer to Jones, Ed demonstrates the quiet, flawless performance of a man on a mission. Coach Harris will not allow the city or circumstances to distract him from what he knows in his heart - this is what needs to be done. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, make sure that you stay behind the final captions. A treat awaits you, as the real James Robert “Radio” Kennedy, who is now over fifty, and still headed by T.L. Hannah’s football team takes to the pitch every Friday night. <br /> <br /> Last remark. If you were a teenager in the mid to late 70s, this movie is worth the price of an entrance ticket, just for the sound track!
