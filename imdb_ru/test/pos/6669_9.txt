Finally, a film that processes the likelihood of visiting aliens with appropriate depth and loving warmth. just in case, if we are not alone, I believe that these visitors are too touristy to take care of us or to give this wayward bundle of anthropocentric nonsense strong proof of their existence. we would not interfere in the battle rites of some agitated desert tribe, unless we take care of our insurance, right? <br /> <br /> In any case, the film shows a transition cathexis of a weary mind and a body by a superior entity. it happens rather indecent and rather unrecognized, but we are dealing with a film here, right? Thus, Prot's hospitalization is just a trigger to the conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges, as usual, behaves well, but Spacey is cheerful. The role seems to him specially tuned, convincing and lovingly “insane”. ate unpeeled bananas, sat on a tree, delivered to his doctor difficulties with speed, wisdom, and (most of all!) amazing quotes. they made me think and philosophize for hours. <br /> <br /> This is an encouraging film, to say the least, and Edward Shirmur’s soundtrack is just great. just go and get a copy. catch a ray of light. now.
