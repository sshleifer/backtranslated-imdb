David Cronenberg, very much like his colleague David Lynch, acquired a taste. A director who plays on topics such as reality, perversion, sex, insanity and death will surely receive the most extreme responses from viewers. He proved it with the movies "Fly", "Naked Lunch", "Crash" and "eXitenZ" (capital X, capital Z) and more recently "Spider". Best to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. Try not to read too much about the plot, otherwise it will be destroyed for you. What I can tell you is that Cronenberg takes you on a journey into the world of video games, which serves as a metaphor for any kind of escapist behavior. People always dream of realizing their fantasies, but how far can you go into them until reality becomes blurred and fantasy turns into a nightmare? These are the topics covered in eXistenZ: a study of the personality, psyche of a person, physical bodies affected by diseases, and, most importantly, reality itself. <br /> <br /> History and direction are excellent. Cronenberg knows his profession very well and successfully implements the artificial world, avoiding the usual traps and cliches associated with such stories. The film shows some rather disgusting things, but is unusually restrained in the blood section compared to Cronenberg's other work. The shock effects on which he plays are never excessive, and the plot development is very clever and creative. This is not the most intelligent film in the entire history, but it will make you think, wonder and be confused. <br /> <br /> Acting is also two fingers higher. Both the main characters, Jennifer Jason Lee and Jude Law, play their roles perfectly and intelligently depict the changing moods and personality of their character. At times, the dialogue may seem a bit outdated and clinical, but this is part of the effect that Cronenberg was going to create to create a discontented and alien atmosphere that makes you feel uncomfortable. The support of actors such as Ian Holm, Don McKellar, and especially the creepy Willem Defoe, is raising the film even higher thanks to their disturbingly familiar performances. <br /> <br /> You need to get used to this movie, but if you can appreciate the dark tone, the bloody images and the twisted story, you'll like it.
