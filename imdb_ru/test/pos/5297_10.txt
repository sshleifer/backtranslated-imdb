Studio Miyazaki Ghibli shows his amazing touch, enlivening, inspiring life in every little action of the characters in Ponyo. When Sosuke so carefully lowers her little boat to reach for the red fish, you know you will have a great time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Characters are interesting, and you really care about them. They visually recall other stories: Riis seems to be an adult Nausika with her son, an old woman in a wheelchair recalls a witch in the Mobile Castle of Howl. <br /> <br /> The presence of the elements, the wind, the rain and the sea with its great, powerful waves, so strong that I think it was never called this way in any other film. This is a simple story, weakly inspired by the “mermaid”, and it covers the heart of the audience, as well as Totoro, Miyazaki’s real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Instant classics, great soundtrack and catchy song during the final credits. Do not miss it.
