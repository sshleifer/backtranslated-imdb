Well, I was a few days late, but damn it ...! In any case, the word that best describes my reaction to “I see no evil” was .... SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is definitely enough blood, blood and action with a bit of waiting in the film. He listens to the good old days of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Think "Crazy" meets Leatherface with a dash of Norman Bates, and you will feel this movie. While SNE is thin on the plot (most horror films), he sort of compensates for this with violence / murder methods, blood, obscurity, and the fact that Kane plays well the very worried Jacob Goodnight. The name of the film comes from the fact that Jacob snatches the eyes of his victims, using only his fingers, and stores them in large jars. What for?? You just need to look and see (pun intended). There are some cinematic elements taken from other horror films, most notably Psycho, TCM and Madman, but they are not explicit. Finally, SNE doesn’t really enter a territory that we haven’t seen or given for a long time, SNE is not “Pyscho” or “TCM 74”, but certainly deserves to look like that. <br /> <br /> BloodStone recommendation: take the morning show "Do not look at evil" on the Bloodstone rating: 7.5 / 10
