I really did not think this film was bad. Of course, the detective curious sucked what he did, and he usually came across Captain Howdy by accident, but he did his job. Captain Howdy himself was pretty scary. Makeup artist did a great job. I really liked to see Dee dress up. I laughed so hard when I saw this. Personally, I don’t understand how someone can sit in shit like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, call it a great movie, and then watch “Strange Land”, which is more alarming because much of this can actually happen when the Internet is and call bad. I personally think that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a bunch of crap. Probably one of the silliest movies I've ever seen. I enjoyed Strange Country. It was a very disturbing film, because almost all of this is actually happening.
