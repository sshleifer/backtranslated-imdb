Being a veteran instructor at Richland College in Dallas and a former MGM screenwriter during the times of decent films, I am very glad that I accidentally clicked tonight on Channel 33 in Dallas and watched this enchanting film in which Betty White was great and was shot one passion for the good old days of really good movies before Hollywood began to play all this nonsense for teenagers. If the producer is listening, I would like to declare that we are over 60 years old, who will gladly pay a dollar to watch a film that has no weapons, no murders, no special effects, sex and violence, and just a good touching story about human relationships that leaves you good warm feeling, like this movie made for me.
