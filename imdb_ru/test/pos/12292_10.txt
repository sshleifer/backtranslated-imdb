I watched Pola X because Scott Walker wrote the music for the film and I really admire his music. To be honest, I expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly incoherent French film. I was wrong. The vision of the film quickly attracted my full attention - starting with the introductory sequence, which shows black and white footage of military aircraft throwing bombs at the graves to the sound of music and Scott Walker's beautiful screaming voice. The film explores the crisis of the personality of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - a brilliant choice of role) and its subsequent (self) destruction. The story is divided into two parts ?? the first portrays Pierreâ€™s carefree life in a beautiful house in a French village, and the second follows his complete personal breakup after he drops everything and moves to Paris to live in poverty with his supposed half-sister. Both pieces contain an amazingly awesome photo. the first is very colorful and bright, the second is very gloomy and almost apocalyptic - in sum, this is a real aesthetic celebration. Pola X is an exciting and totally unique movie.
