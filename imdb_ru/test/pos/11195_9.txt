Nuri Bilge Ceylan's 2002 film “Distant” (“Uzak”) - his third feature film (his first black-and-white film “Small City - Kasaba”) in 1997, is a significant step forward compared to his good, but erroneous the 1999 film “Clouds of May” (Mayis Sikintisi). An earlier film had potential, but it smelled of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst respects — plot holes and a wooden game from amateurs. The fact that the May Clouds succeeded at any level was evidence of Ceylan's talent as a budding director. Nevertheless, Distant is the appearance of Ceylan in the international arena as a great artist, possessing many of the same qualities as other great cinematographers, such as Ingmar Bergman (although his script is not as intense in dialogue, he is as thoughtful, and Bergman is not enough, the inclination to close-ups - his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors) and Yasujiro Odzu (whose piercing contemplation scenes Jeylan reconfigures). Most of the film takes place in the snowy winter of Istanbul (the fact that it is snowing in Turkey will probably surprise someone), which gives the film a certain Bergman atmosphere and also reminds one of the gloomy snowy urban images of Krzysztof Keslowski. Decalogue. Natural images evoke the best of Werner Herzog - because they tend to go to a beat or two longer than standard cinema theory dictates - which makes them even more memorable, while cityscapes range from Michelangelo Antonion's almost precision compositions Woody Allen's cultural hagiography — a single shot of a waterside bench is a direct quote (read steal) from Manhattan, except for the absence of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene, Ceylan also quotes a famous ship shot at the harbor from Tokyo Ozu history. Nevertheless, like all great artists, Ceylan makes his allocations with his own art, slightly modifying them and leaving them to meet the needs of his film. ” A film is remote, whose name is accompanied by a characteristic of the film and feelings that some viewers have for it, but it does not describe the film itself, since the scenes remain with him for a long time after the end of the film. Perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film appears when Mahmut pursues his ex-wife at the Istanbul airport and watches her with her new husband as they head for the plane, which will take her out of his life forever. As he watches her from afar, we see her catch her gaze as he watches her. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this movie. He retreats behind the column, and Nazan simply turns his head toward his future. Mahmut is her past, and she knows the best way to move on - just keep moving. Mahmut will never get it. Most often obtained such moments of insight into the essence of life. The fact that some viewers get the film, and that Ceylan gets their own creative abilities, shows that ignorance can teach as long as someone moves through it. Far makes, although it is only at the correct length.
