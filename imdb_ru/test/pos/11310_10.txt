“Medusa: Dare to be truthful” is an incredibly funny parody, which is a great addition to the original “Madonna: Truth or Daring”. Julie Brown's brilliant creation penetrates Madonna’s very interesting documentary (although it wasn’t completely bold, insightful, frank or truthful), accurate to the details, right down to packaging. I highly recommend this for Madonna fans, Julie Brown fans, or those who love a harsh and clever parody.
