In a sport that appreciates the quirkiness and treasures of its characters, one of the greatest of them since the 1930s was the jug Dizzy Dean. He was such a colorful personality that he was probably elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, unlike his statistics. After all, part of the story of Dean - this is the early end of his career. <br /> <br /> In St. Louis Pride, Dan Daly successfully captures Dizzy Dean's character, at least Dean, whom I remember. I'm not old enough to remember his pitching, but I remember how he aired the “Baseball game of the week” in the 1960s. Because it is also part of the story of Dean, to be a pioneer on the radio, and then on television. Now that the announcers are in the Hall of Fame, there is no doubt that Dizzy belongs there. <br /> <br /> Jerome German Dean was one of the Sharecropper children who had very little school education, but an amazing talent for throwing baseball at dazzling speed. In fact, he had a younger brother, Paul Dean, who himself was a pretty good pitcher. <br /> <br /> Richard Krenna plays Paul in this film, and this is one of his earliest film roles. In real life, Paul Dean was a quiet retiree whose career was also cut short by injuries. Because of this, Krenne is not allowed to work much. During the heyday of Dean, sports writers tried to connect Duffy's nickname with Paul, but this did not happen. <br /> <br /> Joan Drew, resting from the game, Western maidens in dresses and corsets in a cage - first-class wise, patient and understanding Patricia Nash, who met and married Dizzy when she played for Houston in the Texas League. <br /> <br /> In 1937, all the star games began for the National League. Having met Count Cleveland Averilla, Dean hit his leg with a blow on him. Refusing to listen to medical advice, Dean returned to the field too early. He broke his big toe and strained his arm. He was never the same pitcher, and his refusal to accept it is part of the story. <br /> <br /> If he had a career of, say, from ten to fifteen years, who knows what statistics on the submission he could collect. Dean was the last pitcher to win 30 games in 1934, and after Danny Maclaine (who was the character himself) did this in 1968, this has not happened since. <br /> <br /> Dean began broadcasting and Although he was not the first former player to go on the air, his colorful game descriptions made him an instant hit. He began broadcasting for the other St. Louis team, the Browns, and the Browns was a rather unhappy team that had nothing to cheer on. Dean became a star attraction there. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of Dean’s story is a problem that he faced due to a lack of education and a bright way to express himself on the air. This is a part of the story that I will not go into, but in the film it is worked out with tact and humility, and your eyes can be moistened if you are prone to sentimental. <br /> <br /> A good baseball movie, a real tribute to the American success story.
