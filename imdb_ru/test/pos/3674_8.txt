It is a pity that it will be released, as I would like to see the finished product! We saw the unfinished version before it came out. He loved all the characters and actors. Does anyone know if this is on the video yet? I would like to see it again. Definitely worth renting if it is not shown in the theater. It was hard for me to find him, because they renamed it.
