This is one of the early films of Barbara Stenwick, and he certainly has an unconventional theme. She makes money dancing with men in the ballroom. She really doesn't like work, but this is life. Her boyfriend looks like a pretty guy, but she’s also pursued by rich guy Ricardo Cortez. Well, after marriage, it turns out that her “good guy” is a robber, a weasel womanizer, and rich Cortez is a damn guy. By the end of the film, Barbara had already had enough, as any woman from SANE would come out of this terrible marriage. <br /> <br /> In the 1920s and early 30s, Hollywood did almost everything he wanted, and some of them. The films had themes or scenes that would surprise many today — such as nudity, adultery, and foul language. Although TEN CENTS A DANCE is not a blatant example of this morality, it does have a topic that would never have been resolved after the toughened Production Code was enacted since 1934. In a sense, Codex was great - in the end, parents do not need to worry about what their children saw in films (for example, nude in BEN HUR, 1925). However, it also tended to disinfect some films too much — and this method could not be made and approved because it tends to glorify the divorce — a serious no-no 1934 and after. This is really a shame, since I don’t think that TEN CENTS A DANCE was bad at all to discuss it - especially since the star (Barbara Stanwyk) was married to a stolen thief. However, to allow the film to end with the fact that she divorced him, and to marry a man who himself was twice divorced, simply could not be. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is interesting and thought-provoking. In addition, he was at a good pace and was suitable for his relatively short travel time. Look at this. <br /> <br /> For your information - Unfortunately, Ricardo Cortes really was NOT Hispanic, but changed his name because of possible prejudices, because he was Jewish. He was an excellent leading man of his time, but today everything is forgotten.
