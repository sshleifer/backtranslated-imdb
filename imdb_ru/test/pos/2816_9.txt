"Stripperella" is an animated series about a girl named Erotica Jones (voiced by Pamela Anderson) who lives a double life as a stripper in a gentleman's club known as "Tender Loin" and a sex crime fighter known as Striperella, who is also Agent 69, who works on the state organization. Like Stripperell, Erotica fights crime and evil forces, such as a plastic surgeon who gives women breast implants that either explode or make them fat, and Economist, a criminal who steals 99 cents from stores and forces his two minions to share a gun . The character and series creator is Stan Lee of Marvel Fame (and the creator of Spider-Man). <br /> <br /> At the end of June 2003, Spike TV (then known as New TNN) presented the premiere On Thursday evening, a block of three animated shows. These were the show "Ren and Stimpy: a cartoon for adults"; new adventures of classic children's shows of characters Rena and Stimpy for adults performed by the original creator John Crickfalusi “Gary the Rat”; the lawyer, who was turned into a rat the size of a man, in the main role Kelsey Grammar “Greetings” and “Fraser”, as well as “Striperella”; Adventures of a stripper who became a superhero, voiced by Pamela Anderson and created by Stan Lee. I remember all three premieres. I couldn't wait to see Rena and Stimpy, because I love the original show. I was a little disappointed. It was good, but it seemed that things had gone too far; there was little to see how they engaged in same-sex sex. Although Gary Rat was not a bad one, the best of these three was the Striperella. The animation was really good, it was a great introductory song, it had some good talent, and it was damn funny! The show was so stupid that I don't even know how to start explaining it! After four out of five weeks (if not a little less), the animation unit disappeared, which was strange, because I know that he got good grades and was advertised everywhere. I was disappointed to see Striperella, but after a few months I learned about new episodes that came out around 1:00. I only saw one, and although it was damn ridiculous, and I was glad to see the show after all this time, something seemed a little strange ... <br /> <br /> In the beginning it was short The launch of “Striperella” was excellent animation It was dark, capricious, realistic and somewhat sexy. Striperella's suit also looked good, the character was well-drawn. After a long break and during the rest of the episodes, the animation was completely different. Instead of a dark and realistic look, everything was really colorful and cartoon. Striperella got the biggest change, though. She used to have normal long hair, now she had more hair than Peggy Bundy (married with children), if possible. In addition, an eye mask actually shows her eyes; before he turned white, you saw that it was cool, as it was more superhero. In addition, the top of her costume looked like a vest with a collar, and her costume was dark blue; it changed to her costume being a blue-purple color, and her top costume was really cheesy compared to. In short, the show was caricatured and very foolish in advance, but in the second half it became more cartoony and fun, but nonetheless funny and hilarious, it became even more fun; for example, there was a later werewolf episode ... yes, a werewolf. <br /> <br /> In any case, instead of complaining about the changes in the middle of the series, “Stripperella” had only one season, but it was a very good show. As in the "Bordello of Blood", "The Tale from the Crypt", this can be very kindly, but very fun. Until you are a prude, you will constantly laugh at this show. I didn’t see every episode because I don’t have a DVD yet for two reasons: # 1. Paramount is released, and they have this spoiled policy of not including any extras in almost all the TV shows released, even if it was the whole show (I would like to see some comments commenting on the animation change and interviews with Pamela Anderson and Stan Lee) and No. 2. The amazing song Kid Rock was opened during the opening. Now I am not a fan of him, but this introduction sang was the theme for the show! If you are not going to pay to have any additional costs, at least pay to have the original intro song you choose. The show also had several interesting guest stars, such as John Lovitz in the role of Cheapo and Mark Hamil in the role of plastic surgery, which hates models. Also Tom Kenny (Spongebob) was on the show as the owner of a strip club in most episodes. Stan Lee has a cameo in one episode. <br /> <br /> The Breakdown: <br /> <br /> PROS: At first I looked great, FUNNY AS HELL, a very fun show, great voice talent for the most part, Chief Strogenoff (watch the show and watch some of things he does), and was easily the best of the three animated shows mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> CONS: the middle of a series of animation change and crappy DVD, described earlier. Besides the fact that sometimes humor may seem silly, I can not say anything special about this. <br /> <br /> Overall: Stripperella is my huge sense of guilt, and that’s just a shame. ran one season. It was a very funny, sexy, action-cult series that I hope will someday be on Adult Swim with an original intro and maybe give it another season like Family Guy. Check it out, even if it is on a lousy DVD. You will be silly to laugh. <br /> <br /> Rated TV-MA: rude and sexy humor and nudity, lead time: about 25 minutes per episode, rating: 9/10
