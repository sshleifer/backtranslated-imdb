I remember when skateboarding had a rebirth in the 70s. I asked my parents for money for a used skateboard from a friend. It was a piece of garbage, complete with clay wheels and everything else. I also remember reading Skateboarder Magazine and was completely impressed and scared by the Dogtown team. Skating has never become a lifestyle for me, but in some respects it has always been a part of my life, be it skating on boards or just skating with friends. <br /> <br /> This film is a brilliant documentary about the true birth of modern skating. Watching how this team turns skating from a boring flat hobby that turned into a vertical lifestyle, in which I sat with a relaxed jaw for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly enough for this film there are still enough videos from this period, and thank God for that. Frames are brilliant. It gave me the feeling of watching Buster Keaton’s movie: since I’ve seen some stunts that Keaton has repeated countless times in other films, but when you come back and see the first person who did this trick, it’s amazing that they were the first to try it successfully, but they survived it and made it seem easy. This is the feeling that this film gave me. Yes, I already saw people riding in the pools, but watching FIRST skating in the pools and inventing tricks that eventually became the basis of modern skating is like watching the front of a house fall on Keaton, leaving him safe in the frame window. It is absolutely wonderful to look at something that has never been tested before, but since then almost everyone has tried it. <br /> <br /> This movie is great for watching and incredible for listening. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a movie. This is a movie that people will like, whether they like skating or not. I talked with several of my friends who made their girlfriends watch this film after a strong protest, and they all said that their friends were mesmerized by the end of the film and loved it as much as they did. <br /> <br /> With regard to the previous comments on this board, which complain that the film is too self-praising, I think this is an unfair humiliation. I liked to see how these guys are excited about their past. They created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever. They have the right to pat their backs. They were stars for what they loved to do. Most of these guys / girls never achieved the overwhelming success that Tony Hawk is using today, but this kind of success was beyond the reach of skaters. Of course, they had some success, but more importantly, they were able to live life by doing what they love to do, and, as we see at the end, almost all of them still surf, skate or surf / skating. industry. Who among us can say that we were able to live our lives and succeed by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do? They can. I take off my hat to Dogtaun and Z-Boys for the fact that they themselves have changed the world of skateboarding forever.
