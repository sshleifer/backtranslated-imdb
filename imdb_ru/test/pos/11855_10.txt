Intense, funny, witty and, moreover, a social comedy about the ways of meeting with adults and its results - good or bad. Maura and Nicholson are engaged in a couple two months after the wedding, when a strange engagement event causes Nicholson to rethink the relationship and start meeting with other people so that she does not feel so intact when it comes to sexual experience. Nicholson and their cohorts. Very clever and necessary at this time clumsy, indulgent comedies, while it contains your usual various comedic, sexy and frustrated characters (especially Charles as a sexually frustrated sex villain ... very annoying) who even seem to have the right a feeling for this heart was a comment. <br /> <br /> The film goes the way it should be watched in our days, showing that guys are sensitive in their soul and have a moral. Most of the male characters are moralistic, straight eyes, and the woman is a new-faced street tramp who will stop at nothing to get pleasure. Guys will be grateful for a message made for guys with dignity, but it's easy to assume that most men who REALLY see this movie will use his message about male sensitivity to hide any flaw or trait that a woman may find offensive. However, the letter formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for their male roles, especially More, Richter, and to find a director in a comedy as a seller! <br /> <br /> Women are much more erratic, as they only talk about pleasure and what it feels like ... with someone else. They have friendly features, although they are covered with images of sexy kittens. Very funny stuff. <br /> <br /> At another level, the film combines different relationships. Richter meets with an underlined divorce (a VERY MUCH and noteworthy performance by the always trustworthy Helen Slater) named Penelope, who divorced her son, who hates her because she broke up with her father. As these two go deeper into relationships, there is a human interest and both comedy and the tragedy of divorce are being studied and started anew. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, Mohr and Nicholson began to think deeply about what would happen next, and it depended on what they had learned about each other and themselves to decide what would come next. It becomes pertinent and dramatic at the right time. <br /> <br /> Vallodorsky's direction is imitated very well when characters learn to deal with each other after all that has happened ... with the right ending. <br /> <br /> In general, this film should have been released all over the country, and I have to hope that it will receive Academy Awards ... maybe Helen Slater can finally get the recognition she deserves. Be that as it may, this film will not miss a single hit, give him everything you got in the romantic sexual farce, very mature and aesthetically pleasing. <br /> <br /> Great movie!
