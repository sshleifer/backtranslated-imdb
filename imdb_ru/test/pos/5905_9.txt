Don't be fooled by the nostalgic aura that surrounds Mon oncle Antoine, because, like in the best Canadian films, darkness lurks just below the surface. <br /> <br /> The story, presumably in the countryside of Quebec in the 1940s, talks about the young Benoit’s developing mind when he learns to cope with both sexuality and death. <br /> <br /> The film’s appearance is amazing, especially considering that a high proportion of the general public’s criticism of Canadian cinema surrounds aesthetics. In addition, the humble Benoit is a seductive protagonist for the audience, looking at his corrupting community with new innocent eyes. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading Jim Lich's critical essay about the film in Canada's Best Features for anyone who wants to put the film in a historical context and also analyzes the form of the film. Definitely check it out.
