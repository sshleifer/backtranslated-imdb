This is one of my favorite books, and I remember watching this series and loved it very much. Unfortunately, I have never seen it repeated or able to get on a DVD, but it had such an impact that I never forgot about it. <br /> <br /> The main characters were perfect for the roles, especially the wonderful Brian Brown, and although the scenes in Australia did not fully fit the book, at least they were there, unlike the version of the film with Virginia McKenna, who missed this role. <br /> <br /> I agree that Gordon Jackson’s character in “Strechen” is completely different from the book, but he is still excellent. For your information "MOLEY75", "Strawn" is the Gaelic pronunciation of "Strachan".
