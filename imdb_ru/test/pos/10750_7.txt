This film is considered controversial today, but still it is very funny. Racial stereotypes are made in terms of humor, not hate. This film shoots and shows how corrupt politicians were in the early 1930s. This film proves that it began before the 1970s and after, when it accelerated in the United States. Lloyd is still in its typical genre, although its character has grown in China. <br /> <br /> In this case, “Cat's paws” is a person who is running for political office, but is used by an established political machine to advance his agenda. In other words, they think this guy (Lloyd) is harmless when running for office. Then, when he is elected, he surprises them. <br /> <br /> The same theme is used later in the James Stewarts film when Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Stewarts is more famous and has a stronger message. This film is more intelligent and thin, which are trademarks of Harold Lloyd. <br /> <br /> There is still the heart of a romantic comedy hidden behind the front of the film, but today's mainstream audience will still appreciate political humor, and the ending is absolutely priceless. I wish someone could beat the current political system in this way. I was surprised how much I liked this film, and I found myself wanting Harold to do it more in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> At least we have this one. I think the person who is most quoted in the film is fictional Lin Po. I always thought Confucius was wise, but this one makes me believe that China’s wisdom is not limited to it and is a huge comedy field that Lloyd got in this film.
