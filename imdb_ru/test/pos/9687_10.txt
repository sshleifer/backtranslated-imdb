If you are a fan of video Jackass, Viva La Bam or CKY, then you already know what you need. But this is one of those rare cases where the sequel is better than the original! And the man makes this film an unbearable blow. But I mean it in a good way. This is the same type of deadly, heartbreaking madness that we all know and love and expect from Bam, Knoxville and Co. But this time with more laughter than ever before! With Johnny Knoxville's insane tolerance for pain, Bam Margera's love of stalking his friends / family and Steve-Oh's blunt factor, you have a damn funny movie. Raised bar for tricks, parodies and general chaos of the Jackass team. Donkey 3? It is doubtful because it is almost impossible to improve perfection.
