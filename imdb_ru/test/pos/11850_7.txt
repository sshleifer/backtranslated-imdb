Plot: Ed and Alice are engaged. They live together and live a boring life. He slept before meeting with Alice. She has much less experience. She decides that she needs to sleep before getting married. He very reluctantly agrees that they should meet other people for some time. <br /> <br /> At first he is not very passionate about it. His wild days are over, and he is simply pleased. Until one day Alice comes back and tells him that she was sorting out with some random guy; which of course begins to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a BAD idea that causes extreme tension in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Good movie. You can see a train wreck approaching, but still good. <br /> <br /> Worth renting.
