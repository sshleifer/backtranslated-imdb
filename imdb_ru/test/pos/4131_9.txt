Gary Busey is great in this musical biography. Great singing and great soundtrack. The Buddy Holly Story is a much better movie than La Bamba. From reading other comments there may be some historical inaccuracies. Despite this, this is a funny movie about listening and a good idea about Buddy Holly's music.
