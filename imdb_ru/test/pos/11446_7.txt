"Night of the Demons" - much more than ANY other film of that period, is a brainless and incredibly pleasant horror panic. It’s a casual fun with a lot of unpleasant makeup effects, great looking (and excited) teenagers and amazing cliché elements. A group of party animals led by alternative Angela is sent to the celebration of Halloween in an abandoned funeral home, which carries a terrible urban legend. Everything starts in a typical and “innocent” way with dancing, drinking and casual flirting between young people who cannot keep their hormones under control, but rather soon the bloodthirsty demon takes possession of the mistress. In the most ingenious way that you have ever seen, the rest of the actors are viciously killed only to return as disgusting creatures scouring blood. What makes this film better than most of the raw horror films of the 80s finds a good balance between frivolous camp and atmospheric horror. Some of the sequences are really creepy, and the funeral home furnishings provide the Night of the Demons with an excellent tone. Directed by Tenney makes great use of the scenery (coffins, crematorium, endless dark corridors ??) and his young enthusiastic actors obviously love what they are involved in. Stunning effects of make-up by a whole team of artists and designers Of course, the obvious aspects of love and horror fanatics will surely fall in love with a large number of severed limbs, protruding eyes and fragmented skulls! The final highlight however is Linnie Quigley's ploy with fading lipstick! This nympho stuck a whole tube of lipstick in the nipple and continues to kill sex! Awesome! The Night of the Demons received two sequels during the 90s, and although they are definitely worth checking out, they are more focused on comedy than chills.
