"Are you alone in the house?" dates back to cable television, when networks sought to offer an alternative to popular television shows. This is a well-made fighter with a talented cast and credible situations. Kathleen Beller plays a high school student who receives a series of threatening letters. Everyone seems to think that this is just a joke, but Beller is really scared. Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Beller's parents, Ellen Travolta (John's sister) is the principal, and Dennis Quaid plays one of his earliest roles as a cheeky rich child. This is a competent chiller with a still relevant social message. Beller is beautiful - if you are 30 years old or more, you remember that she was very popular with young people. Blythe Danner, whom I usually don't like, gives a really exciting presentation. Good little movie.
