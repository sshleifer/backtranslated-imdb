Oz, this is one of the most amazing and exciting television events in history. <br /> <br /> Having caught this on SBS, I was skeptical at first, however, having finished the 4th season, I, unfortunately, know that this brilliant show is nearing its end (6 seasons), and yet Iâ€™ve all I still can not get enough OZ. <br /> <br /> You want something that pushes your feelings and stomach to the limit ... Oz meets all the requirements, hands down. <br /> <br /> These are not children's things, guys, this is cruel, cruel and not cute. Yes, this is an experimental unit in a high-security prison. <br /> <br /> Oz Tom Fontana is great in all the right departments, actors, screenwriters and directors. <br /> <br /> The Oz HBO site is also highly recommended, for beginners, for information on this series. It was the first hourly show created by HBO, and it proves what kind of masterpiece it is and what others will follow. <br /> <br /> Thanks, HBO
