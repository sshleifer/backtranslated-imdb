It was one of the worst episodes of Colombo that I have ever seen, however I am only in the second season. <br /> <br /> Colomboâ€™s typical performances are both fun and annoying. His cigar ash, which brought him trouble, was seen before, and the moment when he always identifies himself with the killer - in this case, with cooking - the scene on the television cooking show diverts itself from the main theme. <br /> <They also did not explain why the brother cut off part of the mixer wires at the beginning of the show. The reason has never been explained, nor has it served any purpose. But most of all I did not like the death of the bride. This has never been explained, and this is the main reason why I put this episode so low.
