Although I saw this film in Korea, in Korean, and therefore did not understand the language, the images most certainly speak more than enough. From what I can do from this, this is the story: two excellent sword fighters become friends in the service of the king. One of them is against the ways of the king and begins to kill important people. Another must track him down. This film is visually gorgeous. The sword fight is gorgeous. And the film has an exciting end. I just hope that this film will be sold to western moviegoers. And to be released on DVD, of course.
