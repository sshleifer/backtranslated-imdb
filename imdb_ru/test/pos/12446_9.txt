I did it too. When I first saw the band, I immediately dropped them, not even listening to music. Then one day, out of pure curiosity, I bought a CD and fell in love with it. So, I bought a video. hold on to your kids dinner, this is not going to be pretty! the video was excellent - a great opportunity to hear the music, watch some promotional videos and get to know the band ... although I * still * don't know how they can wear these masks all the time! A must for all fans of the group, and fans of alternative music in general
