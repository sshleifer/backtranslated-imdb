This film is fascinating and complex, but it retains a simple beauty. Our two characters get together, sharing the basis of curiosity and loneliness, but this is a springboard for studying these people, their lifestyles and the past that support this. <br /> The two main actors (Bol, Brandryge) were at that moment like any two actors I have ever seen. 100% believable they carry the audience, seemingly without much effort, into their own world. The impeccable action of the actors in conjunction with Behardâ€™s beautiful, realistic dialogue and his true leadership leads the plot to an exciting and touching ending. This film is visually pleasing, increasing the intensity of the plot. The soundtrack serenades the viewer, calming and at the same time pulling out the emotional content of the film. I believe that this project is nothing but a masterpiece. intriguing.intense.
