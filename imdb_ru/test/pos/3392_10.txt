Even for a 17-year-old student who loves history and caught the emotions and excitement in the children's years of this series, his release on DVD was a blessing for all ages. North and South is a series about friendship, love, honor ... You name your list of feelings that you get from watching this series. I still remember how I first saw the series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I think, wow, this looks exciting. Unfortunately, I have never had the opportunity to see one or two books on television in the Netherlands. When the third book aired on the late evening show in the Netherlands in the summer of 2004, I just knew that I should see two other episodes. As far as I know, the third book was a big disappointment. Well, since I saw Book 1 on DVD, I must say that so far this is the best of all 3 books. For all young people who just watch such fantastic films as “The Patriot” “About America for Freedom”, there is a more realistic look to see them here .....
