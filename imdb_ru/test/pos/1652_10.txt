Fantastic movie! One of the best movies about the film noir. The bad guys, the bad girls, the robbery of the gem, the perverted moral, the kidnapping, everything is here. Jean Serva has a face that could make Bogart proud, and the rest of the cast is full of actors who seem to know that they need something good. Get popcorn and have a great time.
