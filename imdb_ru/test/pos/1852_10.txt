My two daughters (aged 11 and 13) and I was fortunate enough to watch the show last night. We were all pleasantly surprised to see how interesting and funny this film was. David Duchovny was very attractive, as he was the leader, and Minnie Driver showed her, as a rule, a decent game. Some scenes are ridiculous - especially one scene that Minnie Driver took off with her “transplantologist” Doni. I liked the fact that it was a film that I could watch with my children, and I was not embarrassed by any scene at all. Everyone in the cinema was laughing and having fun. Thumbs up Bonnie Hunt!
