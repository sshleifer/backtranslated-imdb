We went to the cinema in anticipation of a large budget and got an art house. The film was projected in digital form on two-thirds of the screen with the classic oblique sides of digital projection and had a limited stereo soundtrack, which was spent on cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was the same old historical content that we all saw before, but carefully cleaned to prevent nausea of ​​the audience. Live action scenes, however small they were, were constantly used in the classic documentary style, which annoyed after a while. <br /> <br /> I was somewhat surprised that only 4 people came to watch it, probably the rest knew something we did not know. <br /> <br /> I suspect that the producers made the film to recognize the ninetieth anniversary of Gallipoli. I have to ask the question if they should have been worried. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten for trying and out of respect for ANZAC.
