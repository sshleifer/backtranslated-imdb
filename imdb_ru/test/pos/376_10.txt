I have never seen this in the theater; my second preview was on a big DVD screen tonight, unlike the old VHS tape from the rental. <br /> <br /> Sauce for its time, and I am sure that the Heys code has been transferred to the limit. <br /> <br /> Pallet Hitch is a gameplay between two combatants. And yes, if Guy immediately calls the police on Bruno, the film will be 63 minutes shorter, hello people, you always make the best or most logical choice. How many times have you been in the shoes of any person and made the right choice? For the love of God, this is called a poetic license. However, when Guy sees the situation in which he finds himself, he takes it upon himself to correct it. He does not ask for help and does not lie to his future wife. Her defense protects him from the final show, and Bruno feels that he needs to play another card. <br /> <br /> For a policeman who shoots an innocent person in the days before the camera and before the rules of engagement, this kind of thing happened. In the world after Rodney King, the presidential candidate supported the police by sending 43 bullets to an unarmed person. If you have not seen or witnessed the outrageous police behavior of your blind or have applied to the academy. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie ... <br /> <br /> Go and watch it. Try to put on a filter after World War II and imagine that you see a wonderful unknown film, as many did at that time for the first time, and I am sure that it has been copied since then, but you look at one of the sources of inspiration for by this.
