Tia Carrere was the reason why I decided to watch this film, since neither the title nor the cover would be enough to make me spend my time and money on this film ?? which shows me and everyone that the DVD should not be judged by its cover. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** The film seemed cool to me, and the moment is not going anywhere ?? Paul Faber's awkwardness (Zack Orta) around girls who are too embarrassed to look, and the fringe on the otherwise attractive Kirsten Beck (like Alexondra Lee), too school to look at. Where was it really fashionable in 1995? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Vicky Muller (Tia Carrere) and Todd Bumer (Jason London) was terrible from the very beginning! That first meeting across the lake ?? magically. What a wonderful coincidence they must meet again, since he behaved like a complete idiot (“Boomer, with two Oh, like an idiot ??”) before Alexondra. It is a pity that we, as spectators, knew who Vicky Muller really was. (Well, the name really gave it away, didn't it?) <br /> <br /> What really surprised me was the acting. Especially in the scene where Vicki gives Todd a metal version of his alter ego (dog character) in a small white jewel box. Did the actors really manage to recreate the tingling sensation of the first kiss ?? point of no return for Todd and Vicky. It’s a pity that the film ends up focusing (after moving with Todd’s father at Harvard) to reuniting with his friends. Could I introduce a whole new movie ?? after wiki to new york ?? there must be a good university of arts that Todd could attend?!? <br /> <br /> However, the film that does what we want Hollywood to: entertain us throughout the film. Has anyone else noticed how none of the lovers are happy in this film? Todd's mother is a little insane (by phone 24/7), his dad does not find her attractive (anymore?) Is Todd's teacher clearly disappointed with his wife, and vice versa ?? Todd himself enters a surprisingly erotic and bold relationship that, no matter how good they were, it would be really difficult to maintain (age difference, difference in maturity, etc.), And Alexondra and Zak do not get together, because Alexandon not mature enough to handle it. relationship (-> her reaction to a condom, cheating, Zack's successes, etc., are all very immature and often include an escape), and Zack himself, the poor guy ?? Too much best friend / like brother-guy to cope with even Alexondra. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind a good movie though! I gave him 8/10. The brilliant performance of the actors - who bring the script to life.
