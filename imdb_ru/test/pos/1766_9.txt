I was surprised, “Once More, My Darling”, did not get enough votes (at the time of this writing) for the “user rating”. This is a “disgusting” comedy that I have enjoyed many times over the years. The mission of Robert Montgomery puts him in very unbelievable situations, and he is just the man for this job. He keeps his trademark "confused" look throughout the film and in hysterics too. Ann Blyth plays his premature / eccentric pursuer, which involves relationships that do not exist. Her character is strange enough to justify the unknowing nickname "Killer", but remains sweet and pleasant. <br /> <br /> Among the oversaturated “B” films of the late 1940s and 1950s, “Once again, my dear,” this is an outstanding one.
