The wide and still impressive early days Talkie Western; other modern films in the same vein include Covered Wagon (1923), IRON HORSE (1924) and CIMARRON (1931) ?? nothing of what I watched, although I have the last one on VHS. It was simultaneously shot in full-screen format “Standard” and in an experimental widescreen process called “Splendor”, but only the first was released on the bare DVD Fox; One can only guess how it would look more broadly, but careful framing ?? not to mention great cinematography ?? fairly obvious even in the "standard" version. <br /> <br /> Young John Wayne is surprisingly in the lead (a role that, however, did not lead to expected fame, as he languished in 'B' westerns for most of the next decade before John Ford came to the rescue with STAGECOACH [1939]!); In any case, he and Margaret Churchill (from the DRAWLA [1936]) make up a good pair ?? despite its somewhat tedious nature. Supporting characters include various types of actions: a veteran westerner, an assistant in comics (with a mouthful!), Strong and awkward villain (played by Tyrone Power Sr.!), His two slimy cohorts (Mexican) and southerner, who also plays the role of Wayne's rival for Churchill's hand), etc. Among the members of the van squad there is also a timid Swede (full of optimism about the promised land, but constantly repressed by his angry mother - in law), and then Wayne regularly Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> Episodic story turns into a series of alternately Cornball, lyrical and action-vignettes ?? as we see the alleged settlers fighting the elements, the Indians, and themselves; the film, however, has a completely genuine feeling for it, which smooths out its essentially outdated and static quality. Also, is editing somewhat changeable (especially in the second half) ?? It is not surprising, because the release of the film on DVD lasts only 108 minutes against the full 158-minute version of "Splendor"!
