This film was a gift - the evening proposal was completely unexpected - so, unlike other reviewers, I did not have any preconceived opinions. I was glued to my place, as the film slowly dictated its own rhythm, its own unfolding. I was drawn to acknowledge my own deep love and humanity, because I wanted “good” to triumph, but I also had to ironically admit that sometimes I was on the side of the “bad” guys. The film is quite beautiful - the word "elegiac" comes to mind, and this is not only because the film begins and ends in an elegy. For me, the film is far from depression or confrontation, and it recognizes deep suffering - and then, by its cyclical nature - with births and revivals, as well as death - the film notes the fact that, quoting an Australian poet, ". Oh gods, I feel that I have just written a love letter for this film - but it is. Hola!
