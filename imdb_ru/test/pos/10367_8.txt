Richard Abernathy, a very rich man, died, and his relatives gathered for his funeral. The younger sister of Abernati Cora Galaccio is included in the funeral party. Although no one from the family has seen Cora for at least 20 years, they all agree that Cora has always been a little different. Therefore, when Cora says something about the murder of Abemetia, the majority laughs at this as Kora's eccentricity. But someone clearly takes Kora seriously. The next day, Cora was found dead in her bed, and she was severely beaten. Is there a connection between the two deaths? Hercules Poirot must find the killer. <br /> <br /> After the funeral - one of the most successful episodes from the entire Poirot series. I have always been a fan of this particular book by Agatha Christie, and, as I recall, the film is as true to Christieâ€™s original material as any part of Poirot. The mystery is top notch with lots of clues, suspects and red herrings. And, as I wrote earlier, I always liked the story of Christie, in which Hercule Poirot gathers everyone in the living room for final disclosure. It may be old-fashioned, but I like it so much. Going beyond the plot, technically and artistically After the funeral remains the winner. The sets, editing, directing and cinematography are as good as in one of these films. The game is equally impressive. I expected David Suchet to perform pleasantly in the role of Poirot, and he does not disappoint here. The rest of the cast is just as strong with Monica Dolan, giving a particularly remarkable performance. In addition to the slight hype with a fast fiery way of representing characters, I have no special complaints. This is a good show around.
