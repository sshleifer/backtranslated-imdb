Well, I've watched this movie for over 25 years, and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. This is definitely one of the most unique films ever made. <br /> <br /> I still think that Martin Sheen was also “removed” from advertising. He dominates the film, but receives fewer bills than Marlon Brando, who appears only in the last 30 minutes of this 2-hour 17-minute film (theatrical version). How unfair is that? <br /> <br /> Shin is great, especially his narration that sounds everywhere. This is one of the best narratives, if not the best I've ever heard in movies. His voice simply haunts when he connects his thoughts in this incredible, nightmare-like adventure. I will never stop appreciating his work in this film. <br /> <br /> Another thing that has amazed me in a film over the years is the number of memorable scenes that I never forgot, such as .... .. <br /> <br /> Sheen loses him in his hotel room in the first scene of the film; Robert Duval and the completely inappropriate scenes of surfing, and then the ensuing attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music breaking free from helicopters; Playboy bunny entertains the troops; Frederick Forrest was thrilled to see a tiger in the jungle; strange scenes on a long boat ride; The appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper welcomes the team in Cambodia, and then the strange character of Brando. This continues in weird scenes. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that I liked everything. No, there are some very unpleasant scenes, such as a scene in which a bull is cut in half (I can no longer watch this), an innocent family is killed on a small boat by a young, chopped off team of Tire, and the crew are sometimes too stupid. In addition, there is a huge amount of profanity caused by too many profanity words. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of good and a lot of bad for almost everyone who watches this movie. One thing is certain: this is a movie that you will remember!
