The story of Tom Garner begins with his grand funeral and is told through a series of exquisite memories told by his faithful lifelong friend Henry. Henry and his wife are arguing whether Tom was a great man and a genius or a completely useless villain. The film is beautifully written, shot and filmed, and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Tom was a fabulously wealthy and successful owner of a large railway, dominated on his board of directors and his competitors, terrorizing his employees, slaughtering strikers. Tom Sally's ambitious wife was responsible for all of Tom's success. When he met her, he was illiterate and fully satisfied with his work as a traveler on the railway. Sally teaches him to read and takes over work on the tracker, and Tom goes to school. He begins to gradually climb the hierarchy of railways until he becomes president. <br /> <br /> But when Tom becomes a business magnate, his marriage to Sally gradually falls apart. His spoiled son despises him, and he comes in contact with a much younger woman (aptly named Eve) with predictably disastrous consequences. In his business life, Tom is a complete success; in his personal life there was a catastrophic failure. Just as the figure of Hirst in Citizen Kane, Tom symbolizes the best and the worst in the capitalist system. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy is great in the role of Tom Garner, and the business scenes seem authentic. Colleen Moore is as good as Sally; both of them are aging in the history of several generations. The film was written by Preston Sturges, but it is no different from the worm comics that Sturges became famous for.
