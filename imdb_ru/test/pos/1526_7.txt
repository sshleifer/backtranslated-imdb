The good news is that the director is reportedly committed to the cause of Amnesty International and is keen to convey a strong message about freedom of expression and the evil of oppression. The plot is clearly original, and the actors are two of my absolute favorites. Not very good news: “original” is not a buzzword when visiting movie or video stores. In addition, well-known critics, such as Mr. Maltin and Roger Ebert, rejected the film as a truly unsuccessful attempt to transform the play from stage to cinematic form. If I remember correctly, the name is taken from a fairy tale written by the character Stowe, and this made it possible for a disruptive and suspicious person in a fictional place where the story takes place. Her dreams are dangerous for the government, represented here by Rickman as an intense, manipulative investigator. Since these two people are practically the only ones that appear in the film as a whole, the director will have the real task of keeping the viewer's attention. In the end, I found it all fascinating. Not perfect, and definitely not for everyone, but useful. It is not as close to the masterpiece as Kislovsky’s Short Film about the Murder, or as easy as The Walking Dead. But if you like these films or any of the political thrillers of Costa Gavra, you can also rate this movie. Just do not expect any obvious sermons or sequences of actions.
