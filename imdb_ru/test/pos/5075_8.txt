Most of this political thriller is presented mainly as an ordinary film about the mill with a slightly better development of many of the main characters, which was highly valued, until the BIG turn and the powerful climax that resembled the turns experienced in “The Silence of the Lambs”. or "The Sixth Sense." Reese Witherspoon as the distraught wife of a missing Egyptian husband and Igal Naor as a powerful investigator offer strong speeches. Unfortunately, Jake Gyllenhaal is given a more two-dimensional character, and he has to contend with the stereotypical view of the emotionally torn CIA analyst, which has already been presented in other films many times. In the beginning, there was a beautiful scene with an explosion that resembles the scene at the end of “Saving Private Ryan”, a quiet scene that was used so effectively to reflect one of the consequences of the violence. The scenario also provides a bit more outlook on the “enemy” mindset, but still does not give the audience a really great understanding, again allowing the audience to wallow in stereotypical characteristics. Cinematography and photography are also somewhat disappointing, because unlike Jarhead or Blackhawk Down, there is no clear, crude intuitive presentation that doesn’t allow viewers to actually be in the film, there is a certain distance that keeps the audience from understanding the intensity of emotions occurring on the screen. However, in general, the film buys itself towards the end, offering the audience a balanced look at the difficulty of using reproduction in the United States and the possible complications and consequences that may arise from its use. Eight out of ten stars.
