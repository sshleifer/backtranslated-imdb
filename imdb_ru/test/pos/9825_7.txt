I read other comments here about this movie before watching it. If you read them, you will know that they are almost all negative. I really don't get it. I admit that this is too long (it takes about half an hour to speed it up). Music is often inappropriate. But for this to be quite strong performances of Ford and Thomas. For all his movie star glory, I forgot that Harrison Ford can really act! This role of the person who identified himself based on lies is remarkable. I think it’s quite plausible that he needs all the details that he can get so that he can see what was real and what was deception. Thomas is always beautiful, and this is no exception. Her initial denial, which leads to confusion, and then to inner peace, is enormous. This film will never be on someone’s list of great films, but it’s not all that bad. I'm glad I waited to see it on video, but it costs 3 or 4 dollars.
