I have to keep Barney drilling my head every day; well .. i think there must be reasons. Firstly, I am convinced that our children are not fools, they are just children, but they know (my son and a half years "chooses" what to see), which is pleasant or disgusting. Have you seen the news? Do you think your children should know reality as it is? Maybe, maybe not; we (adults) are responsible for what we want for our children and what to teach them. The film drug dealers? news of the massacres in the middle east? Of course, children should know that there is real life, but ... they are children; let's spare them. What do you want for them? If you want the children to train on weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor, go ahead, impose deadly weapons on them, kill Bill, any anime manga, tell them that Santa Claus is a lecher who enters the pipe directly to break them. I want illusions for my son (don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that Barney and Friends are the best; in fact, there are many flaws in the series, I read other comments and agree with the majority); maybe happiness consists of dreams or illusions. At the very least, I want to teach him to grow WITHOUT FEAR, BUT CAUTION, who learns to think and believe that all are not serial killers or hijackers whom they deserve to grow. At least he may be a little happy with his own dreams. So, parents, do not underestimate their children; they know what they want.
