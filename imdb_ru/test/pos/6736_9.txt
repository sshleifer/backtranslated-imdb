Blythe Dunner and Judith Ivy perform wonderful performances here when Jonathan Silverman and Eugene talk about their lives in Brighton Beach in 1937. <br /> <br /> What makes a movie so good is the relationship between the characters against the backdrop of extremely remarkable family values. <br /> <br /> Bob Dischie had a wonderful opportunity to become the father of the clan. He acts with restraint, but convincingly, as the patriarch of the family. <br /> <br /> His sons, played by Jonathan Silverman and Brian Dillinger, are incredible. There are certain scenes when Silverman skates or jumps where I am reminded of Jerry Lewis. <br /> <br /> As for Danner and Ivy, they are also wonderful. Their manners, intonation and idealism of Jewish culture are perfectly realized by them. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great. Beautiful Brighton in 1937! Despite the fact that the inevitability of war loomed, the film is rich in many of the typical problems that families faced during that period. In a sense, you don't have to be a Jew in order to experience what your family is going through. <br /> <br /> Be sure to look at the nostalgic lovers and those of us who so strongly believe in family values.
