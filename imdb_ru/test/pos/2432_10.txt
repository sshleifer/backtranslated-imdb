This film is a very pleasant respect for Bogart and other detective films of the past. Robert Sacchi does it like the gods, and Michelle Phillips is really timeless beauty, like Gena Anastasia. <br /> <br /> However, the most remarkable part of this film is the longest belly dance scene ever created in a Hollywood film. One famous professional instructor noted that nothing else in the movie is suitable for dance excitement. <br /> <br /> The scene, which eventually becomes an important part of the plot, takes place in a magnificently beautiful Middle Eastern nightclub and is mesmerizing in all respects. Pulsating music, swirling curtains and ringless finger cymbals, undulating waves and beautiful costumes - and an unexpected twist with the seductive Sybil Dunning - create tension and excitement to the very end. <br /> <br /> Three talented and beautiful professional dancers at the nightclub have been headed by an exotic brunette beauty Kamala Almanzar, one of the leading dancers in the United States since the mid-1970s. Famous Armenian musician Guy Chokuryan picked her up for traveling along the road with his orchestra. Guy's Ensemble is a live band with which dancers perform on stage. If you watch the trailer on this site, you will see a glimpse of Kamala (playing fingers on cymbals for Sybil Dunning). <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a fan of belly dancing, you will be after watching this movie, and if you are a fan, after repeated viewing it feels very good.
