Vasily Pichul's film “The Little Faith” of 1988 “Little Faith”, which is a grandiose presentation of the destruction of family values ​​and human dignity after Soviet communism, is a landmark film of contemporary Russian cinema. Pichula’s brutal drama marks a strong departure from the ideas of sanitized idealism promoted during the Soviet era (as in Aleksandrov’s circus), defiantly putting the social chaos of its time into the center of public attention. The modern Ukrainian environment further enhances the effect, firstly, due to the immediacy of the film and its time, secondly, through the use of locale, which fights not only for identity instead of the Soviet system, but also as a nation different from Russian idioms. which dominated the USSR <br /> <br /> Vera, the main character and protagonist of the film, is a rebellious teenage girl with a “dysfunctional” family, in which there is a lot of drunken father and a caring mother. Having abandoned his potential handsome Andrew, Vera begins destructive (and especially sexual) relations with a college student named Sergei. Despite the hostility of her parents to lazy Sergey, and despite Sergey’s rude contempt for her parents, he moved to their cramped apartment. Tension escalates, until the father of Faith drunkenly stabs Sergei. Faith must decide whether she will remain faithful to her unbearable family, indicating that her father acted in self-defense, or will continue to support and protect the dismissed Sergey. <br /> <br /> Little Vera masterfully conveys and conveys the inevitable void left in public life after the collapse of communism. The sexual aggressiveness of the film (it was the first film to demonstrate explicit sex), combined with the unrelenting view of social reality (a distinct difference from socialist realism, which Stalin demanded) effectively opposed the conditions of the former Soviet life. However, the most interesting was the public reception. While many people wrote letters hating the director and the star, the film was incredibly popular. Here the double-edged nature of “film as social criticism” is manifested: if done correctly, the film will create discomfort for the audience. Since there is no simple solution, some viewers will hate the film and directors for raising the issue. Many films come to mind as somewhat comparable in this respect: “Children of Larry Clark,” “Gammo Harmony Korin,” even such popular films as John Hughes’s Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to viewers for whom the prospect of a nearly two-hour tormenting internal conflict and social miasm is not too scary. The film is absolutely beautiful and incredibly complex. Despite the difficulties of watching the film, some moments in it are deeply beautiful. Of course, the socio-historical and cultural significance of the film cannot be overlooked, and in fact is an even more compelling reason to watch this film.
