I think some others have already commented on this film, but I liked it so much that I just wanted to say how good the film is. I gave him a rating of 9 out of 10. It did not get 10 because it is a very slow start. I was almost gone, but glad I didn't. Hold on, it's worth it. <br /> <br /> This is primarily a film about relationships: deception, trust and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Lange and Jason Robards In this film, everyone is looking for a job. <br /> <br /> Jason Robards, who lives on a farm in the Midwest, is a farmer whose grandfather first settled there. Jason's character is aging, and he decides to create a trust dividing thousands of acres of farmland between his three adult daughters. It was then that the plot of this film really begins to prepare. <br /> <br /> The sisters are turning against each other because of misunderstanding, and not because of greed on the ground. They also make some discoveries about each other's childhood and their marriages, including adultery, while the father becomes increasingly offensive, demanding, and paranoid - until the awful truth about everyone finally boils away. <br /> <br /> This film really came to me emotionally, I got angry with some of the characters, and I felt sad. I felt their pain because of the great performances. <br /> <br /> The ending was a bit unexpected for me, but according to the height of the characters. <br /> <br />
