I first saw this film in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when he was fifteen years old. I loved it then and still do. The cast is great - in those days, the actors acted “naturally” and you “felt” them in their respective roles. “Glossy” film of that period - the relations in it are still relevant for the modern world, but now the sex is at the same level, women will not or should not allow the type of treatment that was in the past. The soundtrack music is great, and it's very nice that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January 2005. Scenes of pity were cut before the exit - even in two hours you want more! I signed up for Amazon for DVD (they now have a special page). Watching this movie in CinemaScope after forty-six years of panning and scanning will be great. Twentieth Century Fox, please look into the catalogers of the fifties CinemaScope DVDs - there is a very large market. I look forward to arriving from the USA in March 2004 Vanity Fair A special article about the film, which is said to consist of fifteen pages with many photos on the set. Greetings.
