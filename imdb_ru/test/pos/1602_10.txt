Masterpiece Visconti! I admit that I don’t know much of his work, but I can’t imagine that his other works surpass this fabulous film. Last night, I watched Death in Venice after an absence of 25 years and was completely fascinated by everything I saw. This captivity was a stylization consisting of many elements: unusual shots made by Viscont, first of all his love for long, languid photos of people dining, swimming, walking and containing significant character passing through this mass of people; brilliant interpretation of Visconti cinematographers; act according to principles without resorting to dialogue, and convey the complexity of the plot with the help of facial features alone. <br /> <br /> This is true: young people watching this film for the first time should be aware that they are watching a unique film. film, a film that could not be shot in 2006. The film, whose time rests in those short several years in the sixties and early seventies of the last century, when the artistic license was transferred to directors, and money people took on secondary roles. As many of the recent IMDb commentators wrote, this film, in their opinion, is long, boring (too few actions) and pretentious. I guess, by the standards of a Hollywood dad, these comments contain their merits. Unfortunately, they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and other similar years. <br /> <br /> Please, if you have not yet seen Death in Venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in the film and the story. from another time. You will be rewarded.
