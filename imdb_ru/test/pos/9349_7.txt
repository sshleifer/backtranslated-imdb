I have seen this movie more than once. This is not the best science fiction movie I've ever seen, but this is not a bad movie The game is good, and the characters are more “real” than most in low-budget science fiction. (At least, he is not full of silly fools, like many other low-budget science fiction writers.) I especially like Elizabeth Pena. She is a good actress, and she worries as a single mother, and any other, and even better than some. <br /> <br /> Don't let those who say no kill you. See for yourself and judge for yourself.
