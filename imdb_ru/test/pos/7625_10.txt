Once a sage from India once said: “At first they will laugh at us. Then they will hate us. Then they will fear us. ” Know that, yes, the budget of this film was a bit out of order, but even then his story still interested us many years later, regardless of how it looked. But know soon, in its time “Masten Thrust” will reappear on the big screen. Then he and the new, upgraded T-Rex will shock you more. It will scare many for many centuries! This film is in the preliminary preparation stage and will not look like anything you've ever seen before! <br /> <br /> This will be outside of the THX format ..... straight in 4-DX format. <br /> <br /> "Fear, VERY afraid!"
