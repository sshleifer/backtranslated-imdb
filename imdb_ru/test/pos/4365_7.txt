(Some spoilers) An educational film from the early 1930s about the horrors of social disease infection and its consequences: the insanity of blindness, loss of ability to function, infection by other people, even unborn children, and finally death. “Damaged lives” were far ahead of their time in informing their viewers about the dangers of a venereal disease. Looking more than 70 years after its release in 1933, what is good, if not better, then many films on this subject were made back in the 1940s and 1950s. <br /> <br /> Donald Bradley, Liman Williams, is the head of a large shipping company that is going to study with his girlfriend Joan Diane Sinclair for some time. both are finally going to get married and start a family. One evening at a party, Donald meets Elsie Cooper, Charlotte Merriam, and they drink too much together, and before you know it, spend the night together at Elsie's house. <br /> <br /> Without thinking about his one-day stay with Elsie Donald, he would later marry his longtime love, Joan, and they both plan to have a baby, or so they thought. In the office of Donald, Elsie calls in panic and tells him to come to her right away about something very important. Hurrying for Donald, to his dismay, it turns out that Elsie has a sexual infection that she infected from her boyfriend Nat, Harry Myers, and that she may have infected him with Donald, and he, in turn, could infect his wife Joan. After telling Elsie that she’s wrong about his infection and that she should seek medical help, Elsie shoots herself when Donald is about to leave. <br /> <br /> Overcoming the tragic death of Elsie, Donald gets another surprise when his doctor, Dr. Bill Hill, Jason Robards Sr., comes to his office and tells him to immediately go to the hospital with him to talk to infectious disease. Specialist Dr. Vincent Leonard, Murray Quinnell, about his wife Joan, who has just been accepted there. The terrible truth about Donald and his wife, Joan, strikes him like a bolt from the blue, and leaves him speechless, as Joan had done before. Both were infected, and the infection is terrible and ineffable; back in the 1930s, the infection was called a venereal disease. <br /> <br /> Dr. Leonard said that it would take about two years of treatment to fully cure Donald and Joan, and Joan remains in a state of dangerous suicidal thoughts. Later in the film, Joan, feeling that she had nothing to live, closes all the windows in her and Donald’s apartment and turns on the gas stove to completely kill herself and Donald, who was asleep at the time. <br /> <br /> An honest film about the destructive effect of a sexually transmitted disease and the harm it causes to those who are infected with it, both mentally and mentally, and how it can be cured, if instead of providing immediate medical care, hiding it is from your doctor and hiding it, due to fear of shame and embarrassment, before it is too late.
