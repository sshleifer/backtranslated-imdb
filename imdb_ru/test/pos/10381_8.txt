These are just stories, some of which we want to happen to us, some that we would like to never happen to us, all about unfulfilled desires. Places and naked bodies are beautiful, but after the second story, all I could think about was “you need more than just beauty to create a real film.” Then of course the film unfolds. The stories are moving, except that Sophie Marceau does not tell her story in this film. Malkovich plays a story for both of them, though. The voice acting is not able to relate the stories, but it helps Malkovich to provoke some thoughts. <br /> <br /> I would say that it’s worth seeing the best of Antonioni I’ve seen. Considering his age - great!
