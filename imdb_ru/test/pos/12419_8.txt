I received it as part of the contest prize. I watched this, not expecting much from a clearly low-budget production. I laughed to the pain! There are explicit references to other horror films — Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday, 13th, and so on. D. All the standard clichés were there — a long way through partially arid and some formidable countryside, inbred red necks, mysterious tracking machines you - add some really good humorous scenes (pumping gas from the van) and dialogue (“damn it, virgin? this is an oxymoron ...”, and you have one of the best parody horror films for many years. I especially liked how our reluctant hero used stress-related nosebleeds with a big advantage.
