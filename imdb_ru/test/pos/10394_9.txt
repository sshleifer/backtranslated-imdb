I'm not quite sure what to do with this film, especially after watching such a wonderful film like La Notte. Unfortunately, I saw it in German during the Antonioni Film Festival at the Frankfurt Cinema Museum, so I did not hear Malkovich’s great voice. He has to tie together four stories about couples in Italy. However, as good actor as he is, Malkovich cannot save the most ridiculous of the four stories depicted here: a woman who walks up to him in a seaside cafe near her shop and tells how she killed her father nearby. Then they both go home, have sex, and he leaves. It seems that Antonioni lost the subtlety that was experienced in earlier films (for example, “The Passenger”) when he was having sex, and replaced it with outright nudity. <br /> <br /> Despite the senselessness of the plot, there are two things in the film that make it watchable: an eye and an ear candy. Actors and actresses are all beautiful people, and the cinematography is amazing - the scenes in the old Italian cities contrast with something in a tall apartment building overlooking the city (reminiscent of La Notte). <br /> <br /> Candy for the ears, but this is what makes the film worth seeing. U2 and Brian Eno worked together on "Your Blue Room" and "Beach Sequence", both of which perfectly tuned the film. Songs are available on "Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1."
