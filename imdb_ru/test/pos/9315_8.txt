I heard a lot about Porno-scaffold and his twin film Erotic Nights of the Living Dead. Both films are interchangeable and were filmed at the same time in the same place, with the same actors changing the clothes for each film (and shooting them). If you expect the genius D'Amato to be featured in films like Buio Omega or Death Smiles on Murder, you will not find him here. However, this film has a charm that fans of exploitation will not be able to resist. Where else can you see hard sex mixed with a zombie / monster and his huge penis that strangles and strangles women to death? Only from D'Amato. There is a certain amount of blood in which many men are beaten to death. The film takes place on a beautiful tropical island. As far as I know, there is no subtitle version, so if you do not speak Italian, you will not know what is going on ... but who cares? Honestly, the fans of Gore will probably be carried forward through hard sex. And if someone really watches this only for sex, he will probably be offended instantly. I can only imagine the modern day of porn fans tracing back through the exit of D'Amato and having met this atrocity! Of these two, I find the Erotic nights of the living dead much better. But do not bother watching if they are cut. Porn-wheezing is extremely low budget, as expected. Even the monster does not look as good as George Eastmanâ€™s character in Anthropophage. The film is worth a look for laughter and the completion of the quest D'Amato.
