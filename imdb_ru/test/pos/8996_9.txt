This film shows a very positive message for our young people. Through the sport of rugby as a means, the High School rugby coach leads his players in their behavior and lifestyle, ON and OFF. <br /> <br /> Play and direction are good. Rugby shots are fine if you know some rugby or really cool if you donâ€™t know a lot about it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film, which is worth seeing, especially at that moment, when this sport is gaining momentum every day more and more adepts. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the plot is a true story taking place in Utah. The coach depicted in this film was at the helm of the Highlanders for more than 30 years (and only lost the game every 3 years). <br /> <br /> Enjoy your viewing!
