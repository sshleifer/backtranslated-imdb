Yes, this is one of the greatest genres of black action. A tangled mix of racist comedy and racist violence (sometimes reaching an alarming limit, even for a fan of the genre), this film is not your mine in the park. Wonderful pieces of Rudy Ray Mooreâ€™s comedy come up, which do not seem funny, at least not to such a white boy like me, but magnificent in context. Much better than its sequel "The Human Tornado"
