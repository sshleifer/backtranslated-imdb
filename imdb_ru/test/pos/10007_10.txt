This film is amazing because the fact that real people portray themselves and their real life experiences and do such a good job as if they are almost reliving the past. Jia Hongsheng plays himself as an actor who throws everything except music and drugs, fights depression and seeks the meaning of life, is angry at everyone, especially at the people who care most about him. There are moments in the film that make you cry, because the family, especially the father, did such a good job. However, this film is not for everyone. Many depressed people will understand Hongshengâ€™s problem and why he does what he does, for example, keeps himself closed in a dark room or walking or cycling himself. Others may watch a movie as boring, because it is so real that it is almost like a documentary. In general, this film is great, and Hongsheng deserved an Oscar for this film, like his dad.
