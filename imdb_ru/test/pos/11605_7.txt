I agree with what mallicka.b said. The film is depicted in such a way that it looks like an insult to the original content. Emotions are not transmitted properly. I think that a few not very good speeches also contributed to his mediocrity. In my opinion, Taboo would be a much better choice for such a role than Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a little lewd, which ultimately is not what the film should portray. I also noticed a bit of excessive play in some of her scenes. I am the bitter critic of Aishwarya Paradise :) There is nothing you can do; sorry for that "Cloak" was a good film Rituparno Gosh. And I saw Choker Bali, seeing the cloak; I was not impressed.
