Life for the New York advertising artist Ted Kramer was great. He had a great job and a loving wife. No, actually, his wife was not so loving, because when Ted returned from work late at night, his wife Joanna packed a suitcase with a suitcase and headed for the door. He tried to stop her, but she just got into the elevator and left Ted’s life. Well, now, in addition to his work, he now has to look after the house, as well as their 6-year-old son, Billy; Ted assured his boss that his wife’s departure would not affect his work. This, however, influenced his performance as a father. He exploded when Billy smashed a blow to his client! Well, some time later, Ted and Billy received a letter from Joanna, and from her letter it was obvious that she would not return. Ted was confused. Well, he was late for coming home from work on Billy's birthday, which made Billy angry at him. <br /> <br /> Ted once was late for work, and his boss shouted at him because he missed a very important meeting with a client. When he returned home, he shouted to Billy for sneaking during supper. Then later he truthfully told Billy that the gap between him and Joan might have been his fault, not Billy; Ted invited a good friend, Phyllis Bernard, that night, and Billy looked at the naked woman for the first time. When Ted took Billy to the park the next day, he fell from the gym in the jungle and landed face to face on his toy plane. Ted literally took him to the hospital, where they had to stitches. After that, life began to take a downward spiral for Ted. Then one day, suddenly, he was called by none other than Joanna! They met in a corner cafe. At first they have a pleasant conversation, but then Joanna informs him that she has returned to take her son and take him with her. Ted wouldn't get anything and run out. Well, life got worse for Ted when his boss, Jim O'Connor, invited him to dinner and was suddenly fired. Not only that, but Joanna wanted to sue Billy, and without work, Ted had no chance of winning. He hired a lawyer, John Shaughnessy, who took a lot of pennies from me: an exact change of $ 15,000. And that is if they win. <br /> <br /> Ted was also able to find a new job. In fact, it was a step forward from what he did with a significant salary reduction, but he accepted it with great determination. Finally, the court date, January 9, 1980, arrived. Presiding Judge Atkins. Joanna took a stand, and Shaughnessy continued to ask her about why she left Ted and about her other relationships, and how they were losers. The next day, Ted took the position, and Joanna's attorney really fried him like a cheeseburger. Ted's good friend Margaret also took a position, and she really did not help matters. Well, it took the judge time to think it over, and, of course, Shaughnessy once told Ted that he had lost. Joanna received sole custody of Billy. How typical! Always make a decision in favor of the mother. Well, Ted and Billy were simply devastated because of parting. They had a weeping goodbye when suddenly Joanna stopped. She and Ted talked a little bit, and instead of just handing out the final, let me assure everyone that everyone is alright! <br /> <br /> It was a very good movie. Dustin Hoffman was very good. He received this Academy Award. I also saw him in “Hook”, “Meet the tormers and raincoats”, for which he also received an Oscar. Meryl Streep was good. She also received an Oscar. Justin Henry was good too, so where is his nomination? I suppose that the Academy had a rule prohibiting giving Oscars to children, but this rule was reversed when Haley Joel Osment appeared. This film is a great drama, light comedy, and it is very thin. It holds your attention well. I watched Rain Man at TCM that night, then it happened, and I just couldn't help but watch. And this is what you should do. If you like Dustin Hoffman or Meryl Streep or films of this genre, then I recommend Kramer vs. Kramer! An exciting film about the agony of two divorced parents fighting for their child. I always liked Ted's little speech that she should help mothers. What happened to sex, what makes good parents? Actually, this is how they have a child. But seriously, he is right. Why always rule in favor of the mother, because she is a woman? Also in the cast are George Coe, Howard Duff, who died in 1990, and Howland Chamberlain, who died in 1984. Watch out for assertive Jobbot Williams in the nude on the stage in the hallway. In any case, see Kramer vs. Kramer today !!! Good film !! <br /> <br /> -
