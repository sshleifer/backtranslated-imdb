AWWWW, I just love this movie to pieces. Me and my cousins ​​really like this film, and I am such a HUGE FANAT !!! I hope that they will soon release the series on DVD. By the way, I have not seen a TV show for a long time. Such times geart! Where I come from Australia Chipmunk Adventures are known only to people in their late teens and adults, which is rather sad because young children do not know what is missing there. <br /> <br /> Songs in this movie Those I love the most. Boys / girls in the style of rock and roll, Diamond Dolls and the song that will surely make you cry, my mom. <br /> <br /> This film is sure to interest both young and old. GET A FAST ADVENTURE TODAY !!! 10 out of 10, such a great movie.
