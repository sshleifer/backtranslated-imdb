The curse of monkey island has always been my favorite in the series. Bright visual appearance, excellent soundtrack and great voice composition create an unforgettable and humorous adventure. <br /> <br /> The graphics in the game are definitely not disappointing. Although some corners were trimmed, the overall impression of the game resembles the animation “Disney's Long Animation”. The gameplay is simple, and even a beginner will quickly master. The game also offers a bit more for more experienced players with Mega Monkey Mode. <br /> <br /> Voice cast is one of my favorites. The sympathetic voice of Dominic Armato makes Guybrash complete, and Alexander Boyd is just as charming as Elaine. Earl Boen is a remarkably sinister, but frantic villain, LeChuck. Also the charm of the game is complemented by memorable characters such as Wally (Neil Ross), Murray (Denny Delk) and one of my favorite characters, Haggis McMatton (Allan Young, voice of Scrooge McDuck). My hat also comes off the late great Kay Cooter and his memorable secondary role of Griswold Goodswald. <br /> <br /> Michael Land’s tropical and beautiful soundtrack once again adorns the Monkey Island adventure, including some of the best tunes in the business. The game is not perfect, and some locales are not as detailed as others, but I did not have any difficulty with simply ending the game, which seemed to me very pleasant.
