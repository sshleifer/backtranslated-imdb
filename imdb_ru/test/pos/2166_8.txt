Black Scorpio - Batman Roger Corman. Cool, and in this movie a lot of cool stuff. For example, Breathtaking is a cross between Dr. Doom and Darth Vader, that's cool. The mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the Mad Hatter. The Cormen B-movie style is everywhere in this puppy, which is not always good. There are many tricks and hot babies to please any fan of action. In this film, the good weighs the bad. But if you don’t like comic movies, then I would advise not to watch Black Scorpion, however, if you like comics like movies and you don’t care if it was a comic before. Then check the BLACK SCORPIO, since for me I give it 8 STARS.
