This film set the standard for African-American film excellence when it was made. Over time, I heard in different stories about the film that after its release, an Oscar nomination was nominated. This film plays on different emotions, and you will definitely feel all the characters. Of course, some actions are a bit wooden, but, fortunately, these parts are not crucial. The music is sensational, and if you don't think that the ending is a tear, you have no heart in your chest. If you watch Cooley High, you'll see that many films copied various elements from it to enhance their own films. The biggest example of this is "Boyz N The Hood".
