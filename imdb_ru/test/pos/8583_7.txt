The dialogue is sometimes too dramatic, and the transitions between scenes can be smoother. <br /> <br /> However, “Bruce” looks like genuine if it is not polished, <br> /> <br /> the story ... even if it plays against some important <br /> < br /> facts. <br /> <br /> Sandy Welch is not Gibson or Brana, but he is a brave <br /> <br /> Bruce.
