I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges, so I recorded it on DVD without seeing it before. I also immediately became a fan of Kevin Spacey. <br /> <br /> In my experience, the general plot of the "alien in the body" was made to death, but I liked the approach used in K-PAX, which seemed completely different and much more sensitive than most. Bridges is a great doctor (you * want * to tell him what's on your mind), and Spacey's expressions and gestures are impeccable in this role. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Prot and the fully human characters in the clinic is delightful, especially the subtle manipulations with their behavior. <br /> <br /> The ending is bitter-sweet - I like Prot's choice, but the last scenes (with Bridges) made me cry.
