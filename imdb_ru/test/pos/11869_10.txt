this film makes me laugh, even just thinking about it. such a clever comedy! very accurate, but easy. Casting could not be better. all the actors are the best choice of their roles, and they all play exactly the best, and there is no silly laughter or cry throughout the film. The layers and progress of the story work great together, and the rhythm flows smoothly. The biggest of these is that when the YMCA of the Village People is put on the map, it underlines the importance of the status of an Indian who was briefly revealed earlier in the film, which makes the cleverest and funniest climax among many comedies. I give him ten, especially many times comedies are so underestimated.
