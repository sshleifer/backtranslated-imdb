On many levels this is very good. In fact, considering that this was a low-budget British indie, first created by an artistic director with neophyte actors, this is a great achievement. I do not know how much it costs. The figure of 8,000 pounds was widely publicized in advertising, but you never know how reliable such a figure is. The fact is that this film looks like it is worth a couple of million pounds sterling, and it is clearly worth a tiny fraction of these great special effects, stunning industrial design, effective scenery and costumes, great photography, good play and direction, impressive results and Absolutely awesome sound mix. Despite this, most of the script was great. The characters were clearly defined, and all had something to do. This is a film about ten men dressed about the same in one place, and it would be easy for them to be nameless, faceless spaces, but these were ten characters — mostly it was done through dialogue and how they reacted to things. Throughout the interim act, when the plot evolved, the script told the story well and showed how it affected the characters. If the whole film looked like the second act, it would be stunning. <br /> <br /> Twelve people will get to the individual rescue capsules or “electronic capsules” that break from the ship before the ship explodes. This is nothing more than automatic metal coffins, and the poor inside are trapped, cramped and have no real idea of ​​where they are going, but it makes sense. I like the electronic pods - they work well and make more sense than a good capacious capsule. I also like the way we are specifically told later that they are meant to escape from ship to ship, but they can almost provoke the fall of the planet in an emergency - because, let's face it, these guys were lucky that their ship was blown up so close. to the planet. However, it does not seem to me that there are still 116 unused electronic containers on the freighter, and you need to ask yourself how a prisoner can get into the electronic unit - but he does. (And it just occurred to me: shouldn't the Captain go down with his ship, and not be the first guy from there?) In any case, the electronic pods are landing on a barren planet, where there is nothing but sand and rare vegetation. - or, at least, on the sandy, sparsely populated part of the planet, where there may be ice waste and lush jungle elsewhere. No, this is a planet in a science fiction film - it will be absolutely the same in everything. We have to admit that all the electronic pods fall a few miles apart, so that ten survivors can meet, firing rockets into the sky to find each other. <br /> <br /> The captain of the muscular mountain of a man who could have a pretty good career in battle if he found a suitable agent decides that they should try to contact the “Captain Behan” whom they intended to meet. But they cannot do this from the planet, they need to go into orbit. The engineer says that if they combine power units from two electronic containers, they can probably give one of them enough juice to climb the anti-gravity duddas, high enough for an explosion over the atmosphere. All this can be done in automatic mode, but to send a signal you will need a “pilot”. The captain is valiantly in favor of this, but in a very reasonable step the engineer notes that it is ridiculous to put the heaviest person in a slightly repaired electronic unit and that he should be the easiest member of the team. This is Baby. I really liked the way he now indicates that his name is David, and the captain begins to use him, treating him with dignity and respect. It was a good storytelling and good characterization.
