I was impressed with this movie because of the quality of the game and the powerful message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays the role of a frivolous, irrational and possessive mother who constantly gives her daughter the message that they should stick together. She takes her daughter out of a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to continue her exciting acting career in Hollywood. The daughter is doubtful, but at first she has no choice - the connection with the mother is pathologically strong. <br /> <br /> Over time, the girl sees that the mother goes into fantasy and does not have it. feet on the ground. She sees her mother follow on the heels of a beautiful, seductive boyfriend who loves them and leaves them. She sees that the mother does not understand this. So how can she turn to her mother for advice? <br /> <br /> Mother sends the girl to the drama and sees her daughter playing the role of the mother in such a way that this shockingly painful mirror is held up to her mother for the night but the lesson is still valid. <br /> <br /> An increase in character is observed when the mother realizes her selfish demand for her daughter and finally convinced to let the girl go. This is a touching scene and a valuable lesson: parents, even if emotionally addicted, should allow the child to leave and become his separate person.
