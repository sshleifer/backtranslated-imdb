Well, I admit that if I didnâ€™t have children, I would never see this film and never see it. But, taking into account all the rotten children's films that I saw (for example, SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: PIG IN THE CITY), this is a significant improvement. And that was enough for me not to be bored because of the skull or because of suicide (which I did several times in two other films). Of course, the performances are quite wide, and the plot is rather silly - but this is a children's film. And, compared to other films in the genre, it is definitely better than average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes do seem to have some talent and are likely to continue their careers after puberty - at least in commercials or voicing. <br /> <br /> So, if you are looking for a movie to watch with your children, you could certainly do a lot worse!
