This film received a special award in Cannes for its game, and it is not difficult to understand why. (A few spoilers - but for the finals you will have to watch a movie!) Simple story - in Moscow on the eve of the war between Russia and Germany in World War II Veronika (Tatyana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Alexey) Batalov) but they don’t give a damn when she finds out that he enlisted in the army. Boris goes to the front before Veronica can tell him that he loves him. Boris is shot, but his final fate remains unknown to Veronica or his family. Mark, Boris's cousin, will rape Veronica, who considers herself obliged to marry him. Humiliated and humiliated by the cowardly Mark, Veronica clings to the hope that someday Boris will return. Great camera work and wonderful scenery director Kalatozov. (For those interested in cinema technology, another Kalatozov film, I AM CUBA, has at least two excellent staged plays - one of them - a long trekking, which begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana, raises two stories to the cigar factory traces the window and follows the procession down a long, long alley — and all without a slice.) An excellent game, in particular Samoilova and Vasily Merkuriev (like Uncle Boris), which becomes even more acute due to sheer understatement. Amazingly romantic film with Samoilova's heartbreaking performance. (This film is often associated with another Russian classical Ballad of the Soldier.)
