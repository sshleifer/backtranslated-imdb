In my student theater last night there was a special screening of this film. I must say that I think everyone was impressed by how good this film is. Although my roommate did not care about it, but in any case he is not interested in horror films and just went to see if Paris Hilton could play. By the way, if you are worried about this, do not worry. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I have to be honest and say that she was pretty good, and she has the best death scene. In general, all the actors were very good. I will not go into the details of the plot, as I am sure that you know about it. Surprisingly, the characters are pretty attractive, and you really care about them, especially the characters of Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray. We meet them as competing brothers and sisters and end up working together. Another advantage is that it doesn’t have the sleek look of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and looks almost like a documentary, not like a music video (don't get me wrong, I loved Texas Chainsaw and enjoyed Amityville). <br /> <br /> Now about the scenes of death. In most slash films, when a character is hit or killed, the scene immediately ends in another scene, but not this one. When a character is about to die, he dies pretty badly. But the filmmakers do not stop on their laurels and each time add a little something extra for each victim. I will not say anything about death scenes and let you see them for yourself. <br /> <br /> Although these are excellent slasher films, they have flaws in almost all slasher films (researching an eerie home when you shouldn’t be brought up with a suspicious character, broke up and shouted for the killer to hear you) . In addition, there is a kind of stupid plot twist that was unnecessary and did not add to the film at all. You could say that it was added at the last moment, and if you shot it, it would have no effect on the film. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you're a horror movie fan, watch this movie. You will not be disappointed. It has everything you need to make it a great slasher film, perhaps the best this year, although it is early. Waiting is felt, and sometimes it's a funny movie. If you hate horror movies, most likely you will like this one, and if you are divided, I encourage you to do it.
