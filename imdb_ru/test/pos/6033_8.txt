In the story, this is not one of the best or most cleverly written Colombo films, but the film is very well made, with excellent directing and really great play. <br /> <br /> Particularly attracts attention action in this film. Director Nicholas Colasanto did a great job with the actors in the film. Apparently, he allowed Peter Falk and John Cassavetes to play a lot of space, also because both of them are credited here as non-credited directors of this film. It must be part of his directorial style so that the actors have so much space. It works very well for this movie. Perhaps he did this because Colasanto himself also worked as an actor. He is perhaps best known for playing the role of a trainer on the hit series “Greetings” from its very beginning in 1982 until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk looks better than ever before in his role as Lieutenant Colombo. Also veteran actor John Cassavetes does an excellent job because the film is his killer and works well for a lieutenant. In addition to them, the film also features Mirna Loy. The big star of the silent film era, as well as Pat Morita in a small early role. <br /> <br /> But not only the acting leadership in the film is very good. Visually and technically, this is also a truly superbly made film, with slow long shots, without using any cuts. The reason why this film is longer than most Colombo films is also obvious. It really takes time to set things up and tell your story. The film also has some good art and experimental shots. Of course, all this really comes to the 70s. <br /> <br /> But as I said, the plot is not the best Colombo movie. In addition, the tips left for the lieutenant are too obvious this time. This makes the killer stupid, as if he had not thought out his plan enough, while the character is obviously an intelligent man. Colombo this time also tries to annoy the suspect and other characters with a little more than he usually tries to solve, in order to solve the crime. This and Peter Falk's other acting approach is the reason why his character may differ from others in Colombo films. But otherwise does not mean worse in this case. <br /> <br /> The film also has a good musical score of Richard DeBenedictis, who then became a kind of permanent composer for Colombo films. <br /> <br /> A great movie of Colombo! <br /> <br /> 8/10
