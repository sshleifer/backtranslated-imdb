I watched it on TV in 1989 and regretted not recording it on tape. I was very intriguing and tense. It's amazing how the events unfold, and this man's past is catching up with him. <br /> <br /> The acting game is first-class, and the story is exactly what the title says ... no one could escape from the life that this man led at the beginning of the film.
