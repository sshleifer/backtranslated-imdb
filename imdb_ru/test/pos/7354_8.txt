After the return of "horror films" (oh well, Scream does not scare!) I did not have very high hopes for this low-budget three-story horror film. But I was pleasantly surprised! Man this is scary! The first 2 stories are great. The first story is about a new couple who travels in a dark forest with their RV when they face fierce ........ (watch the movie)! The second story is about a disgusting man who is obsessed with a little girl who is home alone one night ... I know this does not sound special, but it is Scary. I promise you. The last story is not scary, but not bad. This is about biker and ghost. In fact, the stories are based on real urban legends (I think Kevin Williamson can also steal ideas). Shoot this movie, it's good !!! I would say that this is the worst movie of the three short horror stories ever filmed!
