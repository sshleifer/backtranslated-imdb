On the Indian Ocean island of Reunion, the owner of the cigarette factory, Louis Mahe (Jean-Paul Belmondo), is in correspondence with Julia Roussel, and he does not know it. When Julie arrives on the island to marry Louis, he is waiting for her at the docks, but Louis does not recognize Julie on the passenger ship and discovers that she is completely different from the picture she sent to Louis. They get married, and Louis shares his bank accounts with her. When Julia's sister writes a letter to Louis asking her to write to her sister, Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie, who has disappeared. In addition, he finds that the woman has cleared her bank accounts and left the island. Sister Louis and Julie hire an effective private investigator Comolly (Michel Bouquet), and Louis goes in search of a woman to France, but he has a nervous breakdown in Nice and he is undergoing intensive sleep therapy in the clinic. He recovers and discovers that this woman, in fact Marion Vergano (Catherine Deneuve), works at the Phoenix Club Privé in Antibes and lives in the budget hotel Monorail. Louis bursts into her room, and when she comes out of the club, she says she was happy with him, but her former dangerous lover Richard was blackmailing her. Louis is still in love with Marion and runs off with her to the village. But Comolly pursues Marion in France, accused of killing Julia. <br /> <br /> “Syrena du Mississippi” is a film noir created by the great director / writer Francois Truffaut, with an unusual love story about passion, murder and love that hurts The femme fatale Catherine Deneuve is amazing, probably in all her beauty and adorable when you see her face and topless scenes on the road and in the room. Jean-Paul Belmondo is very athletic, and the sequence when he climbs the wall of the hotel is impressive. Catherine Deneuve makes this film valuable and gives authority to the passion and lust of Louis. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Sereya to Mississippi” (“Mississippi Mermaid”)
