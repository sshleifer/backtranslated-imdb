Sophisticated sexual comedies are always difficult to carry out. Watch the films of Blake Edwards, who may be a master of the genre, and you will find as many blunders as there are hits. For if a film of this kind never works, it will never be able to return to the tried and true toilet humor of teenage sex comedy [i.e. “American Pie”] or will warm the audience with the sentimentality of the romantic comedy [i.e. The whole career of Julia Roberts. It can only support the push to the end and hope that the audience can appreciate the almost required irony of its resolution. <br /> <br /> The authors of the husband’s / wife’s team, Wally Volodarsky and Maya Forbes, “See Other People” begin with the engagement couple Ed & Alice [Jay Mohr & Julianne Nicholson] just a few steps from the back of the car in front of them. When the frame freezes, we suddenly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. From now on, we welcome that the story that is about to unfold will take advantage of both sexes. <br /> <br /> Two months shy of their vows, Ed and Alice already look and behave like an old married couple. In the early scenes in the bathroom, only their actions show us how comfortable they are with each other and how long they have been together. . Thus, when the line to advance the plot breaks through - as expected from the smallest probability of the two - it is as if the attitude itself required a change, even if it means its own destruction. <br /> <br /> Once all the basic rules are established [Ed cannot sleep with her mother or, for that matter, Salma Hayek], they are sent in different directions hoping to find some meaningless sex to strengthen their relationship. At first, everything seems to be going according to plan, since their daily visits only help ignite the passion between them. But, as expected, as deeper emotions of regret and jealousy begin to manifest themselves, they soon become fragmented and are on the verge of decay. All of these actions lead to a resolution that you may or may not like - depending on your own degree of cynicism. <br /> <br /> For such a comedy, you need a reliable cast with supporting characters as strong as the leads. And the director Volodarsky does not disappoint. Here he took down two of my favorite actresses as sisters - Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham - and lets them play in their power. For Nicholson, who always reminded me of young Shirley MacLaine, she brings Alice naivety and vulnerability, even when her actions seem less than that. As for Graham, an actress who has proven that she can surpass the entire ensemble of Howard Hawks, she steals every scene she is in, with a sharp persona "without BS". <br /> <br /> As for the guys, Jay Mohr works here, as does Josh Charles. Byron Cranston from Malcolm in the Middle is to be welcomed for taking a British accent and letting it all hang out. But the real pleasure here is Andy Richter and his subplot with the participation of single mother Helen Slater. While his scenes seem to almost belong to another film, they are by far the funniest, and his dead panned production steals the show. <br /> <br /> For the independent production “See other people” has a more personal and introspective character. the feeling is that it would be noticeable to be absent from a big Hollywood movie of this kind. Not to mention that there are also some really funny moments in this film - unlike, say, most Hollywood comedies in general. <br /> <br /> Rating [on a 5-star system]: 3 1/2 stars
