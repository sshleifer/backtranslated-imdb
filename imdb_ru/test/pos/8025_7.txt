I saw this movie last night and thought it was decent. There are moments, I think, you would say. Some scenes with special forces were awesome, and some of the shots from the scene were very authentic. I will not put this film in my DVD collection, but it is fair enough to recommend for rent. I think nothing has put the film on a different level compared to others from the same genre. The action is good, the game is decent, women, in my opinion, are very seductive and exotic, and the story is quite interesting. 7 out of ten
