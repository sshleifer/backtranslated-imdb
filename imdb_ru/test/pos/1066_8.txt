Forget Jimmy Stewart re-living his life and choose this clever comedy of errors instead. I suppose that only legalized sexism explains why this film and another great Christmas story of Stanvik “Meet John Doe” are not honored with the same level of love as ... well, you know, his name. <br /> <br /> Stanvik plays a culinary writer for McColl-type rags who have lied to their pompous publisher for years about the indecent approach to their recipes. She is ace bs The artist until the day when the sailor Morgan was pulled out of the ocean after 18 days of sailing and 6 weeks of recovery in a naval hospital. The film, released in the last year of the Second World War, is full of subtle patriotic gestures and festive nostalgia, but never sinks to sentimentality. Stanvik, as always, is sexy and sassy and meets his girlfriend in a hefty Morgana, with whom this is love at first sight. Unfortunately, she has to be married to an extraordinary architect, Gardiner, who for many years has been looking for her hand on his farm in Connecticut, just to fool her boss. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakall adds a lot of Hungarian Malaprop and double humor in support as the true source of Babs' culinary talent, and Una O'Connor is gay as the nasty Irish housekeeper Gardiner.
