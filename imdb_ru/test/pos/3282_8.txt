ManBearPig is a rather funny episode from South Park. He forges Al Gore and his talk about global warming, replacing only global warming with ManBearPig (a fictional monster with parts of a man, a bear and a pig). He tells the boys about this in the school assembly, and Stan is sorry for him, so he and the boys decided to hang out with him. Eventually, Gore falls into a trap in a stone cave, where, he believes, there is a man-breed pig, and they are stuck for several days. Meanwhile, Cartman finds the Treasure, but he wants to keep it all to himself. ManBearPig is a good parody of global warming and a generally funny episode from South Park. <br /> <br /> 8/10
