Admittedly, there are some scenes in this film that seem a bit unreal. The delightful woman first panics, and after a few minutes she starts kissing the young man, and the old man stands next to her. But as the film progresses, we learn that she is a little volatile girl (or whore), and this partially explains her behavior. The cinematography of this film is well done. We see the elevator from almost all angles and perspectives, and some of these images and scenes really increase the tension. George Goetz plays his hero well, the wannabe roasts, ages and overcomes young people, such as the character Jannice. Wolfgang Keeling, whom I admired in Hitchcock's THE TORN CURTAIN, shows a great performance that, although he doesnâ€™t speak much, he is definitely the best actor in this play. One critic complained that the film was unrealistic and that in the real case nothing would happen. But again, how realistic are such films as Mission Impossible or Phone Booth. Given the fact that we are talking about a movie here, and that in a movie you always have to deal with some scenes that are unlikely to happen in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. This is much better than many things that I see on German television these days, and I think the vintage 80's style has added something to this film.
