"Four daughters" begins as another clone of the melodrama of the type "Little Women". A single father with four musically talented and appropriate daughters tries their best to keep them informed and guide them in caring rituals. What turns the film around is the sudden appearance of a new Hollywood star, some critics say that the first antihero long before James Dean decorated the big screen. Since the dark, gloomy figure of Mickey Borden (John Garfield) appears at the gate of Ann Lemp (Priscilla Lane), splashing her self-pity and doomed philosophy on the rest of the cast, the Four Daughters have become much more than just a chick Flick. <br /> <br /> Although Garfield is the main reason to watch Four Daughters, there are other flashes of brilliance. Hungarian-born director Michael Curtis, later in charge of such precious stones as Casablanca and Mildred Pierce, using his camera, reveals certain pictures (with the support of cinematographer Ernest Haller from Rebel Without a Cause) that are remembered by viewers, the shrill gates that the first admirer of Anne, Felix Deutz (Jeffrey Lynn), so cheerfully unfolds, become a symbol of changes in the attitudes and affections of those who use it. <br /> <br /> The fact that Garfield delivers outstanding performance is obvious, but the rest of the cast is keeping up with it most of the way. The underrated Jeffrey Lynn plays her part to perfection, like an abandoned fan, whose love for his cherished Ann never hesitates, even when she is with another man. Claude Raines, somewhat mistakenly considered the father of four young adult women, gives an excellent image of the recruitment of a mad head of the family who got lost in a random order. Three sisters Lane, already known for their musical abilities, are transformed into experienced actresses who perform their roles well. A lot of supporting actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, May Robson and Eddie Acuff, make it all believable. <br /> <br /> Attracting opposites is part of the trick to capture the viewer's imagination. Ann is an eternal optimist, even when she and Mickey are upset. She always looks on the bright side and, like many of those who got into the pliers of the Great Depression in those days, saw prosperity just around the corner. Mickey lists a complete list of the bad things that happened to him, looking for the company in its suffering from Ann, which Ann refuses to do. Mickey expects to go out with the lightning that struck him when he closes the corner of his life. Mickey has a scant talent as a composer; Ann has the talent to save as a singer and musician. Ann loves beauty; Mickey has a great personality in a twisted sense. And the differences continue and continue. The way all of this is agreed at the end is an important part of the film that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> See “Four Daughters” to see John Garfield's voice acting on the big screen debut. The only time he got better was seven years later, when he again hypnotized the film’s viewers with one of the greatest screenings when Frank Chambers in The Postman Always Calls Twice, against the equally charismatic Lana Turner. But also look at “Four Daughters” to catch the important elements that can be missed if too much attention is paid to the star of the show.
