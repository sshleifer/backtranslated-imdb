This is an epic film about the unification of the ancient kingdoms of China in the third century BC. What makes it interesting is the tragic fall of the king and every palace intrigue that takes place around him. It reminded me a bit of "King Lear" and some other Shakespeare plays. <br /> <br /> King begins with noble ambitions, to unite the kingdoms under one ruler, and to end all quarrels so that people can flourish and lead a better life. He and his beloved baby, perfectly played by Li Gong, came up with a scheme whereby she pretended to go into exile in a rival kingdom to recruit the murderer to kill the king, thereby giving him a reason to go to war. But as long as she is gone, the king becomes a sadist in his lust for power and continues to kill. <br /> <br /> There are many side scenes that support action. There is a marquis who pretends to be stupid and stupid, but in reality he is very clever and wants to become king himself. He has two children with the Kingâ€™s mother and manages to keep it secret for many years. Then there is the Prime Minister, a political rival to the king, who, it turns out, is really his father. <br /> <br /> The killer is in itself a complex character. An adept swordsman and murderer, he undergoes a reformation when the king's lover comes to recruit him. He wants nothing more with murder, but in the end Li Gong overcomes him (who would not be?) When he sees how cruel and vicious the king has become. <br /> <br /> A bit of exciting cinema, especially Battle Scenes, which take place on a large scale - as they usually said, thousands of actors, literally. The game is fine, nothing special. This is an interesting story, although for more than two and a half hours it expands the boundaries. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing.
