Look at these people at the entrance to the prison. They are not the faces of Hollywood extras. Some of the producers were really smart to get filmed in Oxford, Mississippi, because you can't get that authenticity from the studio. Inspect the narrow dusty roads, frozen ground below and skeletal trees barely hanging on them. Not surprisingly, these faces look harsh and unforgiving; they simply reflect the soil from which they originate. Old man Lucas (Hernandez) is better afraid for his life, but then he comes from the same solid land. <br /> <br /> The film works because it tells a good story that does not preach, does not sentimentalize, and does not even have some expectation. Old man Lucas is not very cute. He is a victim, and we sympathize, but he is also arrogant and unfriendly. Wisely, the script refuses to sweeten it. Thus, we are forced to recognize the consequences of racism and injustice, even for the less sympathetic. The script also wisely avoids being directly involved in racism, as it becomes preaching and less effective. Instead, we are shown how easily prejudice can convict an innocent person and condemn him to a terrible death. Thus, thanks to our common instinct to see justice, the consequences of racism are revealed, a much more effective way. This also makes the sheriff’s and attorney’s actions more understandable, since otherwise they are part of the Jim Crow system. <br /> <br /> Note that the film does not attack segregation. It is doubtful that old man Lucas would in any case want to mix with whites, and there is no hint that even attorney Stevens (Brian) wants to cross the color line, except to get justice. No, the possibility of reconciliation lies in the future, as the child (Jarman) symbolizes, whose head is not yet filled with "concepts." He is not quite friendly with Lucas, but he saw the friendship of all mankind after falling into a frozen stream. The last line of the dialogue also shows that he sided with his uncle, a lawyer, instead of his more hidden parents (the scene of the dinner table is important and easily overlooked). A lawyer cannot join the future civil rights march, but the child can. This is the really encouraging side of the film. <br /> <br /> During this short 3-year period, 1949-51, there were a lot of films on the racial theme (“Well, no way out, home of the brave, lost borders”), Even the famous MGM got into the mix with this little gem. Unfortunately, the cleaning of McCarthy in Hollywood put an end to the “problem” films that cannot serve the purposes of the Cold War. However, each of them is worth catching up, not only because they are good films, but also because even after 60 years and Jim Crow, they are still relevant.
