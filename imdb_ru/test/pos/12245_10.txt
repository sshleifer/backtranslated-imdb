Really awesome, touching movie. Women's melodrama in all its glory, with a lot of comedies: a great dialogue, characters and writing. Any woman can relate to this story because it is classic: you are in love with Mr. Right, but he is not interested in you until some guy appears who seems completely wrong and you do not fall in love with him. But, of course, it is not so simple. The characters are real, and all the performances are impeccable. The film is also fun, every scene turns society. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a well-written script of humor and melodrama. You can relate to each character, and the plot moves in unexpected directions. Great, underrated film.
