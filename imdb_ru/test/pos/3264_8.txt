Based on his current IMDb rating, as well as on several plot summaries, I did not expect much from Two Hands. But how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, you are deeply absorbed in a genre that has long remained unoriginal. Even in terms of stage setting and cinematography, the director stands out and creates a film consisting of a lot of imagination. If you are looking for a film that is not only interesting, but also provocative, convincing and really unusual, then make it the next movie you are watching. <br /> <br /> I hope that the tragic death of Heath Ledger has led more and more people to catch this film. He was an incredible talent, and his performance in this is one that cannot be missed. Make no mistake by judging and discarding this amazing film before you see it.
