This is a very good comedy film. I just liked it. I don't know why I love this movie, I just adore it. Storyline: This is the story of two boys, Amara (Amir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan), who want to get rich quick by taking all the shortcuts in the book. Amar is the son of an honest hairstylist Murley Manohara (Deven Verma) in Mumbai, and Prem is the son of Bankeilal Bhopali (Jagdip), a hard-working tailor in Bhopal. Both Amar and Prem sell the shop and house of their father, respectively, and concentrated on the hilly station, where the beautiful rich heiress Ravina (Ravina Tandon) accompanied by her friend diplomat Karishma (Karishma Kapoor) came from London with the intention of marrying a virtuous Indian. The lucky one who marries Ravina will inherit all the wealth of his father Rama Gopal Badzhaj (Paresh Raval). Amar and Prem see how quickly they get rich, and achieve the rabbis, everyone is trying to do something else. Enter Teja (Paresh Rawal in a double role), whose only ambition in life was to capture millions of his twin brother, Rama Gopal Bajaya. So Teja puts Bhallu. (Shehzad) and Robert (Viju Hote) at Ravina's house to help him fulfill his ambitions. As the story progresses, it becomes an insane chase for the wealth of Ram Gopal Bajaya, full of humor, romantic thrills and cold. Will Ravina and Karisma see the evil intentions of Amara and Prem? Teja will succeed in their motives? See it all in the super comedy ANDAZ APNA APNA. <br /> <br /> Amir, Salman, Ravina, Karisma and Paresh are the best there. <br /> <br /> Good music. <br /> <br /> Good direction. <br /> <br /> Good story and script. <br /> <br /> very good comedy !!!!!!
