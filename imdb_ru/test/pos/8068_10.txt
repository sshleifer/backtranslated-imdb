Although it may seem strange that a 32-year-old woman plays a 12-year-old role, Mary Pickford soon makes you forget about inconsistencies and just enjoy the fun. <br /> <br /> Mary is a street child in New York, with her own attractive gang of intrigue creators whose attention is concerned with the elder William Haynes (he was then 25 years old, and he is just on the threshold of his own stellar glory). <br /> <br /> Distributing too much of the plot would be unfair. It is enough that Mary is very fun to watch and show why she was the first and most beloved Hollywood superstar. Production figures are very good, with a lot of additions that make the street scenes of New York quite plausible.
