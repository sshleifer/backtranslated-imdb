It was one of the few Norwegian films I was looking forward to. It began as a few commercials with a multi-colored bunch at football matches. Then they made a movie of it. The presenters are not professionals (and you can see it), but they still do a very good job, and the film as a whole impressed me. <br /> <br /> Norway is known for making shitty movies (no offense) I had a good feeling about this. Even if I'm not interested in football, I wanted to see him. the story is much better than expected, and the laughter just accumulates. There are a lot of cameos from Norwegian celebrities and players. characters are well depicted and you feel towards them. If you ever gonna see a Norwegian movie. LET'S ONE ONE !!!!
