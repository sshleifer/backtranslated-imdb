This movie was great. It had everything that a true action fan could wish for. A lot of people get shot and / or get hurt, minimal romance related to sex, a hero with whom you can identify yourself, violence in many periods of time instead of a meaningless conspiracy to remember one scene at the end, and villains who just ask for it. Bronson seems to be in his lowest tolerance level in this film, and it shows. Ed Lauter is an excellent cop, and he worked without any problems on the plot of Bronson, without stealing his attention. There is no plot in the film that is so boring or excessive that you watch this movie once and never again. Rather, you want to see Quercy in action, and the storyline just reveals it. These are great things.
