Rita Hayworth lights up the screen in this hilarious, whimsical and delightful musical starring Gene Kelly. Rita plays the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker, who dreams of becoming a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately, her career does not go anywhere in the nightclub Danny McGuire. When one of her fellow dancers says that she is going to take part in the "Cover Girl" competition, she decides to follow her dream and enters. She reminds the publisher of her grandmother, whom he was deeply in love with many years ago. But when she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy about it. <br /> <br /> I have never seen Rita before, and I'm so glad I did! She has such a presence on stage and she is a very good actress. There are some good numbers here, not the best musicals, but they are melodic and pleasant to listen to. One thing I didn't like was the character of Gene Kelly. He had to support his girlfriend! But in any case, this is probably the only criticism I have about this film. The cover girl is a gorgeous, fluffy film - the perfect escape. Not everyone is a perfect film, but, nevertheless, a wonderful film thanks to the star power of Rita Hayworth. Great movie, really impressed.
