This game has cartoon graphics, a bit of violence and very short levels - then why do people say that it is so brilliant ?! Because he always keeps your attention, he captivates you and refuses to let go! You will spend hours trying to find the damn on-board recorder, try to decide how to enter the room without warning the guards, etc.! Levels are short only when you know what to do - before that you'll spend hours trying to figure out where to find matches, where to find helicopters, and so on! And you will have fun all the time while you do it! Worth renting!
