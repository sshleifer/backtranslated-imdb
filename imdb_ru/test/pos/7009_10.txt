I am 15, usually not children of my age, usually watch these old classic films. But this is one of my favorites. I was completely addicted after watching this for the first time. It's really good, if you think about technology and movies at the time, the music is great, the storyline is fine, the choreography is great, you should see it. I do not know why there is a prequel to this film. Not many people like this film, but I love classic love films, now they are much better than movies! This movie will make you smile, cry and start dancing. The music is absolutely attractive and beautiful. I have not seen Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights. Nobody wants a prequel, they want a sequel. Many would agree that the film is enough of the original, the sequel and the third. In addition, people will not worry to watch it. Who remembers the film about Saint Benard Beethoven? I think there are 5 films in general.
