I have seen this film, and anyone who has ever been in the Marines or in any branch of the service can appreciate the accuracy of this film. It is necessary for any collection. Jack Webb does an excellent job with a heavy drill instructor. My father went to Marin's Camp Penelton training camp and says that this film is so accurate that it seems to him that he has returned to basic training. The film has a line where the character of Jack Webbs is angry at the shoe for killing the sand flea. Well, let me tell you that there is nothing in the camp but sand fleas. I was there and can appreciate it. In fact, the exit to the camp is Las Pulas, which in English means a city of fleas. You should watch a movie to appreciate what I am saying. Anyone who participates in World War II films, all battles begin right here with the sergeant's training. Must have a collection for you
