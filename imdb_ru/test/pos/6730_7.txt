So years later, I finally tracked down this movie! I was dying to see how this corresponded to my memories. I distinctly remembered the shots of a ghost boy who ran through the mine, then waited behind two boards crossed in the mine, and looked with a pale white face. This single shot was probably the most intimidating shot of my childhood, I remember a chill running down my spine. Observing this now is obviously not at all so scary, but it is rather unconsciously strange to see the same images again. If someone needs a copy, write to me. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty standard. It is strange, however, that this time the message is rather obscure - there is no real morality as such (except that “ghosts are here to help us?” Or “don't be prejudiced against ghosts!”). greediness / capitalist angle in terms of wanting to profit from the mine. However, the massive act of irresponsibility on the part of the captain, prompting two children to actually follow the vague consequences of the ghost, not only in the mine, but also in the new mine pit, which is absolutely dangerous. Then the captain urges the children to descend the huge stairs deep into the mines simply because he thinks the ghost wants them too. It is also a bit strange that a ghost chooses a boy to help trapped adults, and not just help trapped adults. Well.
