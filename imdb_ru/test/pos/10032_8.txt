When someone stops to recall the frequent screen shots of Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland, “They died in boots” (1941), most likely, the film is best remembered. This is a terrific saga about General Custer (Flynn), told since he entered the West Point Military Academy and fell in love with the succulent Elizabeth Bacon (De Havilland) due to his stay in the US Civil War and finally his death in Little Big Horn. Directed by Raoul Walsh, he erects his historical epic on the laurels of the highly dubious renunciation of historical texts, rewritten by screenwriters Wally Klein and Aeneas Mackenzie, until truth and fiction are distorted completely disproportionately. Consequently, the battle against the Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) is portrayed as an unfair agreement between politicians - California Joe (Charlie Grapevin) and an unceremoniously absent corporation that wants to return the land that Caster gave to the Indians as a result of the systematic genocide of the nation. The first nations. <br /> <br /> Flynn, who plays Custer deftly, as if he is one part of Arnold Schwarzenegger in two parts to Albert Schweitzer, has never been more disgraceful. He literally exudes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his faithful heroine. Stock players Resident Warner, Arthur Kennedy and Sydney Greenstreet deliver amazing cameos that seem to have a much greater depth and character than is actually written in the material for them. <br /> <br /> In general, despite the fact that the story does not make sense in favor of a good romantic yarn “They died in boots” is a good feed for a Saturday matinee or a Sunday evening in which you can chat with your beloved. Warner's DVD is pretty pretty. Although the grain of the film is often obvious, the gray scale is very well drawn with deep, pure black and very pure white. Some attenuation is evident in the transition between scenes. The sound was very well cleaned and presented at an adequate listening level.
