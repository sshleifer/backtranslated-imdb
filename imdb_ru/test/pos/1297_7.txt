This film was shot only 48 years after the end of the civil war - most likely, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. The film presents recreations of battles and people of the era, which look quite impressive and realistic. He also gives a different and more balanced view than just his contemporary, BIRTH OF NATION - a clearly absurd and racist film. Because of this, this short film would be excellent for classroom use to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man who runs off to sign up for the role of a drummer. The boy succeeds and is a hero, although the film ends rather melodramatically - a certain convention of the day. Not a very good film, but a decent plot, a decent game and a bit of excessive play, which you have often seen in other films of the day. <br /> <br /> One annoying aspect of this film was the too-frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for really obvious things. From time to time it was annoying.
