it's more than saturday. noon special. Very well written, if very low key, there are many here, if you are looking for it. Catch a companion / scout cat, for example. It could be not only a comic, but also a comic. The comic industry (as well as the film publicists) missed the boat on this issue. One of the least known really great films.

This keeper. I have never seen a DVD of this movie, but I had my own version of VHS. Good hunt
