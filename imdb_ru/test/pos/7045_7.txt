The quintessence of "let's prepare for the summer film." It is stupid, stupid, and perhaps at the touch, but my children just saw it, and they laughed as much as I did when I first saw it. In the style of all the films The Little Guys are Against the Establishment, so yes, the plot is very predictable, but it's warm and funny. And no, this is not Bill Murray in his film "Bill Murray", but he begins to stretch in his first starring role. It is strange, however, to see how few “fresh young faces” in this film have done much more.
