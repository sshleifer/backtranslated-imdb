In The Strangers by Train, it is obvious from the outset that playboy Robert Walker singled out Farley Granger as an unwitting accomplice to a pair of murders. Granger is a semi public figure, he is a professional in tennis, but not very tall. However, high enough that he knew that Granger was trapped in a marriage without love and would like to be free to marry Ruth Roman. <br /> <br /> So when one day they meet like complete strangers on a train, Walker knows enough that Granger will be at least intrigued enough by the possibility that if they are two, completely strangers, they will commit murder against parties that the other will be caused by their demise. Although Granger is repelled by the idea, one of the great features of this film is that in the performance he showed you can see that Granger may simply succumb to temptation. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Walker kills Laura Elliot Granger's wife, who beat him twice and even got pregnant from another man, expects Granger, in turn, to kill Walker's father so Walker can inherit him property. Today, Walker will be called a child from a trust fund and quite malicious. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to a career role, ironically in his last full film. Walker died the following year, when most of my son John finished. Hitchcock does a good job with Farley Granger. <br /> <br /> Of course, when Granger disagrees with the murder of people who have never done anything to him, there is tension. “Strangers on the train” also featured great editing, primarily in a tennis match, in which Granger must end the match and spur Walker before he presents evidence that Granger had condemned at the crime scene. And also in this latest climax with a fight on the runaway carousel between Walker and Granger. <br /> <br /> “Strangers on the train” - Hitchcock is at his best, he should not be missed, and he should definitely look at editing film lessons at cinema lessons.
