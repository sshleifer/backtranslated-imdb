Young John Garfield played an excellent role in 1939 "They made me a criminal." Noting the victory in the ring in the locked locker room, boxer Johnny Bradfield talks about his love for his mother, refusal to drink and clean lifestyle for fans, including the police, who eat them. Later in the evening, he plows and swears at his girlfriend, while his manager, at the fraudster, shares the evening. And whiskey. <br /> <br /> The problem arises when another pair comes. The guy is a newspaper reporter, and he says that he will reveal Bradfield’s fake life on the front page. The manager kills the reporter, and he and the whore leave. The murder that was discovered, the police, are later on in search of a sleeping pill boxer, whose car is controlled by a manager with his new girlfriend - now former former Johnny. The police chase ends with a fiery car accident. The manager and the girl are dead and unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> Johnny discovers that he must be a murderer. But he is also considered dead. Turning to a lawyer for advice, he entrusts the consultant with the key to the banking cell in which his only savings are stored - $ 10,000. Later, the lawyer gives Johnny $ 250 and informs him that the balance is his fee for professional advice: quickly leave the city and go far. (I would never charge more than $ 5,000 from a client for such informative, concise and wise leadership.) <br /> <br /> Johnny, now a traveling freight train, ends up in a convenient place on a ranch in Arizona where he is fed back to health beautiful Goldie West, Ann Sheridan, a beautiful actress, whose career was in full bloom. Taking Jack Dorney as his nickname, the boxer loses some of his rough edges when he falls in love with Goldie. He becomes a mentor and a friend of The Dead End Kids. Familiar on-screen characters to pre-war moviegoers. <br /> <br /> A chance to earn appears when an exhibition boxer challenges any sucker to go with him in the ring for several rounds. This is a natural temptation for Bradfield / Dorney, but there is a spoon in the ointment. Who should appear besides New York Detective Monty Phelan, the mockery of the department? He was on duty at the morgue for ages because of a small mistake at the beginning of his career, which sent an innocent man to Old Sparky (we all make mistakes, right?) Phelan learned Bradfield from a news photo, and he is there to watch the fight and pinch. Claude Raines is a policeman who has endured and humiliated his fellow officers for years. <br /> <br /> What follows is predictable, but it is well developed. I hope it was the main feature when it was released - too good to evaluate as a "B" second on the tent. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley, best known as an outstanding choreographer, put "They made me a" Criminal "and Max Steiner, one of the most prolific Hollywood composers who wrote good but not unusual music for the film. <br /> <br /> Now available on Alpha Video DVDs, the film pushed me back. $ 4.99 and it gave me real pleasure. I’ll watch it again. <br /> <br /> 8/10
