Before watching this movie - brush your ears, remove eye make-up and tell your girlfriend to stop kissing you. She should not. This picture will give both of you enough warmth to keep your relationship for life. If you are a Jew / Russian / Ukrainian / immigrant - yes, what a popular minority film ever - laugh in your memories. If you are something else or something else, laugh at the bitter-sweet memory of the importance of friendship and family. There is nothing strange in this film, however strange it may seem. However, I am afraid that few people will see this film, because this is not the type of image that people watch when they go to the movies. But please do it for humanity, and don't forget to get a soundtrack, for fun.
