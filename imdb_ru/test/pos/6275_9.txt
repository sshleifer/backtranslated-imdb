Miles O'Keefe again assumes the role of the mighty Ator in this first sequel of the original film. <br /> <br /> What can I say? - It pretty much represents B-Movie Nirvana! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, the script is terrible, the acting is everywhere, special effects .... well, let's not even go there! - In general, this film is a real pleasure! <br /> <br /> Highlights of the film: Ator and Tong (his mute companion, not his underwear) are attacked by invisible attackers in the cave (of course, saved on the budget of currencies!), Ator is fighting what must be the unconvincing giant snake that ever made celluloid, and, of course, the infamous scene of a hanging ray! <br /> <br /> I have one question, though ...... at the end of the film we see a huge atomic explosion, when Ator allegedly destroys the Geometric Core (as the narrator tells us) .... .. like, damn it, Ator destroyed it and managed to get out alive ?! Has he come up with some form of primitive timer / detonator or something like that? <br /> <br /> Well, such an illogical ending really only adds to the film a general charm - they simply no longer make them so!
