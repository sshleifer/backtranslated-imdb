Plunkett and Macklin fall into my favorite movie genre (historical action movie with comedy), so I guess I appreciate it so highly. <br /> <br /> In the center of events - a robber (Plunkett) and a simple gentleman. who gets confused with him and his schemes (Macklin). This leads to all sorts of escapades and adventures that are colored with comedy. There is also, of course, love interest. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast consists of many bright, more than vital characters that add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses that are now rich. <br /> <br /> This is a nice movie with a rather simple but interesting plot that offers a lot of entertainment.
