Chris Smith Smith American Film - An Insightful Analysis of the American Dream. The film is about Marc Borchardt, an independent director from Wisconsin. Mark dreamed of becoming a great writer and director from adolescence, when he had an unfocused hi8 camera. The film follows Mark through his attempt to make his dream film, Northwest. There are some funny scenes in the film when Mark is pre-filming Northwest, and then his short film Coven (pronounced “coven”, correct pronunciation, Mark says: “It sounds too much like a stove”) and he plans to use to raise money to complete the Northwest. The insight and humor of this film are on par with Roger and myself, a wonderful Michael Moore film. I first watched it at the chaotic screening of the Sundance Film Festival, which revealed the spirit of the film - a giant duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the film, hit seven people and caused a delay of twenty-five minutes; in the middle of the film, the sound began to quiver, and the projector had to be stopped to repair, and in the last twenty minutes the projector stopped, and the film burned. Despite the delays, viewers continued to watch the movie and applauded him. The American film also won a grand jury prize for a documentary at the end of the festival. I highly recommend this beautiful film, which is worth seeing through any hell of a show.
