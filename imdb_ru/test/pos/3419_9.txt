The difference of this film from the traditional Hollywood film is that it shows the true depth of feelings. For example, in Europe we had war years, and although one nation could never destroy another, old enemies always ended up living side by side with each other or with each other at the end of a conflict. In the US, the white population of immigrants destroyed the aboriginal population almost to extinction. a US citizen never had to live with his enemy. This explains, in my opinion, the often simplistic nature of Hollywood films when they try to explain conflicts in a foreign country. But in this film, the director and script did not fall into this clich√©. It turns out that everyone in the story has something right, but something wrong. it's a great story about morality, hidden truth and compromise.
