Being relatively young, I did not know how bad anti-Semitism was in Brooklyn, where my family came from. This movie absolutely horrified me. I have seen many films about prejudice, racism and anti-Semitism, but it seems that it struck me more than most. <br /> <br /> It was definitely one of the best indie films I've ever seen .. I had to drive 45 minutes to see it, and it was worth it. Almost everything in the movie was great. Sometimes it was a bit slow, but it didn't bother me, because the film was very atmospheric. It happened in the 40s and really looked as if it were the 40s. The game was great ... William H. Macy, as always, was beautiful, as was Laura Dern, and I was pleasantly surprised by the game of Mitl√∂f playing an evil anti-Semite neighbor. <br /> <br /> 9/10
