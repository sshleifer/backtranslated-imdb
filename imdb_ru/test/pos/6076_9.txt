It was curious to know the name of the Tuscan village, where the shooting took place in Italy. I know the name of the villa: Villa San Girolamo, however, I would like to know the exact location in Tuscany. The cinematography is excellent and it would be great to visit this area. I would also be interested to know what is the location of filming in the desert. I travel a lot in Europe and Africa, and it would be interesting for me to visit the places that were discussed in the book and movie. Please email me any information about sites that anyone can have. We would be very grateful. And if someone finds out whether the villa in Tuscany is still habitable, it would also be great. I am waiting for any information and thank you in advance for your time.
