I was surprised how much I liked it. Of course, this is a bit of a slow movement in parts, but what else can you expect from Rollin? There is also a lot of nudity, there is nothing wrong with that, especially the fact that there is a lot of gorgeous Brigitte Lahai in it. There are also some spectacularly erotic dead, perhaps a little smarter, but most effective. There is also a sci-fi storyline with a brief explanation at the end, but I wouldn't worry too much about it. No, here we have the most interesting study of memory and the effect of memory loss, and how far we are still alive without memory. David Cronenberg is mentioned on the cover of my DVD, and although it may not be as good as his best films, there are some similarities here, especially with the large use of seemingly threatening architecture and the effective and creepy use of interior space. As I tried to point out that this is by no means a terrific roaring thriller, this is a fascinating, nightmare-like film that makes most of its seats, including the terrific railway situation at the end.
