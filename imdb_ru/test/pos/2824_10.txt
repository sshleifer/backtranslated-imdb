Well, first of all, to all haters: get a life! I do not understand why you generally write on these boards, when, obviously, you know nothing about cinema, robots or people. <br /> <br /> This film has important lessons that we all need to learn about sex, stereotypes, relationships, and FATE. In fact, we are all robots that are programmed to respond in a certain way to certain stimuli without thinking. How many times have we seen the sunset and made some banal comments without even thinking about it? I say, THANK YOU, Aqua (brilliantly played by Bernadette Peters) for making me stop and think about the amazing power of mother nature. <br /> <br /> Only when Val and Aqua begin to abandon their programs, they begin to understand their true desire - to find love and leave the factory in search of creative life. This film should be a must-see in prisons - just think of dreams and hopes that can inspire prisoners. maybe even they can overcome their “bad” programs and join the rest of us in a world free of crime. <br /> <br /> We can all learn a lot from these robots. I am the best person for heartbeeps.
