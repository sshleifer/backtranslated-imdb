ATTENTION: Reading this record after watching a movie! Like The Light Horseman, released a year earlier, Joe is trying to illustrate what happens when counterculture and dominant (albeit right) America meet: a violent end comes. Although for the most part this film is a slow show of the traditional "old fashion" of American morality compared to the "do what feels good" way of life in the 1960s, it is also a comment on the higher and lower middle class and their inability to meet in the middle, as shown, when the comptons meet the Curran. Boyle Joe represents a generation stuck in the 1940s and '50s, when “Killing a communist for mom (or japa or hippie for that matter) is good, as long as it helps and saves America. Joe and wife Mary Joe are clearly the archetypes for Archie Bunker and Dingbat's wife, Edith. This film - which will forever be known for its cruel (but not bloody - blood is not visible at all) - however, ends unevenly. Joe scolds (verbally) the hippie generation, then (literally) lays down with them to get into their numbers, to find Compton's daughter - when it is clear that he had to be discarded by this idea, but refuses the idea of ​​separatists for sex. When he is betrayed through theft (read: the trust of the older generation to the new generation), he pounces through an unrelenting chain of murders. Perhaps it is because of Tarantino in Hollywood that the observer expects a bloody death in the final scene, but bloodless executions crave any impact or realism. "Joe" is not a very good film, but it represents an interesting demonstration of the alienation of class and culture, as well as the animals that underlie the extremes of the gap between generations.
