I don't know what some people thought when they said that this film was bad. Was cool. The classic Bruce Campbell, yes, it was a low-budget project, and this showed a special effect, but this is not what you see in Bruce’s movie to watch for Bruce. Also Ted Rami was superb. I found this movie fun and interesting, I still get upset when I remember Bruce on this pink moped. Now I admit that this film is not for everyone, if you don’t like movies B, you probably don’t like this movie if you crave big budget effects and the actors stay away. But if you like slap and science fiction plots, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Hail King Baby!
