Bergman and comedy do not quite agree. Some of his comedies are so sassy that you almost shudder. This film has a strange moment - the last 30 seconds - this is a nadir, but in general it is a charming (and not funny) film that gives pleasure in everything. Bergman shoots a few of his usual suspects, who perform well. In the train between David, Marianne and the clumsy seller, I remember a great scene. Some of the marriage materials are the typical cynical Bergman, but this is Bergman in a light, not dark mood. <br /> <br /> This film has its moments, and it costs more than 90 minutes. Not one of his classics or a place to start if you want to fall in love with Bergman.
