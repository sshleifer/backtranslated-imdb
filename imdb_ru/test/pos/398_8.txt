<br /> <br /> “The Last Frontier” is an excellent West, overcoming the numerous shortcomings in weaving its history of the Jedi Traps (Victor Mature), Gus (James Witmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationship with the army in particular, Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston (Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, wife of Colonel (Ann Bancroft). Jed, Gus and Mungo, hired as scouts after losing their reserves for the Indians, are adapting to live a “civilized” life in a fort on the edge of the “last frontier”. Jed, who was raised by Gus, inspires and looks at the "elders" of Gus and Mungo, and it is especially difficult for him to deal with "civilization." His real problems begin after he is greatly attracted to the wife of Colonel Corrin. Colonel Marston is a reckless man who threatens everyone around him with his dreams of a ruthless victory over any adversary. Corrina, a woman depressed by her position and sense of responsibility, loves her husband for who he may be, and Jed for who he is. In the middle is Captain Riordon, a brave and handsome man, torn by his duty to the army, his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the possible catastrophic consequences of the recklessness of the colonel. <br /> <br /> What makes this film so interesting (and also fascinating) is that in most cases the weaknesses and strengths of the “Last Stand” are exactly the same elements (forget about the tasteless title and outdated music ). ) <br /> <br /> First, the script. Almost all sub-subjects (in particular, the reckless colonel) were made better elsewhere, but rarely met with such eccentricity. Just when you THINK you know what happens next, this one takes off in a DIFFERENT direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER: "The Final Frontier" - the film "Production Code" (at a time when the word "virgin" was taboo), it is very surprising that the factor of adultery was treated in such a mature, tolerable way. I expected that either Jed or the colonel's wife would reap some punishment for their sin. I was surprised and a little disappointed that the film did not use this expectation to create a less predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Secondly, casting. An older man, at least ten years older, to play the role of Jed, a wild-eyed innocent man who grew up in the forest. ” James Whitmore, who plays Gus, "the man who raised Jed," is actually five years younger than Mature. However, Mature is very cute, playing a character who is innocent of civilization, but by no means stupid. Although at the time there were several actors who could play this role (especially Bert Lancaster and Kirk Douglas), none of them could play Jed better. Preston (also the youngest of the Mature) plays Colonel Marston, losing sight of the tics and affects you would expect from such an obsessed person. However, Preston perfectly reflects the sense of honor that someone must have seen in Marston to promote such a foolish fool to the rank of colonel. Bancroft is a particularly astute choice, like Corrina. Bancroft's dark hair died blond, and it has the same effect as Winona Ryder (“Edward Scissorhands”) and Christina Ricci (“Sleepy Hollow”). That is, I felt a conflict with the character, not knowing exactly why; I believe that the answer lies in the fact that blondes and brunettes have significantly different skin tones and eye shades. In addition, Bancroft has always designed strength that borders on stiffness (although here blond hair softens it a little). This allows 24-year-old Bancroft to stand face to face with both 40-year-old mature and 37-year-old Preston; Yes, she may be the wife of the colonel. Madison, like Riordan, behaves cautiously, balancing a difficult role and sometimes unpleasant dialogue. Playing a role similar to that of John Wayne in Fort Apache, Madison does a more skillful job. The film has the camaraderie "Silverado". This in itself makes it worthy of attention. It also has unforgettable performances, a beautiful script and a lot of action and direction. I only hope that the mailbox version is available (many have been lost), because this film makes full use of this format.
