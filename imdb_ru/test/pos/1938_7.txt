"The Edge of the River" was one of the most disturbing films of 1986, and during the year, when he also saw Blue Velvet, you know, it says something. Today he has lost his strength and remains much better than the overvalued "Children." The preview of "Children" played out to expose the youth of the nation. In fact, it was just a film about exploitation, based mostly on shock value. River's Edge was advertised as a teenage exploitation scenario, but in fact it was much better. The only time it gets in the way of being disgusting is a permanent image of a dead naked body. In addition, the film is suggestive and, for all its minor flaws, quite realistic. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves, known as an especially wooden performer, gives his best performance as a burnt teenager, Lonely Sky is equally responsive and pleasant. Dennis Hopper (on the way to returning with this, “Blue Velvet” and “Hoosiers”) does an excellent job with the work as a creepy but pitiful relic of the hippy generation. Crispin Glover, although he is always interesting to see, seems a bit out of place as a manic stoner and group leader. The best performance, however, is definitely Daniel Roubak. Like John's killer, Roebuck is frighteningly emotionless. It is a pity that he did not become a bigger star, because he is a much better actor than Reeves. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole is fantastic and bold. Don't mix it up with another lame John Hughes movie, for example, The Breakfast Club. This is a shocking piece of nihilism that resonates with the viewer. Fans of this film are advised to watch the 1981 Canadian film "Out of the Blue", directed by Dennis Hopper. This is another shockingly dismal study of the gap between generations, and, despite its gloom, may have had an impact on the "Edge of the River." (7/10)
