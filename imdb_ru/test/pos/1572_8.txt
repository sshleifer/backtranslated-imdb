It is a low-budget, well-functioning little gem. Alice, a teenager from a small town in Massachusetts, fed up with her existence, sets out on the road to escape from her mother, who turns burgers and her own work as a check in a supermarket. She goes to Florida and stops at her richer school friend, who is new to Miami. After her car broke down suspiciously on the road and she lost all her money, she eventually retires to an RV that also travels to Florida. The couple, brilliantly played by Judith Ivy and Bill Raymond, are overly hospitable and, it turns out, a prostitute and her pimp. Slowly, Alice is lured into prostitution by a truck stop as the RV wanders down through the general direction in Florida. Through periodic memories, we learn a little more about Alice and her desire to leave tiny Milford. We also see the couple in a new light, and their life and choices made by the couple and Alice seem completely trustworthy. An excellent, well-made film that you will think about when it ends.
