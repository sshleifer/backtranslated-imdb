Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin’s longest films at the time — a clever and surprisingly complex parody of Prosper Merime’s then-famous Carmen story. I was a little embarrassed by the difference between the IMDb listing “Burlesque 1915 on Carmen” and the 1916 version. Based on the duration of the work, I guess it was the 1915 version, which I saw, since the 1916 version is 20 minutes longer, and from what I read, these are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, it becomes clear that Burlesk on Carmen is one of Chaplin’s most difficult and ambitious efforts to date, starting with a long story told in the inter-names about Carmen’s tragic love story. <br /> <br /> Carmen is sent by a Gypsy squad (“A squad that turns a GYP into a Gypsy”) to seduce a Spanish officer so that he can start his smuggling operation. This is a clever Chaplin group of criminals whose leader, Lillas Pastia, "spent 50 years learning to steal, thinking that they could offer him a job in politics." <br /> <br /> In addition to this, I have seen some almost misogynistic messages and anecdotes in some of Chaplin’s early works, but probably not as explicit as in this one. At the beginning of the film, when a group of Gypsies are traveling, there is a scene where mules and women are loaded, and in one of the headlines it is explained that "mules are those with long ears." If you could not tell, I think. <br /> <br /> Chaplin plays the role of Don Jose, the unfortunate officer Carmen is supposed to seduce. He is described as a "brave soldier and lover of women." Not quite what Chaplin needs, which removed any doubts about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant Shoulder Arms. And, of course, he did not need to act because he loved women. <br /> <br /> The difference here is, of course, in its polished military uniform and strict disciplinary manner, interspersed, of course, with some of its traditional slap movements. He seems to me a little guy with an authoritative position, struggling to maintain the respect of his subordinates, showing a rude, impassive appearance. <br /> <br /> Soon, Carmen appears (“Beloved by all men under the age of 96 ??”), and she immediately begins to flirt with Charlie. I have to say that for most films, he is surprisingly true to the original story, which was full of jealousy and tragedy. Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover who can arouse jealous passion that I have never seen from him. There is at least one scene where he is really a little scary. <br /> <br /> Chaplin’s movie There are some great shows, for example, fun table dance and classic skies with swords at the end.And his boyish charm and the role of a soldier are also certainly a winning combination, although there is another peculiar trick involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that were not very effective from the very beginning continued, and probably about five times longer than it was worth, although it was interesting that when he finally fell, he was clearly shown as a cinematic support. I always appreciate such glimpses on old film sets. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is its strongest part. It bears a striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet, but even when you think that Chaplin will conduct a major thematic experiment, distancing himself from his traditional style, a merry turnaround occurs, as vintage as everything I've ever seen. Well done!
