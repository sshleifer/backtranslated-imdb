I really love this movie !!! I didn’t play Final Fantasy VII, but I still liked the film, it’s really funny, and I like the work the off-screen actors did. The visual effects are so fantastic, and all the lines are so well made. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have a pretty good imagination, so I was able to fill most of the gaps in the film, and I suggest you watch it twice, because many things "suddenly" make sense. <br /> <br /> Also, (this is pretty funny) you have to watch it with subtitles, because what they say and what the submarines say is sometimes completely different, Usually it is quite funny, but sometimes it helps to understand what they say better. <br /> <br /> Look! love marnie
