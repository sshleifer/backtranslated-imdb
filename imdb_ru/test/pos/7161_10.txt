I just got back from the GLBT Film Festival at AMC Loews 34th in New York. A friend told me about this movie. The reaction of the audience was very positive! A lot of good solid laughter, as well as some quiet moments of realization. The highest level in each area. A film that makes you think, and then makes you realize how lucky we all would be if we could turn back time and live without shame and guilt. I believe it will be close, if not win, a favorite reward of the audience! What was most surprising was the fact that the film begins with satire and then slowly turns into a genuine commentary on the negative and sometimes cruel reactions of the very group that he began to make fun of. There is no mean humor at the expense of one group, just a slow realization that we will all be better if we just return to the gentle innocence with which we all started.
