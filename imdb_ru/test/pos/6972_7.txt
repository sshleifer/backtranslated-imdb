Shirley Knight plays Sarah Ravenna, a Long Island housewife who runs away from marriage when she finds out she is pregnant. She plans to enter the center of America and start all over again. On the way, she picks up a friendly hitchhiker (James Caan), who calls herself "The Killer." Soon she discovers that the good-natured "killer" is in fact damaged by the brain, and, lifting it, she unknowingly assumed a huge responsibility. The two of them travel to Nebraska, where Sarah is satisfied with Killer's work on a reptile farm on the road. It is here that Sarah meets Gordon, the local policeman, and soon everything goes terribly wrong for everyone. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful drama about people cut off from society, alienated from the choices they make, or the restrictions imposed on them by others. Even with such a low budget and a very free attitude, the film is able to cover everything that needs to be said through these well-defined characters. Shirley Knight has a complex, divergent role, and there are moments of some awe-inspiring action performed by her. One of my favorites is when she first calls home to her anxious husband. It is such a tense scene at both ends, and in every little gesture and bend the words speak so little about her so little. Then appears the character of "Assassin" by James Caan. This character is not like any one I've ever seen him play, and he plays beautifully. This is one of his best performances, as he is very restrained and mobile. <br /> <br /> The way that Coppola develops characters with short, dream-like memories is very clever, adding a fragmented view of it all. Fast flashbacks that are graphical and self-contained contrast well with longer frames in some important scenes. In addition, since this film was shot on the spot throughout the eastern United States, it offers an interesting, authentic look at America in the late 1960s. <br /> <br /> I didn’t see many other films that Miss Knight starred in. I’m only familiar with her later work on television, I usually play the nursing of my mother-in-law or the old woman. It was great to see her so young, beautiful and so amazingly thin in this film. It’s also a shame of its kind that James Caan became a “tough guy” to the end of his career, because this film proved that he was capable of much more.
