------ ----- Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers ----- -------- Just a few small <br /> <br /> We saw it on Satilite channel missed the first 30 min of the film, This comment will be short and informative. <br /> <br /> The film consists mainly of 5 characters. Acting is very bad for some characters. 1 girl with the help of another girl kidnaps 3 different people, but it leads to the opposite effects, and 3 kidnaps 2. This is one of those types of films where the writers try to be defiant or philosophical, mysterious and ... period; but they themselves, personally, lack the thought that they do not hold out terribly. As one of the captives, who is supposed to be a nerd psycho, looks like a part, but his language cannot speak it. The authors believe that if a nerd amateur uses a lot of letters from 8 letters - I unconsciously believe - that the audience will be ignorant enough to believe it. I would like to give an example, but I can not remember a single one - just as it was said. The ending was also bad. But one captive woman played her part as an old and relatively wise woman, although she, like everyone else, had many cliches. <br /> <br /> So why should I put this movie on 7 stars? if I thought all of the above? Simply put, I give away seven stars to Lisa Keller - one sexy mom. She is beautiful, lol. I appreciate the beauty, and it is just that. But don't get me confused, because I'm not a pervert, and this movie is not porn anyway. I can't explain them, but I like it. I remember the scene when a prisoner broke free and, looking for a way out, crashed into Keller. She tries to leave, but she has no chance. He throws her on his knees on the stairs and pulls off her pants, no panties;). Now, although she has an AMAZING ass - and this picture leaves little to the imagination for a long 30 seconds, I think - it was her facial expression that captured me. she wanted it, and this look made me think that I was behind it. I would have torn this prey! After this expression, I simply could not look at it objectively, I was in love. lol I'm glad I watched this movie, but if Lisa Keller hadn't played a major role, I would change the channel ... well ... after I saw the scene I mentioned above. I'm a fan of LISA KELLER, but she seems not to be a consistent actor, because this 2003 film is her last. But I look forward to another movie with her.
