when I was a kid, it was a movie that I watched. I think this is a great movie for children, and parents should not be afraid of violence or obscene images. Rainbow Bright is a happy young girl who is trying to make the winter go. she discovers that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it for herself. I love this movie, and I think even adults can enjoy this movie.
