Since about 1965, American films have been replaced by shocking and iconoclastic, which was great for that time - a kind of seed that would pave the way for dirtier, bold dramas. However, since the decade itself, which gave rise to these films, was governed by his own convictions, the majority of all films released during this period are dated. CACTUS FLOWER is no exception. Its very name implies a “sunny” romantic comedy with rare errors in risk. This is not to say that it is bad: on the contrary, films about objects of risk must begin somewhere, and America, which is a culture rooted in certain traditions, permeated with profound hypocrisy, shocks itself for this when it sees an indirect reflection of the mores of time. Meanwhile, European films turn to the same situations, look like a million dollars and have a longer shelf life, because what we consider scandalous, they shrug their shoulders, say “Next” and go on. <br /> <br /> Tony Simmons (Goldie Hawn in the lead role), a young, very talented girl of the sixties, talks with a much older dentist named Julian Winston (Walter Mattau), who has problems with obligations. He cannot marry her: he is already married. Tony decides instead to wither, she really wants to meet his wife and "fix everything." The picture shows his assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (bright Ingrid Bergman, returning to American cinema after a twenty-year absence), a woman close to his age, who behaves as if she and he had an ideal marriage and household. There is a reason for this: she had quiet emotions for Julian, emotions that he doesn’t know about, even when he asks her to play his wife in order to keep Tony from wanting to develop her relationship further. And then he climbs up a notch when Tony's blissfully innocent actions turn the action into an unexpected one, and he presents Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston) as Stephanie's “lover”. By the way, Harvey is also an elderly gentleman who has an affair with a much younger woman (Eva Bruce), whom he also lies in one very funny scene. <br /> <br /> It's funny how the person we are looking for is someone who has always been there. What could be an ungrateful role for Rick Lenz, who plays Igor Sullivan, Tony's closest neighbor, turns into a man who not only sees true beauty in another outcast Stephanie, but also the one who saves Tony from suicide. (Not a comedy, suicide. Again, this is not an ordinary comedy.) And, of course, this is a thin, piercing image of Ingrid Bergman of a woman who somehow lost her chances of love, which became barbed, which because of Falsely told another She becomes the real person she always had to be. I can not imagine anyone else in this quiet but deep role. <br /> <br /> Such films can be viewed at face value and viewed as escapist fun — a product of their time — or you can look at the deep symbolism that, like its name, it carries deep inside. This is a tricky film, just like the performances of Houn and Bergman are equally cunning, because, looking so simple, devoid of bloom and posture, they do not go out and do not declare what they are about. Their acting game becomes “not quite acting”, and plays real people, warts and all that. CACTUS FLOWER is a story that seems to never take itself too seriously, but in the end it reveals itself to be deep and very human.
