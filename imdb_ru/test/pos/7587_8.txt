Earlier, I saw this short video on a VHS tape with the Summer Stock feature, and I just re-read every Sunday on the TCM website. This marked the debut of 15-year-old Deanna Durbin and 14-year-old Judy Garland outside her two older sisters. These two teenagers demonstrate their musical talents with a solo from Dinna from Il Bacio, then from Judy from Waltz with Swings before two climaxes from Americana. A small plot of this 11-minute film concerns the potential unemployment of Edna's grandfather (real name Durbin, as she is called here), who is working in the park due to low attendance. With the help of two girls, you can probably guess what will happen next! Contrasts are marked not only by the musical choices of Garland and Durbin, but also by their height, balance and movement. Despite all this, at the end they did well, and itâ€™s almost surprising that MGM chose Garland, while Durbin had already signed a contract with Universal, as this short film was released, but was soon allowed to participate. The debut film (Three Smart Girls) was at the beginning of the preparatory stages. Judy herself would play her first role (The Pig Parade) at 20th Century-Fox, when MGM decided which movie she would be next star. It would be the Broadway Melody of 1938, where she would play the number, stopping the show, "Dear Mr. Gable" You made me love you). But back to this short talk. Every Sunday gives a warm and wonderful look at the two star singers at the beginning of their legendary career, not knowing what awaits them in the future ...
