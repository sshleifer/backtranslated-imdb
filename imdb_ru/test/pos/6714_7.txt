No, Lifeforce is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This is an ordinary film with good effects and a convincing plot (and, of course, Matilda May). In fact, this may be one of my favorite science fiction / horror films for the simple reason that they are trying to clarify the science of space vampires. How often do you see it? Even in Alien (science fiction / science fiction film of all times) science does not enter history at all. In Vital Force they try to justify an unreasonable world. <br /> <br /> Now I think he is successful? Not. I think the film has the problem of a massive cast of the ensemble that Hooper strains to constantly collect and watch, and that the audience should focus on more than one "villain" and have too many road trips. > <br /> Honestly, the film is very nice looking and interesting to watch. but here the great remake has a lot of potential to get hold of what Hooper was trying to do, and really create a strong, scary SF / horror film. <br /> <br /> However, if the remake does happen, I demand that Matilda May have a cameo.
