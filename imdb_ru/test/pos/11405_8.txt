All you need is a great house, nanny and telephone. Simon West directs this exciting and frightening remake of the 1979 original. This version is more a thriller than a horror movie. Emotionally tense with increasing fear factor. Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) has to work out excessive cell phone bill; she takes on the task of nursing the two children of Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis (Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant). The house is a wonderful masterpiece of wood and glass of the 1970s. Secluded and calm. The children are already in bed, the wind increases, and torrential rain joins them. The phone starts ringing, ringing, ringing. The nanny is soon in insane survival mode in fear of the creepy stranger on the other end of the phone. <br /> <br /> Bell is gorgeous, like an innocent, smart and strong teenage nanny. The voice of a stranger on the phone is the voice of Lance Henriksen, and the stranger is played by Tommy Flanagan. Also featured: Katie Cassidy and Brian Geraghty. Kudos to James Dooley for atmospheric original music.
