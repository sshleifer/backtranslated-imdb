There is only one film I can think of that can be as good or better than this one when it comes to Bugs Bunny and Duffy Duck - ALI BABA BUNNY. However, the definition of what is best does not matter - just watch them both and enjoy. <br /> <br /> I compared this with ALI BABA BUNNY, because both show Duffy in his absolute worst condition - greedy, nasty and very funny in the process. However, I think I prefer RABBIT SEASONING simply because Bugs are also pretty awful about doing terrible things right in front of Daffy every time Daffy tries to spoil. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Daffy, the leaving rabbit tracks up to the Bugs hole in the hope that the hunter (of course, this Elmer) will blow up the rabbit and leave Duffy alone! To keep up, Bugs again and again takes all the tricks of Duffy and turns them around - and in most cases this is due to the fact that Duffy gets a shot in the face! It's all very, very clever and funny, and I don’t care how old you are, this cartoon will make you laugh if you don’t grumble. I especially like the magnificent and unexpected finale, but I will not speak anymore because I don’t want to spoil the surprise.
