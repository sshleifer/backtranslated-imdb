I gave him a seven just because the game is good. And, of course, I mean Wilkinson. The other two principals were "decent." But the characters themselves ... what's so bad about the character Wilkinson (James Manning) played? I did not see him behaving as if Martinet Emily Watson blamed him for this. Bill Bull, on the other hand, was an intolerable jerk whom I prayed to meet an extremely cruel and long-term demise. Who am I kidding? Tom Wilkinson is not Paul Bettany after all. So what on earth can character Emily Watson (Ann) SEE in him ???? She herself admitted that he was pretty much a part in handling her. Why would she even want to be in the same CITY as he, not to mention the same “room”. <br /> <br /> I noticed several other reviews, one person said that she “cried” at the end to witness the tragedy of James. ??? WHAT is a tragedy? What, you mean to lose the idiot who will find someone like Bill Beal? Give us a break.
