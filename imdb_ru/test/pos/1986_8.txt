I always believed that the plot of a movie based on a virtual reality video game never sounded like it would be something special, but eXistenZ proved that I could not be mistaken. This film is incredible and, although very interesting, offers much more than that. From start to finish, this film makes you wonder, and you can draw so many ideas that you cannot make a final conclusion. David Cronenberg has a talent for this, as he does a lot of things. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ - pure Cronenberg; The way it is written and how it is directed is unique to its style, and it can only be good. Cronenberg set himself a clear goal in this film, and viewers should have guessed what he did with obvious ease. His love for the grotesque is not so prevalent in this film, as in “The Fly” or “Naked Lunch”, but there are still some elements, such as game modules and how they are made, which can make the audience start. As for his earlier work, eXistenZ is more like a combination of a Videodrome and less cruel scanners, a rather surprising combination. The task of the film in the not-so-distant future was a really good decision, because it allowed Kronenberg to be extremely inventive around films and also allowed him to visualize more concepts, allowing him to slow down his writing less. It was important that the film not become too confusing, and Cronenberg avoided it very well, leaving things relatively simple. In addition, if he wanted to make a film that could not be watched, he would know how to do it much better than this. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ boasts an extremely talented cast of actors, and they all play very well. Jennifer Jason Lee gives outstanding performance as a game designer who spends more time out of reality than in her. Lee is sexy and in command in her role as Allegra, and she really gets her teeth to the role. The emotional range that she shows in the film is especially impressive, which makes her completely believable (if you can believe it). Jude Law is also good and very convincing that his character is afraid of implantation. The chemistry between the two is very electric and gives the film an additional flavor. Jan Holm and Willem Dafo are just two of the great supporting actors who add depth to the film with very colorful performances. The cast of the film is small, but eXistenZ definitely has an “quality is better than quantity” ethic that works very well. <br /> <br /> In addition to being interesting and thought-provoking, eXistenZ also addresses such social issues as control and loss of self. It additionally demonstrates the film as an intelligent ship and can also explain why it was not a huge Hollywood hit. At eXistenZ there is so much, and although it is not to everyone’s taste, this film will appeal to those who love the work of Kronenberg or like science fiction. This is one of those films that you need to watch with an open heart, but it really is something special.
