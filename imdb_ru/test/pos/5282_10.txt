Rarely, when a film takes you to its own world and leaves much to be desired as soon as it goes. “Ponyo” by Hayao Miyazaki is such a film. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a young goldfish named Ponyo, who wants to become a man. She swims to the beach and is found by a boy named Sasuke, who promises to take care of her. Of course, Ponyo’s father, an ecologically obsessed sorcerer named Fujimoto, is trying to keep Ponyo from becoming human in order to preserve the balance of nature, which will eventually turn over when Ponyo finally turns into a little girl, causing a massive typhoon. <br /> <Ponyo is a very rich movie. He is full of amazing fantasies, cute characters and sincere hearts. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki made a little story here, creating real cinema magic. <br /> <br /> Ponyo is an exciting experience. The love between Sasuke and Ponyo is very pure and true. The ecologist in Miyazaki is as obvious in this film as in all of his previous works. Miyazaki reveals the dirt and mud that falls into the ocean in an almost startling light, not to mention that Father Ponio has an obsessive mission to clean up the world's oceans. While the story is simple, Miyazaki manages to add this extra layer to provoke thoughts with skillful skill. <br /> <br /> The film is a beautiful work of art, each hand-drawn cell looks like an amazing pastel painting. The film does not look like many other productions studio Ghibli, but artistry is still as effective as before. Watching the underwater scenes is just wonderful, Fujimoto's sea fortress is very inventive, and the sequence in which Ponyo stumbles upon a jumping fish in a typhoon to get to Sosuke is a cult one. <br /> <br /> Of course, thanks to his wonderfully executed characters make this film unforgettable. Sosuke is a young boy who acts older than he really is, and an energetic ponyo laughs for a minute. Each character is very pleasant and memorable. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ponyo is an amazing experience, captivating in every way. Although the film may be sold as a children's fairy tale, I believe that many adults will be swept away in his fantasy world with their children. While the film may lack the density of some of Miyazaki's previous works, here he keeps it clean and simple, being truthful with himself, delivering a film that will be funny, heartbreaking and interesting - all in one. This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I give Ponyo the perfect 10 out of 10!
