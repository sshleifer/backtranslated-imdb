Why is it better? Because this is true for the dark vision of the comic. Because the images are creative and, unlike the first, there are real moments of fear and pathos. The former had too many Jack Nicholson tricks, too much prince music and an awkward “romance”. Here instead of one villain there are three of them. There is no Robert Hulk, and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face. In fact, Pfeiffer is the # 1 landmark of this film. Its transformation is what drives the main theme, balancing on the verge of sanity and madness, good and evil. She gets really scary. The costumes and makeup are great. Penguin Danny DeVito is inspired and tortured, and not just crazy. His circus gang squad is one of the elements of comic relief (aside from this giant duck). Max Shrek is the only character I would reassure, Walken is rather boorish, like a ruthless businessman. The score of Danny Elfman, as usual, is perfect, and the song of Siushi and Banshee (Face to Face) is the best song from any of the films, the perfect combination of a musical artist and movie soundtrack. The least funny of the films, it is dark, does not condone, and requires a second and third viewing, like a trip to an amusement park. Bravo Tim Burton and the cast!
