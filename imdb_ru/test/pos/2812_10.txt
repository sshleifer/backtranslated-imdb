Gerald McRoney, (Dave Morgan), War Crimes, TV series 01, was like Tiffany Thyssen's father, (Jennifer Gallagher), Kiss Before A Lie, '03, who experienced a very bad situation in his life and this made Jennifer to be recalled with people and young people. Dave Morgan is desperately trying to get her out of the house, and he manages to introduce Jennifer to Chris (Gallagher), who falls madly in love with her at his first meeting. After almost one or two dates, Chris asks Jennifer if she will marry him, and she agrees. Shortly after the wedding, everything starts to happen, Chris works in the navy and does not like to work on submarines, and with the young girls in the neighborhood events begin to occur. This is a very good TV movie, and sometimes it makes you wonder if the guy or girl I want as a soul mate is the perfect person!
