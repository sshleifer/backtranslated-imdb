I just watched The Tale of Two Sisters last night and I really liked it. I have been a big fan of Asian horror films lately and I think this is a strong entry from South Korea. Not so much to scare you, as in the usual American horror film, but the director very well supports the mood of anticipation and foreboding, especially in the awkward relationship of the characters with each other. Most of them are more conceptual and play on everyone’s fears of “something under the bed” when they were children, but in this case it’s a cupboard and a sink. I also liked how the director was able to capture how unfavorable this household was with such scenes as the first dinner that the characters spend together. He is also good at uncovering the inner life and fragility of people with simple scenes, such as a stepmother, erasing makeup in a mirror or sitting in front of a flickering TV. I think this film is mainly a study of the guilt and consequences of living with the guilt hanging over you. <br /> <br /> BASIC SPOILERS AHEAD I was pretty good at keeping track of history, but when I was dragging my bag, I started to get confused. However, I think the memories at the end definitely tied everything together. The film is very similar to the "Machinist" in the sense that the joint guilt of the two characters ultimately leads to mental disorders and delusions. <br /> <br /> Here is my interpretation of the film. Su-Yon, which we see after the girls had to return to the house, is either a deception of Su-Mi, or a real ghost of Su-Yeon, with whom only Su-Mi can see and interact. The original stepmother, whom we see, in my opinion, the delusion of Su-Mi. However, there is a real stepmother, and she first appears in the film when she wears a gray trouser suit. I believe that this is a real stepmother, with which her father talks on the phone during the first part of the film, and she does not appear until he picks her up and leads her to the house. Up to this point, the stepmother is Su-Mi (perhaps part of her split personality?). This explains the bizarre sequence of dinner parties when the stepmother's brother looks at her as if she is crazy and does not remember anything she tells. I think that Su-Mi plays out his stepmother as part of his forked personality. The film shows this later in the bag-dragging scene and scenes, such as a stepmother, wiping her makeup in a mirror, which, as it turns out later, is actually Su-Mi wiping her makeup in a mirror. <br /> <br /> I think the ghosts in the house didn’t quite imagine Su-Mi, and they belong to either Su-Yon, or mother, or both. In the last memory, it turns out that Su-Yon was wearing a green dress and had a hairpin in the balance when she died. This is a green dress, which they showed earlier on a ghost sitting at the dinner table, while the stepmother looked under the sink. In addition, this hairpin, which Soo-Yon wore in the memory that appears on the floor when the stepmother looks under the sink. <br /> <br /> A real stepmother, after all, is punished by the ghost of Soo-young, who appears in a scene a bit like The Ring. After that, the scene of memories binds everything together in terms of the fact that the stepmother was primarily responsible for her death, and Su-Mi inadvertently played a supporting role. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the “mother” that Su-Yon sees when she goes to her room to cry is already a ghost in her memories. Perhaps by this time the mother had already committed suicide in the closet. This remains ambiguous. <br /> <br /> Other things that are offered but not clearly explained in the film are that it seems that the stepmother was a nurse at some point, might have cared for the mother and contributed to her death. . It is not clear when her relationship with her father began, and whether this did not lead to the fact that the mother committed suicide. It is also assumed that the mother had mental problems requiring a nurse. The stepmother hints at this when she says to Su-Mi that you start caring for your mother. I do not think she meant only physically. <br /> <br /> In addition, if we assume that the original stepmother we see is actually Su-Mi, that is, an incest assumption, since the father is sleeping with her, That's why Su-Mi goes crazy and screaming, “Don't touch me” every time your father reaches out to her in later scenes? These are the “dirty deeds you have committed” that she mentions in a subsequent conversation with her father? This film is interesting for its ability to different interpretations. However, some scenes were kind of derivative, for example, a woman in black, crawling around the scene, which reminded me of Kayako's thorny movements in the films Ju-On / The Grudge. In addition, the final scene, where the stepmother finally gets her desserts, reminds “The Ring”. Moreover, the very idea that some characters can be ghosts is taken from the “Sixth Sense” or “Others”. <br /> <br /> Overall, I liked it, and it will be interesting to see how the Hollywood remake (which is already in production) works out. I have to be honest, I liked "The Ring" and "The Grudge", so I'm not one of those mocking types who insist that remakes can't be good either. One remake that I’m really excited about is Dark Water coming out this summer. I haven’t seen the original Japanese version yet, but both films are definitely on my watch list.
