Much slip rather than flop, mister. IMPERIUM plays the role of Ezio Pinza in the role of Alex, the heir and subsequently the king of a small European nation, who fell in love with the finished American actress and actress Fredd Barlo (Lana Turner), but because of the machinations of crafty Prime Minister Alex the King, played by Cedric Hardwick, the lovers are separated for 12 years, and then reunited in Palm Springs, where their love is kindled. Director Don Hartman, who also writes scripts, cannot fully use his talent for a lively dialogue due to Pinzoy's trial use of the English language, and the necessary rewriting, combined with fewer common links in the testimonies between the two stars, leads to somewhat uneven the tone of the script, exacerbated by the unfair cutting in the studio of many scenes, which leads to a confusing final. Strong Pinza dominates his scenes with Turner, but both performers do an excellent job, while Marjorie Mine impresses with his patter effect, as it is written, with Debbie Reynolds, put on the track Louis B. Meyer for SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN as a result of her cheerful performance here; only Barry Sullivan was badly hurt by the slaughter. Beautifully filmed mainly in Pebble Beach, California and other neighborhoods of Monterey County, the film is endowed with Pinza’s powerful iron opera bass in Solament-Una-Vese, as well as Harold Arlen’s original songs and Dorothy Fields, with superb sound processing by Douglas Shearer. Record and notice must be made of the elegant decorations of Edwin Willis and the effective designs of Walter Plunkett costumes.
