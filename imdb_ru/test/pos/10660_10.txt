A masterpiece of the silent film Battleship Potemkin (1925) was commissioned by the Soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 1905 uprising and make this event a heroic omen of the October 1917 revolution. Ironically, the film director Sergei Eisenstein was one of the earliest and most influential supporters of the formalist approach to cinema. Subsequently, Eisenstein's formalism and suspicious policies will cause innumerable conflicts with government agencies insisting on "socialist realism." Under the influence of Russian cinematographer Lev Kuleshov, and through him - “Intolerance” D.G. Griffith (smuggled into Russia in 1919), Eisenstein created his films from the “collision” of quickly edited images, editing frames of various lengths, movement, content, lighting and camera viewing angle. Without a doubt, the most memorable illustration of Eisenstein's stylistic approach — and probably the only most cited and studied sequence in world cinema history — is the sequence of “Odessa Steps” in Potemkin. <br /> <br /> According to the structure, Potemkin is a “five” “Reeller” is divided into five narrative parts, an organization clearly originating from the five-stage scheme of Western drama. In People and Larvae, Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and dissatisfaction of the working-class sailors of the battleship, as the situation inevitably develops into rebellion. Even before the sailors and their high-class officers / masters were visually represented, Eisenstein symbolically creates revolutionary conditions by editing collisions with waves that violently and ominously break into the sea. On board the ship, we observe crowded, unsanitary conditions. Eisenstein stresses the inhumanity of the sailors with the shots of random lashes, of hard labor and, most notably, of meat infected by a larva intended for supper in the evening. The rest of the ship’s myopic doctors put forward other officers to declare that the meat is perfect for serving with a dark soup boiling like the wrath of sailors. In accordance with Marxist principles, the church also leads people, and we see one of them breaking the plate on which words from the Lord’s Prayer are written, from two different points of view (perhaps in the first deliberate “jump jump” in film history ). br /> <br /> Indicated by the interdisciplinary names “Drama on the Quarter” and “Appeal of the Dead”, the second and third parts of Potemkin depict the actual insurrection and funeral of its leader and the first hero of the revolution on the shore. Vakulinchuk. United by the calls of Vakulinchuk for fraternity, the initial rebels join the whole team in attacking the officers. This is followed by a chaotic scene, whose fierce passion is well used by Eisenstein's editing techniques. Quarters of officers trampled, and the symbols of their privileges destroyed. The ship's doctor is thrown overboard, accompanied by dramatic transitions to the larvae-covered meat, and his glasses hang metonymically in the rigging. Unfortunately, the death of Vakolinchuk is the price paid for the rebellion (without an omelette without breaking eggs), and he laid out with dignity on the Odessa pier. Hundreds of ordinary citizens of Odessa gather together with sailors to honor him and take an oath of "death to the oppressors." Shooting fists and releasing fists signal the birth of a revolutionary consciousness. <br /> <br /> The complex and unforgettable sequence of “Odessa Steps” is the fourth act of the film. It begins with uplifting music and a series of large and medium shots on the jubilant faces of various people on the beach and selected items (umbrella, glasses, baby carriage). Suddenly (as the title card says in huge letters), the music stops, and at the top of the steps, lines of soldiers appear with painted rifles and fixed bayonets. Here, Eisenstein reveals the full power of collision editing, as nearly a hundred shots are put together to counter panic chaos and victimization of citizens with the relentless attack of soldiers driving citizens to the trampling horses and flying sabers waiting for the Cossacks waiting below, the staircase is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the stairs to the upstairs stairs and flying sabers waiting for the Cossacks waiting below, the staircase is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the stairs to the top of the stairs to the top of the staircase below. symbolic metonyms of the Russian despotic institutions: the royal monarchy and the Orthodox Church. <br /> <br /> Punctuation sequence - two scenes involving mothers and children. In the first case, the mother and the young man, who were represented among the joyful people in the crowd, are among the first victims of the slaughterhouse. The boy was shot, but the mother continues to run until a close-up of her face passes her startled look at her son’s fallen body, trampled by the crowd. With a very slow pace of editing, the camera follows the mother because she carries her child’s lifeless body up the stairs to stand up to the soldiers (shown only in the form of a diagonal shadow line). In the end, they shoot her. After this lull, the slaughter continues for several dozen cuts, until the second mother (the womb of Mother Russia?) Falls into the stomach, while she is trying to protect her child in the stroller. In a scene imitated famously in The Untouchables, the carriage inappropriately slides down the stairs. In horror, confused citizens watch the slow progress of his death. When the carriage reaches the bottom, a cut appears in the Cossack with a sword, and the classic Kuleshov effect suggests something that we do not really see: the murder of this pure and symbolic innocence. The last series of shots in the Odessa sequence consists of three stone lions, one at rest, one in a sitting position and one roar. Editing brings them to life in a visual metaphor for the awakened rage of people. <br /> <br /> The fifth act returns us to the battleship when rebellious sailors flee into the open sea and wait for a meeting with other ships from the fleet. They and the audience expect retribution, but when the meeting takes place, no shots are fired, and instead all the sailors wave and throw their hats into the air as a sign of partnership. Eisenstein rewrote history at this stage, since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years. But aside from this slander, the Battleship Potemkin appears as one of the fundamental works of the silent film era and retains extraordinary cinematic power.
