What a refreshing change from PG movies in which teenage girls jump and sleep out of bed? etc. and so on. Karl Hiasen has written so many books that are pleasant, but hardly classical literature. but he finally wrote something that high school kids WANT to read. And this film sends a message to the children that maybe they can change something, that maybe their voices will be heard. Filmed in South Florida, the scenery is beautiful and natural and REAL. Who cares if it is predictable and a bit trite. So it was FREE WILLI and see how well it turned out. This is a good family movie .......... rare breed.
