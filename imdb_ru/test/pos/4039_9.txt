I really liked this movie. I am usually not a fan of fairy tales or fictions, but this film caught my attention. <br /> <br /> I first saw this film on the British channel Hallmark ... which usually shows some tasteless films ... but then the Snow Queen appeared ... and I liked it! I really admire Bridget Fonda in this film ... she plays the Snow Queen brilliantly and glamorously. <br /> <br /> I will not explain what is being said, since other people have already done this, so there is no point in repeating. <br /> <br /> I would simply advise you if you want to see a fun trip to a fairy tale ... take this film ... but if you want to buy it and live in the UK, it can be difficult. I bought it from South Korea completely new (of course, in English).
