The funny first draft for North By Northwest, Saboteur, has some great Hitchcockian moments (one of the best things happening at the table when a woman asks a woman who hasnâ€™t seen him wearing handcuffs) to give her a plate; trying to do this, he also throws the knife on the floor, exposing himself even more!) but suffers from poorly chosen leadership (whether it is a speech with patriotic speeches, an affair with Priscilla Lane, a joke or an attempt to look concerned, Robert Cummings wooden), and iz- for the lack of really great villains (oh, there are villains, many of them, but hardly anyone has enough screen time).
