in his descriptions of CAA, platinum-card dinners in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in Provincetown that he never spent, and free trips to Nicaragua, funded by Colombian photos. <br /> <br /> Sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray because of his unusual personality involves the audience, laughs at himself (perhaps because he does not take the Hollywood thing oh-so-so) and makes us care. <br /> <br /> This monologue is not only about the "Death Fields" or "Swimming in Cambodia"; it is rather a fake event, as he sees them. Some of the lines are classic, such as when Gray meets with respected talent agents at CAA. A conference table ... "full of them, tanned, healthy, just drunk blue-green algae from Lake Oregon ... there are no drugs in Hollywood right now." <br /> <br /> This was a tragedy before. Many of us will miss his unbalanced humor. 9/10.
