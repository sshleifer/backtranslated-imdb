Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives her life in the soap opera "The Cause of Love", as a way to get away from her sloppy husband and boring life. After a shocking incident involving two assassins (Morgan Freeman and Chris Roc), Betty is shocked and sent to Los Angeles, believing that she is destined to marry the main character of the show (Greg Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty is a rare thing, a little-known film with a star cast and a Rom-Com fluffy plot that surprises with its amazing script and perfect action. Indeed, such a plot calls into question the rating of R, but that's all right. The shocking incident that makes Betty jump over the edge is too graphic compared to a bright, funny comedy that should appear and be felt like something from another movie, but at the same time it should be believable to show the transformation of Betty into She becomes attractive, attractive and insane work. <br /> <br /> Directed by Neil Lábuth, along with Betty on her journey, makes extraordinary magic that makes the film unique and high above your standard swamp comedy of mistakes. An example of this could be Betty’s first meeting with her love. She pours his heart out to him, and he plays along, thinking that she auditions for the show. Even though we are aware of Betty Betty’s ridiculous nature, the music swells when she speaks, giving us the audience an emotional outlook to Betty. We almost believe what she says, but we understand that her mind is broken. Considering that other directors would try to emphasize the absurdity of the situation in order to remove every ounce of possible comedy from the stage, Labyut is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the greatest sympathy and understanding. <br /> <br /> The banter between hired assassins played by Freeman and Rock is priceless, a great script plays the smart line behind the smart string that they can throw off. Freeman, in particular, is excellent, as always, walking slowly, as his character slowly and blindly falls in love with his ideal Betty, not even knowing who she really is or what happened to her. Aaron Eckhart once again shows the universality in the ungrateful role of bad husband Betty, and he is almost unrecognizable. Another revelation here is Kinnear, whose image of a soap star is not too overcooked. There is a tendency to fall as thick as possible on the cliché of celebrity bastards, and Kinnear resists, instead filling him with a pompous but restrained self-esteem, despite the fact that he is just a soap star. <br /> <br /> The soap opera is implemented so well, it can almost exist. LaBute and company hit a nail on the head, and that’s good too. If the soap opera were too satirical, most of the film would not have worked. A fake "Days of Our Life" in "Friends" would be the wrong move for this film. The desire for detail pays off, as the style and sensations of the soap opera begin to merge more and more with Betty’s reality, while preserving the overall unintended comedy aspect of the genre. The scenes on the set seem real, unlike some films in which the atmosphere seems so fabricated, you wonder why people who do it for life can't do it right. <br /> <br /> Clear resolution of the last act, although a bit predictable, is generally quite satisfactory. It is a pity that after LaBut made this wonderful film, the mainstream appealed to him to send a terrible remake of The Wicker Man, which is an excellent example of a man so superior to the material he was given. Unfortunately, no one can relieve him of all responsibility. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen Nurse Betty, this is what you need to open. If you have, it is worth re-visit. Nurse Betty has a charm that is contagious, even if it doesn't make you think long. However, the hidden pearl.
