If you want to watch a movie starring Stan Laurel from the comedies "Laurel and Hardy" in the lead role, this film is not for you. Stan would not look for the character and rhythms of these films for another two years. If, however, you need a good parody of Rudolph Valentino's "BLOOD AND SAND" shot last year, this film is for you. All the stops were made, both in the physical comedy and on the title cards, and if the film is not united by the character, the plot of the film Valentino is used - well, sort of.
