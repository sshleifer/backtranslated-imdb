"The Last American Virgin" with Fast Times at Ridgemont High is one of the last great teen films ever made. This is a gentle story of envy and unrequited love, created in the early eighties. Many have criticized that this was a sophisticated, banal attempt to recreate the magic of "Fast Times on Ridgemont High." These critics fail to realize that these two films were shot simultaneously at the end of 1981 and released at short intervals from the other. In any case, studios would never allow such a bold and uncompromising image of the problems faced by many teenage men, reaching their puberty. Especially given the protagonist's heartbreaking discovery, Gary is faced at the end. American pie is not. The story revolves around a trio of male teenagers and their mostly unsuccessful sex work. Gary is the least successful of the group, so the slogan is LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN. Secretly, Gary craves Karen, who is associated with Rick, his best friend. Rick and Karen start having sex, and Karen gets pregnant, only to be abandoned by Rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility that lies before him. Gary slips into Karen's rescue, leading to the aforementioned unexpected conclusion. In general, as a film, I find it very successful as a comedy, as a comment on the sexual dilemmas of young men and the wonderful story of coming of age, concerning such issues as envy, unrequited love and abortion, which are as relevant today as they were more than twenty. years ago. In addition, he has one of the coolest soundtracks ever made !!!
