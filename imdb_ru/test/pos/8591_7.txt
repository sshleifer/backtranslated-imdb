An excellent, thoughtfully created historical drama - well-played, skillfully written, shot in ways that convey accurate visual images of the Congo, and with more than a few exciting moments, especially for those who are not indifferent to the history of Africa and imperialism. however, a considerable amount of useful content is lost in translation, and because names, abbreviations, etc. are difficult to follow. therefore, I highly recommend checking out a neutral source, such as Wikipedia, to get a general idea of ​​the story being depicted (and the next story) before watching a movie. If you have a DVD version, there is also a useful historical reference. By the end of the film there is a point where the character's name, which then speaks with an American accent, actually sounded - a simple Google search for “censoring the movie of Lumumba” or something like that will show a truly fascinating (and, perhaps, alarming) turn regarding an important movie. This film, in combination with a small amount of external research, helps to contextualize dozens of other films on central / eastern Africa and / or imperialism, such as the Hotel Rwanda, a handshake with the devil, various adaptations of the heart of Conrad’s darkness and even “Ali”, when Mohammed Ali visits Kinshasa.
