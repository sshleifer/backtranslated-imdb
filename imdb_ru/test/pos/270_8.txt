As the excellent Prime Suspect series reaches the fourth part, the momentum is not lost at all, which in itself is a significant achievement. ‚Äù Prime Suspect IV: The Lost Child has a solid cast that we take for granted in these British dramas, but, of course, the beautiful Helen Mirren easily dominates; our eyes never leave her while she is on the screen. <br /> <br /> The search for a lost child with the title leads the CID team of the Superintendent Jane Tennyson to the main suspect, who turns out to be a convicted pedophile, who now lives with a single mother and her two daughters. one of the emotional moments of this mini-series, but it may be too strong for many stomachs. <br /> <br /> The handheld camera brilliantly copes with the sequences of actions, holding us right in the middle of the excitement, and during the climate siege there is tension. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is another great police procedural drama.
