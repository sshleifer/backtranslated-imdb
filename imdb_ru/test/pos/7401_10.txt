Seriously, I do not understand why people here scold it. I mean, <br /> <br /> the idea of ​​a murderous snowman damaging a tropical island paradise is rather absurd. The good news is that the producers understood this and made a comedy in the spirit of the Army of Darkness. <br /> <br /> Especially in the second half of the film, when the little killer snowballs attack, I laugh it off. For example, put one of the little creeps in a blender (a la Gremlins 1) and mix. After that, he again turns into a snowball and squeals in a high voice: "It was fun!". <br /> <br /> The result is an incredible film, shoot it.
