Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teen who rests in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy saves Serafin Pigot (gorgeous Julie Delpy) from suicide on the Eiffel Tour and falls in love with her. He does not know that she is a werewolf. They go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is injured and becomes a werewolf. He is advised that the only way to become normal again is to kill the werewolf that attacked him and eat his heart. This film is a cruel black humor. The special effects and soundtrack are excellent, emphasizing the song of the Bush group. I do not know why some readers compare this film with the masterpiece “American werewolf in London”. These stories have nothing in common (only an American teenager, werewolves and a city in Europe). Especially recommended for fans of films about werewolf and black humor. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Um Lobisomem Americano em Paris” (“American werewolf in Paris”)
