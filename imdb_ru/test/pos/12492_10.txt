Quai des Orfevres, directed by the brilliant Henri-Georges Clouzot, is a film to be cherished, because it is one of the best representatives of the French film industry of the post-war years. M. Kloso, adapting Stieman's novel Long Protection, reveals his genius in the way he describes the story and in the way he connects all the characters of this deeply satisfying film, which, as D. B. indicated. Dumontal on this forum demonstrates how influential Cluzot was and how much the new generation of French filmmakers owes to the master, especially Claude Chabrol. <br /> <br /> Arman Tirar's clear black and white cinematography has been superbly transferred to the Criterion DVD we recently watched. Working with Clouzot, Tirard makes the most of the dark tones and shadows in most key scenes. The music of Francis Lopez, the man who created light music and operetta in France, works well in the context of the film, as the action takes place in the world of music halls and nightclubs. <br /> <br /> Louis Jouve, who is considered a police detective, is perfect in this part. It was one of his best screen appearances for an actor who was a mainstay of the French theater. Zuwe well understood the mechanism for creating his own police inspector, who is wiser and can look deep into the souls of his suspects and, ultimately, steal the show from others. In the unfair comment of someone on this page, Inspector Juve is compared to Peter Falk's Colombo, a television detective. Honestly, without disrespect to Mr. Falk, it’s like comparing excellent champagne with good homemade wine. <br /> <br /> Bernard Blier is perfect as a jealous husband. Blière had a face that could be associated with a man absorbed in the passion that his wife Jenny Lamur awoke in him. Martino is vulnerable and does not act rationally; it is easy to suspect him, because he did everything wrong, because he discovered that he did not commit a crime in the middle, but all the evidence points to the opposite. <br /> <br /> Another great movie character Dora, the photographer. This is understandable by the way she communicates with Jenny, where her real interest. Simone Renant is tragically attractive as this restless woman and makes a huge contribution to the film. Susie Delaire, who plays Jenny, is attractive as a singer who suddenly jumps from obscurity to celebrity and attracts people like Brignon, the old libertine. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the best Kluzo, shot during his Excellent career and one that will live forever, because so he gathered all the elements together.
