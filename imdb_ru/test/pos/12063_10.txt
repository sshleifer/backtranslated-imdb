“Home War” is a great television series, and I don’t understand it because it was canceled. Please, the fairies are something to continue this very beautiful television series, with excellent and wonderful actors, good reading and good situations, please, we want the third series and even so many new episodes. I pray to you !!!! I would like, if possible, to do something to achieve this and send an e-mail to those interested in advance, as I can tell you that here in Italy, this series is very pleasant, like in other European countries a dresser, for example Spain As a matter of fact, as I already wrote above, what is striking in this television series is a good listing of actors, as well as an honest one, which is addressed by numerous questions that have true meaning. I think both of the latest top American television series will appear on Italian screens in recent years. I'm praying for you !!!!
