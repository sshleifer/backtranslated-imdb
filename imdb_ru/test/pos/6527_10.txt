This is the first American film I saw this year, and I think it will be the best because of the feeling. As a teenage singer in America, Aaron is not as popular as before, most Americans I met with said that his song was fake and that he didn’t even know how to rape. But attention, everything, he is a child, how many people can understand him. Being a pop fan is difficult, and being a pop star is more difficult. I think this time Aaron (JD) will show us something real. And I think that people should learn to understand each other. On the other hand, I really like the music in the film. I remember that the first song that appeared in the film was “Saturday Night”, and it also includes Aaron’s real live show, and the second one is “One is Better”, so I think if you like this film, you may also will be a fan of pop music. Finally, I hope you have a great time ^^ Chinese boy's voice.
