And thus was born the most passionate skunk who ever adorned the silver screen. While the plot depicts a cat insulted, posing as a skunk, and unintentionally attracting Pepe Le Pugh (here his name is Henry), Pepe, of course, steals the show. Without a doubt, Chuck Jones realized that this love-seeking member of the Mephitis genus had something special to become a star, and so four years later he played Pepe in the film Fragrance, firmly stating that steadily keeps presence on the screens everywhere. <br /> <br /> So, otherwise, “Odor-Able Kitty” may be a trifle, I try to imagine that I was watching it for the first time in 1945. Could anyone guess that this support hero would soon join the ranks of Bugs, Duffy, Porky and the rest? Regardless of whether someone has done it or not, Pepe remains one of the nicest characters to this day. C'est l'amour!
