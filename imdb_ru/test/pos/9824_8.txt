I do not know how I would feel if I lived in the USA. I would see some preview scenes, advertisements, I would know that the director is Sydney Pollack, starring Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas. I would watch this movie as soon as possible without reading a single bad review. Will I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> I read a lot of reviews that say how bad this film is: “This is a boring, long film without passionate emotions, and it’s not interesting.” Harrison is wooden, cold. Slots must be cut. Too serious, especially for Harrison Ford. I am interested in this topic, and I like Harrison Ford in films that are not actions. I also like Sydney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas. Therefore, reading the reviews on the IMDB site, then on other sites, and then in February in Hungarian film magazines, I was surprised and surprised what kind of film it was. In any case, there are films, directors, stars, that / whom I want to see, despite any reviews. <br /> <br /> I understand people who think that this film is boring and cold, and there is no passion in it, but I feel differently. However, I liked the sliding doors, “Forbidden Woman” (this is a French film, I do not know what it is called in English or French). The basis of these films is the development of love. <br /> <br /> I think that Random Heart is in its own way a pleasant and interesting film. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Slots congressional elections and police investigations after a corrupt police officer are poorly written, not worked out in detail, but add something to the leading female and male character. After the death and traitorous emotions of his wife, the anger of the Dutchman comes to the surface during his work. He will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend (then the woman too). The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: the death of our wife / husband and treason. One of them is a woman: it is a tragedy, but life goes on. She does not want to mourn forever. What she wants to know - what her husband's lover thinks of her is the wife of a police officer, she will never know. She is forced to behave in this way. Elections are coming, and all that concerns his husband can become a scandal. She wants her daughter not to be disappointed in her father. The man is a policeman. He suffers from living in a lie. He wants to know - perhaps every man wants to know in this situation - when his wife began to deceive him. How long has she got a lover? He needs the help of a woman, but she does not want to, but the guy is stubborn and persistent. A woman cannot tolerate him, because he always enters her life, and she cannot forget. Their relationship is tense at first, then slowly the type of silent sympathy develops, which prefers the union against the outside world, tragedy. (I said this, despite the fact that they made love in bed) However, the police officer cannot stop with the investigation, cannot stay close and cannot allow the woman to be near him, but he starts “love” their relationship continued. But it can not. A woman understands this. The end is a bit sad, but logical and at the same time pleasant. <br /> <br /> I was pleased to see Peter Coyote again - I like this man’s face - Sydney Pollack. I hardly knew Bonnie Hunt, but she was good. <br /> <br /> I think Harrison Ford did well. His eardrum is unusual, but at first, finally, I believed that a woman likes being in his company, despite his temperament. It is a pity that he did not get any joke. But Ford has a good sense of humor. The observer noted (in Hungary): “Ford is charismatic against his haircut and ears, and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic remark. But Dr. Jones does not smile at us. ”But he smiles at the end, and that’s so good. I agree with the rest. I really like him in this role - he is good at this a bit rough, cool, but somewhere in his soul is a smart cop. Christine Scott Thomas’s character is a strong, confident woman, but she is locked inside an ivory tower, and she keeps herself away from her emotions. But she is really a woman who becomes indecisive and finds support from the police officer. Two cool, discreet people find each other. <br /> <br /> The script may not be very good. He is full of ordinary, banal sentences, but there are several humorous sentences from women and movements, especially from men. This is a good film, but not for everyone, not for a wide audience. I watched women younger than 18 years old, and men over 45 liked this movie more. As for the latter, perhaps Sidney Pollack made this film for his age group, which does not go to multiplex. In any case, I advise people who love energetic scenes with battle scenes, who only like Ford action films, to skip this film.
