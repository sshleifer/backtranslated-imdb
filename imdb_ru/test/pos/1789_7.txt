What I say about this movie. Well, for starters, I thought that everything was fine with this film, not the biggest, not the worst. I said this because I thought the script was great and original, really different and refreshing. Now I would not say that this is the best film I have seen in the film. To the actors who played each role, it seems that they played them without emotion, as if they took their life from them. When my wife laughed or cried, for some reason it did not look real for me, this is just an example, but sincerely all the characters did not act at all. I would like to say more positive words about this film so that you guys can watch it at least once, but how can I do that, because I know that I will not see this film anymore? I rented this film in the library of my school, without having heard anything about the film itself, nor about the director. I ventured because the story that was described on the back sounded really interesting, and it really was.
