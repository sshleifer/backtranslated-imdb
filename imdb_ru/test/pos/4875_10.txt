I watched SEA OF DUST at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival in Providence. It was a festival film shown and won the Best Picture from, I think, a couple hundred works. The director and several stars answered questions after the show. One star, Susie Lorraine, was even hotter in person than in the film, and she was attractive in the film. <br /> <br /> This film is independent, but it has many cinematic touches that give it a sense of quality. He even has original music in classical style. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Savini, and he is here, in a black cloak, a villain, he is rather an evil force than a real person, I think. He sucks souls out of people and uses them as soldiers in a perverted attempt to establish his version of the kingdom of God on earth. In his opinion, Christ was all about suffering, and Savini intended to make everyone suffer. <br /> <br /> The main storyline that interests you is about young doctor Stefan, who is sent to investigate the strange events of Savini. calls in an isolated city. On the way, he offers the chick an aristocrat, but her father SOB tells him to get lost. Then he meets with a strangely obsessed but charming country girl. I think she falls in love with him, but she also tries to kill him, like many of the hottest women in the film. <br /> <br /> I found the scenes shot in the forest, the most terrible and the most terrible. are striking, with strange people along the road (evil little twin girls scare the hell out of me). <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of things, too many to list. There is a lot of blood, torture and blood. Hot chicks lick the blood off the guys fingers. The head of a scared girl explodes. It was unexpected. The throat is cut. Some cruel blows. <br /> <br /> Then they sometimes play it for a laugh, ridiculing the whole genre of the evil Black Forest. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the films Hammer and Ingrid Pitt, it is interesting to see her in this film. She takes off one of the leashes, sticking a cross into his skull. Fine. The guy who played "Multiple Miggs" in the movie "The Silence of the Lambs" is great in a fight with an ax. <br /> <br /> The film is surreal, and with the ending I am not sure that the events took place or they were in the head of Stephen because of his refusal by his potential bride. He returns in vengeance, and this scene is fierce. <br /> <br /> The director also said that the theme of religion is used incorrectly to support wars and murders. I can see for sure that Savini’s gaze on religion was frightening. <br /> <br /> It was a strangely unusual film with stars like Savini and Pitt, with lots of good actors, including hot babes, great scenes with blood action, and all the time you wonder what the hell take it happens and what happens next. <br /> <br /> It deserves ten stars, because it’s a great independent movie, I don’t think it was a low budget, but it should have been smaller than a big studio budget, and yet they managed to do something really attractive, unique and thought-provoking.
