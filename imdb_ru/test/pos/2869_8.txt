See no evil with Kane. The film has a great storyline, but it wasn’t “Hide My Eyes,” “Scream Aloud Horror,”. I thought it would be from watching WWE Superstars on Monday night, when the film first came to the cinema. I enjoyed the movie, although I liked the story in which it was played. <br /> <br /> A GREAT MOVIE EXCELLENT WANTED TO SEE PART 2 <br /> <br /> It doesn’t matter if Kane is killed at End <br /> <br /> Or not They killed other horror stars in every movie. <br /> <br /> They are gone and they are still coming back, so part 2 will be <br /> <br /> Be very interesting.
