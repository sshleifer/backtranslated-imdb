The only pure life is the one that ends with a bloody signature. <br /> <br /> One way or another, Mishima says, a young protected boy who becomes a famous writer. The life of one of the most famous literary voices of the Japanese is told from three points of view: his life shortly before he and four members of his private army captured the Japanese military base and committed ritual suicide (shown in color), flashbacks (shown in black) and white ), and scenes from his novels (shown in a kind of dreamy Technicolor scenery somewhere between the traditional But theater and the "Wizard of Oz". These stories are often told at the same time, but are edited to strengthen the slow mixing the life of Mishima with his fictions, to the end (or beginning), when, like the ancient samurai, whom he admires so much, he will be on the balance of the pen and the sword (when his words and actions are the same, and he is full of ). <br /> <br /> Paul Schroeder wrote the script for "Taxi Driver" and shot Cat People (a strange erotic horror film that left me with strange impressions as a child) and in Mishima he comes closest to creating really great the movie. <br /> <br /> What's interesting? For example, watch a poet, a homosexual, a shy and awkward man with a low physique who exaggerates his tuberculosis to get a second world war (which he seems forever ashamed of) becomes bodybuilding, obsessed with a samurai, sexual media phenomenon at as still writing many novels, plays and short stories. <br /> <br /> The short and pleasant version is to say that Mishima has no father, and she is obsessed with masculinity, beauty, sex and self-destruction, in some kind of tragic attempt to feel connected to something more than himself, whom he always missed. Watching him with his suicidal comrades, you see him happy, speaking with a big fatherly speech, giving orders and loving control ... to the very speech, the point where the pen and sword converge? Of course, this ignores the subtlety of the craft telling the story, which makes this transformation so natural and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Although the story, fascinating at times, is not really the biggest success of this film. Cinematography, performances, editing, music (from Philip Glass) and scenery are really worth seeing and more than traditional biography. <br /> <br /> One day I will pick up, pick up Mishimaâ€™s book, he seems to have a propensity for prose and for the formulation of ideas, but now I am pleased with the film. <br /> <br /> Those interested in Japanese literature and post-war culture should be checked. Fans of inventive combinations of facts and fictions should also rejoice.
