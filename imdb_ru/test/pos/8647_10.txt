There is an inscription on Lost Highway: <br /> <br /> * BASIC SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> (but you already knew that, didn't you?) <br /> <br /> As it is many people who obviously did not understand the meaning of this film, I would like to share my interpretation of why the plot makes sense. As others have noted, watching this movie alone is not enough. If you have a DVD with MD, you can “cheat” by watching David Lynch’s “Top 10 Tips for Unlocking the MD” (but only during the second or third viewing, please.);) First of all Mulholland Drive is absolutely gorgeous. Masterpiece. This is a movie that refuses to leave your head. The comments on DVDs are not often very accurate, but Vogue “It penetrates your head and stays there” is really amazing. <br /> <br /> David Lynch deserves praise for making the film, in which not only is the beautifully stylish appearance - from the point of view of cinematography, a great acting game (especially Naomi Watts), Badalamenti’s haunting soundtrack and very amazing quality - but beyond of all this he also manages to engage the viewer in such a way that several films used to be. (In the end, when was the last time you saw a film that just doesn’t leave your mind and that everyone feels obligated to talk and write, regardless of whether they like it or hate it?) <br /> <br /> Well, enough about all this, it's time to justify these claims. <br /> <br /> Most people who have made some efforts to try to put the plot together will come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion / sequence of dreams. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is too bad for all those who are trying to comprehend the film, waiting for the “traditional” methods by which the story is laid out in a timely manner, in a logical and linear manner for the viewer. But for those who expect it, I urge you to check the name of the director and come back again. ;) MD is the story of the sad end of Diane Selvin, the imitator actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor, Camille Rawls. Due to the lack of talent at Diane, she constantly tries to move up the career ladder and feels that she failed to meet the expectations of her parents and her parents. Realizing that Camilla will never be her (S. becomes engaged to Adam Kesher, the director), she hires a killer to get rid of her, and subsequently must cope with the feeling of guilt she causes. <br /> <br /> The film begins with what may seem like a strange discovery for such a thriller; This is a dance / jitterbug competition of the 50s, in which we see the main character Betty playing great. We also see an elderly couple (which we will see twice more throughout the entire film) along with her and applaud her. <br /> <br /> No, wait. This is what most people see for the first time. In fact, there is another very important fact that is given in front of the captions - the camera moves into the object (albeit blurred) and the scene quickly disappears. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, showing that what follows is a dream. <br /> <br /> The main characters seen in the first half of the film: <br /> <br /> Betty: The imaginary “me” of Diane Selvin, used in the first half of the film, is a “sequence of dreams” - a positive image of a successful aspiring young actor (the exact opposite of Diane). "Betty" was chosen as the name, as this is the real name of the waitress in Winky. Please note that in the dream version, the waitresses are called "Diana". <br /> <br /> Rita: Camilla Rhodes's fantasy version, which, thanks to Diana’s dream and with the help of an imaginary car accident, turned into an amnesiac. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diana's love. It is then conveniently placed in Aunt Betty / Diana’s luxurious home, in which Betty was allowed to stay. <br /> <br /> Koko: In real life, Adam's mother. In the dream - the woman in charge of the apartment complex in which Betty lives. Basically it is a strong authority figure, as evidenced by two parts of the film. <br /> <br /> Adam: Directed by. From the second half, we know that he is engaged to Camilla. His only goal is to act in the first half of the film only as a punching bag for Betty / Diana, as she develops such hatred for him. <br /> <br /> Aunt Ruth: The real aunt of Diana, but instead of being outside the city instead, she is actually dead. Diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used it to pay for Camille’s murder. <br /> <br /> Mr Roach: a typical Lynch character. Not real; appears only in the sequence of sleep Diana. He is a mysterious, powerful man who manages the chain of events in a dream from his wheelchair. He performs almost the same function as a reverse-talking gnome (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> Hitman: the man who kills Camille. This character is basically the same in both parts of the film, although in the sequence of dreams he looks a little more stupid (more on this below). <br /> <br /> Now that we have installed different versions of the characters in the movie, we can start digging into the plot. Of course, I will not go into every little thing (and I will not present it in chronological order), but I will try to explain some important scenes related to Lynch’s “hint”. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, Camilla was reproduced as an amnesiac because of her incredible survival in a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the film, which made her completely vulnerable. What really intrigued me in MD is that Lynch constantly gives clues about what is real and what is not. I have already mentioned that the camera is moving into a pillow, but notice that in each lane on two lanes approaching limousines approaching the limousine. <br /> <br /> Only one of the cars crashed into a limousine; and what about the other? Even if they themselves avoided the accident, would they not try to help others or at least call for help? My theory is that, since this is a dream, the presence of another car is simply postponed and forgotten about it. Because, as Rogert Ebert eloquently says: “Like real dreams, he does not explain, does not complete his sequences, lingers over what he finds fascinating, rejects unpromising subject lines.” <br /> <br /> Soon after Rita crawls down from the crash site at Dr. Mulholland and she goes down the side of the hill and sneaks into Aunt Ruth’s apartment, Betty comes and we see this creepy old couple leaving, staring terribly at each other and grinning at himself and the camera. This is the first sign that what we see is a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Although the old couple seems to be Betty unfamiliar, I think they are actually her parents (since they applauded her for the jitterbug contest). Perhaps she did not know them very well and did not have such good relations with them as she wanted, so the couple seemed to her very pleasant and helpful in a dream. They also represent her guilt about murder and Diana’s dissatisfaction with her unmet goals in her life. <br /> <br /> A pretty long and funny scene with an assassin. Diana, apparently, sees him as the main force of the campaign, which is trying to force the director to accept the role of Camilla in the film (from the party of Adam in the second half of the film), and therefore he occupies most of her dreams. Because of her feelings of guilt and remorse about the murder of Camilla, part of her wants him to miss, so she turns him into a stupid criminal. <br /> <br /> This scene, I think, is also an attempt by Lynch to completely confuse his audience, because they are given a false excuse to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> Gotta love this phrase "Something that just bit me." :) <br /> <br /> The next interesting scene is a scene with two people in Twinkies who talk about how one of them continues this nightmare with the participation of the person he sees through the wall. outside the diner in which they sit. After a short conversation, they go outside and continue to walk to the corner of the fence, accompanied, of course, by excellent music, corresponding to the mood of the scene. <br /> <br /> Reaching the corner, a round-looking character with a disfigured face appears, scaring the living shit out of a person who is having a nightmare. This nightmare exists only in the mind of Diana; she saw that guy in the diner when she paid for the murder. In short, her obsession turns into this poor man's nightmares. The vagabond also points to the evil side of Diana, as can be witnessed later in the film. <br /> <br /> A cowboy represents (along with a dwarf) one of the strange characters who are always present in Lynch's landscape - Diana only saw him for a short time at Adam's party, but just as our own dreams can reward insignificant people whom we hardly know much of our dreams, so that he can be honored with an important role in her dream. We are also given additional clues during his scenes, that what we see is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.). <br /> <br /> Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock a director when he meets. with him in a strange place (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of the dream). Also note how he says that he will appear again if he (Adam) does good, or two more times if he does badly. Throughout the film, he appears two more times, showing Diana that she did poorly. He is also the one who wakes her up to reality (this scene is probably an illusion created to meet her demands for his appearance twice), and soon after that she commits suicide. <br /> <br /> The espresso scene with the Castille brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, like Luigi) is probably the result of Diana having an espresso shortly before Camilla and Adam made their announcement on Adam's party in the second half. At the same time, it may be the statement of Lynch. <br /> <br /> During the scene in which they enter Diana’s apartment, the body lying on the bed is Camilla, but notice how she assumed Diana’s sleeping position; Diana sees herself in her own dream, but the face does not belong to her, although he had the same wounds on her face as Diana after shooting herself. This scene is also filled with some genuine Lynch eeriness. Since Diana did not know where (or when) the assassin would get to Camilla and finish her off, she just gave her to her house. <br /> <br /> In real life, Diana’s audition for the role in the film was bad. In a dream, she conducts a perfect audition, causing excitement to the whole team. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting that the money that was used in real life to pay for Camille’s murder now appears in Rita / Camilla’s Wallet. This is part of the fact that Diana canceled her terrible deed, actually returning the money, since the murder did not happen. <br /> <br /> When her neighbor comes for an ashtray in the shape of a piano, this is another hint given; she takes an ashtray from her desk and leaves, but later, when Camilla and Betty meet on the couch, we see that the ashtray reappears when the camera is leaning over the table, suggesting that meeting Betty with her neighbor was a fantasy. /> <br /> Fantastic phrase of the film, in which Adam auditions actresses: “She is a girl”; these are the same words that Diana uses when giving a summary of the killer Camilla. <br /> <br /> The blue frame and key represent the main turning point in the film, and it is there that the real personalities of the characters are located. revealed. There is a lot of symbolism going on here; The box can represent Diana’s future (it’s empty), or it can be some sort of Pandora’s box (the assassin laughs when she asks to open the key). In any case, this is due to the murder with the blue key (which is next to it after the murder occurred). The box is also visible at the end of the film in the hands of a disfigured ass. <br /> <br /> Club Silencio is a neat little addition that reminds the viewer once again that what he / she is watching is not real. It also means that Diane is about to realize her reality (her reality is a nightmare from which she cannot escape even in a dream). <br /> <br /> During a chilling scene at the end, where a creepy old couple appears, Diane is tortured in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out to avoid screams and avoid being harassed by her fears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is my $ 0.02, I hope it could help people get out of this movie and call it “the worst movie ever” or something like that, not aware of the plot. <br /> <br /> As usual, Lynch is creating irrational fears, and he certainly does this with this picture. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
