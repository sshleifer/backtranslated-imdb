The best fan movie I've ever watched, with the exception of Free Enterprise. <br /> <br /> In some ways, he reminded me of an early film about Kevin Smith. <br /> <br /> In this film you will often laugh at his insatiable fun. Don't expect a big budget here, acting is also sometimes dubious, but it does add to the fun of the atmosphere they create. The scenario is really humorous, with a lot of witty moments worth trying out. <br /> <br /> The bard, who is always killed, made me ride. The player with sexual confusion also made me smile a little. But in the end ... It was just a great movie, showing off some of the best moments in the lives of a few geeks having a great time in role-playing games. <br /> <br /> If you are bored and have you ever fallen into the role of playing, it will be good for distraction. This is an unexpected pleasure.
