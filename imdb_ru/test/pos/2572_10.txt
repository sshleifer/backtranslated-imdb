I guess this is what is called southern gothic. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, and Justin Timberlake are shot in it. Timberlake does a good job, much to my surprise, I did not expect it from him. <br /> <br /> When you get lost and you can’t find your way home, this is the groan of a black snake. <br /> People in this film are definitely lost in many ways, psychologically and emotionally damaged, betrayed by those whom they trusted and loved, and experienced severe pain. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson plays a blues singer / musician, whose wife quarreled with his brother and now left him for his brother, and also interrupts the birth of the child he hoped to have with her. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci's character — a woman who was sexually abused as a young woman — turned her into a self-destructing nymphomaniac; allowing men to mistreat her. <br /> <br /> The story is the intersection of the life of these two characters. This is a love story, but not a story of sexual love between them - the older black and the young white woman. <br /> <br /> It is different from most movies that Hollywood brings out. <br /> <I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
