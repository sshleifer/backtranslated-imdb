Before watching this movie from start to finish, I happened to catch the last half hour. Usually I don’t watch a movie, if I haven’t seen it from the very beginning, but with a friend it was turned on, and as soon as I started watching it, I could not stop. <br /> <br /> I am really surprised this film did not receive a wide theatrical release. This is a pretty funny movie (often fluttering with humor), and the monster and the truck with the monsters in it are rather formidable. Because of this, the Leatherface monster looks beautiful, and the monster truck is a cross between a German artillery vehicle from the First World War and a giant coffin. <br /> <br /> A timid virgin of twenty-five years old is on a long journey to prevent a woman he loves from getting married. His former best friend constantly drags him. On the road, they are threatened by an old black hearse and the aforementioned monster truck. They also pick up the hitchhiker, played by the very sexy Aimee Brooks. <br /> <br /> I also watched an animated trailer with comments from the director and an electronic press kit, and they both seemed interesting to me. I can argue that commenting on a film with a director and two male stars is also quite pleasant, but I have so many other films that I have never seen before ...
