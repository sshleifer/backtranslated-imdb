It was as if a reality show like “American Idol” was not enough, in which judges, such as Simon Cowell, shoot razor-sharp beards to contestants trying to get their mark on the world of music - warts that many times brought to life even outstanding singers to tears. after what was recognized as a “bad performance”, now the “American Next Top Model” has in the past three years invaded the boob pipe with its own version of “looking for the next big thing” in a business that appreciates shallowness, concepts of beauty and body dysmorphism. <br /> <br /> The concept created by Tyra Banks, who is also a judge in the show, gathers about fifteen participants from all walks of life and forces them to perform countless "tasks" in that they have to prove their "talent" in front of the camera and subdue not only deceased Janice Dickinson (called the “First American Supermodel”), but also the sly Jay Manuel and Nor Marin, who can focus on one girl not working well and carelessly to her in tatters as if it were bad morning coffee. As in many other reality shows, every week one participant is removed from voting and must pack his things and leave immediately (the thing Tira reminds of at every step). Of course, between some of the type A females, a burning connection, tears, dramatic musical unrest at key moments, there is some truly fascinating picture that turns former ordinary pretty girls into inaccessible goddesses. <Br /> <br /> I admit, the show is a pleasure. Maybe it’s a state of mind that I’m in, but I kept wondering where was vomiting in those cases when thin girls would have to rush to make the cut and look like judges, photographers and many non-permanent designers. at the moment. Nevertheless, it attracted me, despite my previous paragraph, perhaps because I was always interested in the fashion world and always loved to watch how stunning women become even more otherworldly with makeup and perfect lighting. But I wonder where they go with these increasingly difficult photo shoots. It’s as if they were competing with the Fear Factor. Filming that looks like a reenactment of battle scenes in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, shooting where models have to pose underwater or in almost impossible situations. What's next: posing, being tied to the railway tracks, Amtrak oncoming roars at them 70 miles an hour? Or a shot where they are under water, chained, trying to free themselves in record time, at the same time looking loud chiffons, and never forgetting to smile with their pearl white on this camera? How about the version of the photo session "The Pit and the Pendulum"? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the show must be given its due, and in some ways this is similar to American Idol. By this I am probably going to justify the severity of both shows and his abrasive judges - and essentially go against my initial paragraph. “America's next top model” is an extended audition, similar to American Idol, and in it girls will get the kind of test processing they will receive in the real world, where potential designers and photographers are monstrously fickle. how they can, crush them into pieces drop by drop, if they cannot sell themselves as they expect, and when they ask one to leave, the other will crowd it out with necessary requirements. It is surprising that any girl will want to get into such difficult media, but this is about dreams. <br /> <br /> In the fifth season, this was a big disappointment with the departure of Janice Dickinson. ; while jogging, she was a pretty hard barometer on how girls should walk, talk, show emotions, express themselves and, ultimately, present themselves as a walking, living product that is sold. With the cold addition of Twiggy, I wonder where it will go from here — Twiggy simply cannot replace Dickinson's excessive temperament. Thus, with Janis’s absence, the show lost some of its facets and, perhaps, even signaled its slow demise, but at the same time, it is still an exciting pleasure to watch, mindless entertainment on weekdays, if at all for great visual effects. If at all, this is the show that brought Adrienne Curry into the spotlight. Curry made a name for herself thanks to facts that have less to do with modeling than her theatrical romance with former child actor Christopher Knight in their own soap opera of reality.
