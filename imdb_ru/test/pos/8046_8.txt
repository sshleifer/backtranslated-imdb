The battle of Guldersch Gulch was the longest and most expensive short recording of Griffith, which he had achieved before. In it, we see how he is trying to improve the large-scale action scene, which would be necessary in his full-length features, packaging all the elements that made his previous shorts successful. <br /> <br /> Griffith uses western format ?? already the perfect backdrop for pure, straightforward action as the setting for his first epic battle. Like many Westerns of the 1910s, the starting point is a character from the east heading west ?? a device that may have helped ease the audience in the desert, and here these oriental people are a couple of children, which was important for the type of picture into which it develops. For Griffith, you could not act without a sense of vulnerability, and here he squeezed him, with children from the east, Lillian Gish, like a distraught mother of the “only child in the city” and even some puppies who are in danger of being on the Indian menu. <br /> <br /> All this paves the way for an extremely complex and multi-layered sequence of actions, combining the script with the stuck heroine and escape into battle with the battles that Griffith He portrayed from the earliest pictures of the Civil War in 1909. There is a phenomenal amount of things going on, and Griffith does an excellent job maintaining an exciting pace and keeping everything connected and logical. However, manipulating the number of elements in a sequence of actions does not necessarily make it many times more exciting, no matter how skillfully they are balanced, and Griffith created the best tension-saturated finals before and after. <br /> But even a Griffith painting, so strongly focused on action, could not have done without drama, performance and atmosphere. In the “Battle of the Bay of Elderbrash,” the emotional setting is discussed briefly, but economically. First, we have a scene in which waffles leave their home. The cart in which they move on their heads from the camera uses depth and distance to express their movement away from security and civilization. An equally effective scene is one in which we meet Guiche's young family, Bobby Harron, and their child. Residents of the city grumble over the precious baby, and then go behind the screen, showing that two Indians are watching them from the background, adding an ominous little note of danger. <br /> <br /> Of course, many viewers today pointed to the “Battle of the offensive portrayal of the Native American by Eldersch Gulch” (as opposed to the more sympathetic look of the red man), but perhaps things are not as it seems. First of all, look at the vest of the son of the Indian leader ?? it is black and covered with shiny white dots. It looks like a pearl royal jacket, perhaps slightly modified for a warmer climate. Now take a look at the "war dance" that they perform later ?? he has a certain "Mother's knee" air to him. This is not the Indians, they Cockney! So this should not be offensive to Native Americans. Just cockney.
