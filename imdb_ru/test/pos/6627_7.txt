Shame, this is a Swedish film in Swedish with English subtitles. A film about a husband and wife named Yang and Eve. They live on the island, working as farmers. There is a war, and the soldiers begin to attack people on the island. After the war subsides a bit, Yana and Eve are arrested as marching along with the opposite side. After liberation, more trouble arises, and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in situations of war, life or death. Winner of the CEC Award for Best Foreign Film at The Cinema Writers Circle Award, Guldbagge Award for Best Actress (Liv Ulman, who plays Eve) at the Guldbagge Award, NBR Award for Best Film in Foreign Languages ​​and Best Actress on the National Council Review and NSFC Award for the best female role, the best direction (Ingmar Bergman) and the best film in the National Society of Film Critics. It's a shame, he has a good leadership, a good script, good performances by Max von Sydow (who plays Jan) and Liv Ullman (who plays Eve), good cinematography and good production design. Shame, this is a well thought out and well made story about how people in a desperate situation sometimes do everything they can to survive. The film has a powerful message and is a good movie. The reason I don’t rate this movie above is that it isn’t a masterpiece like some other Ingmar Bergman films, such as Strawberry, The Seventh Seal, or Persona. The film did not have as much influence on me as I thought, and there was no thoughtful and philosophical dialogue of Ingmar Bergman in it. Although it’s close to being one of his best films, there’s something else Shyda might like and this is a good film. I probably would have liked more if I had not seen some of the other masterpieces of Bergman.
