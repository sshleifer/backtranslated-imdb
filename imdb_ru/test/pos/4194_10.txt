I confess that in the past I had the opportunity to watch this film, and after 5-10 minutes I felt that many had done it. I was expecting the Monkey movie, which looked like a television show, but instead they gave me ... well, I didn't know what they gave me, to be honest. <br /> <br /> However, after watching In this movie, I realized that I not only had a closed mind to the brilliance that he portrays, but I watched it again and again. This is one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it forces me to be alert when I try to decipher its meaning. And only when I think I found something in the film, his answer collapses when I watch the movie again. Glitter really. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people who didn’t like this movie want to watch a movie with a clear story in the first place. They want everything explained and all questions answered in the final. Well, I'm sorry if you want this, this is not a movie for you. But if you like films such as The Matrix (and even better, their continuation), I think you will appreciate the challenging, amazing experience that this film will give you. <br /> <br /> Think that the film is like a dream, In our dreams, things do not make sense, things that we expect do not occur, people place things and things do not say, act or function the same as in reality . To complain about the “Head” is the same as to complain about a dream that, as you felt, you cannot understand. The mind is a complex system, and, considering that the film called “Head” is just as complex, is it difficult to connect them? <br /> <br /> The music (and the musical numbers) really stand out, especially the Two Songs by Peter Tork, which remain the best tracks in the movie "Can You Dig It Up?" and “Long title: Do I have to do it again and again?” <br /> <br /> This film proves that “Monkeys” were much more than just four hot guys in the “prefab” group (as their critics) . called them) on television shows, but they are actually much smarter and more talented than the world could give them. So many messages can be extracted from the film, both in relation to “Monkeys” and the “entertainment industry” as a whole, that it is a masterpiece of filmmaking, which is much ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> I feel that if this film were released as an independent work at this moment and in fact, it would really collect the respect and admiration it deserves. <br /> <br /> And one more note: <br /> <br /> This can be compared with the Beatles movie “Magic Secret” because the Beatles movie turned out to be just as strange and strange. However, in my opinion, "Head" is much higher than anything that the Beatles put on celluloid.
