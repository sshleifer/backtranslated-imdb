This is another western about the greedy cattle baron, seeking to oust small ranchers and farmers. It has certainly been done before and since. But The Violent Men is something special. <br /> <br /> What is special is that Barbara Stenwick plays the role of the fox, as she often did in her later films. She is married to the crippled Edward G. Robinson, who is a baron of cattle here, but Robinson is crippled, and there is some hint that his injuries could make him powerless. No matter Barbara, whose needs are met by her brother-in-law Brian Keith. This does not suit either Dianne Foster, who is the daughter of Robinson and Stanvik, nor Lita Milan, who is Keith's Mexican friend. <br /> <br /> The plot of infidelity almost captures the entire movie, but Glenn Ford the Valiant little rancher, a veteran of the Civil War, came west to keep his health here. He is every inch a silent western hero whom people make a mistake pushing him too often. I almost expect those famous words from Wild Bill Elliot to be heard from Ford: “I’m a peace-loving person.” That would be most welcome in Cruel Men. <br /> <br /> “The Fifties” was the era of an adult western, the equestrian operas included themes that had not been studied before. Next year, Glenn Ford will come up with another Western, Jubal, one of his best, who also views infidelity as a component of the plot. <br /> <br /> In The Violent Men, there are enough traditional western items and enough for those who are addicted to soap operas as well.
