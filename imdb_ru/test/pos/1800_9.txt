This is a good film, which in many ways has disadvantages with a low level of production. Martha Coolidge herself said that she had only 350,000 dollars to work. This is a movie that I loved when I was growing up in the Midwest. I remember friends and I had a trip of nostalgia for this film 10 years ago. Great things about this movie .... A great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director. The bad moments of this film ... For a small budget that requires too much improvisation. If Martha Coolidge had been given more money and time for this film, the results would have been even better. They should have taken history from the perspective of the 20s, and not from the point of view of high school students of 15-17 years old. Most of the actors / actresses were between 20 and 17 years old, and they tried to play for 15-17 years. The best scenes in this film take place in the dirty Hollywood clubs of the character Nicolas Cage. I gave this film a high rating of 9/10 for five reasons. The improvisational work of Nicolas Cage on the spot; Camera work and camera angles are excellent, given the budget they had and the ability to get only one take of each scene; Styles, music and jargon are recorded perfectly and forever; Again the music is incredible and carries the story from scene to scene; And finally ... Martha Coolidge can turn a weak script, unknown actors and a very very low budget, and 20 days of filming the entire film into such a good and memorable film is amazing!
