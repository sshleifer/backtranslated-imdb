<br /> <br /> When this film was released, I did not consider it an easy pop pop. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> After repeated viewing and viewing of a documentary film on the creation of DIRTY DANCING, disclosing the depth of this film certainly increases its appeal. <br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING is a film about change. The evolving nature of relationships in the family, changes in ideology during the age of majority, etc. The story unfolds in August 1963, in the last weeks of the last summer of innocence for the American people. The many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in American society that will be marked by the killings of Kennedy and Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Female filmmakers adored this movie and repeatedly made trips to the cinema this is the most successful dance film in the world. As a man, I find the romantic combination of an outstanding student, Patrick Swayze, with a very simple Jennifer Gray, very difficult to understand. It would be fatal for most romantic dramas, and could also cause strong hostility expressed by most male reviewers. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack for the film gained the status of # 1 before the release of the film. Until today, it’s almost impossible to attend a wedding reception without listening to the song DIRTY DANCING. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, the child's mother wakes up and asks the child's father: “Is something wrong?” <Br /> <br /> Baby's father, a family member against change, is trying to keep everything that is happening secret. He tells his wife to go back to sleep. However, to resist, as you can, the changes do not stop. DIRTY DANCING is a story about one person waking up just in the last minutes of our country’s last sleep in innocence.
