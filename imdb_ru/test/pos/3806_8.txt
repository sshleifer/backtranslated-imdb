This movie may be the best if you like to watch movies and laugh, and then force your friends to watch these movies too. If you are something like me, and perhaps it is, you will laugh for years at jokes in this film. One of the funniest parts is when Gus shakes some money for a guy with children, and then he takes the children to the forest, such as Hansel and Gretel, then he and his wife go home with them. The kitchen of the soup scene abounds in the comic genius of prankiness: “The inspector is here!” And the following lines will forever remain in my memory. When I show this film to my friends, they usually say: “What was that?!?” So if you're in the mood for one of these types of films, hurray! This film is so OOP that it is no longer funny, so probably the easiest way to get it is through an online auction. The first time I saw it was from hire.
