When I went to Bon Voyage, I was expecting a good, skilled multi-drama for the Grand Hotel (1932) and Les Enfants de Paradis (1944). It was better than that. With rare exceptions, none of the characters were absolutely good or evil, as in real life. The game was wonderful, especially those who played Frederick, Raoul and Camille. The photo was amazing, as it perfectly recreated this period, and it could be taken in / near Bordeaux during new public works, but they controlled the “appearance” of June 1940. Costumes and makeup were accurate. In this film, so much that is worth seeing the second time. It is exciting, fun and, ultimately, touching. N.B .-- Be sure to watch this in a movie theater with good projection quality. It is widescreen, and in the theater where I saw it (“Clairmont” in Moncler), the first 30 minutes were focused on the subtitles below, and the actors' faces were slightly blurred! This was eventually corrected, but distracted from the pleasure of the film.
