I have seen this film twice at the Transylvania International Film Festival (TIFF), a film in the competition, and I very much hope that Esteban Sapir will receive one of the awards (at least, the best image award). <br /> <br /> As a silent movie fan, I am interested in contemporary films that quote or recreate the cinema language of past years. The previous reviewer underlined the quotes from Fritz Lang and Fr. V. Murnau. In my opinion, the film directly mentions Metropolis Lang and the allegorically parabolic character of his plots. But I have not seen Murnau in this. Although there is a more obvious respect for Meli: The moon with a human face (cigars are smoked here) and paper-painted mountains and cityscapes. I liked the film mainly because of its visual effects, and at the same time I found a very interesting story about the dumbness and creative media that are used by residents of the city, where there is no voice. From this point of view, this film is a unique reflection of the silence of a silent film, because in films of a silent period one can hardly find stories with dumb characters. In this case, it is possible to question whether the story with the stolen voices was the motive for a silent film, or it is intended to play on the silence of silent films. I found another example of this kind of reflection in Guy Maddin's “Caution,” where the inhabitants of a mountain village have limitations in using their voices. I intend to write an article about this, if you know movies related to this topic, please let me know !!! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Esteban Sapir’s film to every movie-goer (one critic called it: the festival’s gem). <br /> <br /> PS: The winners were announced, and the film won an award for best cinematography!
