I just recently discovered this fantastic series, and I just can't get enough of the calm PI of Garner. The show constantly shows an excellent level of writing and waiting episodes. <br /> <br /> This episode, “Sleight of Hand”, is slightly different. Rejecting humor in favor of a more serious turn for Rockford, who is looking for his missing girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The mystery is great, and it is solved convincingly enough. It is based on a book (I can't remember the title), and it could easily be stretched to an episode with a long characteristic. Garner stands out here, because Rockford is getting tough and really means business. All this sounds like “noir”, dark lighting and a general mood echoes the gorgeous dark thrillers of the 40s and 50s. <br /> <br /> A really good episode on class A. Easy deserves 10.
