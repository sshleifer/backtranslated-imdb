It is a great honor for me to see this film by chance. I really stumbled upon this movie. One night, at night, I was recording another movie on Showtime, and this movie came later. So I sat and watched it, and the boy was blown up. The game is absolutely gorgeous. Katie Bates ... who has been my favorite actress since Misery and Roasted Green Tomatoes have played an amazing role as a powerful mother who is desperate to keep her old school values ​​(religion, family) at the risk of alienating her family. Martin Shin is great as a “tough” patriarch who doesn’t really control anything in his life or family. One thing that I really liked about this movie is how it tells what happens when the characters return home. This shows the real damage done to our soldiers after they wage senseless wars for political and financial gain. This film just hit me, and I'm happy that I accidentally recorded this film and saw it. This is a must see for everyone who wants real drama, it is not too melodramatic and preaching, but attracts the most sincere feelings to you like no other.
