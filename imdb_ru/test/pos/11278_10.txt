This kind of anxiety can only be inside a young man who is very seriously looking for his religion and his place in this world. As the text says at the beginning of the film, these pictures are dead: they are already in the past and were right from the moment the product was ready. But this is only for the manufacturer of these “products”: Maybe for someone who is in the same spirit (I think that many people, at least, from those who are seriously interested in religion, go through the same terrible tests and doubts in their personal development). And this, of course, is the reason why art is created in the first place: identification and consolation among the brethren. <br /> <br /> This film very well uses the “classic” technique of experimental cinema. And here, in my opinion, this technique is best used: as a tool for telling stories and creating an atmosphere for them, and not just as a pure abstraction or as an end in itself. These "tricks" have already been done quite a few times. Some of the other films that I think influenced and influenced this director are Eraserhead and Nosferatu. It is interesting how these techniques make this film absolutely eternal: there is nothing modern in this film. Or nothing from another particular time. This could have been done a thousand years ago. <br /> <br /> I wonder how these people relate to this newborn holy child: they use it selfishly for their own purposes and do not even try to listen to it. They beat him, tear off his intestines and castrate him. They forcibly pull his (living) body from place to place. And they do the same violence with his mother. This story also reminds me of Borges' story "El informe de Brodie". Also, criticism of the practice of Christian institutions reminds me of the great "El Topo". <br /> <br /> Sometimes unpleasant hours, but beautiful. Very simple, thoughtful and focused. Very strong movie, almost too strong. All human energy has been focused on this. In addition, this film shows that when you have passion and ideas, you can make a film with a round zero budget. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit that it was a bit difficult to watch the “contemporary” viewer, like me, because of experimentation. It was so slow and demanding. But it is worth suffering. I have to give ten points just for the fact that someone makes such a film.
