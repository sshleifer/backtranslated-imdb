This is a great movie! It's funny for everyone, even for adults. We got Jason Voorhees / Leather look like a killer, along with other stupid characters. Very funny movie for kids of all ages. We must shoot it every time we went to the video store! Baster and Babs make a good pair and should love duck. He is probably my favorite character! I've never been big on a television show, but this film just brings back so many beautiful memories. Be sure to look for families, fans of the show or anyone! Nice, no matter how old you are! RENT NOW IN YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE! <br /> <br /> P.S. NEED A DVD RELEASE!
