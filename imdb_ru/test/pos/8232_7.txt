After cleaning up Dodge City (with a little help from Wyatt Earp), Bat Masterson goes to Liberal, Kansas, where they have a small long-range war. Plus quite an interesting sharing scheme. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is Bat Masterson and he pursues the villains Billy House and Steve Brody, who drive homeowners out of their farms. The homeowners they leave are participating in the equity scheme funded by Robert Ryan. It seems that he puts different farmers on a plot of land to farm land for a percentage of the profits from their crops. Ryan is about to lose his shirt because of all the machinations. <br /> <br /> Bart Masterson, portrayed by Scott, is a standing Western hero eager to head east and become a reporter whom we all know he did later in life. <br /> <br /> Anne Jeffreys and Madge Meredith are involved in a romantic story with Brody and Ryan, who is a little silly and distracting. Ann Jeffries sings really well. <br /> <br /> Of course, Gabby Hayes, as always, provides great comic relief. <br /> <br /> A good addition to the Randolph Scott Western Collection. Also interesting, because in his later Western films he does not wear the same white hat as here. <br /> <br /> This review is about Casey Hayes of Professional Bull Riders, a proud resident of Liberal. Kansas, a city with great tradition, whether it is Bat Masterson, marshal it or not.
