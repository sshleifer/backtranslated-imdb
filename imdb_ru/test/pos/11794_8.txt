People watch movies for various reasons. This film did not have a big budget, there are no special effects, no car chases and explosions. In fact, in reality there are not so many of them either. At least not in my life. <br /> <br /> This is a very real film about very real people, none of whom is perfect in any case, but together they find themselves in a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that is, in turn, puts things in order out of chaos. I am not ready to limit the possibilities of parapsychology, since I am not an expert and do not use all the possibilities of my brain. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie for characters. He is full of a whole bunch of wonderful strange people. <br /> <br /> For the first three minutes, Kiefer Sutherland perfectly represents the life of Detective Michael Hayden and continues to develop the character throughout the film. Great game, very believable. <br /> <br /> Henry Cherni could not be played better, and the connection between his “Harvey” and “Mickey” Kiefer reinforces the opposite of their characters. <br /> <br /> I really liked the capricious hostess of the house. "Mrs. Ramsay", I am sure that she and my mother-in-law are good friends !!! <br /> <br /> There are many other great characters, but there is little space, so watch the movie and enjoy them.
