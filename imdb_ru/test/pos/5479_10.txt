This is a superbly crafted first-class Washington thriller, filmed by talented Wolfgang Petersen with hot screenwriter Jeff Maguire (who seems to have done little over the years, so he may be caring for his roses). In the film, Clint Eastwood is an aging secret service agent, and John Malkovich is a vengeful killer who fought each other in a massive test of will and ingenuity, where the president’s life is at stake. Excessive secrecy and competition between competing security agencies almost doom the president, which is a real touch. This film was made when Eastwood and Malkovich were at their peak. Eastwood has probably never done better than here, and for an old professional everything is so simple. There are some wonderful sound effects of his pant and pant when he runs alongside the President’s car as a bodyguard for which he is too old. I wonder if anyone else noticed the humor of these noises? My “guardian angel”, whose name is Vigil, liked this film even more than I did, but then the films about bodyguards are his most interesting. Rene Rousseau was the perfect choice for a female agent who falls in love with Eastwood, as she is not obvious, but so talented and shining. In this story, tension is tense at every turn, and Eastwood's psychological struggle to get rid of the earlier defense failure is well manifested in his typical understated play. With Eastwood, if he raises an eyebrow a millimeter, watch out! Of course, he is a super cool master. Malkovich has the opportunity to indulge all that he desires, in the paranoid character that he portrays, and he captures the central vanity of man to perfection. What kind of good.
