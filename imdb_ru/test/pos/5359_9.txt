This first (and hopefully not the last) Wallace & Gromit function meets expectations. There are a lot of jokes (some a bit cheeky), and also some great tribute to past science fiction films. Because of the many horrible and patterned films that have been erupted from Hollywood, itâ€™s great to see such a wonderful film like this one that will appeal to almost everyone. If there is at least some justice, then this will be the top box office and, at least, the nomination for the best animation in the next Oscars. The animation is wonderful; the characters are amazingly expressive, and their adventures are a great pleasure. This is one of those films that the whole family can enjoy. Charming, clever, fun and well done, what's not to like?
