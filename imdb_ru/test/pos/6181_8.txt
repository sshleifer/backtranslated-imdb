It's all about getting what you want, when you want it. And the message of the Eighth Bluebeard's Wife is to be careful with what you desire, up to what you desire for desires. <br /> <br /> Most men have heard stories about what happens when your sexual disorders do not go away. and a certain part of your anatomy turns blue. In addition to the misizinist pirates, Cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very used to getting what he wants, when he wants it, too late to find out that this is not what he expected, and never assimilating a lesson, until he faces a furious Claudette Colbert As a result of a perverted (in the soul and in practice) business deal, he ends up marrying her / bought her with the intention of putting her to bed, but she does not receive anything of this (literally) and upsets him every step corner and room and tourist attraction. <br /> <br /> The film has a certain French sensibility, which means that it has a strong double sense and boudoir humor during the day and a sharp edge that you are not used to (and may not like to see) in Cooper or Colbert. The reason I watched the film was that they were “cute” actors, and the whole point of this film is that they are unattractive people or at least nice people who have developed unattractive features to protect themselves, like they think of peace. <br /> <br /> If you accept it on your own terms, you will find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film ... and satisfaction, as we said before, that's all. Such a film with such actors appears, eventually, once in ... mmm ... blue moon.
