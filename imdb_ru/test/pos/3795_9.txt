Telling a story doesn't make sense, does it? Barnens ö, written almost like “booné aww”, is the name for this brilliant novel of the late seventies, which shook a multitude of people, including me. <br /> <br /> “Children's Island” is the name, and which island. In the book, Rhine, the protagonist has the Guinness Book of Records as his own Bible. And he seeks to break new records himself. In particular, the youngest man is under water in three minutes. <br /> <br /> The story, like most Swedish films and books of the time, is deep, consciously provocative and awe-inspiring. Bergman started his last film, and Chris and Whisper barely broke down. expectations from any Swedish film were quite high. Then they taught us that great theater, great actors, great writers and talented directors created a real perfection team in the cinema. <br /> <br /> All this suggests that Barnens ... is a story of discovery. This is also a story of alienation: cities are alienated, and life in one of them makes us aliens for the majority of its inhabitants. This is a story of revelations and unexpected encounters with our own destiny. This is a film of overwhelming hope and despair. About feelings buried under layers and layers of isolation and isolation from a world that would not care less ... <br /> <br /> This approach in itself is a rather difficult way to create a convincing narrative. Here, Kay Pollack’s masterful guide to Ola Olsson’s novel PC Jersilds turns him not only into an opportunity, but into one of these masterpieces of cinema. <br /> <br /> With someone I can disagree who said that this work was almost forgotten. Is not. Even when I write this in 2009, discussions on the history of P.C. Dzherzilda are conducted around the world, and the film is shown in many film schools and small cinemas. <br /> <br /> Why? It would be difficult to philosophize on all this, and many have already done so in a scientific way by writing lectures. The reason why Barnens ... was and remains a special story is the feeling of comfort that you experience from the very beginning when you discover that everything is told through the eyes of a small child. And this also ends there. Maybe this is a clinical view, as someone else pointed out. But deeply moving, touching and satisfying. The concept is deep: as long as we do not have pubic hair, we can still live another day like an angel. After that, we will become what Rhine reflects as a colophon of his experience: "People are pigs." He finds his fears when he is fearless. He finds love when the world collapses around him. He discovers the reason for not behaving like adults, because he refrains from committing crimes. He left his inner purity and confidence in others unconditionally, just to find out how rotten a person’s soul can be. <br /> <br /> Where love is expected, he finds hatred. Where compassion is necessary, he finds suspicions and cold hearts. This is a movie metaphor. A film for thinking and asking questions that are hard to ask, but which are harder to answer. <br /> <br /> In the end, the satisfaction of having witnessed such excellent work (which really increased the stakes for any other Swedish film after) is a ride of joy and hope. Know that this is a film full of the dark side of our nature. But alas! A film of hope and deep joy. Rhine will still be an island in Stockholm, but there is great hope to live fully today, even when we discovered the first signs of sexual maturity.
