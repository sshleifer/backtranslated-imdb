I have not read the novel by Anne Rice on which this film is based, but who knows, maybe reading a book is cheaper than renting the Queen of the Damned, and is probably better for your health. It's not that this film is necessarily harmful to your health, but the book can be very relaxing and, of course, uses the active part of your brain more than this film. You can count the number of pages of Anne Rice that I read on the one hand, but after watching this movie and interviewing a vampire, I have a feeling that she writes really good novels. The plots of both films hint at a whole sea of ​​deep and intertwined vampire stories. <br /> <br /> Still, Stewart Townsend’s off-screen narration is damn more annoying than Brad Pitt’s vampire tale, and you can tell that the limited production resources of QUEEN OF THE DAMNED barely provide enough flesh to Anne Rice’s storyline. While the Interview decided to use lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on special budgetary special effects, which are very hard to treat. You can see that the original novel had potential as a film, and that the film crew was focusing the wrong place. The costumes and the rock and roll scene could be replaced with blood and an eerie soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I will give due when it is needed. The soundtrack is great. Korn and Disturbed made me fall ill with a disease that was shaking my leg like a Butthead. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a very cool installation in the style of goth rock and splicing, but after about ten minutes the director begins to degenerate. quickly. As if the film was so long that the director realized that there was not enough time and money to pay tribute to the novel by Anne Rice. Which leads to some mediocre vampire scenes and a variety of raw special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED cannot cope with genre justice in the same way that their colleagues, John Carpenter, cannot impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where is pale blue makeup? Backstage, I shook my head, recalling the days of the Salem Lot and the Night of Fear, when the small budget was properly made. <br /> <br /> Although there are redemptive qualities that save this film from garbage. Support Aliya, and may her soul rest in peace with the world. She could have become a famous actress if her life had not been taken so prematurely from us because she gave this film a decent performance with a lot of beautiful belly dances. Did I mention the soundtrack was good? See what else can I say? It was not too long. Roman Anne Rice could easily have become a three-hour film if such ambitious film directors as Francis Ford Coppola had come to him. In the plot there are several turns. But overall, it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to a variety of second-rate vampire films. The director of this film became the director of the new mini-series Battlestar Galactica, if he says something to you. <br /> <br /> JY <br /> <br /> Jimboduck-dot-com
