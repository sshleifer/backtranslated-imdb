“The tourist trap” is a strange thriller, released in the 70s, it's about 5 friends Molly (Jocelyn Johns), Jerry (John Van Hess), Eileen (Robin Sherwood), Becky (Tanya Roberts) and Woody (Kevin McDermott) who stumbled upon a dilapidated museum of the lost oasis of SLAUSEN, a curious and creepy roadside museum. This gold mine of decaying, but strangely life-like dummies is ruled by Slausen (Chuck Conners), an eccentric but seemingly harmless person. Slausen has one warning for young people: stay away from Davey, the hermit, and worried brother Slausen. <br /> <br /> Young people's curiosity takes over, and they go exploring. The trap jumped! Between flying objects, slamming doors, scarves that stifle themselves, reinforced by some hidden force, the trap slowly approaches the group. "Creature" Davey and his army of murderous dummies do the quick and brutal work of friends, until only one remains. <br /> <br /> Although in the film “Slasher” “The Tourist Trap” there are still no elements of such slash films as: scenes of persecution, persecution and the fact that the killer wears a mask. <br /> <br /> The killer’s telekinetic ability to block bolts and animate wax dummies appears to be used with great effect. Perhaps the scariest thing in this film is mannequins who, admittedly, are scary enough to start with them, but at the same time they are just frightening. The film is successful, in spite of or, perhaps, because of a clearly meager budget. These wax figures are obviously plastic mannequins from the store - but it gets even more creepy when their eyes move with an incredible person. The game is actually quite good, Chuck Conners gives a very round and creepy performance like Mr. Slausen, Jocelyn Johns. excellent as a female presenter.
