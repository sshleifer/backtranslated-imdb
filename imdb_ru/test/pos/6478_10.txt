Pat O'Brien played his best role as football coach of Notre Dame Knut Rockn. From the very beginning, Rockne entered Notre Dame as a student around 1910. He studies chemistry, but he becomes a wonderful football player and hero. <br /> <br /> After leaving school he teaches chemistry at school, but he has a soccer ball. the fever that beats him makes him give up chemistry to continue his dream of training the game. In a sense, the school probably lost a wonderful chemistry teacher - of course, much better and better than mine in high school. (More precisely, Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn.) <br /> <br /> He motivates his students. He will not tolerate academic failures. He is a coach for all times. <br /> <br /> O'Brien caught this generous good touch. One of his students, George Gipp, unforgettably played Ronald Reagan in an excellent short support game. <br /> <br /> Years pass and achievements reach a high level, but Knut remains the same kind coach who testifies before Congress when football is in question. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp is an eminent priest of Notre Dame, who knew that Rockney was destined to train football. Albert Basserman is adequate, but his Jewish accent in the image of a priest is awkward at best. Basserman was nominated the same year in the support category of the Foreign Correspondent. <br /> <br /> Roknaâ€™s tragic death in a plane crash deprived the world for many more years of an absolutely professional person. The film is great.
