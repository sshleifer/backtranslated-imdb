Furious Men is a good western. Perhaps the story is not the original owner of a large ranch dedicated to knocking out small competitors from the valley he needs for his growing cattle, but the film has many ingredients that raise its level and make it worthy of attention. <br /> <The cast is the highlight. There is a reliable Glenn Ford (John Parrish) in the role of a former army officer, and now one of the small ranchers who tries to stay out of trouble until he is prompted to difficulties. Edward Robinson (Lew Wilkinson) is as good as ever as a cripple, and Barbara Stanwick (Martha) plays his treacherous wife in one of her usual meanest female roles that she easily copes with (others were in “Double Compensation” and "Blowing Wild" Brian Keith (Cole) copes well with the role of Robinson's warrior brother, an ambitious man trying to capture his brother's big ranch, no matter what. Regular villain of the 50s westerns Richard Jackel (Wade Mattlock) also ends there as usual (no wonder there.) Dianne Fost (Judith Wilkinson) plays Robinson's daughter, who does not approve of the way father and mother and uncle deal with their neighbors. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Mate suggests a standard, but acceptable direction, perhaps with the help of beautiful and wide open scenery, and a good and suitable musical score also helps. <br /> <br /> The inevitable final bout between Ford and Keith is one of the best in Western films. Each person has his own duel style (pay attention to shooting with his arms and aim at military target by) resolve their differences once and for all. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Western performances of Glenn Ford, second only to the classic “3:10 Yume” he made two years later. This is probably the cast, which puts the film on the rating of "A" and, in my opinion, is in the top 10 of the genre.
