In the pantheon of John Ford films there is a unique place for Wagonmaster, Sergeant Rutledge and The Sun Shines Bright. It was these three films, in which there were no box office names, that Ford did not have to set up a film around the star’s personality, be it John Wayne, Henry Fonda or someone else with whom he worked. Not surprisingly, Ford considered it all to be favorites of one sort or another. <br /> <br /> Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. sign up a pair of cute cows to drive the Mormon train to the valley in Arizona. On the way to them, they first join a group of stuck players from the medical show, and then a family of criminals on the run named Clegg. Their stories merge, and what happens is the basis of the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> If Wagonmaster were completed even 10 years earlier due to two representations of Johnson and Cary, both would probably have had significant careers, like the B picture of cowboys. In the case of Johnson, it would be an art imitating life. Johnson was a real rodeo cowboy and came to Hollywood with a horse that John Ford used at Fort Apache. Ford was amazed by his presence, and the rest is history. <br /> <br /> But Western B came to an end, and Johnson and Carey had excellent careers as two excellent actors. <br /> <br /> Ward Bond plays a senior wiggs, Mormon leader. Bond is a new convert and it’s hard to remember that he doesn’t use four-letter words. But he is a leader because of his strength of character, and not his impeccable SPD theology. He turns out to be a wise and compassionate leader. <br /> <br /> With the image of Cleggs, Ford needed only four years ago to return to his “Favorite Clementine”. They are the reincarnation of the gang of Clanton and pure evil. In fact, if Walter Brennan, who, after my dear Clementine had refused to ever work for Ford again, wanted to, I could easily have seen that he was being shot as Shilo Clegg, the head of the family. Since it was Charles Kemper who did an excellent job, it is probably this role that he is best known for. Shortly after this film was made, Kemper was killed in a car accident. He could work very well for Ford in the future. <br /> <br /> Ford is doing Mormon pacifists here, and I don’t remember that pacifism was part of the LDS doctrine. However, it works here, the whole idea is that these people who do not carry weapons are innocent when dealing with evil people such as Cleggs. It takes a certain amount of cowboys to get rid of them correctly. I think that this film after World War II tries to say that pacifism is not always the best policy. <br /> <br /> Another transition from “My dear Clementine” is Alan Mowbray, who plays the same role as there as the head of the medical show troupe. Part of this troupe is Joan Drew, who makes another twist as a woman of resilient virtue, as in the Red River. Drew made so many westerns that she wanted to get out of calico and get acquainted with modern fashion. <br /> <br /> Wagonmaster is great fun, and I bet that Utah is a pretty popular movie. ,
