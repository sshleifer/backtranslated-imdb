This existential thriller, in Portuguese with English subtitles, is a modern version of American films from the 1940s, complemented by an unexpected twist at the end. It rivet from start to finish. My only criticism is bad production values. The film looks cheaply made, and perhaps it was so, so black and white cinematography is much inferior to Godardâ€™s films in Vivre Sa Vie, if we recall another film noir more than 30 years ago. The craziest of all, subtitles are often hard to read. When filmmakers learn and provide yellow subtitles so that they can be read on a white background. I would give 8 as a whole, although at higher production rates it could be higher.
