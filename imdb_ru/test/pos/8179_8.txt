This film is not for those who expect martial arts extravaganza. As for historical accuracy, I will leave this question to those who are better informed on this issue. I thought the performances were great. Gong Li never disappoints as the resourceful and (initially) faithful consort of King Qin. Fanji Zhang showed great flexibility in portraying a ruler descending into madness. He chose the route "Hannibal Lecturer", and did not resort to ranting. For me, Zhiwen Wang had the best performance as a super-smooth marquis. The character looked very oily, but in a subtle "Sir Humphrey Appleby" - "Yes, Minister." <br /> <br /> Cinematography is an outstanding feature of this film. The scene when the marquis and his people stormed the palace is breathtaking. There are also many wonderful battle scenes. Therefore, this film is strongly recommended on the big screen.
