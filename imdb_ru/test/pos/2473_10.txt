However, keep in mind that all this was filmed using one 16-mm manual camera ... the whole dialogue was improvised ... none of the actors appeared in front of the camera in front of ... It sounds like a recipe for disaster. Instead, we get hippies and cops running around the California desert, which turns into “unfair”. I am on the side of this man.
