I really wanted to give this movie 10 points. I thought for a long time that it was my favorite of the four modern Batman films on the air today (and maybe it will be so - I have to watch Schumacher films again). I also begin to worry about whether I am in some subconscious way the opposite. You see, I always liked Schumacher films. As I recall, they were 9 or 10 for me. But the conventional wisdom is that Tim Burton’s two directorial films are far superior. I had serious problems with the first Burton Batman this time - I ended up giving him 7 - and I apologize how I could, I just could not feel that the Batman Return simply had too many small problems of direction, plot and script scattered everywhere to justify 10. <br /> <br /> But Burton _almost_ transcends problems with the sheer power of style, and, although there are many minor flaws, Batman Returns is still a great movie, especially if you're a 'Burton fan, because " The Return of Batman "has as much in common with" The Nightmare Before Christmas " (1993) and "Edward Scissorhands" (1990), how much and with the rest in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The film begins strongly, with a cobblestone, having a child. We see their confusion - people leave the room of birth with horror on their faces, ready to vomit. Later they give birth to a child in a small cage. Finally, they take him for an evening walk and dump him in the river Gotham City. The child becomes the villain of Batman "Penguin" (Danny De Vito). <br /> <br /> Max Shrek (Christopher Walken) is the “evil capitalist” of the film, comparable to Grissom (Jack Palance) in Batman. He plans to deceive Gotham City in various ways, and we see how he emotionally insults his secretary, the timid Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). When Kyle discovers one of the heinous conspiracies, Grissom tries to get rid of her, but she is saved by the cats, and she becomes a female cat. <br /> <br /> While all this is happening, the Penguin, who has long been rumored to be, there is only one who is considered dangerous, and begins to put forward a plan that will be presented to the public as a good guy, despite the presence of not very friendly, hidden motives. <br /> <br /> Before re-watching Batman Burton’s films this time, I don’t remember how few Batman movies (Michael Keaton) are. As if Burton did not feel that the character was interesting enough to focus on him. Here, more attention is paid to the villains, especially Penguin. Batman doesn’t appear very often, especially at the beginning of the film, and surprisingly often we see him watching Penguin. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers necessarily consider this a disadvantage, I can not say what I know, even if I wanted to learn more about Batman and follow his story more. The stories of villains are also interesting, and as the “history of origin” for the two main villains of Batman, the Return of Batman is more than difficult from the point of view of the plot. <br /> <br /> However, there are some problems with characters that I consider a disadvantage. Penguin has a number of circus artists who execute his orders, but, although they are often on the screen, we will never know anything about them. Burton has the same intriguing characters as in Todd Browning's Freaks (1932), with interesting actors like Vincent Schiavelli, but he simply has no place to use them. <br /> <br /> For this, the fact is that he hardly has a place to explore a female cat. The film plays as if Catwoman may have been as developed and shown in so many scenes as Penguin, but this section of the film would have lasted 4 hours. Thus, most of the scenes of "Catwoman" should be removed. Of course, all this hardly leaves Batman a place. In this film, Burton gets very gloomy in front of the public, and, oddly enough, he never tries to solve this problem. As far as we know, in the end, the Gothamites still think that Batman is a crazy killer. This is an interesting development, but, unfortunately, in the end it was missed between this film and the next one. <br /> <br /> With regard to the scenario, there are some minor problems, including some non-sectural and strange solutions (in terms of logic). The characters show that Burton and the writers Sam Hamm and Daniel Waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story. Many dialogues are pun-oriented, but often they are rather thin and / or complex (of course, sometimes they are too explicit or transparent). It helps to look at the “Return of Batman” as a more “poetic” film, as I thought. This also translates into more general plot and directorial decisions — many unusual actions of the characters, including those from secondary characters, are performed to serve the general mood or style, and this style works very well. <br /> <br /> “Dark” is the easiest way to summarize the “Batman Returns” in one word, and whether it will be positive or negative depends on your location. Anyone who knows me knows that I love darkness. So for me, the Burton style is in many ways beyond the plot and script flaws. In many ways, The Return of Batman is reminiscent of a crazy, horrible horror movie with a beautiful, creepy production design. Like Batman, Burton still makes many references to other films, but instead of "Vertigo" (1958) and "Star Wars" (1977) (well, there is a small link to "Star Wars"), he refers to such films as Nosferatu (1922) (including this "Max Shrek" - that was the name of the actor who played a character like Dracula there), "Motel Hell" (1980), the aforementioned "Freaks", Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) ( which has a surreal, dark edge) films about zombies - made most clearly in the final scene of Penguin. <br /> <br /> In terms of visual effects and general atmosphere — and this includes the overall “feel” of the story, the characters, and so on — this cannot be stronger than 10.
