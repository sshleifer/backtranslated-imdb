Travis (James Franco) is a young man traveling by train for business reasons (we must assume), who leaves his favorite phone behind. Terry (Rachel Miner), a prostitute, takes him, and when he goes to her city to pick him up, a series of events take place that will definitely stay with him forever. <br /> <br /> Both characters There are barriers that they set to protect themselves from intercourse. But, despite their facades, it is obvious that both are seeking to destroy them. There are only about 30 or so spoken lines, but because James Franco and Rachel Miner use their faces, you can also turn off the volume, words are not needed. A scene worth paying attention to - Terry looks at himself in the mirror. You can just feel her despair penetrating the room. <br /> <br /> But the film is not perfect. This is mostly captured with hand-held cameras, which is a little distracting. Mainly due to the actions of Mr. Franco and Miner and the photographs, the flaws of the script are not so strongly highlighted. However, sometimes it seems that the story does not really know where it wants to go. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a type of film that really stays with you long after you have watched it. An hour after you saw this, you are still “what if” on behalf of certain characters. This is not perfect, but still leaves much to be desired, wanting it to be at least 4 times longer.
