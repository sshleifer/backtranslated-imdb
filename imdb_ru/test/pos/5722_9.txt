Definitely, this is not a film that revolutionizes the industry or introduces any new methods of film production, it is a very beautiful and solid production. It's amazing that today we can enjoy it in excellent quality on DVD - probably, most viewers saw a black and white copy about 100 years ago, since the stencil version of the “suite” was available only in the best cinemas. Even if you are not passionate about this film or its theme, you can't help but admire a copy released by Image Entertainment (along with another gem, From Nursery to the Cross, 1912). It is almost impossible to see a film that is more than a hundred years old, but which demonstrates so little damage. The screen coloring process was very efficient, and, compared to the sometimes blurred and blurred images of a hand-made color film, the colors were clear and sharp. Filmed as part of the shooting, which was known in 1902, when the shooting began, the static nature of the scenes today can be considered almost intentional, meditative and solemn. The tables continue to move evenly, so the movie never becomes tedious. You may not be fascinated by this film as a work of cinematography, but it is certainly beautiful as a work of academic, pictorial art. If you are a religious person, the fact that you look at anonymous people, long gone people playing long gone characters greatly increases the riddle. Correct viewing at Christmas or Lent. <br /> <br /> PS.: I ticked the box "contains spoilers" just for fun. As you can see, I did not reveal the ending.
