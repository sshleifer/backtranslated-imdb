Accounts seem real with the human factor added to the mix. A lot of sadness. I'm sure glad I am not him ... another thing to add is that all the women on this show were not really pretty stories about real women. But I don't think it was about women, although it was to the passion of JFK Jr. What a disgrace. Any loss of life is a real shame. <br /> <br /> This seems like a good account of his life. I recommend it if you are in biography and melodrama!
