This film tells about six men who are charged to transport money from a bank to a business. Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) was in Iraq for the war serving his country, and now his friend Mike Kohron (Matt Dillon) is making a living, making sure he does not lose his home. Mike tells him that this was not the life that his parents expected from him, and he should live better than now with his brother Jimmy Hackett (Andre Kinney). Speaking to Ty, that he and Jimmy were always family with him and will do everything to help them, Mike tells Ty about the plan to commit the robbery. The money will be about 43 million, divided into six directions and among other transport workers, although Tai does not like the idea that he tells his friend Mike, until no one gets hurt, he will be in. Last night, Ty had to talk to the Lady of Welfare about putting his brother into a foster family, giving him the dilemma of losing the most important thing in his life. Although the plan sounds safe at first, greed is not everything when it comes to deprivation of life. <br /> <br /> When it comes to robberies, that is you or not, so when you don’t go with Plan it’s hard to play a hero and stop people’s greed when it comes to getting big amounts of money. This film comes with a star cast to interest you in starring roles: Jean Reno, Lawrence Fishburn, Amaury Nolasco, Fred Ward, Skit Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia. In short, I just recently remembered him in Stomp the Yard, which told about a child who lost his brother and lives his dream to go to college. It was probably one of his best films in which I saw him, and in this film he blends so well with the character that it's nice to see him again on the big screen in action.
