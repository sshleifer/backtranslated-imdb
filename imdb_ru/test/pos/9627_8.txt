This is really a classic Kung Fu. This film seems to have influenced martial arts films for decades. Spanish background music on the guitar, competing schools, incredibly high jumps on the edges of the roofs, catching of spears, fraud in tournaments, secret training for exotic karate techniques, themes of patience and perseverance and much more were copied by many later films such as "The Karate Kid "(1984)," Hero "(2002)," Kill Bill Volume 2 "(2004) and" Kung Fu Hustle "(2004). <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see this film for the first time in 1972, shortly after its release, shortly before the kung-fu films became mainstream and before Bruce Lee became a household name. I saw it with two of my buddies in a theater in downtown San Diego frequented by sailors, and although scenes of glowing red hands and hollowed out eyeballs caused some laughter, it is clear that the public was involved in this, like our small group. It was a very memorable film for me. Decades later, I could still recall several specific scenes, even after I forgot the name of the film. This film is special to me now because one of those two friends I first saw him with (sailor Kenneth Lee Hines from Kitty Hawk) has since passed away, so this film serves as a memorable sign of the day we took judo. and karate lessons in the following years. <br /> <br /> In relation to the films about Kung Fu, I would rate this film as 10/10. But since I have to remember a larger audience of the film, I will more objectively evaluate it as 8/10 due to obvious technical flaws. I simply recommend that the neophyte viewers regard these technical flaws as proof of his vintage character and authenticity, and then merrily continue to enjoy his testosterone-charged chaos.
