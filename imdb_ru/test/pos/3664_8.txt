Have you ever wondered what it means to feel FREE? I am sure that each of us knows the meaning of freedom and never seriously thinks about using it to our advantage. HARI OM shows the audience what freedom really means. In this film, freedom is described in the form of a style represented by the discovery of Isa India. Isa discovers her inner true love when she travels by rickshaw with Mr. Hari OM. She looks at life differently and portrays the freedom that every woman limits when she is in a relationship. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely “worth seeing”, and for the first time I saw it in the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF), and I left the cinema hall with complete satisfaction. <br /> <br /> “Look”!
