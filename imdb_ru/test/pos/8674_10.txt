I think this is the best Norwegian film I have ever seen. This is about 40-year-old Andreas, who is knocked down by a subway train, and he suddenly finds himself in a strange city, but everything is prepared for him here. He has a job, a house and clothes. At first this city seems ideal, neither death, nor pain, nor problems. Everywhere there are people in gray suits who clean and fix everything that does not fit into their definition of the ideal. However, Andreas, it seems, cannot fit in and begins to return to his old world for a long time, and tries to return by all means. <br /> <br /> What struck me most in this film is how they make the city so surreal, although I have seen many such places in real life that they seem so far away. Another thing that makes a big contribution to this is the performance of the actors. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is just the perfect guy to play the embarrassed and annoying Andreas. And all the other characters also do an excellent job playing apathetically (sounds like hard work, doesn't it?). The strong difference between Andreas and the others also leads to very funny situations. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a terrific movie. The plot may be a little confusing, but the film has such a wonderful atmosphere that I would advise everyone to watch it. <br /> <br /> And I wouldnâ€™t recommend listening to ccscd212, because it seems that he has seen too many commercial American films and seems to be too used to the fact that he just likes the moral qualities on a silver plate. As I understand it, in this film there is little that suicide is right or wrong. I think this is rather a warning about the direction in which our society is moving. But, of course, everyone can watch the film in their own way.
