When I was very young, my mom had a series of four Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies shorts on tape, and I watched them all several times. Koi bait was one of those shorts, and I was shocked when I read comments in another that she was banned. When I was young, I probably didn't even understand the Black Beauty gag right from the start. However, this is probably why it was forbidden, although, until I watched it on the video site, I did not even remember the gag. When I watched the video, I remembered some of the pictures, in particular, the reduction of Duffy's hat, and Duffy's eyes turned live when the bait surrounded him in the Lake. I was not bothered by the gag, which most likely caused the gag to be banned. Instead, I was flooded with childhood memories of watching this short film. Because I liked this short childhood, I rate him as 7 out of 10.
