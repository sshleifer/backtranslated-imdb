(Warning: spoilers! - although this film is hard to spoil, telling the details of the story.) <br /> <br /> Eisensteinâ€™s black and white propaganda film is not for everyone. He is very old and awkward. What makes it great for me is the soundtrack, not the original, but the updated soundtrack. Moreover, the orchestral version of Prokofiev was created (my favorite performance is Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony). <br /> <br /> In some places, the film is really funny. It resembles the old "Midsummer Night's Dream." Some of the outdoors scenes are pretty awesome. Some of the actors are also quite gorgeous. (The actor who played Nevsky could have become a superstar today. The same is true of the warrior chick Vasilisa, definitely a rocker.) (there are many of them - they make up the bulk of the conversational lines). <br /> <br /> Battle scenes actually look much more realistic than most big-budget Hollywood films. These guys are as clumsy in their struggle as real peasants. The weapon looks ugly, so the actors probably tried not to cause each other any harm. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays the German Grand Marshal, * very * tries very hard to look scary at the beginning of the film, but he looks like he really was a cat. After being captured, he looks * so * pathetic. (Says a lot about the intended audience, huh?) <br /> <br /> A really funny touch - the German army brings with it * the organ * on which the character in the black mantle plays. See how Russians kill this guy * while * he plays. <br /> <br /> After the battle is over and almost all Germans are dead, the best part of the film (and music) comes, the song is played to the dead soldiers who died defending the Motherland. This part is so sad that it is almost an anti-war statement. <br /> <br /> Ten times more men than women rated this movie. I wonder why? <br /> <br /> Warning: Joseph Stalin liked this movie. Ironically - he killed more Russians than anyone. "Those who come to Russia with a sword will die by the sword."
