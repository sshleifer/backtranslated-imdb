John Cusack starred as Hoops in this little stupid film, which should be one of the best comedy films of the eighties. Believe it or not, Demi Moore is his colleague in photography ... If you love the eighties, grew up at this time, or you suffer from the sadness of a teenage artist, get ready to laugh. Wait until you see the cartoons .. what a riot ....
