Jean-Pierre Melville is a director I just recently met (I need to see Bob le Flambor and Le Samurai again to fully understand them), but in Le Circle Rouge (Red Circle, presumably based on Buddhism) I realized that I was watching the same skillful and exciting crime film that I had seen for a long time. Despite the fact that his film has a dialogue, it is mainly intended to ensure that the scenes of the film move forward, adhering to the plot. What kept me alert, even in seemingly everyday scenes / episodes, was an emphasis on character movements or behaviors. Melville laid out his story, and he tries not to rush to tell about it (to some it may seem boring, but it seems that it works, as he places more emphasis on the weight of the characters / environment than on the plot), <br /> < br /> But take a look at each of the four main players: Alain Deleon as Corey (just released from prison, plotting a new robbery), Jan Maria Volonte as Vogel (escaping from custody in handcuffs) meets Corey by happy coincidence) , Yves Montand in the role of Jansen (elderly professional l with years of experience with guns, Vogel each), and Andre Burvil as Matteo (experienced investigator who is looking for Vogel, and on the fingers with the internal affairs). Each of these actors plays its part with precision, detachment, and each of them has its own moments that indicate to the audience what their personalities may be, besides being criminals and policemen. For example, a sequence of robberies gives small hints, for example, how Vogel feels like a female statue, walking through the corridors, or how Jansen pulls out a flask and just inhales the contents (and what dream this guy creates). Even Corey's movements with a photo of a woman are of interest. <br /> <br /> How an exciting and cool story becomes, and how great the skills were to bring it to life (through cinematographer Henri Deka, the editing and musical accompaniment of Eric DeMarsan), itâ€™s the people on the screen that enchants with how they remain true to their nature and ideals. The French enthusiast of the new wave will not miss a single film, and lovers of modern crime films may want to spend 140 minutes to soak up the atmosphere of Melville's work. The elegant part of filmmaking, which is still considered one of my favorite.
