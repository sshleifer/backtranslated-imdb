"The Edge of the City" is another film that owes a great deal to "On the Embankment." From his places in New York, to his assessment, to the belief that whatever problems you may have, you can somehow correct your mistakes. <br /> <br /> Edge also deals with ideas such as loyalty and racism. In my opinion, this is where the film failed, like Quay. After 85 minutes, the film goes through the establishment of relationships and binds everything so quickly that a lot of it seems forced and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Possible spoilers **** <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavett could have developed at the beginning. I do not believe that these two characters from two completely different places would build such a strong relationship so quickly. <br /> <br /> I think that the whole love story with Cassavet could be eliminated. He is so embarrassed with a woman that it hurts to watch. The only reason this happens in a film is because she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways they could show it. I would also like to see some scenes with Axel in the army to show why he is what he is. <br /> <br /> The game is great. Poitiers is stunning in a role that is beautifully written. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially in 1957), a self-confident, respected and intelligent man. Cassavet as Axel North, although very good, is not quite suitable for this role. The guard is amazing like a boss who knows Axl's secret (although his battle scene with Cassavetta is awful at the end. Too many tear-off boxes) I thought Ruby Dee was great as the wife of Poitiers. <br /> <br /> In general, “The Edge of the City” is a smart film with a very good composition that tries too hard to be an interesting noir-style. photo, without wasting time to let the drama stand. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
