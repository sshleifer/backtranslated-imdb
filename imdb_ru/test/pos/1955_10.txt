IMDb makes reviewers type a certain number of lines, but all I really want to say is: "This is an incredible film, and you cannot consider yourself as a fan of the film without seeing it." You just have to believe me in this and stop reading this review and get the movie and press the play button. But I have to print something. So let me point out the following: <br /> <br /> (1) River's Edge contains what can still be considered the most ridiculous and best show of Crispin Glover in the film, and if you followed Crispin Glover In general, you you know that this in itself justifies giving him 10. Fun lines in abundance. <br /> <br /> (2) The River Territory has the second most memorable picture of Dennis Hopper’s career (except that in Blue Velvet) and this is really excellent. Dennis Hopper is really funny. <br /> <br /> (3) In River's Edge there is the best job in the career of Keanu Reeves, and this is great. It was the role he was born to play. He has many good lines, but one of them is really very funny. Listen carefully when his character and stepfather are talking to each other. <br /> <br /> However, the best film about stoners, it is much more than simple. This tends to appear in the dramatic sections of movie rental stores, but if it’s a drama, it’s the funniest drama of all time.
