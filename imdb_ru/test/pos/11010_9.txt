The premise of SF is not unique (although to a large extent it was then), but the focus is completely different than in other films about artificial reality. Especially in the first part, this is a complex crime scene that uses the SF premise to tell an unusual crime story in which a forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of disappearing characters and useless witnesses who do not need to lie to be useless. <br /> <br /> In the second part, we follow the protagonist’s struggle for sanity, and this more turns into a psychological study of the character in an extreme situation. He knows that his very existence is nothing but electrical impulses, how does he cope with this knowledge? He knows that there is a world that is more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world where no one can understand him. The problem of thinking about knowing something significant about a world that no one knows or does not want to believe in is very real, with which many of us can identify ourselves. For me, the film conveys very well this hopelessness, with its dark, artificial atmosphere, which also supports the actual artificiality of the film’s world. <br /> <br /> In addition to “The Matrix” or the “Thirteenth Floor”, it doesn’t bother much to cause a sense of awe for the plot of artificial reality; instead, it pays great attention to psychological aspects. Philosophy is interesting only because certain philosophical concepts are necessary in order to shape and change the perception of the character of the world. <br /> <br /> It may be longer than it should be (and this is not a problem if you are fascinated by it just like me), and part 2 works at the limit.
