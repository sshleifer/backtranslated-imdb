Riffi deservedly enjoys great mention of the famous scene of the robbery, and, indeed, this scene deserves all praise. This is the master part of the waiting, the interaction of characters and photos. But Rifi is not just one scene - each scene in the film is also masterfully composed, and the film is taught not only with a stretch, plot and character, but also a cleverly told moral story that prepared the stage for noir film for many years. <br /> <br /> Cinematically and technically, the sequence of robberies can be the most impressive scene of a film, but for me this is the final scene that has the most power - the hallucinogenic Tony Le Stefanua move to buy.
