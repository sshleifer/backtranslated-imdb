Fulci is one of my favorite Italian directors. He is also a very good storyteller, perfectly combining horrors, supernatural and psychedelic themes. This film was really his last great story, before he chanted such disappointments as Voices from. The story is simple because Fulci plays himself, a horror director. After many years of filming films about splashes and blood, it seems that Fulci begins a disorder in which he begins to hallucinate the people who are being killed. He decides to turn to a psychiatrist, who only aggravates the situation when he convinces Fulci that he is killing people. <br /> <br /> Fulci used scenes with blood from several shots at the same time. These films, I do not believe, he shot, but, of course, produced. Some of these films are “Massacre” by director Andrea Bianchi (“The Imperial Eagle”), “Touch of Death” by the director Fulci, “The Secret of the Murders”, and I cannot remember the other films. <br /> <br /> Nightmare Concert is a very underrated film, even Fulci fans. But I loved this movie and watched it many times already. Sadly, after this, Fulci didn’t have the opportunity to manage something worthwhile, but, nevertheless, this is a great film, and I recommend it to any Fulci fan, whether you like it or not. 9/10 stars
