An exceptional film that handles the theme of large proportions with a very well balanced direction. Dmitry was a very good director, at least from what I can say from this film and Kill My Sweet, but HUAC seriously influenced him, as did other directors and actors. In a sense, it is ironic that Crossfire did not get an Oscar, because it is an excellent example of how to make a great film with a low budget. Everything in this film is exceptional: a well-written script that uses extensive memories, a great cast, excellent lighting, which seems to tell a story more than the action itself. What else can you expect from a top-notch movie? I can add that noir is used here because of its style, and I could add financial advantages. But this proves once again that what was originally thought of as a B-film may have a greater impact today than most hard A-films that have lost their audience over time. <br /> <br /> This film is not a noir-film in itself, and this raises serious questions about what noir really is. The style is definitely noir, in terms of sets and especially lighting, but the theme surpasses the recipe of "noir genre." You can look at things from the opposite point of view and argue that anti-Semitism is only a pretext for a criminal investigation, because the actual goal is murder. This would be so if it were not for Robert Ryan in an outstanding presentation. In any case, the film has something to offer, and it’s a pity that the director suffered so much from lawlessness because of his previous beliefs in really “noir” America.
