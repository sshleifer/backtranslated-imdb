Yes, I am ashamed to admit it, but this show is positively DEVINE !!! This is so exciting, and I watch this time perfectly. From the 1st cycle it was great, and I did not notice the fall in this Glory to ALL. Tyra Banks, as you know, is leading, and no matter how fabulous she is, there are other judges and co-chairs, such as J. Alexander, Jay Manuel, Nigel Barker and Twiggy. for each girl invited to become the American model of Top Top America, she has to go all the way to the top, passing and winning the photo shoot competition. It sounds great, doesn't it, and let me tell you that itâ€™s great !!!! ! It's amazing to watch all kinds of photo shoots that girls do, and they are all different, cool and bold. Anyone who hates this show has no idea, and I will tell you that this show will be on for a long time, so handle it !!!
