Lauren Himmel's debut film is well directed with pleasant sophistication. There is a strong storyline that makes sense in all of this, even if nothing is decided at the end, hence the name “Incoming Water”. The storyline revolves around a lesbian couple and their battle with their mother for adoption. 7.5 / 10
