Excellent special effects make this catastrophe very plausible. It can be seen that manufacturers have put a lot of effort to properly configure the displays on computer screens - all this is very convincing. The sets also look very authentic. A good selection of music perfectly complements the film. <br /> <br /> The cast is good, and the presence of David Suchet, of course, adds weight to the cast. Compared to other films of this genre, Flood is right there with the best of them. Fortunately, the aspect of “human drama” was not exaggerated, as is often the case in this type of film. Human suffering is depicted in perfect balance with real flood scenes. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the film confirms what many of us suspect, one way or another: weather forecasters often do not understand that! :)
