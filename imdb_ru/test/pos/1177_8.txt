Walter Mattau and Jack Lemmon, who, unfortunately, are not enough, once again proved that they were a team devoted to their skill to bring funny moments to the screen. This film is another example of this. <br /> <br /> This time they play two son-in-law who sit on the ship as dance instructors on board. <br /> <br /> Of course, their boss is a perfectionist and unhappy man named Jill Godwin, who just likes to chase these boys. It's funny how Lemmon gives a quick dance lesson to Matteu and how the last one is dancing a lush rumba with boat owner Ryu McLanahan. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the dance colleagues give Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor so little to do, but parts of them require it. Mattau falls in love with Dayan Cannon on board, along with her fellow prospector, the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch. Unknown to them, Mattau also has no money. Widowed Lemmon falls in love with Gloria De Haven, looking better than ever. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Mattau and Lemmon and will serve as an additional tribute to their outstanding career.
