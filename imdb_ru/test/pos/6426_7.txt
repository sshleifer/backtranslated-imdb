Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a translator living in Italy, discovers that she has a memory loss and cannot remember the last couple of days. She begins to follow the traces of memory fragments that lead her to the small town of Garm. People in the city seem to recognize her, and she begins to suspect that the repeated nightmares of astronauts conducting terrible experiments are somehow related to her own amnesia. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting, and the plot is good, but it is a bit to slowly move and lay claim to my taste. The plot takes several pleasant turns, and it is very difficult to understand where it is going. Florinda Bolkan is good in her role (but even better in the “Flavian heretic”), and it is always nice to see the “star” child actress Nokolettu Elmi. The role of Klaus Kinsky is too small though. This is not a movie for the harsh hounds of the mountains or the exploiting addict, but still a very pleasant secret for an hour and a half.
