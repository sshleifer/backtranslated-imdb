I can’t imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is greater than Quentin Tarantino’s thirst. (At least in his films) The inglorious bastards are no different. We all know Tarantino, a guy who exploded on stage in the early 90s with iconic classics such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since then, he has been a disappointment for some. Well, I'm glad to say that Tarantino has not lost touch. He brings us the utmost since the days of “Pulp Fiction” and, fortunately, so. <br /> <br /> We know the story, the story of the Second World War, told only as Tarantino can. (Of course, fictional) The war film has not yet been shot. Brad Pitt as Lieutenant Aldo Rein leads the bastards in Nazi occupied France. Their goal is to kill the Nazis. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other hand. He is known as the “Hunter of the Jews” and goes about his business as mercilessly as no one else. The third story tells of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnessed the murder of her family. And she, of course, wants to avenge the Germans for her devastating losses. Here, in fact, the three stories are intertwined and connected with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new for him. <br /> <br /> War has never been so fun. Bastards pursue, but at the same time very funny, and sometimes even funny. The dark comedic aspect plays a big role in this, as in many other Tarantino films. Fun and fun is led by Brad Pitt. I found it extremely funny and interesting. I could not wait to see it again on the screen. Even with his insane accent, he works in this type of film. Also impressed were Melanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were amazing. The film was filled with remarkable performances. <br /> <br /> In the history itself there are so many historical inaccuracies that can even be counted, but so what? This should not be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun, like us. The cinematography department deserves large footings with beautiful bright colors that highlight the film. You really have to love the last line in the film ... but "Pulp Fiction" remains his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino, among other things, is an artist. World War II is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino somehow manages to make it funny. “Inglorious Bastards” is a funny movie, it is incredibly interesting, shocking, dramatic, tense and funny at the same time. Jam is packed with everything that you are looking for in a film, made with this specific Tarantino style, it is worth checking out. The time has come to experience for yourself what war looks like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.
