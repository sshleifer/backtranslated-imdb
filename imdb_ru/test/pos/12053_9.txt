Darr is a great movie! Shahruh plays an obsessed lover who will do everything to defeat his lady, in this case Juhi Chawl. Little does Juhi know in the film that Shahruh is in love with her BASICLY and constantly persecutes her. I have to admit that some of the things he did in this film were rather creepy ... like threatening phone calls. Never in my life will I forget the phrase: “I love you, K..k..k..Kiran!” <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Shahruh and Juhi were not a “together” movie. But Juhi and Sunny in the film are well combined. Although the role of Shahrukh was pretty crazy, I still think that he coped well with her, and can not imagine that someone else would play this role. No wonder he got Darra's 94 'award! <br /> <br /> Juhi ... what can I say ??? She looks especially amazing in this movie! It's not that she doesn't always look amazing in her other films, but Darr really gave her a wonderful image of her audience! <br /> <br /> As for the music ... it was excellent! Especially "Jaadu Teri Nazar", one of my favorite songs. I also thought that Tu Mera Samne was also very good. <br /> <br /> Be sure to look at all! Overall, Darr deserves 9/10!
