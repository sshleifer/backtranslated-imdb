I hope that we, as a society, will never become so cynical to appreciate the simple beauty of this film: beautiful, to look at him with his romantic English countryside, and beautiful in his message of faith and devotion. Watch it with your children, especially with your young daughters. Velvet Brown is a great role model for girls. It was one of my daughter's favorite films. <br /> <br /> The story is based on Enid Bagnold's bestseller about Velvet girl, whose life is her horse Pi, and her dedication. the pursuit of her "impossible" dream. I will not talk more about the plot, I will not spoil it to newcomers. She lives in a big loving family in a small coastal village. <br /> <br /> This is the movie that made Elizabeth Taylor a star, and to watch a movie is to understand why. She is a natural actress who radiates inner beauty that corresponds to her outer beauty — trusting, passionate, innocent — she is the emotional core of the film. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney gives a wonderful idea, as Mi, a young Man who once arrives at their doorstep, stays and helps Velvet teach Pi. This is one of his best performances. Anna Revere also stands out in the role of the mother Velvet in the role of Oscar winner. Her strong, loving and wise character understands that life is not of great value if you do not follow your dreams: “We are the same. I also think that everyone should have a chance for an exciting piece of stupidity once in their life. ” "<br /> <br /> I wholeheartedly recommend this very sweet, very inspiring classic of the golden age of Hollywood.
