This show has everything you could ever want from a prison drama. There are twists to the end of the season. The characters are very strong, and this gives the show a lot of power. While watching the show, you feel not only prisoners, but also prison staff. The actors who play prisoners on this show did a great job on the image of the prisoner. Also, if you like law and order, the criminal intentions related to the rule of law, there are many actors in this series. The only problem with Oz is that it was not long enough. This show could easily have had nine to ten seasons without aging. Even after the season finale, I watch Oz all the time on DVD. This show is one of the best shows on television. Don't be a fool, go watch Oz.
