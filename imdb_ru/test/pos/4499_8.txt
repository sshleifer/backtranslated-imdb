Based on Khaled Hosseini’s best-selling book, The Running Serpent is a story of friendship, betrayal and the struggle for redemption. Filmed in Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion in 1979 and later, during the reign of the Taliban, all elements are present in the big drama, but under the direction of Mark Forster (In Search of Neverland) the film lacks a kind of burning emotional impact. It creates unforgettable impressions, although they are interesting, work well and move from time to time. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Kabul in 1978 but filmed in Kashgar, China, due to the dangers in Afghanistan, the friendship that opens the film between two young boys is very real, although in social and economic circumstances they are on many miles away. 12-year-old Amir (Zekiri Ebrahimi) lives in a posh location with his rich and educated father Baba, played by the great Homayun Ershadi, although his wealth seems a bit ridiculous in one of the poorest countries in the world. Although Baba is a loving father, he admits to Rahim Khan (Sean Toub), his friend and business colleague, that Amir is too soft and that something is missing with this boy. The family has a servant Ali (Nabi Tanha), who adores all his needs, and his son Hasan (Ahmed Khan Mahmudzada) is Amir's best friend. <br /> <br /> They are divided not only by class, but also by ethnicity. Amir, a burgeoning writer, is a member of the Pashtun majority, while Hassan is a Hazara minority sect (10% of the population). Although we learn little about their traditions or social status, they are connected with each other with their love for a kite, a popular sport in Kabul, and the fact that Amir reads Afghan folk stories to the illiterate Hasan. The annual kite competition for boys is a big event in their lives, and the CGI effect is breathtaking. Strings of kites are covered with glass particles, and the winner is the one whose strings can destroy other kites in the sky. Hassan is a kite runner who has the uncanny ability to locate fallen kites and bring them to Amir as a trophy. However, after Amir wins an important competition, a sad event occurs that will determine his life. <br /> <br /> Hooligans, led by a senior Assef (Elham Ehas), who later acts as a ruthless leader of the Taliban, attack Hassan because he is a Khazar and brutally rape him (behind the scenes), while Amir is too scared to try to prevent it. Unable to resist his seeming lack of courage (although one has to wonder what if he could do something to help Hassan), guilt becomes the driving force in his relationship with Hassan, and their friendship becomes tense. In one case, Amir throws grenades at Hassan, as if imploring him to fight back and punish him for his passivity, but Hassan does not accept the bait, continuing to remain faithful, despite the cowardice of his friend. When Amir convinces his father to fire his servants and accuses Hassan of stealing his watch, Hassan confesses to the theft, although he is innocent. In the end, circumstances force Ali and Hassan out of shame. When the Russians invade Afghanistan, Baba and Amir also leave, fleeing to Pakistan, and then to Fremont, California, where the story unfolds over the years. <br /> <br /> Baba is forced to work at a gas station and sell knick-knacks on the open-air market, while Amir (Abdul Salam Yusufzai) seems to be experiencing the movements of life, studying to be a writer at a local college. After he falls in love and marries Sorai (Atossa Leoni), the daughter of a Kabul general, Amir finally publishes his first novel, The Ashes Season, and everything looks very positive. When Amir receives a call from Rahim Khan asking him to visit him in Pakistan, which says that “there is a way to become good again,” the ghost of guilt that has been pursuing him all his life calls Amir to return home. He is returning to Pakistan and, at great risk, is returning to Afghanistan, which is now controlled by the Taliban, in order to confront the demons of his past and to uncover a startling mystery in this process. <br /> <br /> “Running Serpent” is a sensitive film that deals with internal pain, arising from the realization that you are not faithful to your best instincts, and gives you the opportunity to go beyond the shame of a new level of responsibility. It also does not hide the pain inflicted on Afghanistan by wars and revolution, the pain that suffering Hasan may represent. Unfortunately, this reduces difficult situations to the level of good guys and villains and distorts what actually happened, freeing the United States, which participated in anti-government secret operations inside the country, from any responsibility for the catastrophic war that killed more than a million people, and millions more disabled. Although we are inspired by outstanding children's actors and touched by the freedom that a kite represents, “The Running Kite” gives up its power when it tries to replace melodrama with history.
