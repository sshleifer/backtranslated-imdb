I find it hard to believe that this can happen at all. We do not know whether Justin and Richard were concerned or committed crimes in the past. The film seems to imply that they were not in trouble. So the first crime they commit is murder? Just to play with the cops? How do they pick up any girl and just say it is? Richard also seems to stifle a woman with little or no effort, and women do not seem to fight. Hmmm This whole concept is really hard to believe. However, let's move on. I really hated these punks and would like to be present with my shotgun with police tactical ammunition and see what their plastic suits then do. As for Cassie, who was the victim of Carl Hudson, he is terribly trying to survive. The memory of the fact that Karl received 17 knife wounds leaves her in emotional confusion. Sandra does an excellent job of acting. She probably made me believe that she was an evil cop. As for solving a crime, I thought it was great. This film kept me in the chair. He loved to play everyone except Sam. He did not get up and did not leave. The only thing that this film didnâ€™t need was a love scene or, if I may say so, a rape scene.
