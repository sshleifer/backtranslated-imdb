I spent a lot of sleepless nights after watching 2001. Not only because of the psychological horror (masterpiece of 2001), but also because of how he brought me (the restless soul) some clarity in how I watch the universe. It changed my thinking very deeply. And after reading the novel (Arthur Clark), I again felt (like me) the writer the level of imagination. <br /> <br /> “Space Odyssey” is not something that you can just “go through” and see. ”You have to be ready for this, or it cannot be understood. In fact, I don’t think that it can be understood at all at least not all at once. This is a philosophical journey to infinity and beyond, a masterpiece of its genre, and 32 years later it is technically quite impressive, up to a powerful musical soundtrack featuring “Also Zarathustra” by Richard Strauss and “Blue Danube” Johann Strauss. <br /> <br /> Take as much time as you like, but ultimately you will see this film. If it can bring some sort of order and understanding of the universe of a struggling artist like me, then surely it can do it for you. <br /> <br /> Or maybe I'm just crazy .. .
