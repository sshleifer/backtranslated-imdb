The revelation here is the dance ability of Lana Turner. Although she was known privately as a great nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability in the film. <br /> <br /> So viewers pay attention to this!

This number is conceived and filmed as a kind of hybrid between Busby Berkeley style extravaganza and the procedure that Hermes Pen developed for Aster and Rogers in RKO. <br /> <br /> So the room opens to George. Murphy and Miss Turner are depicted as bar regulars (with a full chorus) in front of a black lame curtain where Mr. Murphy is humming Miss Turner's number.
