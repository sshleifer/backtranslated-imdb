Although at times I was the only one in the movie who laughed, this is the main pleasure I received from the beautifully filmed “Thirst” - laughter. Although it sometimes seemed that the film had a personal crisis, and he did not know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy, the blackest of black humor shone through at regular intervals. <br /> <br /> Of course, it helped that the standard of behavior of all stakeholders was remarkable, and that I was slightly obsessed with the sometimes evil leading lady who was superbly elegant, no matter how blood and anger she became. <br /> <br /> I read reviews that suggested that this film was too long. I do not think so. In fact, the last scenes, touching and funny (I mean brown shoes ....) in turn, were among the best in the film.
