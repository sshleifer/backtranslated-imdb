Shot a video for a slow Saturday night. The first view seemed funny to me. It took time to get used to American caricatures (here we are more adapted to British grotesques), but very nice. <br /> <br /> The next evening I looked again and really warmed up. The characters seemed more human, even attractive. A film that can be watched several times and get more from it each time. However, my wife * hated it. I suppose there is no taste in humor.
