Beware, my favorite has recently appeared on television on BBC2 in the early hours, so I set the video to record it, and was glad I did. <br /> <br /> A man finds a dead woman, so he runs away, so he does not take the blame for her murder and get a job as a housewife at the widow’s house, but she doesn’t know what she is doing here. It turns out that this man is a psychopath and possibly a murderer. He begins to torture her and locks her in the basement. He then cuts the telephone line so that it cannot receive outside help. A young boy, who regularly buys for her, notices that something is wrong when he comes in to give up her purchases. In the end, the person leaves, acting as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> I understand why Carefully, My Lovely received an X certificate when he was released in theaters. Some scenes are rather unpleasant for this time. I also thought that this guy was going to do something with a young boy. <br /> <br /> In the cast, Robert Ryan plays a great role in the role of a psychopath, Ida Lupino in the role of a widow, joined by Barbara Whiting and Di Pollock in childhood. <br /> <br /> This is by far the most dreadful talk of Robert Ryan that I have ever seen. Must see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
