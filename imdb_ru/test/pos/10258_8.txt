It was the very first film I ever saw in my life in 1974 or 1975. I was then 4 years old, and I saw him at the cinema. I did not understand that it would be a classic at that time (I went to bed for about twenty minutes at the cinema). After seeing it on TV, along with two of my other favorite films, Car Wash (my favorite film) and Wizard, which seemed to appear every year at about the same time â€” about 40, 50, 75 times, I knew that there was a film that I would choose as one of my favorites. These three films were the only live shows that I could watch as a child. <br /> <br /> I would not consider this a film about the Blushplose, but rather a film dedicated to urban interests. Shish and Sermon reminded me of some of my uncles, especially the wild Irish rose that they drank. My mother also told me about some of the parties she attended and that some of the things that happened in the film were similar to what happened in real life. If you are one of two or three black people over thirty who have not seen this movie yet, then I recommend you buy a DVD right now. I'm glad I was there to witness some of the events of that era.
