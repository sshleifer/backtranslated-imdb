Wow, here's another great golf movie. These are at least three in the last few years that I really enjoyed, which were well made, beautifully shot and inspired. The two others were "Bobby Jones: The Beat of Genius" and "The Legend of Bagger Vance." <br /> <br /> This is a true story about an autdog, if it ever existed. The amateur defeat of all professionals and winning an open golf tournament in the USA is an unheard of feat. I believe that this is the only time in 100 years when this has been achieved. How much of this film is coined for dramatic effect, I do not know. I know that I plan to read the book, and I know that in real life, Francis Uymet had a three-stroke gap in the playoffs, and he had only two holes left, unlike what we saw in the film. <br /> Anything. Francis Uymet’s victory over golf legends by Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is a fact. This is an amazing story, and the filmmakers did an excellent job presenting it here. This is not just something for golf lovers; This is Kudso's hilarious actor movie, directed by Bill Paxton, for outstanding work. <br /> <br /> Yes, in many ways it’s just golf, but there are such plots as Wyma’s relationship with his father and a rather young woman who is clearly interested in him. It is also a touching story about someone who gives a small child a chance. The film also tells about the demons of Vardon, who came from the wrong side of the tracks and try to turn it into an elite sport, as it was at that time for both Europeans and Americans. <br /> <br /> Shea LaBuff - the winner of Uime, like Stephen Dillane, like Vardon. For those who don't know, Vardon was like Tiger Woods of his time, maybe even more invincible. In the film, Vardon is portrayed as a warm, pleasant guy; real man. the other main competitor, Ray (Stephen Marcus), looks like some kind of gruff, nasty guy. <br /> <br /> The fourth protagonist of this golf story is perhaps the coolest person in the film: a boy of fifth grade who eventually becomes Caddy Ouimet in the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the film. <br /> <br /> If all of this - the playoffs with a huge outsider against two powerful pros and the last hole left - wouldn’t be true, you would think: “Oh, man, this is so stupid. Who could believe it? ”That's what makes this true story funny to finally see her in the movie. As in another 2005 sports film, Cinderella, this is another great movie that was unfairly ignored when it came to awards. I guess good movies don't get awards ... just the hearts of their viewers.
