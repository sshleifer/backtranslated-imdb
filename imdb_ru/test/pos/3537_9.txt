Obviously inspired by Se7en and sometimes even more awful; more bloodshed and very graphic details (too much for my taste). Excellent script and acting (Ken Stott especially impressed me and there were no weak points in the cast) Good cinematography and very realistic stereo sound. One of the best thrillers I have seen over the years. Although it was planned for the BBC in three parts, I watched the Messiah on video in one duplicate. One point of criticism; the villainâ€™s motivation was not very convincing.
