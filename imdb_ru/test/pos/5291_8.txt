Like the 5-year-old heroes of his latest opus, Ponyo Hayao Miyazaki fascinates with his rampant innocence, as if the anime meister himself became a child, creating a narrative that relies on its simplicity and radiates infectious charm in the process. , Miyazaki, recalling his earlier works, paints a brightly colored world, clearly intended for a younger audience, and the unbridled hiss joyfully removes the gloomy thematic elements that distinguish his immediate predecessors. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (voiced by Yuria) Nara), a fish with the face of a young girl (because of which she looks like a pretty child in a pink overgrown Halloween costume), runs away from her underwater home and from her siblings school to explore the surface. Once on the beach, she was saved by Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), a five-year-old boy who, along with her mother Risa (Tomoko Yamaguchi), lives in a house on a nearby cliff. This initial meeting and, ultimately, friendship have a profound effect on Ponyo, who now wants to become human, but, becoming so unintentionally, disrupts the balance of nature and unleashes a whirlpool on earth. With the help of Sosuke, Ponyo must pass the test in order to remove this curse and fully become a man. <br /> <br /> Despite the plot, which lacks philosophical sophistication, say, its latest “Spirited Away”, “Ponyo” is nothing short of a striking sequel, characterized by extremely diligent attention to detail and masterful balancing of the real and fantastic, as well as simple joys and great fears. This is a straightforward story, which, although sometimes inhibited by the tendency to wander like a baby, corresponds to its adolescent pedigree of magical delight. "I will protect you," says Sosuke, pony, as a matter of course, childish statement, not unlike the way Miyazaki endows her story with insidious spirit.
