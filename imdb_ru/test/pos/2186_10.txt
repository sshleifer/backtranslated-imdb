I saw this play on Showtime a few years ago, not leaving the house, and when the last note sounded, I wanted to jump off the couch and give a standing ovation. Anyway, I shed a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic performances and songs. On my birthday, my children bought me a VHS version, as well as a CD from a performance with Len Kariu as Sweeny Todd. <br /> <br /> I shared the play with many ... some people found the subject a bit sick, but no one had anything but praise for the songs. <br /> <br /> I have always loved the interaction in songs with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn, and also with Hearn and Edmund Lindek as Judge Turpin. <br /> <br /> I have to own a DVD.
