I really liked this movie. One thing I noticed is that Korean TV dramas are much better if you give the whole story. I watch movies when I have no time or I want to go through 16-30 episodes. It looks like films are in a hurry, and if you donâ€™t watch carefully, you can skip something. <br /> <br /> I feel that it was urgent, and I had to rewind a few pieces to try to find what I missed, especially at the end. If you like good love stories, I still think it's cute, and if you have extra time, I still think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> It is always a pleasure to come back to watch the actors in different films, since we cannot follow them from the very beginning, as we do actors, producers and directors in our own countries.
