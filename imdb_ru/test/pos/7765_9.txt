This is my favorite film that portrays African Americans in a completely different light. because it shows the other side of African Americans that it is not shown in the films. it is not a gangbang, an urban ghetto or the need to solve deep racial problems, it fascinates the whole essence of youth and attempts to be successful, as well as problems with weakening one’s alertness and letting someone into your life, and the whole bohemian it’s all gorgeous, it’s a great script, a great dialogue that fascinates you, and you just get in touch with the character. the perfect cast with a lot of chemistry and a very good acting, and I still have not seen any other movie with black characters that are depicted in this format, the only thing that comes close is "Sprung", but since this is a comedy, he plays it very quickly I give this film 9 out of 10, and I would like them to continue making films with this type of attitude towards African Americans
