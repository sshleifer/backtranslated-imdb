I don't think I've ever seen a parody of the best movie. Mel Brooks is insane. EVERY time I watch it, I find something new, and that makes it even more fun than last time. Carey Elvis is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. He has a great and unexpected finale that makes you puzzle. Every character is great, from Little John and Will to Virgin Marian and Brumhilda. I laughed to the end and never get tired of it. Watch this! <br /> <br /> If you liked Cary Elvis in this movie, you should definitely see The Princess Bride.
