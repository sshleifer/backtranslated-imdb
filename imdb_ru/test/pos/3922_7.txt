Carly Jones (Elisha Kurtbert), her bad brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki) and her friends Paige (Paris Hilton) and her boyfriend Blake (Robert Richard) and Dalton (John Abrahams) go to another city to watch an important game. They decided to camp halfway and hit the road the next day. However, the belt of Wade's car fans is torn, and he stays with Carly to buy a new one in the near town, where there is a wax house. Upon arrival, they realize that this is a ghost town, and two deranged former Siamese brothers turned people into wax statues. <br /> <br /> I liked this House of Wax, a really worth teenage horror movie. The story conforms to the standards of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and other cutting films, and it is well done, has a good team of actors and actresses, and special effects and death scenes are amazing. Even if the movie was not good, watching sexy and adorable Paris Hilton is worth it. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Casa de Cera" ("House of Wax")
