The plot is somewhat original, and all the actors did an excellent job. There is also a lot of comic relief. Some things don't make much sense (for example, the first “chase” scene, why the heroine is not just hiding somewhere and waiting for the villains to leave?). Russians actually speak Russian without an accent, but the cars are very strange, with models that are around 50 years old, and therefore the place seems strangely out of time. In general, if you like thrillers, you will probably like this one too.
