The Tourist Trap (1979) is a fascinating horror film from the late 70s that tells about a group of young friends who fall into an old deserted alley of a creepy old wax museum. <br /> <br /> The owner of the museum seems like a strange but harmless old man, but everything becomes very unpleasant when they start killing members of a young group responsible for the murders, old Slausen or his collection of creepy dummies who seem to be alive and thirsty for blood !! !! This film was good, it looked fast, the performances were very good from actors / actresses (Tanya Roberts was very sexy), and the movie was never boring, and, as I say, there were some very creepy scenes in it, so be ready hide under the covers! Definitely recommended for horror movie / ghost stories fans! I give this film a very respectable 7.2 out of 10.
