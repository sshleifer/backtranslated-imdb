A wonderful film, shot in Hong Kong in 1962, about a man (Mr. Chow) and a woman (Mrs. Chan), who become close friends, suspecting that their spouses have an affair. Stylistically, the film is also beautiful. Wong Kar-wai uses many slow movements and close-ups on parts of the body (feet, hands, waist). The film itself has stealth and accuracy, which indicates its period of time. It is sexy, not showing everything. Wong Kar-wai also does not allow viewers to see what spouses look like, suggesting that Mr. Chou and Mrs. Chen be together. Smoking even looks elegant with close-ups of curls of smoke. Really beautiful movie. Just get ready for the final. <br /> <br />
