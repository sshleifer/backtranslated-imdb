If you want to have a great time, then this is a movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Take a prerequisite - there is this college, which accepts people with minimal qualifications BA, B.Com, M.Com, MA, MBA, MCA, BE, M.Tech and BCA. Thus, you must take into account the time spent, and thus, it is obvious that all students are over 40 years old. In addition, the school accepts students with a more “heavy” distribution and has a P.Hd course on weight loss and the only student who failed in this course, Manisha Koirala. Only she was a snake in a past life. Still not convinced? Ok, keep reading. <br /> <br /> Here is the scene. Akshay Kumar, a college student, pursued by Arman, he pulls out a bazooka and shoots him! Then throws grenades. Then one of the grenades hits Akshay. But he does not die and continues to fight, the snake Armand plunges Akshay into a half-foot dagger and stomps them, but Akshay is still there. Then Akshay sits on a water bike and follows Arman. They fight, and Armand suffocates Akshay under water, and, finally, Akshay is dead. Therefore, we think that as soon as Arman leaves the field of view, Akshay floats to Raj Babbar, the director of this college + Boxing referee + Parapsychology as a professor + muttering priest. <br /> <br /> But no one, I repeat, no one takes the cake, but a certain Mr. Nigam. You should look to find out more. :-)
