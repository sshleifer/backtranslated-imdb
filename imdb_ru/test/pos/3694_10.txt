You know, people who often make comedies forget that itâ€™s really normal to be outrageous. Well, not this time. Unconditional Love has it all. Barry Manilow and the dwarf in the film with Kathy Bates as a romantic hero ... and it works. Not only does it work, it works very, very well. Actually, I think it is perfect. I laughed so hard, I think I hurt myself, but the main characters were so human, so honest and so real. But isn't that where great comedies come from? Don't the characters need real feelings, real emotions, and the ability to feel real pain? Well, they do in this movie. Unconditional love is a movie you should not miss, especially if you need a really good laugh, or you are curious to see a psychotic gnome in a red cloak.
