This film is a gem ... an uncharted classic by Jerry Anderson. <br /> <br /> The origins of both UFOs and Cosmos 1999 are evident from this film, including the cast, which includes the late Ed Bishop. and George Sewell, who both went to the UFO. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Anderson, despite his numerous television successes, did not get the opportunity to develop his talent on the big screen. Think about what he could do with the version of the movie "Thunderbirds" (from which he quite rightly denied himself!). <br /> <br /> I am sure that if you give "JTTFSOTS" / "Doppleganger" a fair assessment of the chance that you will appreciate its good qualities.
