With his goals, Christopher Nolan set “Follow” in a very narrow direction, and in this direction he shot something that reminded me of great small films about “poor people” like Ulmmer made back in the 40s. Only this time, he can realize touches, such as black and white photography (given because of the budget for shoelaces, but also necessary for the dark crevices in which these characters live) and the cast of actors (the role of John Doe, a pleasant male a colleague and a beautiful in a tough manner a femme fatale - by keeping him in the realm of the underground indie of the 90s, where for several thousand dollars and specific options in locations, music and such things, everything could be done. This, as well as in the mood of the film Nolan create That is a tricky plot network, maybe even more than Memento. If the latter was the work of psychology, unfolding through the plot, enriched with a look at last inch by inch, here the non-linear structure serves to show how far a person like Bill , can pass the same dark road, like Cobb, only in an environment where to keep your toes not for someone who is not really twisted, and playing games with a deeper mind, Cobb. <br /> <br /> Of course, the whole act of following someone becomes the main impetus of the story, and, going into details, I wasn’t even sure what it would lead to, if it were some stream of consciousness, unlike the slacker, where Nolan would tell his character to one city Briton to another. But the establishment of Bill’s connections with Cobb is quick and excellent, as we see when Cobb goes to Bill’s cafe to ask what he does, following him, tells almost everything we need to know about this, and the first heist. for which he led him. What will soon become a good result on the horizon is in fact one big set-up of Cobb and his lady (just called Blonde, perhaps too obvious respect for noir, but why carp). But this is revealed in such a way, which actually made me guess, since the manipulations with the narration worked especially since there were questions not so much about why, but how. Density manifests itself more and more due to the fact that the actors understand their main features as characters, and Alex Howe brilliantly looks like a real sociopath, who can barely disguise his “deep” ideas about what it really is like to enjoy burglary, and Theobald with such behavior of someone who can never be as clever as he is in what he actually does, but more intelligent in such a naive key that has no chance in a raw environment such as this one; Russell almost makes it too easy, even with a face that will make Anna Savage shake her head. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Nolan is also at a height with his style as an operator, not hiding anything in it, add to the atmosphere and uncertainty, with a gradual appearance / disappearance not too fast to leave an indelible impression, but enough , to add to the logic of the script "it could lead to anything." He watches it in the shape of a hand, as if he knows what his limitations are, and yet he is great at keeping the essentials: close-ups when necessary (one of those I loved is Russell’s face in a small mirror ) and a fairly simple techno track that never distracts. Sometimes, as already mentioned, the line between seeing something in the “modern” and something as eternal as the whole story about low-level criminals with mind games and moral uncertainty is never completely clear, which for me is almost irresistible in its dark image. Simply put, this is one of the great business cards that I have seen from a cinematographer in recent years, and I hope it should be that future fans of Nolan’s other work can look forward to the discovery. Or even those who think that noir has gone to fast editors and hunters for major mainstream rifles (even in independent films) are a bright little 71 minutes.
