I do not understand all these bad reviews. I believe that this film was one of the best in the Puppet Master series. Being made with a low budget, one can understand why special effects and acting were not impressive, but they were not absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> Greg Sestero brought a lot of charisma to Andre Toulonâ€™s role. He has great potential, and I hope to see him soon. Although the cinematography was not excellent, and the violence and blood was minimal, this film was very funny. I am a big fan of Puppet Master and grew up expecting blood and blood from the films of this series, but I can say that I was never bored during the entire course of watching Retro Puppet Master. So, if you ever have the opportunity to watch this film, you should not automatically regard it as unworthy of your time. Give it a chance. You might like it.
