Well written script. A moving story demonstrating middle-class English at its best. A bit of a great game by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of the best British actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson - an actress with whom I was not familiar, but, to her credit, she copes with the role of ****** wife. Directed by Julian Fellows did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks, to give the film a certain meaty storyline. He is not too dramatized image of the English middle class. The pace of the films does not fluctuate, although it is not a grand film. A good twist to the plot that is not predictable. Beautiful English country setting. I really liked this movie. Places were also very well chosen. If you like movies about relationships, this is one to watch. It is better to have ready-made napkins!
