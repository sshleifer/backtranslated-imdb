Two great children's stars of Hollywood (Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney) have perfectly combined to create one of the most classic family classic games. The story of a determined 12-year-old girl, whose adoration of horses will not allow her to turn away from her goal to win British citizens. Mickey Rooney is a recently orphaned tramp seeking to tie himself until he can follow his own dreams. <br /> <br /> A beautiful plot shows that the girl's mother had young ambitions. Repeatedly rejecting her father’s decision in favor of her energetic daughter, she seems to know better than anyone. The scene when an exhausted Taylor rushes to school is priceless: the father protests: “Why did you let her go to school, she would fall from exhaustion until noon!” it was saturday! Brilliant Technicolor, magnificent music and these beautiful faces, all tell a bittersweet story. Here is a good reason for the old saying: they no longer make me like that!
