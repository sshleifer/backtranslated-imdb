This is not a walk in the park. I saw it when it came out, and I didnâ€™t have the courage to watch it again. You will never see a more horrendously destructive or depressive film. I felt that I was severely beaten. What kind of world do we live in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? This is our world, what we have created, what we have allowed to happen. And I would not want to say that I-WE-are not responsible for this. Babenko made this film to wake us up, shake us to the depths of the soul, and he succeeded. How can we be cruel, or indulge ourselves, or neglect our children when we see the graphic results of such behavior? He accuses us all of having done so with the lowest and least influential society. And if you do not do something every day to prevent it, then you are part of the problem. I am NOT a religious fanatic, but this film made me think about the state of my soul.
