My God sethrp-1, you completely missed the point. The girl was only seen for a short time, because it was she who was going to commit suicide ... everyone else was so immersed in their stories that we did not even notice her. As one of the other students said at the end, we are all so immersed in our problems that we do not notice what is happening with someone else. <br /> <br /> The director himself said that if he had killed someone from the others, he would have suggested that their problems were worse than that of someone else. The meaning of the murder of Kelly was that she was unnoticed by all of us. Get it now ??
