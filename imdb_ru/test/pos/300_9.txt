First of all, I believe that this film will be much more appreciated by viewers who actually read the book “Heart of Darkness” by Joseph Conrad, the literary basis of the film. With that said, I think this film is amazing. This is a great war film that concentrates not so much on the bloodshed and cruelty of the Vietnam conflict, but on the psychological damage it has done to young inexperienced “children” who have been sent to fight. Coppola has shown a true genius in the art of filmmaking, using a variety of visual effects to help tell a story. The game, which I felt was definitely comprehensive at the proper level. Marlon Brando’s participation in the film is what really gave me the opportunity to play. His explanation to Willard at the end of the film stuns you and reveals the emptiness of the person you heard about and wanted to see throughout the film. Those who consider this to be just another war movie should examine in detail all the literary elements that are intertwined with this film, because there is a lot of sense behind all this. In my opinion, this is one of the most sculptural and best films of all time.
