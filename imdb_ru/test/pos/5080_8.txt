Imagine that you were just on the plane for 18 hours. You were on a business trip in South Africa. You are a highly paid professional. You lived in the USA for 20 years. You are over thirty, you have a wife, a little boy and another child on the way. First, although you have a green card, you are still an Egyptian. In transit, you are asked to come with two guards, the next thing you know, that you have overcome, put on a hood and chained, and after a short (but still quite civil) interrogation you must have! This is what happens with Anwar el Ibrahimi at the beginning of the film. This is a story of pain and (literally) torture. This is one of several storylines. One follows his wife's attempts to get more information. One follows the issuance of (cold) bureaucrats. Another story concerns the family of a man who interrogates Anwar El Ibrahimi. There are other stories, and by the end they all neatly come together. Although better-known actors, such as Reese Witherspoon (as a distraught pregnant wife), Jake Gyllenhaal (as a CIA rookie forced to watch the interrogation in North Africa) and Meryl Streep (as a hot cry of the CIA Corin Whitman), are in fact more unknown actors bring the story and give it your heart. For me, the actor playing the unfortunate Mr. El Ibrahimi (Omar Metvally) was the heart and soul of this film. His image of a man in distress was amazingly well done. It is almost as if he was really tortured! Also, Israeli actor Yigal Naor was very impressive, as his part bothered the family man, and the other - an extremely cruel head of torture. Hard to watch and not exactly fun, but still worth it.
