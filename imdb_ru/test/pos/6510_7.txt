Well, I think we all agree that Michael Jackson was the low point. <br /> <br /> And special effects too. But please keep in mind that it was NOT a budget movie, ok? Not every movie gets as much a budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars. <br /> <br /> However, I thought it was pretty funny. B-? Nothing that, in my opinion, will waste your time. <br /> <br /> Parodies are always fun to watch, and just because it was not a big budget does not mean that it is bad. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good movie, albeit a weak one at some point. <br /> <br /> I hope this comment helps. ~ Angela
