I am a sociologist / anthropologist specializing in symbolic interactionism, and I must say that this film shows high quality in a symbolic context throughout the film. For those who have not yet seen this, I recommend that you also read Victor E. Frankl's “Search for the Ultimate Person”. I think you can draw amazing correlations. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I would like to say that, despite the fact that the main characters are gay, this is not a story about being gay. This is a story about finding and finding meaning in life, despite the difficulties and challenges, pain and horror that stand in your way. This is the story of finding and finding balance, integrity and happiness.
