Two funeral directors in a Welsh village? English humor unlike other things because of the Atlantic? How could I resist. My wife and I saw it on March 6th at our belated Valentine's Day celebration, and we both enjoyed a good, lively laugh. Later we were going to watch another film, but decided not to do it, because we wanted this film to stay with us for the evening. <br /> <br /> Mortal scene of the last 20 minutes of the film is worth the Wait. This raises questions that are rarely talked about in the community, but I know three funeral homes, and the humor is right about money <br /> <br /> I highly recommend and congratulate the authors. Without you, all the actors, directors and others will not work on any Monday.
