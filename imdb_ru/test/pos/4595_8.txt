I have never seen a movie come out worse than this one. And it's a shame, because it's the funniest film of the year! You would think that advertising with the words “From the Director of Office Space” will be enough to guarantee a big release! But there is no advertising, no posters, no website, I doubt the stars even knew that it came out this weekend. What does the 20th Century Fox think? Mike Judge's science fiction comedy takes place in 2505, but it can come true in about 10 years (if everything is as it is). Luke Wilson and Maya Rudolph froze in a secret army experiment and will wake up in the future full of consumer inbred zombie retarders. The film reminds me of Sleeping, RoboCop, Planet of the Apes, Blade Runner and Network by Woody Allen and the late great Futurama. Try to see this before Fox has burned all the prints!
