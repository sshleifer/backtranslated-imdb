If you see only one Ernest movie in your life, make it that way! This is by far the best in the series, with his non-stop laughter and clever humor, which is suitable for all ages. Other Ernest films were good too, but most people tend to get tired of him quickly (but not me). <br /> <br /> In this film, Ernest P. Worrell is appointed juror. murder case. The murderer Nash, it seems, is very similar to our clumsy hero Ernest. Mr. Nash believes that this is a good opportunity to escape from prison, knocking him out of a rut, exchanging personality with him, and we will see how Ernest will react to him. <br /> <br /> Great movie! If you have not seen this yet, look!
