Look at three geishas that are far behind their heyday. Now they lovingly look back at the past and mourn their present. Kin (played by Haruko Sugimura of Floating Weeds) has rejected people and made a living as a usurer; everyone in the quarter owes her. The other two, Nobu and Tamaye, want them to drop off their husbands, but not so stupid as to believe that they will ever be. Meanwhile, their children - one has a son, and the other - a daughter, both are going to get married (not with each other). Tamay is annoyed by how much prettier her daughter has become, and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry a man. Nobu's concern about her son is more legitimate, but they are also (for obvious reasons) self-serving. After her son leaves, she will be alone. Little in the film, two former clients of Keen come to track down her, one man so obsessed with her that he tried to force her to commit double suicide with him, the other of her most beautiful clients. Unfortunately, he comes for her money, not for her love. The way I described the film makes it sound relentlessly depressing, but in fact it is not. Sad but not fatal. It is more bitter-sweet. Unfortunately, I just liked the late chrysanthemums a bit. When I look back, the story seems better, but it is very slow and boring. I actually nodded twice during the film, and I was not at all tired when I started it. This is a film that I can appreciate more than you like; it reminds me very much of my reaction to a couple of more famous Ozu films. 7/10.
