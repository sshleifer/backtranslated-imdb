This picture was released in May 1979 with the participation of Playboy Playmate Susan Keeger as Honie Shane, Playboy Playmate Lisa London as O'Hara and Playboy Playmate Pamela Jean Bryant as Terry Lynn. In one of the most delightful secondary comedy stories in the story of the hounds of young temptresses, they unite in a story about the sisters of the feminine who fight in bikinis, who stop at nothing to expose everything. So what does H.O.T.S really mean? You will need to watch a movie to get an answer. You see, girls have problems with public girls on campus, which make them just maniacs eager to have sex. Therefore, the girls intended to discredit the society, regardless of what they need to do to do their job. In addition, in this mess is the dean of the college, who wants to dismantle a group of girls before they get out of control. I really liked this movie, especially Lisa London. I thought her acting was fantastic and I was disappointed that she didnâ€™t get another acting job. Based on just three buddies, I give this movie 10 affection stars.
