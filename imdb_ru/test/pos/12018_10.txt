This is one of those films that for some reason just clicked with me. That's all right. Eric Roberts is a laconic, good researcher, his off-screen narration, a twisting plot, Dan Hedaya and Denis Lipscomb got good roles, settings, pictures in the artist's studio scenes, the final credit sequence and wonderfully pursuing thematic music that perfectly captures the mood of the entire film. If I have any doubts, it concerns Beverly D'Angelo as a femme fatale, but she plays her last scenes beautifully. I think that director Matthew Chapman tried to create a kind of "Chinatown". It did not work. But the mystery killing is a gem.
