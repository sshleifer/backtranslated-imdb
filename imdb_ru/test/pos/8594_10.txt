I am very lucky that I have the opportunity not only to watch this film, but also to learn more about this fascinating man and time. Lumumba is an outstanding image, giving the full meaning of the story, not falling into the usual Hollywood attributes - yes, it is shown with his wife and children, but the essence of the story is his policy and the policy of the still emerging independent Congo, the film is brilliantly made, moving at a pace that constantly attracts. I look forward to seeing other films by Raoul Peck, as well as more from Eric Ebuany!
