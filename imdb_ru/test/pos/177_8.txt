In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation by releasing the very first release of their series “Silly Symphonies”, “Skeleton Dance”. Iverx and Disney have been working together since the beginning of the 1920s in the Disney animated series Laugh-O-Graham; nevertheless, their friendship suffered greatly when Iverx accepted a competitor's offer to leave Disney and open his own animation studio. It was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iverx continued to develop his style and technique (and where he created the character Flip the Frog). Although his work maintained the same high quality, it was not really popular, and by 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year, Iverx was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Iverx decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color. <br /> <br /> The skeletal agility of 1937 is essentially a remake of 1929. The classic "The Skeleton Dance", a film that brought him fame and fortune. Like this short film, it is set in an abandoned cemetery, where at midnight living things come alive and begin to play. The dead rise from their coffins, preparing for the show, which should begin when a group of skeletons formed an orchestra and begin to play a happy melody. Now being a musician of only bones is not easy, as some members of the orchestra have problems with body parts, but the group manages to make a good show, and another group of skeletons begins to dance. The beautiful couple of them are faced with the same problems that bothered the orchestra: it is difficult to dance with free parts of the body. Everything ends at dawn, and just as the sun rises again, the skeletons run to their graves. <br /> <br /> Directed and animated by Ub Iverx himself, Skeleton Frolics faithfully follows the scheme established by Skeleton Dance many years ago, albeit with a fundamental difference: Iverx shot the entire film in Technicolor. The bright tonalities allowed Iverx to create a more visually appealing film, as well as use the many new techniques that he practiced after leaving Disney, creating even better depth and dynamic effects than those he had previously planned. This is definitely more experimental than The Skeleton Dance, although, unfortunately, this does not mean that this is necessarily the best movie. To begin with, the film is almost identical to the film he made with Disney, with the only differences in music (more on this later) and color effects. It looks beautiful, no doubt, but in the end it does not look original. <br /> <br /> However, the originality of the concept doesn’t really harm the film (after all, Iverx plays it in a wonderful way), but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNath for the film is rather uninteresting and lacks charming elegance and the bizarre fun of the one that was made by Karl V. Stalling for "The Skeleton Dance". In other words, although the DeNat tune is effective and relevant to the topic, it's easy to forget about it quickly, while the Stalling song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical film, it is very important, and the mediocrity of music destroys Iverka's impeccable animation work. Personally, I think that with the best music, “Skeleton Frolics” would be remembered the same way as “The Skeleton Dance”, despite the fact that it is not as innovative as it is still a funny movie to watch. <br /> <br /> It’s kind of sad that most of the work that Iverx did after leaving Disney is now forgotten because of his poor success, but it should be said that if Iverx didn’t have enough popularity of Disney or Fleischer ( Disney's main competitor), he lacked the quality films of these companies. It was probably just a misfortune that made the person who gave life to Disney's mouse face a failure because of Disney for the first time. Despite its shortcomings, Skeleton Frolix is ​​a very funny and visually breathtaking film, which, although not the most original and fresh film (just unwittingly recalling Skeleton Dance while watching it), definitely reminds us that Iverka’s skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire us. <br /> <br /> 8/10
