Oldboy director Pak Chun-wook returns with what should be one of the most disgusting and at the same time the most serious vampires in film history. <br /> <br /> Trusting the latest Hollywood passion, vampires today should be more non-violent, asexual, love-suffering chevalier, and not evil sexually sucking, manipulating the mind, animals of the past. This is the movie you want to see, if you want to remember the sticky thrill of the past ... well, at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> “Thirst” begins with a long exposure of the characters, culminating in a slightly different love story. The transformation of the vampire priest for quite a long time is limited to the romantic and sexual aspects of the story, which makes it awkward. But the last 40 minutes or so is amazingly bloody. Well, maybe it’s not so surprising if you know “Oldboy” and “I am a cyborg, but this is normal”, but I think it would be fair to say that “Thirst” surpasses Park's early films in terms of violence in your face. <br /> <br /> In general, keep in mind that this is not a feature film or a horror movie. This may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some. “Thirst” is original, interesting and, fortunately, a bit less strange than the previous attempts of Park Chun-wook.
