(WARNING - CONTAINS A SMALL SPOILER) The film, almost intended to make you stop and check your memories of it - it is limited to an almost empty motel, where a huge courtyard resembles a circus ring, and the rooms seem to be temporary disposal points than shelters; as the characters become more concerned about the past, the present disappears more and more, until the final incendiary appearance of the countess in a black Mercedes marks the merging of reality and fantasy. Whether their stories are true, and whether Stanton really is the father or just a crazy old man joining their stories seems to be impossible to determine. It seems that the theme is how the love of an extreme and ill-considered nature is mixed with stability to the extent that reality itself is destroyed; where exotic, inappropriate fantasy becomes dangerously tangible. The image of a burning motel - a symbol of dislocation surrounded by destruction - is a rather strange ending for this strange, but effective, amazingly creative film.
