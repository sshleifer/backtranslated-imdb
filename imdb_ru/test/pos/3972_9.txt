From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar, Liar! The film took some time from the beginning, at least for me, as I expected, it was the film American Pie. But it was a little different: a cheerful idler who graduates from high school and makes his own college, managing it accordingly. As you would expect, there are a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis, but this film has tried more than an ordinary teenager. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through free speech and, ultimately, “pushes them into the system.” The humor was diverse, which I loved. The whole cast has put on fantastic performances - hire this with a friend, it's damn cool!
