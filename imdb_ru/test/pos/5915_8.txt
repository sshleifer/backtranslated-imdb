What you bring to the film affects your view of it. I brought 30 years in the Air Force to this, and every time I see it, I am touched by the final. Does the same 15-year-old boy feel like he spent his life flying planes? However, I can only influence me. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart gives a wonderful twist like ... Jimmy Stewart. Considering that he was a pilot and general of the Air Force reserve, he is probably so close to becoming an expert on how the pilot will act like any other living person. No one can blame his delivery or his actions. This pilot, being a pilot, is enough. <br /> <br /> --- Spoilers --- <br /> <br /> The last minutes of the film continue to capture my heart. Lindberg flew without radio contact and has no idea whether anyone is waiting for him. When he flies to the Paris airport, the insecurity in the landing pad attracts you. What is this lower? Those shifting circles that look like cobblestones or a corn field should make you think, is it in the right place? They go on and on, running past his vision, until he is low enough, and they see that on Paris night he saw the light of the city, reflected from the inverted faces of THOUSAND people waiting for his landing.
