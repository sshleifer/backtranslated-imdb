I saw it tonight with moderate expectations - if Tartan Films picked up something and released, it’s usually a good sign, but I’m usually not a fan of Julie Walters, I usually don’t like her comedic roles (sorry, all fans a personal matter - I just do not find it funny in a comedy). <br /> <br /> It was great - everything is great, but Grint and Walters are exceptional! A lot of laughter, a lot of pathos, a great time and a stunningly dynamic film - such a film about coming of age, as a rule, is unlikely to please me, but I cannot recommend it highly enough - and watch Rupert Grint as he turns into a wonderful beautiful actor.
