Fred was such a wonderful sight. It was simple, but for some reason it was very tiring. I still remember the days when I looked at the Kids WB on Saturdays, but then the Kids WB did the unforgivable. KD WB has become the same senior relative who is trying to act "fashionable" and "funky." * shiver * They looked like a relative who is trying to behave abruptly, but trying is a terrible disaster. They pulled Fred's coconut fruit salad deep into the island and all the other good shows to put on a little of the most meaningless shows I've ever seen in my life (Johnny Test). The only thing that makes me watch KWB more is random fragments of old shows and anime on 4kids. It was such a huge mistake to get it to show the graph. This brings me back to my first point ... RETURN IT BACK !!!
