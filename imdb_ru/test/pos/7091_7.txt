Sometimes I wonder if Meryl Streep has become so recognized as the most impressive, versatile actress since, well, maybe just at the beginning of the sound era, that perhaps her talent is now taken for granted. There are probably about three ticks on which she constantly relies during her speeches (most noticeably pinching her lips), but other than that, her speeches are surprisingly variable and original and fresh expressions of inner work. Although Sophie's Choice, Creek in the Dark, and Silkwood can be spectacular, her work here and in Bridges in Madison County is also wonderful - just more subtle. In One True Thing, she’s mostly sweet and in love with her home life, and Streep does what can be a chore, even boring, appealing and charming. I think that she should develop these mini-theses for each character and find out what makes this person real and interesting. She works from the inside with each character, and perhaps it is this essential quality that caused the main criticism of alienation or self-awareness. I don’t think she’s cold at all, but instead she thought about the unique qualities of her character. I think her critics confuse self-awareness with intelligence. Not so many other actors would be so complex, thoughtful and creative to make Kate Muldrune easy and carefree in her favorite home environment, then to uncover unprecedented depth because of her true affection for this home environment. Her performances have unsurpassed consistency, she rarely does something wrong. I wonder if it’s possible that any of the Strip’s paintings didn’t look diminished due to her presence ... In any case, Kate loves her home, and her attachment to her “family life” is as attractive as her new conflict in home causes discomfort. When all this happens together, Kate begins to realize that she can no longer function in the same capacity, and she breaks the cake pan and shouts that she has no flaws, it is painful to look at her because it was not someone then prone to emotions. The strip is smart and generous enough to understand how much better everything works, because she sensed the dramatic significance of Kate, and this is truly the only scene where she allows her character to evolve. But how refreshingly true it is to see a character who can really surprise you by demonstrating something that you couldn’t have imagined. Once again, the character Streep has at least three dimensions ... God, it sounds like the thesis itself, but as an actress, Streep just has a special intellect, incredible empathy and great expressive skills. The film itself is probably somewhat mediocre. I guess William Hurt is an incredible jerk, and he does a great job with bombast. I think Hart is really a bit creepy. The script is quite standard - another tribute to the Strip, that she was as touching and believable as she.
