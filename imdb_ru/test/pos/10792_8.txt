I have never been a big fan of Oliver Stone, often because I found his films compulsory, preaching, and generally flawed. Two films about the stone that I really like are JFK and Talk Radio, but Talk Radio believes that this is Stone's best achievement. Stone is a director in which you are either a fan or not, it's safe to say that before watching Talk Radio I didn’t like this guy and was considered one of the most overvalued directors in the film industry, although after watching Talk Radio some of my ideas have changed. Talk Radio is a disturbing and funny attack on what is now known as the "reality show". <br /> <br /> Talk Radio follows a smug, dysfunctional, resolute, hysterical, outrageous and confusing radio host named Barry Champlain who hosts an ambiguous night radio show in Dallas. Quickly becoming famous for his bold and bizarre air presence, he becomes a late-night sensation when corrupted drug addicts, offenders, racists, sociopaths, drunk, perverts and idiots make fun of the air. The film tells about the rise and fall of a person’s career, carefully making an accurate picture of the freedom of speech. Originally adapted from a stage performance, the film joins a theatrical theme around which it was originally built, wonderfully conveying the cruel nature of the film. <br /> <br /> With ferocious energy and non-stereotypical air, Talk Radio brings all the fun behind the “rude media”. Today it remains even more acute than at the end of the 80s. The film studies in depth such notions as arrogance, self-deception, abusive behavior, disputes, hypocrisy and ignorance. The film shows in a controlled way how good it is to have a personal opinion and freedom of speech, but this is something that should be used wisely and not shamefully stupid. Stone is trying to show how freedom of speech is crucial in life, but we must treat this with caution and caution. The film asks the question: “Is our main character the same as the sad people who are causing the show?” <br /> <br /> Stone fabulously creates the key scene of the film (radio station) with ambitions and a cold atmosphere. Then he manages to capture the isolation, fear, ambiguity and dangerous emotions that accumulate on the radio station. Eric Bogosyan perfectly plays the role of the isolated, self-absorbed and complex genius of Barry Champlain. He is ideally suited for this role, with such enthusiasm, urgency, confusion, rudeness and, ultimately, the bold gaiety of his offensive nature. The performance is full of spark, which was clearly devoid of Oscar nomination. His voice fits the character, as he is the main element of the radio host, and his ability to act along with tragedy and comedy works fine. <br /> <br /> In the films of Stone, editing works are widely used, and the boasting of Talk Radio is part of its purest, most rhythmic editing. He uses a superbly controlled camera technique that differs from quiet to sudden turbulence. The film is filled with energetic energy, and its raw and surprisingly delightful script serves as a central element of the greatness of the film. Striking and effective cinematography stands out in moments inside and outside the studio, most impressively capturing the city at night. Do not forget about the heartbreaking and, nevertheless, gloomy climate "spiral to decay", ultimately, a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Talk Radio is an important modern masterpiece, I'm sure you will be surprised how good it is, I highly recommend Talk Radio to anyone interested in media or cinema. Talk Radio is a great example of top-notch, intelligent and insightful entertainment that still contains a well-deserved wake-up call. Finally, if it were not for Eric Bogosyan, the film would not have been the cheerful, delightful and lengthy masterpiece it is today.
