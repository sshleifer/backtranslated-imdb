Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with the American pilot Rock Hudson while on a business trip to Germany. <br /> <br /> The songs are beautiful. Two well mated. Julie shows a more temperamental side in this film than the cute girl she usually plays. <br /> <br /> Julie, half German, half English, who sings beautifully and entertains troops in the First World War, sings several charming songs of Mancini. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie. Some will say that it is “chik-flick”, so what. It is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Auxiliary characters are somewhat stereotyped. Perhaps this does not apply to Rock in Pillow Talk, the Magnificent Obsession or the Giant. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards shot the film in Ireland, and the film used authentic airplanes such as the First World War. The scenery for England and France is absolutely gorgeous.
