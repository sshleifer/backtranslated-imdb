This is easily my favorite movie. The tragic romance is intertwined with a complex mystery, whose threads are almost invisible, until they all break at the end in one fantastic rush. Brilliance itself. <br /> <br /> I would like to see some more works by Gilles Mimuni, but at least according to imdb, he did not do any other functions. Has the high quality of this work made creating another a bit too difficult? Has he moved (back) to some other sphere of creativity? Of course, I hope that this will not be his last feature, but I cannot blame him if he decides to dwell on this precious stone as his only contribution to the world of feature films.
