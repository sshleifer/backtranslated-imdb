It is sometimes difficult to determine what distinguishes a successful, delightful comedy from a comedy that fails. In this case, a contrived plot about a spoiled rich girl who plans to take her nieces out of the “bohemian” Greenwich Village, who grows them only to fall in love with himself, does not promise. And nothing in the filmography of director Lee Jason suggests that he was overlooked. Yet he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed, happy atmosphere on the set, which was accurately recorded on tape. <br /> <br /> He also had a good sense of playing this film correctly. The only minor flaw is Miriam Hopkins in the part for which Ginger Rogers would be perfect. Hopkins is effective, but fragile, he lacks the warmth and sexuality that Rogers would have. In addition, it is interfered with by two strangely long and smoky false eyelashes, which sometimes distract. But a very young and very handsome Ray Milland could not be better in a rich, unrestrained comic performance of great charm. <br /> <br /> And the Hollywood image of Greenwich Village in 1937 is better than that, especially for New Yorkers. Although it is fully synthetic and idealized, it remains recognizable to the modern viewer. The artistic director of Van Nest Polglase has created a curious confusion of apartments with meows and common courtyards, which are the perfect backdrop for the collection of this painting, consisting of artists, racers, clever men, and imitators. The best cast member is Guinn Williams, who brings sweetness and light to the role of the prize-winner sculptor-dressmaker, offering composure and mobility (sexual and other) life in the Village. Betty Filson and Marianna Strelby playing little girls are even more refreshing. Simple, clever and full of humor, these girls seem to be real people and do not look like professional children's actors of the time. <br /> <br /> Of particular interest are a couple of memorable comic decorations: Ray Milland Demonstrating a vacuum cleaner to a woman with a howling child plays out with more spontaneity than can be expected (the child and his curvature are wonderful “found” moments), and fake home “game »In the storefront of a department store, which degenerates into free for all too much fun. The film slowly slides down the slope to the court, and then never returns when the action moves to Long Island, but this film is still worth watching.
