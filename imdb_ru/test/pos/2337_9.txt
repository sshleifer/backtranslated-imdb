I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to be one of the first to actually see the film. It really captures you. John Paul, in the end, sees the light and makes a living, not tied to the ropes of his mother. <br /> <br /> I believe that nowadays there should be so many families in one position (especially with children leaving the house older, but I would not become wiser) with very sad parents who really do not live their own life and that make your life miserable. <br /> <br /> I think this film is necessarily a wider audience. I would also say that other actors also played a brilliant role. This is such a deep film and very touching.
