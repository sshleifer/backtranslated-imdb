I saw this beautiful movie shortly after graduation. When I sat there with joy, watching Alice turning from a repressed virgin into a sexual adventurer, I wondered why her sexual relationship seemed familiar. Then I remembered the Intro Psych 101 lecture! One of the lectures was devoted to the psycho-sexual stages of development, mainly the displacement in time of which part of the body and the accompanying stimuli attract our main attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure. Alice's first encounter is bathed, with an emphasis on the genitals and the bottom. Her next meeting is oral with the Mad Hatter's dingaling. I forgot the rest of the lecture and the order of Alice’s meetings, but I remember how well they matched. Interestingly, there is a click of the skin instead of a cliché “I'm here to deliver your pizza. Let's fool around. ” <br /> <br /> I don’t understand what kind of career Christine DeBell could be. Destroyed by this film because it was her first film. And Reagan’s tedious hypocrisy has not yet spoiled this land when it was liberated, but somehow he and his puppet Meese really influenced Mrs. DeBell. When Meese set up his anti-pornographic commission (to divert people's attention from their criminal activities), Meese hired anti-porn activist services named Judith Reisner. Racener was absorbed by the images she perceived as child pornography. She saw the cover of “Alice”, which Ms. Debell did for Playboy, and immediately stated that she scientifically proved that Ms. Debell was actually a photo collage of photographs of several adult women and a ten-year-old child. Yes, right....
