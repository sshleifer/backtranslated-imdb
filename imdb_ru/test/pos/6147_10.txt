When I watched Wirey Spindell, I couldn't help but laugh at what was happening on the screen. Wirey, of course, had a lot of influence on both boys and women, but I was puzzled why the actor who played Wirey in H.S. was 10 years old. Then the actor changed his age to 20 to play Veri when he was a senior at HS ... but whatever I thought, it was fun.
