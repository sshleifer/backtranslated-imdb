Following the tremendous success of Nick Park and the Aardman team with short animations by Wallace and Gromit, we had the first (hopefully many) feature with clay characters that many people love so much. The DVD of the film turned out to be the most durable and the best of many of my Christmas presents made by my two children. The plot of the film is quite simple, but the beauty of W & G films for me is the background joke. There are a lot of jokes and farce for children and adults, but the background for me is a killer. All in a cool addition to the already cool filmography for Nick Park, and I would recommend fans and new viewers to watch this movie .... often.
