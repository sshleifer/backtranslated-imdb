I absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be entertained. Direction, acting and story are great. Definitely where there are films such as Face and The Godfather. This movie makes your heart beat. The cast was awesome. I would definitely shoot this movie. Damian Chapa deserves an Academy Award for his game and for the way he portrayed the life of a gangster. This film will soon become a classic, and around it is a brilliant film. I loved it, and I give it 10 stars. In the sentence, the only way to describe it is a film without any flaws. Watch this movie and youâ€™ll understand what I mean. 2 thumbs up !!!!!!!
