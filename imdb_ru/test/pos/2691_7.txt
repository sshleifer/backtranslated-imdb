I recently started watching this show in syndication and found it a bit of a hit. Some episodes are stupid - Doug gets upset about some little things / juvenility, behaves stupid, etc. <br /> <br /> And yet others are quite funny and sometimes touching. These include those episodes that are faced with the difficulties of the characters. For example, in several sitcoms you can find the theme “Young overweight, friendly guy marries a sexual wife” (Kerry also has something about her, seemingly wise. Not just an ordinary sexy girl.) But Kerry has an advantage - she can be good on the eyes, but she has too many traits of character, not too far from her father. <br /> <br /> And she readily admits this - for example, one episode revolves around her lack of desire to be kind to her colleagues. I personally find her damn sexy, but you have to be the right person to live with that. Friendly Doug is a good match. And deep down to see how simple things too. Maybe not like Doug, whose nirvana is watching TV and eating a big snack next to his big screen, but without culture. The lack of a common sensitive side is one of the reasons why two have no children. <br /> <br /> Of course, the simple pleasures of a guy also have nothing to laugh at, and this adds to the charm of the show. They live the ordinary life of the working class in Queens - in this sense it is realistic. And, in general, a fun and enjoyable sitcom board, especially. if you just want to relax. In the end he gets a little tired, so it's probably good that he ends. It was a good run. See also Becker.
