Except for the main character, the acting did not convince me, but the story was pretty good: it’s about a love affair between a boy from a fun party and a young Mormon missionary. As you can imagine, such a relationship is quite problematic. The film is very American and, as such, has some metaphysical nuances to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance. But some storylines are funny: one of the main characters asks his gay colleague: “Do you believe in God?” And he answers: “Do you mean: other than Madonna?” But the script is really good, and I really liked it: it is interesting and opposes (religious) prejudice and intolerance. I think this is an important message in our time. Since I rated films that I liked less, with 9, this is clearly 10 for me. Some people may find it exaggerated, but I think this film deserves it.
