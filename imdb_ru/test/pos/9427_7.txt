Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atville) are engaged in a battle of minds for control of the newest creation of the bombsight of the inventor Switz. Holmes wants to protect it for the British, while Moriarty is not against the sale to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Although no doubt many fans will be disappointed to see that Holmes has been updated to the wartime setting of the 1940s, this particular film proves lighthearted fun that doesnâ€™t go into wartime propaganda as it could It may be that Inspector Dennis Howie Lestrade and Dr. Watson from Nigel Bruce try to steal the show, because the methods of their clumsy characters constantly bring delightful comic relief. The sparring between Holmes and Morirati is colorful and well thought out. Atville copes with Moriarty quite well, even if he is not as memorable as the others who played this role. <br /> <br /> Although it does not give anything particularly new or exciting to fans of the series, this is a wonderful escape from reality, which, in my opinion, is to some extent suitable for 1942, which reflects many adventures in the 1930 TV series and the 1940s, but boasts a more compact, less repetitive plot. And all this is done, remaining faithful to the basic spirit of Sherlock Holmes.
