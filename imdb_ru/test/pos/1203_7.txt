(May contain spoilers) I am disappointed with the criticism of this film. Although he is definitely not perfect, he is much better than what is believed. The acting and photography are excellent. Some of the musical numbers are great; including the title “Where should I go?”, “Easy to be hard” and “Black guys / white guys.” Although I have not seen the musical on stage, I think it darkens the opinion of many. This is not the musical that you see in cinemas. Do not try to compare them. The theater musical might have been sensational to watch, but it would never have had the same effect on the film, so I had to add a plot. And the added final is just awesome. The film left me feeling that I really watched something important, unlike most modern films that satisfy only one level.
