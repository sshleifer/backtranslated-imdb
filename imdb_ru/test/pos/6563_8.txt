Wow .. I just watched this movie on the Sundance Channel and it's really weird. I may not be an expert in the field of cinema, but this is probably the strangest film I've ever seen, like an ordinary movie fan. <br /> <br /> Whoever invented it had a lot of imagination. I’m a bit of a Japanese drama fan, and there are often drama actors in films. (For example, Matsushima Nanako, leading to Ringu, is the main star of d-drama). But it seems that this is the first film for portraits Kyrie and Shuichi. I must say that if they really make their debut here, they do a pretty good job. <br /> <br /> Kyrie was a very responsive character, I thought it was easy to communicate with her. She was kind and kindhearted, perhaps not the most popular girl, but nicer than some other girls seeking attention. She was also good in classic style. I hope she makes more films, but it was a couple of years, so maybe she doesn't have such plans. <br /> <br /> The ending was strange. I'm not going to give anything, but the rest of the film’s weirdness was a kind of shame. <br /> <br /> Very strange, but very creative and unique film. I would recommend it to Japanese horror fans, although I warn you that this is much more strange than Ringu. <br /> <br /> However, I would give 7.5 points out of 10 for originality and imagination. , good character, above average acting, and just being intriguing.
