I like this movie. I saw it in a crowded house at the Toronto International Film Festival the day after the grand opening, which must have gone well. Director Gavin Hood was supposed to be present at today's show, but, alas, his twins were born only a few hours ago, so he had to fly back. “2 births in 24 hours” - that's how he joked about it. <br /> <br /> “Transfer” means “extraordinary transfer” - a term by which suspected terrorists in the United States can be sent without the legal consent of their parents. nations, to prisons abroad, to be interrogated and detained. <br /> <br /> This is quite predictable - an innocent Egyptian-American man mistakenly accused of terrorism "goes missing" when traveling from South Africa to Washington, DC. He is sent abroad, and his wife at home (Reese Witherspoon) fights to find him and release him. But what makes this film special is that there are several good options for telling stories: 1) a story about a human touch on what is happening in the area where a suicide bomb exploded; 2) humanity is a CIA agent trying to understand and be honest with what is actually happening; and 3) the chronology of storytelling, which makes it a tough, tight story that moves and jerks at the right moments. Ah, relief! And a mixture of emotions that circulate around when the story fights for the final. <br /> <br /> All around a strong game with Meryl Streep as an outstanding fox.
