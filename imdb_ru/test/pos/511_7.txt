It seems to me that many people do not know that Blade is actually a film about superheroes along with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher, and the like. Common to all these heroes (and in the case of the X-Men hero group) is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Initially, Blade was a normal person (in a blue outfit) who pursued vampires because of personal dislike and eventually ran into Dracula himself, and he lacked a better word, boring. So boring in fact, that the character was put off and was never actually used in the Marvel universe. At least, until it was reinvented. <br /> <br /> David Goyer made a brilliant stroke when he assumed the character of Blade and turned him into a dark knight in a leather coat. He cannot take all the credit, and much of this should also go to Steven Norrington, who with his excellent visual style reveals the best of character. The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) in this film is pretty amazing and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as a title character and successfully detects duality and character's internal demons. He, however, is a rather tough actor in both voice and posture and is interesting enough only for one movie (which is clearly seen from the worst sequels). Chris Christofferson is also good and really animates Whistler's tormented character with energy and a sense of time. N'Bush Wright, however, is rather weak as a leading lady, which makes her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is quite funny and can do a lot with the secondary character. We should also mention the German Udo Kiera, who brings a lot of grace and style to the vampire race, probably due to his experience of playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf provides the best acting role in the film and its amazing role, since Deacon Frost is one of the best screen villains I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story is good and, I feel, it updates the vampire genre (something that hasn’t been since the time of Robert Rodriguez “From Dusk Till Dawn”) by adding many modern elements and maintaining the sensation of comics. To say that there is a comic in the film does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Not at all. It was a lot of effort to make the film seem as real as possible. Including effects that are pretty good for their time. I found the vampire dusting a very pleasant touch. Instead of adding a lot of blood when the vampire dies, Norrington decided to let the vampires burn out spontaneously, which looks great. The fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film, which otherwise would have collapsed on his face. <br /> <br /> As mentioned earlier, Norrington has a very clear visual style that distinguishes him from the directors of the following Blade films. Del Toro is almost as experienced, but I prefer the style of Norrington. His style gives the film a special look, but most importantly, it creates the atmosphere of the film. Very tense dark atmosphere that blends perfectly with the main character and plot. Along with the visual style is music, which also works great and adds a movie atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In general, Blade is a very interesting film, which probably should have had 8 from me, but a few annoying flaws (which cannot be detected without damaging the film, suffice it to say that many of them are located towards the end of the film) lead to the fact that the film should be brought to a maximum of 7. <br /> 7/10
