Haggard, located in the hometown of Bam Marghera, in Westchester, is a semi-truthful story about the life of Ryan Dunn and his buddies Falcone and Vallo. <br /> <br /> Dunn was abandoned by his girlfriend, 2 years old, Gloren, who now sees a beer being drunk, a long-haired metal head named Hellboy, and this drives Dunn to madness from jealousy. <br /> <br /> In a desperate attempt to find out the truth about what is happening between Gloren and Hellboy, Dunn pays his friends Vallo and Falcone for breaking into her house and presenting evidence of this case, with somewhat disastrous results for all interested parties! It seemed to me that this film is very funny, perhaps partly because I am a fan of Jackass and CKY, and I must say that most of the humor is likely to be lost for those who have no prior knowledge of the insane Mardov comedy. '. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of interesting things for figure skaters, and not least for skateboarding legend Tony Hawk as a cop. There are also cameos from Bucky Lasek, Brandon Nowak, Jason Ellis, and Bam's long-suffering parents, April and Phil. <br /> <br /> Additional DVDs include music videos from CKY (featuring Brother Bess Jess on drums) Bam's favorite band, HIM (Bamâ€™s character in the film takes its name from HIM frontman Ville Vallo) There is also a documentary and a parody " too hot for a donkey. " <br /> <br /> In short, as I said earlier. This film will be mainly interesting for skaters and Jackass / CKY fans, but I feel that Margera and co have put a lot of effort into 'Haggard', and I, for example, enjoyed it very much.
