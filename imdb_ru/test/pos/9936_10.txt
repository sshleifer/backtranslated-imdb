“Opera” is a great movie with amazing imagery. The operatic singer (Cristina Marsillah) is pursued by a murderer who makes her watch as he kills everyone she knows, tying her and gluing needles under his eyes. Needles are due to the fact that Argento does not like when people close their eyes while watching his films. “For years, I was annoyed by people closing their eyes during the most difficult moments in my films. I shoot these images, because I want people to see them, rather than avoid positive opposition to their fears, looking away. So I thought to myself, “How would it be possible to achieve this and make someone watch the most terrible murders and be sure that they cannot prevent them? eyes? The answer I came up with is the essence of Opera. - says Argento. Lots of suspense, great cinematography and brutal, bloody murders. One guy stabbed into the throat with a knife, causing a slashing. wound, Daria Nicolodi gets a shot in the eye, while I make my way through the peephole, etc. For those who have not yet caught this one, try. Highly recommended.
