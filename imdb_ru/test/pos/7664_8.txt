I like Thackeray's novel on which this film is based. And although this modern version of Becky Sharp's story is film B, the casting of Loy in her first starring role is quite fascinating. <br /> <br /> Before Loy became MGM's ruling girl in dozens of cool movies. and in comic roles she was an actress. Vanity Fair was the last film of Loy to Emma in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter, who almost destroyed the faithful housemaid (Marie Dressler). <br /> <br /> Becky Loy is much nastier than version 3 of Miriam Hopkins years later in BECKY SHARP. Loy Becky is a character in the film before Codex, with its deep cuts and immoral manners. This is a type of character that Jean Harlow or Clara Bow could easily play, but here Becky still has to be an elegant grid. That's what makes her fallen character so tragic. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the setting of Loy, Becky is the cute Amelia (Barbara Kent), who is simply not an interesting character. Mary Forbes is as good as Mrs. Sedley. Most of the other actors in this version are pretty bla: Conway Tirl as Rowdon; Walter Byron as Osbourne; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin. Others almost Dickens are their quirks: Billy Bevan as Joseph; Lionel Belmore as Crowley; Montague Love as Marquis; Lilian Irene in the role of maid Polly; Elspeth Dagen as housekeeper. <br /> <br /> Loy front and center. Although the final is pretty shocking, she has some great scenes, such as a casino gambling scene where she tries to steal another woman's winning roulette bet. The more Loki Becky descends morally, the more beautiful she becomes until she is finally "caught." The bottom line is that this is a very solid Loy performance in a film that is worth seeing.
