I'm from Ireland, and I thought that this film had a strange minute or two, where the accents were a bit unusual, but no worse than any Brad Pitt or any other American who emphasizes. In addition, I have rarely seen any British actor handle an American or Canadian accent, with the exception of Colin Farrell in the Minority Report. This film is a small film and it was interesting. No, it wasn't a blockbuster in Hollywood, but honestly, I was tired of this shit. I laughed more than a few times and had a good time. It was definitely worth the rental. The main character forges other tough British gangsters. At least that's how I saw it. If you expect a production of 100 million dollars, you will be disappointed. Enjoy the fact that it is a small entertainment movie.
