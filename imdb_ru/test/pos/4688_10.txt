Hi, I have to say that you got the wrong information about the show here. The main author was Richard Carpenter, he created the series. Later there were some other authors, but they did only a few episodes. <br /> <br /> The first director to make the most of the series (I think the completed series 1) was Jan Sharp, who created the distinct image of Robin from Sherwood. <br /> <br /> Clannad did see some of the materials, and they read the notes. I know this for sure because Richard Carpenter talked about this last year at Con in England. <br /> <br /> I think this is a masterpiece of television entertainment, because it has great characters and actors, good costumes and a great story lines. For me, still one of the best TV shows!
