I recently received a movie, and all I can say is a good movie. There are many famous Roman monuments and historical sites. This is from the same author and director of The Da Vinci Code. Stars Tom Hanks, along with Evan MacGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The film begins with a space and temporary experiment in Sweden, until one of the canisters is stolen by the Illuminatiâ€™s most hated enemy of the church. The plot is difficult to discuss without spoiling anything. This is a race around Rome along the Illuminati trail to get to the secret Illuminati meeting place. During the time trial, to find the path of the Illuminati. For all this film, which is worth watching, damn it, I watched it 3 times, and I still like it, so in the end go and buy it. This is much better than in the 2010 film. And the final has one stunning plot twist.
