I usually stay away from film festivals and do not enjoy the slap comedy, but I must say that this picture was magnificent. I immediately recognized David Krumholtz from the television show Numbers, and Lorraine Bracco, Rosanna Arquette and Karen Black were at their best. This is a comedy at an incredibly high level with visual, conversational and satirical interludes that kept the audience, and me, laughing at a rather deep plot. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Mr. Parness for dealing with a delicate but real subject in a way that you can enjoy but completely absorb your audience at any level of intelligence The plot remains unchanged throughout the film, and the comedic relief adds to the message without being superimposed to distort. The blending of the segways is great, and the whole product is wonderfully made with taste. <br /> <br /> I can say with confidence that this film will be of great importance and should be watched by viewers of all ages; The problem is real, as is the powerful impact of this production.
