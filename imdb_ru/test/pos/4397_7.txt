The Coen brothers did it again. Three convicts of the Depression era (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) escape from the Mississippi chain gang and go in search of buried treasures that will finance their new life. Along the way, they sing on the radio and become popular stars, as well as fugitives. Great laughter and soundtrack, which is a lesson / introduction to bluegrass music. <br /> <br /> Clooney - outstanding, as quickly speaking, quick-witted Ulysses Everett McGill. Holly Hunter plays his foreign wife. Turturro and Nelson are impeccable. Also in the cast are John Goodman and Charles Durning. <br /> <br /> Dan Timinksi provides a singing voice to George Clooney for the song “I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow,” the song Soggy Bottom Boys, which serves as a model soundtrack filled with bluegrass, which also features Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, Whites, John Hartford, Family Cox and Gillian Welch. A knock on the nose, a slap in the face for the whole family. You will be surprised how relaxed and fun this movie is.
