I saw this film only a quarter of a century ago, but its influence never left me, and I still remember my reactions to it. I was hypnotized by the breadth and absolute beauty of such a large part of the photo. I was amazed that an American studio could produce such a European film with its slow pace and unfocused plot. The absence of any strong characters was felt as a drawback, but I was angry at the completely unnecessary ending on the yacht, which looked as if it was drawn out to give some kind of cohesiveness to the plot and completely contradicted the style of the others. It was also nice to see the Western, which did not pretend to be cruel and exploitative, which so often were the unfortunate detritus of the American dream. Western scenes and scenery also had authenticity, which was completely new and anticipated for me by the recent TV series “Deadwood”. The film was massively cut out for an American audience, and I very sincerely wish that these days the directing director Michael Cimino got the opportunity for fresh editing in the light of reflection - a clipping that could turn into this trouble. The fate of the film turned into a masterpiece that he could become. Now I saw the initial version, and the network of relationships makes much more sense, although Christopher Walken is mainly responsible for this. If only De Niro, and not Chris Kristofferson had played a major role, there was still great concern about creating reality and the atmosphere to the detriment of a good script. However, the work with the camera was so clever that sometimes you could almost believe that you yourself were inside the action. And there were a lot of special moments. Everyone who argued in the hall in different languages, trying to overcome their national differences and achieve some unity of action in the face of an impending catastrophe, gave a real idea of ​​the difficulties faced by the United States: especially when the threat came from a combination of old elite and money. Nate's uncertain approach to Ella, when she first visited his cabin, contrasted sharply with the subsequent violence and was different. I had a special show with a large group of comrades to see the new cut, and we all enjoyed it, having various reservations. This revisionist and much closer to the truthful version of events was probably too much for Americans to take when the film was first released, but we all felt that it was of tremendous value and that its place in the history of cinema should also be revised.
