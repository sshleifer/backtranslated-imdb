It is said that inspired by Disney's The Little Mermaid, Ponyo on a Rock by the Sea is a Japanese animation master, Hayao Miyazaki’s next big work after the well-received film Spirited Away in 2001 and Haula the Moving Castle in 2004. Animated fantasy kingdoms and children's characters are shown again. <br /> <br /> Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), leading in the film, the boy discovers a “goldfish” caught in a glass jar while playing on the seashore under a rock. , He stays with his mother Liza (Tomoko Yamaguchi) at the top and at the top. Sosuke strongly shakes the jar, trying to pull out the "goldfish", but the little "goldfish" is stuck. Then he tries to pull him out, but he just can't tear himself away. Then Sosuke put the jar on the ground, and then broke a small stone on it, instantly breaking it into pieces, while at the same time getting a small cut on the finger. Then he checks with curiosity whether the golden fish is alive. Watching this, the goldfish reacts by suddenly licking blood from his finger. Agitated, Sosuke quickly rushes back to the house and puts the “golden fish” in a small bucket of water in the hope that she will survive. It happened, and he called it "Ponyo" (Yuri Nara). <br /> <br /> The above scene will mean what should happen before the end of the movie. This is from the interaction between Sosuke and Ponyo. And this is the one whom Hayao Miyazaki diligently portrayed. He must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before he portrays this chemistry of communication between the two main characters. The behavior of the children also extended to the rest of the film in their subsequent meetings. <br /> <br /> Love between Sosuke and Ponyo grew as the film progressed from the moment Sosuke brought Ponyo to school in Lisa’s car. The best moment came when they were reunited after a brief breakup, when Pono's father, Fujimoto (George Tokoro), the magical sea dweller, again captured the lost Pono before concluding it in a magic bubble with good intention. <br /> <br /> Fujimoto, who was once a man, began to turn people away from the fact that they pollute the sea and steal his life. But all Ponyo wants is to be human and to be with Sosuke, so the second time she runs away, accidentally emptying his father's precious stock of magic elixir into the sea, creating a storm of tidal waves and absorbing a small city in the process. /> <br /> What follows the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in a flooded city. <br /> <br /> Is there a happy corner? Will true love triumph? You will learn. <br /> <br /> Looking at art in Ponyo on a rock by the sea, it seems that there is a deviation from Miyazaki's past work in terms of rendering. It looks unfamiliar, because the environment, except for the characters playing in each scene, is not painted in the usual way, as in Spirited Away (2001) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004). Aesthetic appeal is not taken into account from the drawings made in color. Objects and characters are also not as detailed as before. <br /> <br /> This is unusual if you take them at face value, but from how the story is written and told, a possible explanation is that Miyazaki allows the audience to watch a movie with a touch of child, but allows adults to recall Japan when they were younger. This step could prevent future moviegoers, newcomers to Miyazaki’s work, from seeing him. The trailer also did nothing to promote Ponyo. However, the consideration of the case in Japan would be a different story, since the powers of Miyazaki would be far superior to any marketing technique. <br /> <br /> In general, however, the whole was not equal to its parts. In addition to Miyazaki’s ability to play viable and animated characters, the film lacks elements of thrill and surprise compared to previous works, which leads to a lack of presence on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Sparks Ponio and Sosuke could not illuminate the film on a large scale, but moments of warmth, kindness and love can still be found in the recognition of the film, which was created not for children, but for children who have all or once were.
