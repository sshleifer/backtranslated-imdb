When someone watches Superman's animated shorts from the 1940s, the similarities of the plots can be a bit boring - the enemy is most often a mad scientist in a hidden headquarters, threatening Metropolis with some evil invention - death rays, mechanical monsters, an electric earthquake, a magnetic telescope , what do you have. <br /> <br /> This is refreshingly different. The bad ones drive, shoot and bomb, but the center of action is the golden train (on which Lois Lane appears to be the only reporter). The films about trains have their typical ingredients, starting with the Great Train robbery of 1903, and there are quite a lot of things to see: car separation in motion, running across rooftops, removing a steam locomotive from the tender in the back, fighting an engineer, Switch turned to turn off the train on the side track, a fall (of people or the whole train) from a high bridge ... it's just a few minutes of this beautiful part. <br /> <br /> But it wouldn’t have been a Superman movie if he hadn’t done incredible feats (including balancing and high-precision placement) to win the day. If you like movies about trains, don't miss it. It is freely available and can be legally downloaded from archive.org.
