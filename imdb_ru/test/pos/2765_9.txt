I'll be brief: I usually hate films like poisonous ... but there is something in it that just attracts me and doesn't let me go. Of course, there are some significant flaws in this (some of them are at best below the nominal, and the dialogue is sometimes so bad that it is funny), but there are enough functions to make it available for viewing. <br /> <br /> But what are they? Well, he has a cool little story - not at all original, but he is better represented than other films of its kind. The three main stars (Whalin, Johnson, Long) demonstrate quite decent work, which more than compensates for the apparent lack of quality on the part of the cast (thick cop and coach Quinn really offended me), and the scenarios are slippery and witty (even if it is bad in some places) . <br /> <br /> But the bottom line is that this film is very cute: I was smiling all the time, and it is in my video collection only because it can cheer up anyone. You really have to be a kind of bore without humor in order not to love it (I dare sit with it without a smile !!!). <br /> <br /> I recommend it if you want a simple, fun, and - above all - a pleasant time. You will not regret it! <br /> <br /> ~ Top $ ~
