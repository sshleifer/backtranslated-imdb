This film is beautiful in all respects. This is visually stunning, which is good, since the dialogue will take only one or two pages of paper. The game is great; it is subtle, passionate and intense. Ben Daniels does an incredible job of turning himself into an animal and mixing this wild nature with the domineering passion and honor of man. There is not a single flaw, not a single mistake or wrong moment. It is perfectly perfect, but only if you understand what you are going to experience. This is not a movie for those who want normalcy.
