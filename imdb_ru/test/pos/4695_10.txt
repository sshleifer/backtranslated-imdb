To quote Jason Connery and Mark Ryan in one of the many comments on the DVD, this “shaky music” above the HTV logo was enough to make me jump out of everything I did to stick my face to the screen for an hour. The individual stories contained in the series were excellent, and the character’s development was remarkable. Robin from Locksley has a very convincing journey through the two series in which he appears, although his departure from the program was unplanned. Marian is also very good at developing her relationship with both of Herne’s sons. <br /> <br /> After years of languor on the TV wasteland, I again met the series on Sky 1 in the UK in the mid-nineties and became even more impressed that the series looked even better than I remembered. This is not a children's television program, it is about witchcraft, treason, rebellion and injustice. And this can be done without showing too much blood. As I recall, you only see some red material in the Pilot movie (Episodes 1 and 2 on the DVD set). The DVDs are great, they contain a lot of extras, including the comments of the actors only for the 3rd series (Jason Connery Robin) and the comments of the team for the 1st and 2nd episodes. The image quality is very good, and the remix and remastered surround sound is simply amazing. /> <br /> The idea of ​​freedom is important, freedom prevails. Nothing is forgotten. Nothing is forgotten.
