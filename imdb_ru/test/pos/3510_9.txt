I first watched this film in 1990, when I was a small child, and he scared Jesus of me. I really liked it, and I really wanted to get it. <br /> <br /> In 2002, I remembered that this film existed, but had no idea how it was called, so I went to the IMDb section and knew what the film was about, and tried to get its name. Anyway, in the end, someone told me on IMDb, so I researched and tried to buy the film. So in the end I got it on DVD, and now I consider this movie to be one of my most valuable horror films. I really love it, and I think that anyone who watches this will be very scared in the forest the next time they leave. 9/10.
