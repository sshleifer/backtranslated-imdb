Yes, 2:37 in some way is robbery from Gus van Sants Elephant. We are talking about some students who deal with their problems, leading to the suicide of one of them. Yes, it's full of cliches, but this is life. You simply cannot deny that eerie botanists, disabled people, or popular students, who, despite their popularity, have problems, exist in the real world. <br /> <br /> But this is not what this film is about. This is not about life in high school. This is not about the suffering of life itself. <br /> <br /> If you look under the surface, under the soapy social relationships that are shown, you will find some exciting, thought-provoking criticism of our society. <br /> Why do people commit suicide? Do we really understand their motives? Or are we just trying to understand when it's too late? And why is it always someone you would never expect? <br /> <br /> This film does not answer this question, but raises it. And it happens very intensely. All this makes you guess whose blood it is, what you see at the very beginning. You follow the path of some students, each of whom has more or less good reason to end his life, just to be forced to watch the terrible act in the finale. <br /> <br /> Do you know who it would be? Or were you taken by surprise, as in real life? <br /> <br /> In the end, one of the surviving children voiced the message. We are always so focused on our problems that we forget about the problems of others. Maybe someone, a colleague, a friend who does not want to live anymore. But, if you do not open your eyes, you will never know until it is too late. <br /> <br /> This movie copes well. He may have some flaws, but they no longer matter when it's over. Either you see a reflection of society, or you are blind to reality.
