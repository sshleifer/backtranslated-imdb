I am a lover of opera, and in operas is full of sex, blood and death. This can help to learn the libretto of operas, of which arias, to truly appreciate this film - my run is very different from Tug-3. I am a lover of classical music, and I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I liked Ken Russell's Nessun Dorma segment, and I really would like him to play Turandot, because the opera has to be stunning, truly multimedia experience, but then I loved Listomania. I love * Turandot *, and, knowing the libretto so well, maybe that's why I don’t find this segment a parody that Tug-3 did. <br /> <br /> The Buck Henry / Rigoletto segment is probably the most accessible to the average viewer — they will most likely recognize the melodies, and this is a classic bedroom farce. I like farces in the bedrooms, so stupidity did not upset me. <br /> <br /> The “Liebestod” segment is so outstanding that I recommend people to watch this only for this work. Depuis la Jour was very spiritual to me. And the recording of Caruso's Vesti la Jubba (aka Pagliacci) with John Hurt as a clown was wonderful. But people who just want naked women may feel that there is too much music and not enough bare flesh and sex.
