I saw this film on screening, and this is the best film I have seen lately. I like it!!!! James Franco is sooo hot and he and Sienna Miller make up the perfect match. I do not want to talk about what is happening, but they play a couple of newlyweds who go on a honeymoon trip to Niagara Falls, and some rather wild things happen along the way ... The film is really very funny, sad and original. I can not even say that it reminded me, but look! I cried so much, but really loved it and want to see it again as soon as it comes out! My friends were crying too. Hope to be out soon - does anyone know when? i would actually go see you
