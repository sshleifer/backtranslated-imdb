Jack, Sawyer and Sayid float to the boat and find Desmond completely lost. His traumatic past experience before sailing to the island is revealed in the memoirs. Said is developing a plan with Jack to surprise “The Others” in case Michael crosses the group twice. John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch, protected by Mr. Eco, and not to press a computer button to see what happens. <br /> <br /> This episode is one of the best in the second season. Unfortunately, we, lovers of “Lost”, can see the lack of respect for the fans of the producers of this amazing series. In the US, the date of this episode was May 24, 2006. Therefore, during this period, fans should wait for the third season in a very tense situation, when Jack and his group are surrounded by “Others” and find out the truth. about Michael and the death of Ana Lucia and Libby; John locked himself in the hatch, not intending to press a button, and Mr. Eco, in desperation, walked out of the hatch. I hope that the fate of "Lost" will be better than "Angel", and his very disappointing conclusion (or lack of conclusion) after five seasons. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): not available
