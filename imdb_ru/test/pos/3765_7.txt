It took me a while to find this film, because it’s not on the DVD yet (and my VCR shouldn’t be reconnected). I think all references to drug use are too many for some people. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is just mentally retarded. This is a cheat in the spirit of "Airplane." I have to say that when I watched this in show-time or Spotlight, which grew in the 80s, I enjoyed the humor much more than now. But it’s definitely worth a look to see that they (that is, the cinematographers) managed to get away with the hypocrites of “Just Say No” unleashed their propaganda. singing ... "We're all on drugs", hahaha This is a stupid film, and it costs $ 10 that I paid Ebei to get it on DVD, without even thinking about comparing it with the original - it's just silly. What are you tall?
