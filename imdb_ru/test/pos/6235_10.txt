Let me first say that The Tourist Trap is a better movie than 99.9% of the horror films that have recently appeared in Hollywood. If you do not believe me, you will see Darkness or Them. And this is definitely better than any of these lousy video releases, such as Stab, Bleed, The Pool and so on. One of the big problems with the film “The tourist trap” is that the audience was never found. When the film was opened in 1979, MPAA assigned him a PG rating. Anyone who knows horror movies knows that a horror movie is usually the kiss of death for a movie. (Directed by David Schmeller talks about this issue in the comments to the DVD.) Although there are exceptions, like Poltergeist, who also received a PG rating. However, there are big differences between the tourist trap and the poltergeist. “The tourist trap” was not a big budget Hollywood film, like Poltergeist, and was not produced by Steven Spielberg. That alone was enough to guarantee Poltergeist's success. (However, for those of you who have seen The Tourist Trap, you will even scratch your head, why the MPAA rated this movie PG. The heart burst scene alone should be enough for a movie to hit and rating R. What about the pipe in the back, from which blood flows?) I have to admit that when I was young, I looked at the copy of Poltergeist on the shelf of the video store, picked it up, saw that she was assigned a PG rating and instead put it on the shelf in favor film with a rating of R. After years I finally saw Poltergeist and realized what kind of substitute atelny movie I missed due to the fact that it is not removed PG horror film. Since then, I will never again judge a movie by rating. This is most likely what happened to the Tourist Trap. People like me with Poltergeist will probably ignore him in favor of a movie with a rating of R. Most likely, this will be the teenager that most films of this type are focused on. Friday, the 13th, was also not a masterpiece, but sold very well at the box office due to the fact that it was rated as R and was widely advertised at the time by Paramount. He found his audience and earned enough money to generate several sequels. When you look at it, the tourist trap is as good as Friday the 13th. The same could happen with the Tourist trap. We could see the tourist trap 2, 3, 4 and so on. As for the film, “The Tourist Trap” is a fascinating horror film, created with a very small budget, but well played, well directed and well done on many levels. Chuck Connors is a riot in the role of Mr. Slausen and gives a better representation in the film. Special mention should be given to the composer Pinot Donaggio, whose score for this film really distinguishes it from others and makes it eerie. Music in scenes with dummies is especially creepy. Donagio has worked on the horror film “Carrie” and many other films since the days of The Tourist Trap. He has done an exceptionally good job in the cinema and continues to make films to this day. The Tourist Trap's weakness lies in the fact that in fact there is never an explanation of Davy's strength. Maybe it should be. He just is, and we have to accept it in order for the film to work. We take it to a certain extent, but then there are cases in the script such as how Davey calls the store while he is in the basement of the house. In this case, is Davey restricted in using his powers? Can he call to Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is its range? These are the things that people who do not care about this film are likely to point out flaws. Others will take it as a mistake. I accept it. There are not enough questions generated by this film to make me hate it. This is a horror movie. We should not demand to read too much into this. Many people call this film "Killer Dummy". I assure you, no mannequin kills anyone in this film. The mannequins are controlled by the power of Davey, who uses them as weapons. This is a common misconception about this movie. Some people have problems with mannequins, and some even say that they are just stupid. I think they add to the overall eerie film. General Tourist Trap is a good fun rental. *** (out of 5)
