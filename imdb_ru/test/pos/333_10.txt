When I entered the theater, I thought it would be a great movie. And I was not disappointed for a minute. BLIMEY! This movie is great! The emotions felt throughout the film are extraordinary! Great game Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman. Most likely, this is the best Tamil film I have ever seen. Mani Ratnam once again proved that he is the best in creating meaningful and spiritual films. <br /> <br /> This film is mainly about a young girl (PS Keerthana) who is looking for her biological mother (Nandita Das) who left her in a refugee camp to fight for her country, like her husband (J. Chakravati). The young novelist (Madhavan) finds out about the story of this young girl and decides to write a story about her. He and his wife (Simran) decide to adopt this small child, but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents, and decides to find her biological mother. <br /> <br /> This movie really screams EXCELLENT. Mani Ratnam presented the film superbly. <br /> <br /> My rating is 10/10
