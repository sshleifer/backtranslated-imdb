Watching it with an open mind is completely different, nothing bothers about it. Very well made realistic tale of Tarzana. Chimpanzee animatronists were great at 84th, Christopher Lambert brilliantly imitated chimpanzee language and behavior. I would not be surprised if he took lessons from Jane Goodall.
