I have seen this film before, but I could not remember that it was fantastic: he has a funny plot, Madonna fumbles around the city with cougars, etc., causing excitement. And the music is just perfect! And a happy ending! Who is this girl is a great choice for a romantic like me. In my opinion, this may even be the best Madonna movie I've ever seen! 10/10
