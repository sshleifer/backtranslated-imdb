The task is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists, driven by a character, and not a star's twists, the need to put special effects, a mandatory novel and endless car chases. However, there is a car chase, and that's great. Aidan Quinn is great because both the terrorist and the naval officer are "recruited" to destroy him. Rarely, when a second or third level actor, such as Quinn, is given an important major role, like this one, in which the film is made. As a rule, such a role is assigned to the actor "A-list" with the drawing of box office, so probably I have never heard of this film before I saw it. Donald Sutherland is great as a morally ambiguous, sometimes somewhat creepy agent who picks up Quinn. Ben Kingsley is also good as an Israeli agent. The plot is very complex, and there are several storylines that gradually come to an end, and not all at once, as we used to see. The paranoia and claustrophobia of thrillers of this type are sealed and depicted with moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. Places convincing and effective. There is nothing special about the soundtrack, but we rarely get all of the above qualities today, without stupid and / or meaningless plot development; flimsy stellar turns; loud, annoying audio tracks like music video; a villain who cheats; and multiple cast, costumes and plot, which serve mainly the audience younger than 25 years. This is an outstanding thriller, which undoubtedly did not receive due attention after its release. *** 1/2 of 4 stars.
