I found this film to be one of those wonderful gems. The storyline is closely intertwined, and character development is fantastic! Anyway, I'm a big fan of non-American films, and it's right there: “Happenstance,” “The Closet,” and even “King of Hearts.” Vlastimil Brodsky, like Fanda, is fantastic. This love story in the true sense of a loving life and the twists and turns necessary to make the viewer understand / enjoy Fanda’s view of life (which almost costs him <br /> <br /> more than he is willing to give) is wonderful. His colleague in the film Stella Zazvorkova is unforgettable as his well-fed wife. I highly recommend this film for the whole family - my children loved it.
