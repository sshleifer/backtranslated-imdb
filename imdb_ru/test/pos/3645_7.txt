As I said, I'm NOT a fan of Tweety. It’s just so annoying that I’d like Sylvester to just eat it and finish it. <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Sly is homeless again and starts feeding garbage cans again. He notices a cruise ship leaving a nearby port and decides to board when he spies. Tweety is one of the passengers. <br /> <br /> The ship provides the necessary scene for the following jokes, and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only this time he succeeds, chewing and swallowing, thus destroying the annoying canary forever. But as Tweety cartoons show, this movie is pretty good, but it's ALL thanks to this wonderful cat.
