I am a professional musician who was inspired almost 20 years ago to start playing guitar after listening to Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin II. Although I do not play in the same genre or style, the influence of this person was enormous. Now, after almost 20 years, I finally saw something more than the not-so-good song “Stays the same”. Again, I have seen so many bands perform, some small - some current “masters”. No band, anywhere, has ever been able to accomplish the magic that you can really try by watching this DVD. <br /> <br /> Robert Plant sometimes happens a bit, and you can almost feel Page's annoyance at forgetting the lyrics, but it didn't matter, I suppose, especially for that era. Bonham's genius shines more on this DVD than on any album from Zeppelin, Band of Joy or Lord Sutch. JPJ is pretty ordinary - but the magic of this DVD is how well all four of them play together. The world liked to imagine that they were addicted to black magic (k), etc. — this was only a matter of interest to Page. The magic (mind you, I say a lot) is that this DVD reflects a rare glance at the rudeness of 4 young men who can play brilliantly, no matter how casually they play. It didn't matter. <br /> <br /> Quick stall. The first of the two DVDs is where the real magic is. You should feel the strength and rudeness that Zep had in its first days. By the end of the second DVD, Page fights with his sanity during the Knebworth songs. (It's no secret that by this time he was very addicted to heroin). So, I would recommend the first disc to ANY music lover, and the second one to the only true Zeppelin fan. <br /> <br /> I may have gone too far for some guitarists, but I would say that after watching this, Paige is definitely more creative and inventive than Hendrix. Yes, I said that. And if you do not agree - watch the DVD.
