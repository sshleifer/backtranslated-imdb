First of all, those who are faint of heart should definitely avoid this movie. Even those, like me, who are not sensitive to most graphically cruel and sexual acts in films, should beware. I am not telling you to stay away from the film, but keep in mind that what you are going to see is some disturbing material. Definitely not a pleasant movie to watch, but nothing is placed on the screen strictly for shocking value. But I have to admit that when I watched the movie a second time, I had to move on to the next chapter, when the "razor blade scene" appeared. <br /> <br /> The main character is one of the most non-sympathetic sympathetic characters I can imagine, but we begin to better understand her character’s humanity later in the second act of the film. In one scene, she shoves a broken glass into her student's jacket pocket, being unhappy with her apparently unsatisfactory performance and nervous before a live audience. A student walks into her pocket and cries in pain, looking at her bloody hand. Next to the razor blade scene, this worried me the most. The student's mother is not much prettier than she. When she receives a message that her daughter will not be able to play, she speaks about it, as if she also received a hand injury, being one of those spoiled mothers who are trying to torture her daughter to become a re-educator. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film intrigued me and mostly interested me, I felt that I needed to explain more about the character of Isabel Huppert. When a woman enjoys sadomasochistic porn and participating in this behavior of yourself, you want to understand the root of the problem. The film establishes that she desperately wants to be loved. Then why hate the attitude of all? Why does she get sexual pleasure from pain? <br /> <br /> The game is amazing and I liked the glossy, stylized lighting. In general, this is not the film that I would recommend if you are determined to have fun, but, as I said, it is very intriguing. And I’m sure that if I watched it a few more times, I could discover some subtleties that would shed more light on aspects of the film that I didn’t realize initially. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 (out of 10)
