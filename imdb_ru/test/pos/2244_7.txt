Age of Steel follows the previous episode, Rise of the Cybermen, which was excellent in some respects and was absent in others. RotC had some positive elements, the most important of which was an excellent image of Tennant Doctor. Indeed, his foolish vertigo carries this author, the shadow of Dr. Tom Baker, with his subconscious separation (as in the countdown when Mickey holds the button in the Tardis), but at the same time brings his alienation. Excellence a la McCoy Doctor, as he allows events to unite around him. Some reviewers and fans whose work I read seem a little alarmed that such a young actor portrays someone who should be more than 1000 years old now, but I disagree. Dr. Tennant really "carries the weight of the world on his shoulders," as he points out in this episode, and this can be seen from his almost smug characterization, like when he finally encounters Lumic / The Cybercontroller at the climax. His tired world, glittering look "other male, objectionable" attitude updates, especially after the excellent pseudo-working class of Eccleston, bad ** character interpretation, more man of action than freshly high pseudododuf Tennant. Tennant's best moment may have come after it ends, when he restores the Tardis with his big blunt smile to Baker Esq when the Tardis restarts. Here we begin to feel this new Doctor, a character who is little more than various aspects of the personality of an ordinary person, divided into 13 different people; some contradictory, some more pleasant than others, but still forming part of the whole. In addition, these two episodes were bearable, but weak. The concept of the revival of cybermen is very welcome, and they look fantastic, but the plot with the participation of the parallel Earth, where this action takes place, does not seem to work correctly. True, the allegory here about people's dependence on technology and their need to serve them, as the Doctor notes, is outstanding, but this could easily be done on the modern Earth or so. Some other weak points, as others have pointed out, are the ease with which Doctor and Co. come out of difficult places, viz. the death ray from the Tardis component, seemingly an infinite number of sonic screwdriver applications (my wife laughed when they used it to burn a rope ladder at the end; she barely watched anyone, so I had to explain that it was traditionally used as a plot device to extract characters from situations from which there is no other way out! Used here, unfortunately). Some of the actors wanted, especially Mickey, who really needs his due, and some of the supporting cast. Lumik was creepy as he was supposed to be, his voice even sounded like a cyberman. However, the score was terrible, with loud music that often overwhelms the stage. In general, Rise of the Cyberman seemed more interesting to me, although the second half was bearable. Building up what we knew was inevitable, good, but the resolution was disappointing. Too many unlikely shoots, lack of development of ancillary staff and, in my opinion, not enough Tennant. This new show is outstanding, and Davis is pushing it in the right direction, but the dialogue (outside the Doctor) must be intensified, as Mickeyâ€™s farewell shows, which were pure ham.
