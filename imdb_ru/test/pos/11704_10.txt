<br /> <br /> Crackjack, starring Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy - both actors in the early 90s on Saturday night comedy show “Late Show”, Bill Hunter, the Australian film icon and John Clark, whom we still Regularly watch Australian television with Brian Dow. <br /> <br /> Crackerjack, Lessly, talks about a boy of thirty (Jack Simpson, played by Mick Malloy), who pays for his annual membership at a local club of balls in order to get a few parking places that he uses himself and gives for rent to others, like cheap parking in the city center. <br /> <br /> The club is going through difficult times and gathering all the resources and members as it can, Jack is calling and saying that he must take part in the match next Saturday or lose his membership (and, accordingly, the parking space) . <br /> <br /> I won’t ruin the rest, but the film is funny, carefree and contains everything that should be in a good Australian film. <br /> <br /> If you are not an Australian, some jokes and humor will surely confuse you, if you are an Australian, do yourself a favor and sit on Crackerjack. Now it is available on DVD, I already have a copy! <br /> <br /> 10/10 .. Awesome movie! <br /> <br />
