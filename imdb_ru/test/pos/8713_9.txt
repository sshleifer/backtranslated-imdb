Of all 48 Bridget Bardot’s films, "Une Parisienne" is widely considered (one of) her best. What we see is special: this time the plot has its own value, it does much more than just provide a cheap car for the BB's sexy appearance. <br /> <br /> This film is your real and well-developed Light Comedy, with a good and consistent story. Established in government circles in France in the late 1950s, it entertains from start to finish. Providing a lot of funny turns and slaps - all are played out by at least three main characters, including Bardo. <br /> <br /> “Une Parisienne” (in French “resident of Paris”) tells the story, not at the Brigitte Bardot show. Bridget copes with the plot, using his talent for filming light comedies. <br /> <br /> When you sit down on the sofa on Friday night, tired and tired of weekly slavery, just turn on “Une”. Parisian". This movie will make you feel better.
