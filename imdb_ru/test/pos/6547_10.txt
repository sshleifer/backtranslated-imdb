I saw UZUMAKI about a year ago and was mesmerized. The only Japanese horror film that I saw before was KWAIDAN (which, by the way, I have on DVD), great! The idea of ​​a city absorbed in spirals sounds just like something from Lovecraft. Of course, this reminds one of TENI ABOVE INSMOTA, about inhabitants slowly turning into monsters (in this case giant snails). And who can forget the washing machine sequence? I hope we will see this film soon on the 1st Region DVD (I see that Sundance recently showed it on American television, I hope they will do it again very soon) so that we all can see it. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
