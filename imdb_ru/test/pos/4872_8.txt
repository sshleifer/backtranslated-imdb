This is more like what made this cartoon popular ..... but who complains? Itâ€™s always fun to see how a poor coyote tries various tricks to get a road runner, and then blows up with each of these inventions. <br /> <br /> The chase in an underground cave was different from the usual fare and was smart. This gave us an aerial view of the chase in a labyrinth-like structure. I did not say that it was fun; just different from ordinary aboveground tricks. <br /> <br /> This one, along with some of the other Road Runner shorts, is represented in the Golden Looney Tunes 2 Volume Collection, and their shows are impressive. The colors are gorgeous.
