I remember watching this movie 34 years ago, and it was full of anticipation and turns. It captures you at the beginning and makes you wonder throughout the entire movie. I thought about this film over the past few years and checked it in video stores to see if it was available, but I could not find him or anyone who had even heard of it. I think this type of film is timeless, and I know that it will appeal to a whole new generation of viewers. I hope that this will soon appear on the video, as it would be interesting to see if it will have the same effect on me as it did in the early 70s. <br /> <br /> Very rarely a television movie can make so many impressions, but it has been done and still does after so many years.
