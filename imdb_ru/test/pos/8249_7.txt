When Pinky, a qualified electrician, is released from prison, his parole officer found his job in a large city bank. When someone from the underworld from his past finds out about his situation, they plan to use him and rob a bank. Pinky is horrified at first, because he really wants to go straight, but when a turn of fate happens, Pinky begins to think that you should not look at the gift of a horse-horse. <br /> <br /> Also known as Bank Mayfair Caper {among others!}, This is an extremely enjoyable piece that is typical of the 1970s. London and all its highly dubious fashion are lit up like a Christmas tree in the cunning choir of Ralph Thomas and Guy Elms. If the viewer can accept David Niven as an elderly criminal lord with some power (it's not so easy, I can tell you), then the Nightingale Sang at Berkeley Square may well surprise you. The actors do not exactly stretch the trees, but in fact it does not harm the picture at all, it has an honest, fun quality that is never less than entertainment. The score and soundtrack may be guilty of excessive fun during dramatic criminal moments, but this is a small complaint that makes me think that this is an underestimated British treasure. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan plays the lead role of Pinky (obviously hoping to seduce American viewers), 70s heart pulse Oliver Tobias {mass of hair} is there to interest the ladies, while the guys get a pleasant sight Elke Sommer and her amazing legs for the company. A decent enough clip and containing a seriously useful final, “The Nightingale Sang” at Berkeley Square deserves much better than a scanty rating of 5.7 here on IMDb, but how many people saw him, I wonder? good stuff 7/10
