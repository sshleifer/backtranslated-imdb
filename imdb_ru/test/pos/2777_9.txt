Although it’s not the most technically advanced film I’ve seen, it was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours. The main characters are cute, and you really like them, and you feel something when Susie Q needs to leave, but you feel good again when she returns to the role of Maggie. <br /> <br /> A lot of standard dialogues and contrived storyline, but most of all, a lot of fun.
