It is strange that the least famous films sometimes turn out to be among the best that you have seen. This film has all the elements of a standard modern action movie, weapons, techno, villains, money, etc., and yet it stands out among ordinary Hollywood viewers. I would believe this to two very charismatic people. Christopher Walken confidently trusts, and Lorain Bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women I've ever seen on screen. Another important reason why this film stands out is the change of scenery in Jamaica after the start. Jamaican resort is so beautiful that you will wish that you do not sit by the pool at night with Run'n'Coke. I know what I did. I am very glad that I watched this film - it was too nice to miss it!
