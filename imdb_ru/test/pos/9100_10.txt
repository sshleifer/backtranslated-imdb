This film is all that Tenacious D. fans can hope for. Directed by Liam Lynch in partnership with “D” is a mixture of epic proportions. Of course, you have to understand the tenacious D. humor and format. When I saw it, the audience did not laugh too much, but the reason is not lack of humor or clever pranks. This film seems to have been released for an unsuspecting public who have not become familiar with the musical duet. This film remains true to its roots. Those few of you who have seen the HBO series and heard the album have not forgotten what their audience likes. As in the television show, people noticed from the trailer the scenes with JB and KG apartments and, of course, open evenings with microphones, with which every episode of Tenacious D began and ended. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and every song is amazing. <br /> <br /> ... And Dave Grohl plays the fantastic devil. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect movie for those who are looking for a hard time and swinging musical.
