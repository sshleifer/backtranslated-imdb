Where rivers flow to the north is a well-told story about the struggle of two peoples for their own lives in the face of “progress” and development. In addition to enjoying the film as entertainment, I also learned a little about life in the countryside of New England back in the late 1920s. <br /> <br /> Cinematography captured all the beauty of Northern Vermont and set the scene, and the music brought the film to life. Very well done for a low-budget locally produced film. I found Michael J. Fox’s character the weakest in the film, but Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal turn into two of the best performances I've seen in a long time. I was saddened that she did not get approval as the best actress of the year (I guess the film was too “small” to be considered).
