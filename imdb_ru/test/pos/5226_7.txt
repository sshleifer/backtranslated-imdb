Raoul Walshâ€™s mega-epic, stunning, filmed in the early widescreen process by the great Arthur Edeson, can be slow and static in an early manner of conversation, but this classic journey on a wagon through America to the Northwest is impressive as a purely physical production when seen on the big screen. On television, the lack of close-ups and the remote reproduction of sound can be frightening. Young John Wayne easily scores in his first starring role with a natural supply that the rest of the cast cannot command. Surprisingly, the film failed, and Wayne spent most of the next decade in the class of Western feed.
