I grew up outside of Nail, Germany (where they landed), every detail of the film was 100% genuine, the power lines they flew over, curious neighbors, a grandmother telling children that they could not watch West German television, etc. This film brings back many good memories to Europeans, a great production from Disney ... In the same German film, Klaus Lovich and GÃ¼nter Meisner use their own voices to translate the English version into German ... for the German version, they also use Fri n Cookoo, a bird that is native to Germany, as background noise to let you know that you are in Germany ... I showed this move many of my German relatives, and they really liked this movie. (These people made a prototype cylinder, which they had to refuse, because the materials they used were too porous, and the other two cylinders that they used to escape. The problem with the burner was solved when they turned the propane cylinders up bottom.)
