Not sure why the other commentary on this film was so negative, but I liked this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a special love for Korean art, culture and history. I thought this film was a very controversial and interesting character for life. Jang Seung-up is one of (perhaps the most) famous Korean artists, and they continue to be respected as masters. Given the confusion of time in which he painted, and his own controversial nature, it is surprising that he created so many works in so many styles and with such skill. This film pays tribute to his talent, and also directly looks at his unstable and somewhat self-destructive personality. The cinematography, in my opinion, was beautiful, many of the outdoors panoramic pictures looked like Korean landscapes (which I found rather vain than “excessive art”), and I think Choi Min Sik portrayed Jan Seung with the necessary intensity unpredictability. I highly recommend this film to art and film lovers.
