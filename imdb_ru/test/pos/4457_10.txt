The name "Lucio Fulci" brings together images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of fans in May. Thanks to films such as Zombies 2, City of the Living Dead, Otherworld and The Ripper of New York, Fulci has a reputation as one of the worst directors in history. And although many of his later films certainly justify his reputation until Zombie 2 was released in 1979, Fulci’s films didn’t contain nearly as much blood and courage that he knows about, in fact they were mostly free from the smell of blood to rely on more traditional shocks and disturbing images for work. "Do not torture the duckling" contains almost no blood, but is considered its best. <br /> <br /> “Do not torture the duckling” occurs in a small Sicilian town, where instead of logic superstition dominates. Citizens are very distrustful of both outsiders and others, often avoiding them. After a series of child killings, many people descend into the city, including Andrea Martelli (Thomas Milan), who is trying to uncover the truth about the killings as they continue. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. It is very well done with an excellent cast, filled with many favorites of Italian exploitation cinema. It also contains a solid account, as well as many creative camera movement courtesies or Lucio Fulci. But the real draw, “Don't Try the Duckling,” is the disturbing nature of the film. Small children, about twelve years old, are shown mocking backward people who visit prostitutes and offer sex to an elderly woman. It also contains some very sharp comments about the middle class and the Catholic Church. It is for these reasons that “Do not try to duck” was blacklisted across Europe when it was first released and never appeared in the United States. However, “Do not torture the duckling” stands as a monumental achievement in the cinema Giallo, as well as the best work of Lucio Fulci. I really can't recommend it enough, check it out.
