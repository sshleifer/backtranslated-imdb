I only gave it nine stars, not ten, because I really do not approve of pornography all that much. Pornography has a useful purpose in society (I can’t say, I can always think of one thing), but it probably does. <br /> <br /> Personal point of view aside, I really thought this movie was pretty funny. I didn’t buy this movie because it was pornography, I bought it because I’m one of those obsessed with Alice who will watch something about Alice in Wonderland. I own almost every DVD version, so it was an obvious choice to supplement my DVD collection with this. I have to admit that I was shocked beyond my expectations, and all this would be completely offensive if it were not so damn ridiculous. besides, the music is really good and i like musicals. <br /> <br /> Not everyone can create a good musical for nudi. Anyone who has seen Nudy's First Musical knows that this was a stinking bomb. Considering that the low budget Bill Osco worked, Alice is very remarkable, like a musical (it's better than some of the musicals on expensive budgets). <br /> <br /> the film cannot completely avoid the filth of porn, I usually watch version XXX for the full effect of shock and some of these scenes are scandalous (shocking because we are talking about Lewis Carroll). I felt very embarrassed and embarrassed during the scene where “Alice” (Christine DeBell) starts to masturbate. it made me feel like a voyeur. and unreasonable lesbian scenes with “Alice” and kittens were a bit too capricious. <br /> <br /> However, the film has a great sense of humor. there is one particularly funny moment during the queen's orgy, when one of the actresses gets up and says: "Who do I need for F - K to get out of this movie?". Happy. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that I buy all the sex, it's good for you, spoil your philosophy here, but sex is a man, and nothing human causes disgust. (I do not know if I am. I really feel that way, but I could not resist saying this.) Some people think that everything must be connected with sex. I do not know. God, just show me some nonsense of responsibility and decency. This film definitely earns points for sexually minded people, but I would not try your luck, the next time you may really be angry with someone. I mean, we are dealing with children's literature here.
