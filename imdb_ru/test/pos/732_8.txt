Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beal (the charming performance of Rosie Holotik's amazing red-haired knockout) goes to work at a remote rural refuge run by Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (excellent Annabelle Broom). Among the motley assortment of crazy crazy patients are the insatiable, aggressive nymphoman King Allison (juicy Betty Chandler), the crazy judge Oliver W. Cameron (glorious Hammy Gene Ross), Vietnamese paranoid veteran Vietnam Sergeant Jaffee (well-crafted, with the help of the al- quanti- matetetetete rest, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4). McGee) and the crazy old witch Mrs. Callingham (extremely annoying Ray McAdams). The mentioned patients are dangerously encouraged to fulfill their fantasies by Dr. Masters, which, of course, leads to a number of brutal murders. Director S.F. Brownrigg, who works on the basis of Tim Pope's clever and appropriate scenario, does an expert job of creating and maintaining a suffocatingly raw and thoughtful atmosphere of boiling madness and suppressing claustrophobia. Robert Farrarâ€™s dreadful score, a dirty set designer, a few wild horrific murders, Bruce B. Alcott's ugly cinematography, many delightfully strong, landscape-distorting stories from the cast of a nameless game (in particular, Ross is a complete eye and even a truly shocking unexpected conclusion of bloodshed even more reinforce the infectious meager fun of this selected piece of low-budget regional cinema of horrors of the 70s.
