I like this movie! So worth a long time work. Although I need help with the ending .... <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Marie's last shot at the end - does this mean that she is still looking for Reno? or maybe it was she who wanted to revive 13? (she seemed to be the one who delivered the original letter to Colin in the first place) I donâ€™t quite understand, but I know that I really liked it. So if someone saw it and remembers it or just saw, please specify the ending. <br /> <br /> Thank you
