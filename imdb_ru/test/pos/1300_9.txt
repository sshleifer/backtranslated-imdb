Let's face it. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly cliche as Korean romantic dramas and films go. First of all, there are a couple of long-lost brothers and sisters, one of whom falls in love with the other. Secondly, there is a not very popular girl and two gorgeous, popular guys who fall in love with her and fight for her. Thirdly, one of the heroes suffers from a tragic disease that ultimately takes his life. <br /> <br /> Still, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Without suitable actors, this film would probably disappoint fans of the novel. But since the actors are perfect for the roles, the film captures - I, frankly, could not help but watch. Kang Dong Won, despite his handsome face, gives an amazing, heartbreaking performance, not to mention Lee Chung A and Joe Han San, as well as all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to everyone,
