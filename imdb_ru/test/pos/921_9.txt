This is the classic sequel to Bleu, also an excellent film with Juliet Binoche as the main star, moreover, she appears in a cameo here in Rouge, just a second at the very end. But this film, really red and very sweet, albeit very sad, is a real winner. The main character, played by the great Irene Jacob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full, active life, only overshadowed by her traumatic relationship with her strange friend Mike, who is in England. By luck, she is friends with an old judge who spends time listening to her neighbors' personal phone conversations. The story begins to weave even further, and we see him in court, almost universally condemned for his pastime. She is the only one who has sympathy for him, for his cute little dog Rita and her puppies, and for all the people who surround them. We are also witnessing the breakup of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady, and their quarrel is also fueled by this telephone scandal ... But the film is not even about that. Basically it is about loneliness and deep divisions between people, distant and close. When she sails to England on a ferry with this lawyer as an occasional travel companion, as well as with the previously mentioned Binoche, who was filming Bleu, the ship is sinking, and we see Judgeâ€™s startled look when he watches the news, trying to guess if she survived. She did, and yet we feel very heavy at heart. Mr. Kislovsky managed to draw a grand, subtle story about loneliness, misunderstanding, mystery and pain. The deep, dark personal pain of those who are lost and alone. Brilliant movie.
