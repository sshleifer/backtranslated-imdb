Or, if you have seen the Evil Dead trilogy and / or Bubba Ho-Tep, then you should know that his films are farcical. With "The Man with the Screaming Brain," he laid out again. In this case, he plays a smart American businessman, William Cole, visiting Bulgaria - when will we ever see this country? - when a woman kills him. So, the strange scientist Ivan Ivanov (Stacy Kitsch) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent, with the result that he behaves like Steve Martin in the film â€œEverything about Me. <br /> <br /> Yes. The whole movie pretty much justifies stupidity. Much of this humor comes from Sam Raimi Ted, the brother of the director of Evil Dead, almost dead assistant Ivan Paul. The relationship between these two people is more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and Skipper. <br /> <br /> Just understand that this is a completely stupid movie and you will not be a little disappointed. I still liked it.
