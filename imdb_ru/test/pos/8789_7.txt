NO SPOILERS !! <br /> <br /> After Hitchcock’s successful American film Rebecca, based on Daphne DuMarier ’lush novel about the Gothic novel and intrigues, he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early British period — erroneous identity and espionage. When the US entered World War II and large-scale "war efforts" of civilians building planes, weapons and other necessary militias, the rapidly developing cinematic business began to turn into paranoid and often street thrillers with themes of wartime. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and experienced operators working in the shadow of good, law-abiding citizens. Knowing that the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer Jack Skirball turned to Hitchcock with the request that he manage his property related to corruption, wartime sabotage and a helpless hero who fell into a maelstrom of coincidences and erroneous identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp mind of the literary girl Dorothy Parker (during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in New York), who co-wrote the script, perfectly matched Hitchcock's sensitivity. <br /> <This film, often neglected, tells the story of the unfortunate 25-year-old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings), who, while at work at an aircraft factory in Los Angeles, meets a new collaborator, Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd), and through a few seconds, it is substituted for the commission. sabotage. Fleeing from the authorities, who do not believe in his contrived history, he meets several characters on the way to Soda City, Utah, and finally to New York. Among these memorable characters are a circus caravan with a car full of useful “freaks” and the popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane), in which he falls madly in love during the worst crisis of his life and national security! Of course, in the country, Hitchcock Patricia, abducted by the alleged saboteur Barry, falls in love with her kidnapper, thus adding romantic tension to the mix. <br /> <br /> In good shape for this walk, Hitchcock is preparing a national network of modest elderly ladies, average Joe and respected businessmen who act as secret agents of terrorists who harbor criminals, draw weapons and detonate bombs to keep things in movement. This is a terrific storyline that spends time moving forward and after it is lit, ends with one of Hitchcock’s most memorable finals. Look for an incredible life, like the tourist attractions of New York (they were all recreated by artistic directors in Hollywood because of the military ban on shooting at public attractions). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock’s most famous films, this is a popular b-film that is certainly solid and attracts many clever plot twists and, as usual, Hitchcock’s awesome villains. Do not forget to look for Hitchcock's cameo outside the pharmacy in the second half of the film. Hitchcock's original cameo idea, which was filmed (he struggled in sign language with his “deaf” wife), was rejected by the Bureau of Standards and Practice, who were afraid to offend the deaf!
