Mrs. Stowe is sensational in this drama about the power of the secret policeman who interrogates the children's author, because he believes that she is trying to inculcate ideas in her works that are contrary to the state. This is an incredibly powerful movie. Both performances deserve greater recognition, as well as the message of this film. Put it on your must-see list if you can find it.
