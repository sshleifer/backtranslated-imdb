Serendipity. I thought that I had a bad start, and I brought the wrong DVD in the case of “The Intruder”. Hire a store staff! So I didn’t want to watch this movie, but I'm glad I did. In all likelihood, the film I chose would not be as excellent as this delightful and delicate taste of what independent people in the US and in Europe can do together. Seven years later, two heroine sisters go on fantastic journeys in the early 1970s after a student demonstration / Baader-Meinhof Europe. Superbly shot in Algarve, Portugal; and in Berlin, Paris and Amsterdam (reminiscent of the feeling of external shots in Paul Verhoeven's early masterpiece, The Fourth Man), Brewster, Diaz and especially Christopher Ecclestone played touchingly. The story unfolds along an abstract plot capturing the ephemeral emotions of these characters when they encounter their relationships and see the idealized images of each other and themselves broken. The film with great elegance and taste. Not for fans of Arnie Commando, so the reviewer at the top is probably so widely recognized in “his” statements that this is a girl movie. Daft criteria. Also wrong Worth experimenting with.
