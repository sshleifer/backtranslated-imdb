I have to admit that this is one of the few Lou Costello films that I really saw in the theater. Most of them have already seen on T.V., and I must admit that Lou is really nice, and he gets a girl too. It was my first time when I saw the performance of Dorothy Provin, and, of course, I fell in love with her, like many others that day. I saw most of the work she did and enjoyed each one. Her performance in the “Great Race” is one of the reasons why I bought the CD! <br /> <br /> Every commentary on this film suggests that this is the film that Lou Costello made with Bad Abbott, which is true, but if Lou lived, he would have done much more. He really does his job well, and he doesn't have to rely on his old routines to laugh. I, for one, regret that a little man from Patterson, New Jersey. I had no chance to do this. <br /> <br /> I hope this someday will be released on DVD and I can add it to my collection of comedy and science fiction films.
