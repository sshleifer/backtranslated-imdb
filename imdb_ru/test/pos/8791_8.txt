A great movie! Oh yeah! Full of energy, full of fun, representing our generation, our alienation: a hymn to positive thinking, despite the world we live in, a story about a great party, a story about a group of friends who desperately have to do something on a weekend and the only thing make it the club. But fun and ecstasy keep boredom away! Very funny, pleasantly grotesque at several points, beautifully filmed ... and a great soundtrack!
