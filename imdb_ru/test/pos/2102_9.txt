The ruthless, evil commander Samanosuke (superbly played by the hated hand of Yutaro Gomi) cruelly treats the civilians of a small village. The giant stone statue of the Magin finally comes to life, to destroy Samanosuke and his evil minions. Director Kimiyoshi Yasudo and screenwriter Tetsuro Yoshida tell an irresistible story, all the power and simplicity of an ancient, age-old legendary tale: a very strong feeling of an ancient and distant place (it definitely happens in feudal Japan) and disgusting, random sword fights are organized with considerable skill and pleasure, special effects are beautiful and impressive, serious tone and steady pace never fluctuate in those ix minutes, and the last flurry of drums Majin wild destruction of an extremely lively, exciting and more than a little scary. In addition, substantial confidence is attached to the fantastic elements of the narrative, since they are firmly grounded in a too believable dark, stern and sandy world. This film earns bonus points for portraying Magin as the more brutal and frightening force of wrathful revenge instead of pure absolute goodness. Veteran composer Akira Ifukubi offers, as a rule, a rich, reliable and inspiring account. The sharp, capricious cinematography of Fujio Morita also hits the bull's eye. All capable actors give excellent sounding and sincere performances, especially the praiseworthy work of Yun Fujimaki as a valiant defender of Cogent and Tatsuo Endo as a dastardly assistant Gunjuro. Highly recommended.
