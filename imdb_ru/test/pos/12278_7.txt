The cult director Korbucci is the rarest of his thirteen Western spaghetti (of which I have only what I do in the middle of the revolution [1972]), which I learned about recently through Strakult Мар Marco Giusti; it is an atypically gloomy pearl genre in the style of his own masterpiece director, THE GREAT SILENCE (1968), complete with desert snow landscapes. <br /> <br /> Johnny Holliday, French Elvis Presley, which I first saw in Jean "Detective Luke Godard" (1985) - a curious, but very effective choice to play alone about Hud's anti-hero (who, like Clint Eastwood's “Man without a Name,” from Sergio Leone's famous “Dollar Trilogy, equipped with a steel plate armor) for protection; By the way, I“ met ”Holliday's stunning daughter Laura Smet at the 2004 Venice Film Festival but was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director Claude Chabrol! Gastone Moschin is another interesting addition to the fold (performing almost the same function as Frank Wolff in “Great Silence”), but well-proven and amusingly awkward in the presence of bathing Fran Suazo Fabian; the latter, then, plays the greedy nymphomaniac of the banker's widow, who seduces one and all to achieve her goals. Sylvie Fennec has another major female role as a farm girl who is watched by Halliday and who at one point is addicted to “Free Love” by “hippies” by Apache Gabriella Tavernese (with this in mind, it's worth noting that there are amazing but kind bouts of nudity from both Fabian and Tavern)! By the way, the anachronistic addition of a group of longhaired young people (who are also engaged in smoking, doping and revolutionary talk) is a somewhat unfinished attempt at modern relevance? but all this ultimately adds to the fun (besides, even a black barmaid wears an afro hairstyle!). <br /> <br /> Mario Adorf is also extremely pleased with his small role as a Mexican who is bigger than his life. gangster nicknamed "El Diablo" ?? who constantly keeps the young biographer by his side (an element that may have influenced UNFORGIVEN [1992]) Clint Eastwood and at some point defies the captive Moshina in a dizzying duel! Having said this, the film also contains one very unusual "death weapon" ?? as Holliday gets rid of the enemy, kicking the salon's cash register in his face! As always, pleasant fake fist fights are accompanied by excessive sound effects; however, equally for the genre, however, the pensive account of Angelo Francesco Lavanino becomes the most significant asset. In fact, the ambiguous ending fully corresponds to the dark tone of the film. after Fabian’s retribution at the hands of the local hippies (who had previously worshiped Hud) suddenly turned against him when the city was wounded and terrorized (forcing everyone on the street and dressed up), but the deadpan fighter rises to meet their challenge (they, however, fuss for the future with him!) and then leaves town, leaving Fennec behind. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I received this with a wide screen print of good quality in Italian, although with French loans and an occasional mistake ?? about one minute of screen time just ?? into French (where, apparently, the original soundtrack was not available).
