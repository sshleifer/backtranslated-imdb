Attractive characters, nice animation, dynamite songs ... all this and cute kittens too. There is a lot of great humor, but no real threat, so don't worry about your babies. Two farm dogs steal the show, although they only appear in two scenes. The artwork has a linear quality that can alienate some people, but I find it fascinating.
