I consider myself a big fan of horror movies. One evening, I just wanted to rent some new horror movies to make fun of them. Then I rented Milo. I was so surprised by this movie. It scared the hell out of me. This is not something that I can say very often. Halloween usually just scares me. <br /> <br /> Two other friends watched it with me, and they had a disturbing feeling. Good feeling if you ask me after watching a horror movie. If this does not concern you, then what is the point. <br /> <br /> This film was original. It did not follow the normal rules of a horror movie. That's why films like Valentina are being bombed for me. <br /> <br /> Of course, many remain unanswered, as most horror films do. It is worth the rent though.
