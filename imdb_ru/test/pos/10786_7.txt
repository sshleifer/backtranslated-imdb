Barry Champlain is a telephone talk show host in Dallas, whose carefree ideas about a lot of social issues bother many of his listeners and listeners. Is Barry a media messiah in search of truth or a social loser to attack his audience? <br /> <br /> This is an intense, provocative character article about a person who has almost no redemptive traits, which at the same time seems to be on some really deep philosophy. Despite being co-authored and directed by Stone, he is in fact a part of Bogosyan’s play, and he gives a strikingly tough and insightful presentation from which there is no way out. Barry is sometimes one of the most disgusting characters you can imagine, spewing bilious misanthropy to everyone around you, especially those who care for him. But at the same time, he is also strangely sympathetic, hypnotic, wise, even cute. Bogosyan's hawkish features burst into the frame, his green eyes constantly rushing around, as if constantly searching for an answer to some mystery. In fact, this film is an angry, self-satisfied rant against fanaticism, injustice and banality in the world, culminating in Barry's wild three-and-a-half-minute single shot delivering the final speech, "I Hate Everything," Especially Green as a former wife and Baldwin as a boss. A passionate photo of Robert Richardson allows you to save an interesting picture for one radio studio, and Stuart Copeland with an intense score shows an amazing melody from telephone music, “Telephone and Eraser,” of the Penguin Cafe orchestra. If you are not familiar with Bogosyan, watch his amazing talent in this film - like his contemporaries, Bill Hicks and Denis Leary, he is the one who rarely appears in the mainstream media, simply because his writings are so popular. I find Stone's variable films; I am not very worried about his great successes, but when he is more orderly and objective, as is the case with this (or with Salvador and Nixon), he is much more abrupt and arrested. The glorious initial cry of the picture, based on a play by Bogosyan, inspired by a real story about Alan Berg, the talk show host in Denver, killed by neo-Nazis in 1984.
