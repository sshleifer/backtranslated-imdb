Every year, you can not miss the long-awaited title of a big budget with the right combination of a star, a director and a plot that fails miserably at the box office. This year it was Superman Returns. In 1982 it was Blade Runner. In 1957, it was Billy Wilder's The Spirit of St. Louis, which was all - the main director, a huge star, the best-selling true story about an American hero - with the exception of enough viewers to cover his expenses. Perhaps the public still remembered Lucky Lindy’s anti-Semitism and his loud admiration for the achievements of Nazi Germany before the war (none of them were covered in the film, which ends with his arrival in Paris, before the legend became too stained). Maybe because they thought they knew the story, or that it would be just one guy stuck in the cab for two hours. Of course, Wilder and co-author Wendell Maes are aware of the dramatic pitfalls of Lindberg’s unprecedented flight, alternating between a well-made structure of memories and key moments in his life and preparation for the flight itself. When the film is in the air, it is at the same time amazing and troubling, it finds true drama in its attempts to stay awake and navigate without the proper tools. <br /> <br /> It also creates a rather remarkable sense of fear, which is unlike anything else in Wilder’s filmography, in conjunction with the real meaning of the epic: shots that look like ominous thunderclouds over a hanger are a dark dawn before flying, are carried in imagine the real cold of foreboding. Even the typically muted and problematic WarnerColor adds to the film, not detracts from it. Along with the excellent use of CinemaScope, there is a wonderful score from Franz Waxman: magnificent, soaring, but filled with a lowered threat, and skillfully used as part of the film’s fabric, and not just musical accompaniment. The film loses points for hinting, although in fact it never says directly that it was a race to be the first to fly over the Atlantic - in fact, Lindberg was the third person to fly across the Atlantic after the almost completely forgotten Britons of Alcock and the amazing Brown's Flight eight years ago - but this is still an amazingly intense and exciting adventure story that deserves a success that she never found.
