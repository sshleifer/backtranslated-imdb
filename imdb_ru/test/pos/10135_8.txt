Corniness Warning. As many familiar IMDb users already know, I'm not a banal, stupid person. If you do not want to read this review, then go. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, you hear it from a man who laughed at the Titanic and almost broke his parents' record of continuously rewinding the propeller scene. <br /> <br /> --- Spoilers --- <br /> <br /> Once I went to the cinema with two friends to see Dickie Roberts: Former child star, last year in August. Boring trailers rolled until one of them began so calmly. It was for radio. The moment I saw the trailer, I just needed to watch this movie on the weekend. When this weekend came, Scary Movie 3 came out too much, so on Friday night there were teenagers queuing there. It turns out that the film was sold out, and these teenagers so desperately wanted to watch a movie that they went, and also sold out Good Boy and Radio. I could not get a ticket, and in the following weeks I was busy with more important things. After about 5 months my friend rented a radio. He let me borrow, and I looked in my room. I will tell you this now, this is the only film I have ever seen that made me cry ever. When Mother Radio died, it happened automatically. The next day I went to Blockbuster and bought a DVD. <br /> <br /> Good enough from my silly personal story, let me tell you about the movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a mentally retarded person nicknamed Radio. Ed Harris is a co-star, and this film is directed by Mike Tollyn. Based on real events, Radio is a teenager who lives life, spending most of his day alone. He walks with a trolley, collects everything he can, and always carries a radio with him. He has his own collection. At the end of each day, he goes home to his mother. He never went to school until later in the film. One day, Radio passes a local high school while the football team is training. A soccer ball flies over the fence, and Radio picks it up and continues. Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones, a football coach. They meet, and this is the life of Radio. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Radio and Coach Jones spend time together, both teach each other. It's great to see how the film goes to the highest joys, the lowest lows, and just see how Radio lives its life. You will laugh, cry and live radio with him. This film has a special place in my heart along with Toy Story and others. This is a must-see for the whole family, for oneself or for those who just want a great drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Radio will never be forgotten by me. Never. <br /> <br /> As the character of Ed Harris said at the end of the film: <br /> <br /> “We don’t teach radio, but radio teaches us”. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Alison A.
