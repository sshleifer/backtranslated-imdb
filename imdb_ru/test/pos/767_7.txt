Ben Marshall, a teenager of religious origin, learned of the financial situation of the house with his powerful mother, Laura. She invites him to find a temporary job to contribute to the household. In fact, the family took a widower to board them with them. Robert Marshall, father, pastor at a local church; he would prefer to be in the country, watching the birds, rather than taking care of the souls entrusted to his church. <br /> <br /> Ben is working with elderly actress Evie Walton, who wants him to do something for her. around the house. “Dame,” Evie, as she calls herself, is a woman of a certain age, whose career has died, perhaps because she was not so great. In fact, the only memorable appearance seems to be in the popular soap opera, but she would prefer to forget about it. Evie, who is an obsessive liar, tells Ben that she dies, only to forget about it, later, when she becomes clean with the boy. <br /> <br /> Ben is obviously delighted with more than the life of the personality of his employer. He took driving lessons. Evie asks him to go camping, which he does contrary to his common sense. He knows that it will cause the rage of his mother. Not content with this, Evie decides to go to Edinburgh, where she was invited to read at an arts festival. It is this trip that strengthens their connection. Ben meets and tastes the taste of flesh with sympathetic Brioni. <br /> <br /> When Ben returns, everything collapses at home. His mother, who had an affair with a parishioner, decides to leave the family in favor of a young man with whom she had an affair. The relationship between Ben and Evie stands the test of time. He also begins to see his own father in a different light. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Brock, author of Driving Lessons and other memorable English films, gets his first directorial work in this fascinating comedy. A mixture of show business and religion, loyalty and friendship, is explored in its screen processing, which makes it a fun movie time. We have seen a similar situation before, like at Billy Elliott, where Julie Walters plays an educational role with a young man. We read that the film is based on Mr. Brock’s own experience when he worked with the lady Peggy Ashcroft when he was young. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, who plays Evie Walton, is perhaps the best reason to watch a movie. She always delivers. Miss Walters is a welcome presence in any film she appears in, and she works wonders with her fake lady. Laura Linney, herself playing on the light, does not quite understand our icy mother. Rupert Grint, known for his Harry Potter films, plays Ben, a young man who sees Evi a good soul. Nicholas Farrell is a devoted father. Michel Duncan plays a small role in which she shines.
