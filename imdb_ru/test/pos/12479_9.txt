Great artists have always suffered while they were young. I could mention Mozart and Beethoven, but this is not the main thing. <br /> <br /> This film was shot by G. G. Clouzot, whose family wanted him to succeed in the professions of lawyers. <br /> <br /> His main star is Louis Jouvet, who had previously studied and worked as the pharmacist “The Greatest Actor”, as well as the director of the French Theater before and after World War II. <br /> <br /> They both have he had health problems, Kluzo had tuberculosis when he was young, Jouve had heart problems, and he died in the theater. <br /> <br /> Such events shape the character of men (and women, of course). You can even to say that contemporary artists are so poor because they never suffered and did not fight for their lives. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the greatest film by Uzo. “The wage of fear” is more in “suspense,” “The Devil” also has more “uncertainty” and a better plot, and more about “female evil.” <br /> <br /> Quai des Orfèvres is more humane. Clouzot was false accused by De Gaulle’s entourage (mainly communists and Jews) in collaboration with the Nazis and forbade making films until De Gaulle left the French government in early 1946. De Gaulle returned in 1958 as president. <br /> <All the main characters are good people: Jenny L'Amour can play Putin on stage, but she’s not “whore” (dictionaries make synonyms of these words, but they don’t match), her husband loves and refuses from minor "advances" from her (presumably lesbian) friend Dora, a photographer. <br /> <br /> Maurice, the husband is jealous and timid, but runs away from the crime scene. He is a coward, because he fell in love with a woman and ended up exchanging a more upscale career for love .. <br /> <br /> Antoine, a detective story (as interpreted by the great Louis Jouvet, mostly a theater actor, speaks in French) Gray "not Noir", as well as EG Robinson in "Double Atonement") shows the talent of pseudo-criminals, affection for the Negro son (?) And compassion for the true author of the crime, because he remembers that his father was cleaning the restrooms in the castle some nobleman !! <br /> <br /> Kloso was able to hit the actor's face in order according to put him in the right mood, but deep down he was very human. In front of me was his horoscope. He had Venus in Sagittarius, which means openness, devotion, mercy and altruism. For those who do not believe in astrology, my most sincere apologies ...
