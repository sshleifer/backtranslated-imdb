It is very difficult to portray the novel of Tagor in cinematic lines. And if you forget about the obscure performance of 1967, for the first time choker-Bali was done on a large scale. Overall, the sets looked fantastic with the right touches to create a successful historical drama. Prasenjit, so accustomed to gross commercial things, put a lot of effort into it. I saw the Bengali version and found that Aishwaryaâ€™s voice was duplicated, which made her dialogue a little more difficult. While the director worked well, portraying each of the characters with grace, there was still very little in the way of a meaningful plot, probably the lack of the story itself. However, character development, including with minor roles, seems to be the strongest point. It is difficult to turn some of the stories of Tagore into films, since only the visual parts seem to be realized.
