I would rate this movie high on my list of Ingrid Bergman films. In addition to the beauty of Ingrid, her talent is manifested in the scene behind the scenes. She was sad, mean, witty, snobbish, flirtatious, delightfully funny, loving, tender, sad, upset, happy, etc. - And so <br /> <br /> convincingly. Ingrid plays a famous woman (Clea), who returns to New Orleans and falls in love with Texas player Gary Cooper (Clint). I especially liked the scene where they sit at the dinner table, without saying anything, just staring at each other. She is in an elegant white dress, and he is in a beautiful white cowboy suit <br /> <br /> sitting there, adoring her to look at her. What chemistry! What is love!
