Brown returned to his role a year earlier (in "Slaughter") for this rough subsequent film. In the original, he avenged the murder of his parents, destroying a huge mafia organization in Mexico. Here he is the one who is being pursued by the money launderer, pictured by McMahon. When the first assassination attempt failed, Brown returned to action again, smashing the gangster ass everywhere, trying to protect his new girlfriend Hendry. Although the original film was, in general, a better and more consistent film, it demonstrates all aspects of exploitation in much heavier doses, which makes it more enjoyable for fans of the genre. In addition to the rather dreary debut on horseback and a completely deadly car ride down a city street at night, this film is shown in a very brisk pace. Every few minutes, one or more of the following appear: drug use, sex, nudity, firefight, murder, or some other action. Brown is his usually reliable, amiable "me", who is helped by his amazing physical presence, which largely hides any rigidity in his game. McMahon is a riot! With tinted glasses and loose hair in the center (!), He shows how he fulfills the orders of his gang of thugs and overhears passionate love for his fur-clad fur. Seeing bosom friend Johnny Carson in such a role is a twisted thrill. Stroud gives the impression of an intense, racially fanatical bounty hunter, while Peters adds just a cool hue as an honest police detective who enlists the help of Brown. Unfortunately, nothing is mentioned about Brown's original chums Don Gordon and Stella Stevens. Suddenly, Brown has a girlfriend (Hendry), who is quite pretty, but she lacks the sensuality and personality that Stevens had before. Williams makes an outrageous turn as a pimp who seems to be able to choose any girl from the bar and make her an instant member of his harem. Cinematography and general management are less polished than in the first film, but this film has a drive and a sense of danger that surpasses the sense of the original. The film spends a lot of time in the sewage system of organized crime, drugs, prostitution and other vices, but it retains interest due to the creativity of its militants and the striking lack of political correctness. One strange remark: the key background player in the first film was shot, but here he plays a different role.
