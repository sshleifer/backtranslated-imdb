I just watched this movie in an extended show. I did not read the book and did not know anything about this story, but I went because the book was recognized by the "Book of the Year" by two local colleges. Therefore, I cannot compare the book with the film, as others have done. <br /> <br /> In short, I thought it was an incredibly touching story. The game was believable, and the understanding of Afghan culture and political history was interesting and shocking. My oldest friend is Iranian-American, and therefore I felt close to certain Middle Eastern values ​​and traditions that were depicted in the film, because they reminded me of the times I spent with his family. The themes of friendship, family, human values ​​and courage under fire are universal and well developed in the film. I will not list the details of the plot, since they can be obtained elsewhere. But based on the technical aspects of the film, the acting and, above all, its heartbreaking story, I definitely recommend this film.
