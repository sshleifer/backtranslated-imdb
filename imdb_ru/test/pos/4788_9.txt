I saw it when I was twelve. It was the film that made me understand what really was a good mystery. I read the entire series of Happy Hollisters' children's puzzles, and they told about the family of detective children who always got their man. But we, the readers, could not solve the mystery with them. This film showed me that a good mystery is what makes the viewer / reader eventually say, â€œOh, !!!!! COURSE !!!!!!!
