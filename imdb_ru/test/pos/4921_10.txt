This is a classic animated film from the animated series! Most of the main characters get a lot of time on the screen, and also perform additional characters! The film focuses on the release of superstar heroes, and each of them has its own unique summer fun! It is very funny from start to finish! He has great color, great music and, believe it or not, I saw it more than any movie. This is great and in my opinion perfect!
