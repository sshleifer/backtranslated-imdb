The director of Moon Blue, Otto Preminger, touched upon an even more taboo subject in his scandalous 1955 release, The Man with the Golden Hand. Considering that he angered the American Film Association, using the words “virgin” and “mistress” in his soft comedy of 1953 “The Blue Moon”, Preminger went far beyond what any film with “The Man with“ Golden Hand "Since Dick Powell made his epopee about the rule of law" To the ends of the earth "(1946) about disrupting international drug trafficking. Based on the novel by Nelson Algren, who won the 1950 National Book Award, this tough, uncompromising, 119-minute black and white melodrama is dedicated to heroin addiction. Initially, when the Preminger film came out, the American Filmmakers Association did not release its seal of approval because the filmmakers depicted drug addiction. This innovative film is qualified as the first major film about narcotics from the point of view of a drug addict, and in fact demonstrates the attributes used by drug addicts to shoot heroin. The Production Code states that filmmakers must refrain from showing characters using illegal drugs. However, United Artists have released this unique picture of Frank Sinatra, and she has collected over 4 million dollars. <br /> <br /> Critical and commercial success of the “Man with the Golden Hand” lost its production code. As a result, the MPAA amended the Codex to allow filmmakers to delve into other prohibited topics, such as drug abuse, kidnapping, abortion, and prostitution. The film received three Academy Award nominations. Oscar nominations were awarded to Sinatra for best acting, Joseph Wright and Darrell Silver for best artistic scenery, Black and White and Elmer Bernstein for best music, soundtrack of drama or comedy. In fact, Elmer Bernstein made a name for himself with his jazz score. The producers thought about the role of Marlon Brando in the title role, but Sinatra defeated Brando. Eleonora Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang, Darren McGavin and Robert Strauss shot together with Ole Blue Eyes. McGavin was particularly memorable as a sloppy heroin dealer, while Eleanor Parker played the main character's wife with a dark, deep secret that was a real shock. <br /> <br /> “The Man with the Golden Hand” refers to the ability of the protagonist Frankie Machines to manipulate a deck of cards. Frankie hands over the cards to Zero Schwifke (Robert Strauss from Stalag-17), but for the last six months he has been out of Chicago at the federal drug treatment hospital, recovering from heroin addiction. Frankie not only acquired the habit, but also learned to play the drums and plans to start a musical career. When Frank is optimistic about his future, he again and again faces his past when he returns to his old arena. Schwiefka wants him to deal with him again, and Nifty Louie Fomorowski (Darren McGavin from Counter-Attack) is trying to get him to resume using heroin. Meanwhile, Frankie comes home to his wheelchair-bound wife, Zosha (Eleonora Parker from Escape from Fort Bravo), who manipulates him with a sense of guilt. Frankie was drunk when he got into a car accident, and Zosh was in a wheelchair. Frankie appears with high hopes and a drum set, but Zosh does not see a future for him as a musician and calls for a return to work at Schwiefka. Frankie plans to visit a music company, and one of his own friends, Sparrow (Arnold Stang from “My Sister Aileen”), buys a business suit in a store for Frankie’s department store. After Frankie refuses to work for Schwifck because he is going to meet with music agent Harry Lane (Will Wright from The Wild), Schwifck turns Frank and Sparrow into the police. Meanwhile, Schwifck forces the Brack department store to drop the charges of theft. Costume cost 37 dollars. Frankie agrees to reopen the case for Schweikki, and the hustler rescues him. Shortly thereafter, despite his decision to stop using heroin, Frankie puzzles his head and pays Louis $ 2 for the correction. <br /> <br /> In the end, Frankie meets Harry Lane, and Lane warns him that he catches Frankie shooting at him, that he will have nothing to do with him. What poor Frankie does not know is that Zosh regained his ability to walk, but she uses his guilt for the accident to keep him. Zosh is also jealous of her neighbor downstairs, Molly Novotny (Kim Novak from Picnic), former lover Frankie, who has fun with drinks at a nearby strip bar called the Safari Club. When Zosh complains about the headaches that Frankie gives her on the drum set, Frankie pulls them down to Molly's apartment. Schwifck and Louis are planning a big poker game with Sam Marquette (George E. Stone from “Guys and Dolls”) and Williams (George Matthews from “Shootout at the OK Corral”), two big players who heard about Frank and his legendary “golden arm". Schwifck and Louis coax reluctant Frankie to a deal for $ 250. After an early series of victories, Frankie begins to lose, and he cannot completely change his failure. In fact, Frankie spends about two days chatting. Exhausted, his nerves are frustrated and in desperate need of correction, he falls apart on the second day, and Marquette and Williams catch him for treason. Louis refuses to give Frankie a fix, so Frankie knocks him out and searches his apartment for heroin. <br /> <br /> Preminger doesn’t hit the man with the golden hand, and the film is pretty disappointing. None of the characters here are remotely sympathetic. In fact, they are either hype or hype. Sinatra gives another dynamite show, like McGavin and Parker. Of course, “The Man with the Golden Hand” has lost a significant part of its influence over the past 50 years or more, but is still considered a significant film.
