In many ways, Stu Ungar was not a very good guy. He spat on dealers, set up people to whom he owed money, and was offended. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers may prefer to embellish a man, turning him into a sports hero, who will win, despite the adversity. But the High Roller does not. And this is a difficult row for a hoe. <br /> <br /> Instead, we need to look very VERY carefully to see a man who has not matured, who has passed by a frightened little boy from the streets of New York, despite all his successes. And the only real approval that he ever receives is death itself. Very brave (because people won't get it) and very touching (when you do it). <br /> <br /> What is still bold is the use of the feeling of Scorsese. “Aha! Like a derivative, ”people will say. Indeed? But there is practically no violence. And Stuey loved gangster movies. Maybe the feeling reflects the person Stu, not the director Marty? And if this is really a low-budget movie and it looks so good, bravo! <br /> <br /> Finally, the linear structure of the flashback. Wow, it will be clogged. However, it not only works, it works exceptionally well, even for those who do not see the connection with the Seventh Seal. (Proof: In SS, Knight plays chess with death: in HR, Stui says: “We can play cards for the hand, you know” ... Death says: “I never play cards very well”.) <br /> <br /> No tricky effects or camera movements. No shaky cam. Nothing fancy at all. Just a hard, tough story. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this makes the film too simple and somehow flawed. But then again, boyfriend too. And that makes it almost right. <br /> <br /> 9/10
