Darr was a Super Hit movie that many nations loved. It tells the story of the innocent obsession of Shah Rukh Khans Juhi, who loves Sunny Deol. Honestly, it was an entertaining film, but if you look closely, itâ€™s not very realistic. Shah Rukh Khan continues to call Juhi and tells her that he loves her too. He advertises in college that he loves her, and gives her pleasant surprises, such as beautiful pictures of her. Unfortunately, instead of being flattered that the boy loves her too, she is very, very scared. I personally know hundreds of people that someone plays, and these people like it because they play for a long time. Yash Chopra gives us a good film that entertains, mainly due to the character of Shah Rukh Khan. Sunny Deol is believed to be the main actor, but Darr belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who provides an excellent performance. Shah Rukh Khan is literally the villain of the film, but I would be happy if he got a girl, because he loves her so dearly. Sunny Deol demonstrates a decent performance, but he beats all these guys himself and endures a brutal attack with a knife. Juhi Chawla is good as always in pretty good performance. A few good songs, including Tou Samne, are the best.
