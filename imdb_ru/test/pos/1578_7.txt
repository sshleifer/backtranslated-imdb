Kazuo Komizuu again impresses with the "Internals of a beautiful woman", a continuation of the "Internals of the Virgin". This time, the story is based on the psychologist (Megumi Ozawa), who decides to take on the Yakuza, in order to avenge the suicide of a doped and raped patient, who once finds himself at her doorstep. When she overcomes her head and the yakuza captures her, she recognizes their insidious platform of doping girls and selling them into slavery. This obviously ends badly when she overdoses from cocaine. But she soon teamed up with another body to get rid of him, to become "doom, doom, doom" "Super Slime Hermaphrodite Zord"! Is he, is she = does yakuza minced meat and saves the day ?? Not really. <br /> <br /> Well, this is better than the "Internals of the Virgin", but not much. Most of the film (a whopping 67 minutes) consists of rape and sweating sex and the usual Hochmaks. Almost to the end, we finally got to work with a bloody rhythm with a few cool episodes (for example, an alien-inspired monster penis in a scene with stomach and suffocation), but he still suffers from a hyperbolic feeling that makes him funny but may not raise it from the z-grade horror soft fare.
