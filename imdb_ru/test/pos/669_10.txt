The irony was that there was so much fuss around because the whole point of the program was to highlight how the media treat such “forbidden” topics as pedophilia. a set of news, costumes, self-satisfied presenters, people on the stage, screaming about things you can see behind them, meaningless graphs and cgi statistics, it was all satire, a very very fun satire. the way that c-list celebrities will say absolutely everything if their agent tells them that it will be good for their career (“there is no evidence of this, but this is a scientific fact”). It can be difficult to watch (with Millie Dowler and the girls from Cambridgeshire, as well as 9/11), but the satire must be difficult and we should not be afraid to resist the blatant intimidating and exciting headlines of the media, just because it is a delicate matter. How this show has not received any television awards for its intelligence, observation, courage, acting and provocation of thinking is shameful, but, as you will see, it will show you that not a bit surprising.
