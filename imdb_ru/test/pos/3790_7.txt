Celebrities in the film tried to play a role in the hostilities, and Charlie Chaplin was no exception. This patriotic and propaganda picture is part of his contribution, although by the time it was released, the war was almost over. The tramp goes to war, commits acts of heroism with humor and kicks Kaiser in the ass. This is a very funny movie, although I do not consider it one of the best. It was “Dog Life” that became the best outlet for First National, before it made its early masterpiece “The Kid”. These are his first three reellers that contain steady, more complex jokes than he usually could arrange in his double-drum shorts on Mutual. <br /> <br /> It may be difficult to balance the pre-war message with the farce of the antics and the burlesque scenes at the front, but no one would have thought that they were watching the Shoulder Arms. In many respects, it is also preferable to “more serious” dramatic work with a similar message, such as Griffith’s “Heart of the World.” By this time, Chaplin had become a true virtuoso of screen comedy; he makes it look effortless. By now, he knew very well that a film with fewer jokes — with more elaboration, refinement, and careful timing — could be better than any crazy key-type farce with a dozen failures per minute. The sequence in which Chaplin is disguised as a tree is a relevant example. Even with raging wars, Chaplin can lift the spirits of millions of people.
