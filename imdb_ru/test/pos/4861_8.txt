At first they came for the Communists, but I did not speak, because I was not a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak, because I was not a Jew. Then they came for the Catholics, but I did not speak, because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and by that time there was no one to speak for me. <br /> <br /> Attributed to Rev. Martin Nimoller, 1945 <br /> <br /> When faced with intolerance or injustice, the simplest thing you can do is not to say anything, and you risk becoming the object of contempt. But when does it get enough too much? Global anti-Semitic sentiments allowed Hitler’s genocide policy to flourish, and equal doses of fear and ignorance allowed McCarthy anti-communist purges to destroy the lives of thousands of people. Inaction makes a person no less guilty. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman is a human chameleon: quiet and inconspicuous, he harmoniously fits in with his surroundings. Lawrence does not like to interfere - when he witnesses an attack on a young woman, he does not tell anyone and goes about his business. His world turns into chaos when he buys glasses, and he is mistaken for one of them. Lawrence's view of the world and his view of him changed forever. <br /> <br /> Although the theme of this film is not new, its presentation is definitely unique. It is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice when they are in a certain context - Lawrence is more concerned about the assumptions that he is a Jew than the opinions of his attackers. He believes that if he corrects this “oversight,” then everything will be fine, not realizing that logic and prejudice never go together. <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether he plays an affair (the only thing I like about Fargo) or the sheriff of a nice guy, the role of William H. Macy is tied to a common flow - his characters share a thin, deliberate face which gives them substance. Macy nails Lawrence to the smallest detail and speaks with a sneaky look or trembling voice more than a dialogue page. Showing, rather than telling, Lawrence can share her fear and bewilderment with the viewer. The auxiliary cast combines the story. <br /> <br /> Laura Sod is irresistible as Gertie, Lawrence's wife with a blowjob past. The fleet of trailers is rough, but on the other hand, he also felt the anger of prejudice as a result of an “error” and unwittingly aggravates Lawrence's situation. Michael Lee Aday (aka "Meatloaf") is as terrible as Fred, the prototype of a village goon, equal equality of ignorance and poison, uniting the neighbors with his evil deed. In the midst of chaos lies Finklstein (David Peymer), the center of aggression and the voice of reason, which raises important questions. Even the image of Paymer does not allow Finklestein to become a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to evoke sympathy, which makes him one of the most powerful performances in the film. <br /> <br /> Close editing and cropping of cinematography makes a clean picture with a small amount of distraction, and mixes the atmosphere of claustrophobia with the feeling of a small US town - this is both comforting and alarming. The deliberate use of harsh two-color lighting to highlight the ominous aspects of the piece and the elaborate soundtrack are powerful, but not overwhelming. Finally, the scenery and costumes recreate the feeling of an era that is an integral part of the film’s message. <br /> <br /> The unusual focus approach on prejudice is reason enough to recommend this film. Just consider the excellent story, solid game and the appearance of the film as additional bonuses.
