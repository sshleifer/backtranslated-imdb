Hello; I just wanted to say how much I liked your feedback and comments about this excellent film “The Intruder in the Dust.” I believe that the comments you made were insightful, clever and fully justified. It is also a pity that this film is hardly ever shown on TV and that it is not on DVD-2 - I live in England. Thanks again for your feedback. Actor Juano Hernandez starred in another brilliant film Young Man with a Horn, which also starred Kirk Douglas and Lauren Bacall. It was a very memorable and stylish film with great music. I would like someone with influence to release entire back-catalogs of films such as Johnny Belind, I Remember Mom and Yearling on DVD Region 2, we love these films in the UK I am not of retirement age, I am still young enough and my family and I love classic films !! films like they were made so beautiful and they bring back beautiful memories. anyway...! Many thanks for your comments!
