Colonel Chaber - one of the best adaptations from the novel to the screen, which I saw in the movies. It combines the realism of French cinema with excellent characteristics: from the lost Chaber Depardieu to the proud lawyer Fabrice Lucini and the complex widow Fanny Ardant. The film has a remarkable dimension, as you would expect from a famous filmmaker such as Yves Angelo. Characters keep this movie in motion and, although at the beginning it is a little slow, it is gaining momentum and is a good movie by the time it reaches the finish line.
