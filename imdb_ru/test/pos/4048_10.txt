I probably watched the movie 4 or 5 times. Each time, I am increasingly amazed at how far the desire of the young heart can go, as well as the strength of Kai and Hertha in the struggle for what they believe. <br /> <br /> And this whole story Presented this way, you just go into the plot and before you know it, you are there. You can see ... yes, there is Kai ... working hard on a mirror ... jumping a little ... there is Hertha fighting for her love ..... and there is the Snow Queen ... <br /> <br This is just a wonderful mixture of love, adventure, tension. <br /> <br /> this is great 10 out of 10
