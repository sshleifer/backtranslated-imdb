Five medical students (Kevin Bacon, David Labracchio; William Baldwin, Dr. Joe Hurley; Oliver Platt, Randy Glass; Julia Roberts, Dr. Rachel Mannus; Kiefer Sutherland, Nelson) Experimenting with Underground Events of Death and Afterlife, (re) Searching for medical and personal education. One by one, each medical student's heart stops and then is reborn. <br /> <br /> Under the spells of temporary death, each one has strange visions, including forgotten childhood memories. Their memories are like children's nightmares. Revived students are alarmed, recalling the sad actions they have committed or committed against them. As they experience the afterlife, they bring back real life experience back to the present. As they continue to experiment, their memories intensify dramatically; yes so, some are physically overcome. Thus, they explore and penetrate deeper into the experience of death after death, trying to find a cure. <br /> <br /> Although the DVD was released in 2007, this film was released in 1990. Therefore, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland were in the early stages of their adult acting career. In addition to an incredibly intriguing plot, an incredible climax in a tense atmosphere and a tense and convincing script, all young actors make "Flatliners", which is now a cult semi-scientific adventure for all the stars. Who knew 17 years ago that the career of a film of this young group of actors would soar to the skies? I suspect that director Joel Schumacher did.
