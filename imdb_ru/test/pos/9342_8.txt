Thriller Michael Jackson (1983) must be the greatest video, ever made. Dude, you have zombies, blood and a catchy tune, what more can you ask for. John Landis mixed elements from the Night of the Living Dead and the American werewolf in London, and this video came out. What begins as a pleasant evening for a young couple literally turns into a date from hell. You have dancing zombies, a werewolf in a funky jacket and Vincent Price "rap." Funny video for the song, which all noted in the neighborhood. <br /> <br /> I have to give this high recommendation because it must be the best music video ever made. This have not happened before. <br /> <br /> Check out the creation of a thriller. The documentary has "interesting" things.
