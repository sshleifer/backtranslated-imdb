Samuel Fuller knows the war and is one of the few directors in the history of American cinema who could accurately depict horrific experiences in such a form as a movie. His pessimism and idealism, if it sounds a bit strange, mix them together, work for him as a storyteller, and at the same time he always seeks to tell the truth, no matter how fierce (or in the form of melodramatic constructions) it turns out. Verboten, however, deals with the post-war experience, as we only in the first scenes get a big boom of war, highlighted in bold type for a point. The first shot looks like one big exclamation mark, which seems to continue in the rest of the scene: a dead soldier on the ground, the camera rises, we see another soldier shot down in a war-torn area. Simple, straightforward language. Then Fuller accentuates the intensity with something interesting: the title song, played in the opening credits like irony and sincerity, and then Beethoven’s music in a shootout between Americans and Nazis. Sergeant David Brent (James Best) is shot, the battle goes on, and then he goes to him, who is being treated for his wounds. <br /> <br /> This may lead to the fact that it will be a somewhat ordinary film of the Second World War. (something like what Beethoven is usually not found, and then Wagner, to some extent, was placed in these images), but this is not so. Instead, Fuller makes this film “Homecoming,” though not at all in the sense that “this soldier is returning home wounded, and so on and so forth.” Instead of truly returning home, Brent is staying in Germany, as he fell on his heels for a woman, Helga (Susan Cummings, does a pretty good German accent) and wants to work in the army to a lesser degree, so he can marry on it. What he doesn’t understand is that a) she wants him to get more money so she can get food for herself and her brother, however it becomes difficult emotionally at the moment of revelation to the slightly naive but sincere Brent, and b) Hitler’s youth sect called the Werewolves who want to start right away where Hitler ended - starting small, despite disputes within the group - attacking the government itself, which is now built into Germany, to give them, as Brent describes, “transfusion blood. " “With this, plus cadres from lawsuits in Nuremberg, and (as I think told by Fuller himself) the fast and trouble-free history of Nazi war crimes piecemeal, we get a multi-faceted view of society in the dire situation of immediate post-war situation. While Rossellini coped with it in his own way with the “Zero Year in Germany”, Fuller examines it in layers: first, it’s a love story, or what is the tragic fall of a man who sees nothing, except that which, in his opinion, should be reasonable that about his wife and child on the way that he cannot leave until the revelation that he (partially) was deceived. Baker and Cummings, along with Harold Day, the young, bewildered brother of Helga, show the utmost detail of emotion; very simple parts of a B-movie, although they could be like that, then another layer is political, the society’s struggle to fight conquest, and the mentality that, from Fuller’s point of view, becomes sensational to make the Nazis absolutely useless: they are evil especially when they eliminate the cause for I achieve my goals. <br /> <br /> And finally, there is a layer of style that absorbs in a strange way. This is probably one of Fuller's “most talkative” films, and this is not bad, considering that this is one of his best scenarios, as the characters do not speak simply or in too many platitudes (except for a small scene where two characters talk about youth Hitler as juvenile offenders, which, according to Fuller's autobiography, is probably another layer that should be considered in the subtext and in the films of the 50s). And Fuller takes it almost in true European style when he is not going into battle or battle scenes, since editing is not always very fast, and sometimes the reduction does not occur for a full minute or longer. Because of this, there is a strange tension, especially when the character says something else with wild eyes or suspiciously; Fuller could easily go to a large close-up, but there is a more sinister, cold quality, so as not to depart from two people in a conversation without a simple deal over his shoulder. But when this is required, for example, a big fight outside the US military office, or shots from Nuremberg, captured in the memories of Franz about werewolves, Fuller can be just as amazing stylist as always. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to find, but it is worth it if you like directors or films about World War II in Germany - or even just history buffs - Verboten! it is an intellectual experience and a strong emotional one, with an actor cast that is better than expected from a B-film and an attitude towards the “other” that is equally damned and makes you think.
