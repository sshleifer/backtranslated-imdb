Being from the eastern part of Pennsylvania, right on the border with Northern New Jersey, I still feel that this is a documentary rather than a movie. I have friends from New York and New Jersey, and this film represents the lifestyle that “still” exists today in low-income areas outside the big city lifestyle. If you have not seen this movie and have never thought about what is REALLY happening in the urban jungle, watch this movie. No really loud actors, as if they just pulled these guys from the street and said that the act, which adds to the realism of the film, FANTASTIC performances, nevertheless! WATCH THIS FILM!
