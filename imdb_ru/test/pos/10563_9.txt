The story was well prepared and interesting in itself. However, it is difficult for me to write a review of this film without spoiling you. To avoid this, I am not going to tell this story here. <br /> <br /> I think this film is a good adaptation of the book by Sarah Water compared to the previous book “Velvet Tip”. I read a book first, and then I watched a DVD. The film retained most of the moods of the main characters of the book. Of course, due to lack of time, the film in the last 30 minutes seemed to be in a hurry to cover part III of the book. Therefore, it could not well illustrate the scene when they all met in the kitchen of Mr. Ibbs’s house and those who were after this (even the book seemed to me in a hurry in this kitchen). Despite this, the film did a good job presenting the story. It is really worth seeing. It is unclear when BBC-America will be able to broadcast this film. This is a pity. <br /> <br /> PS: I noticed that the ages of Maude and Sue in the book were set 20-21 instead of 17-18; the latter is more reasonable, while the first is closer to the age of actresses.
