The youth in us is the perfect stone. I saw this amazing short film this year at the 2005 Sundance Festival. This story led me to a deep transformative journey. Director Joshua Leonard, actors Kelly Garner and Lukas Haas, artistic direction, cinematography, musical score - each element was believable. One can only hope that this exquisite and painful film is a prelude to the greater work of this talented director. <br /> <br /> Just as before the screening of the short film at Sundance, commercial cinemas used past times in a similar format. It would be great if miniature masterpieces, such as Youth in Us, could thus cover wide audience.
