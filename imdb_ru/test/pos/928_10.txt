In the "fools" section for this film there is a comment that there is an error in continuity when Auguste's car is apparently parked in a different place than in the previous frame in the same scene. This is not true. One of them opens from Auguste’s apartment, the other from Valentina’s apartment across the street. The whole purpose of this segment is to show how Valentine and Auguste - which can be made for each other - almost intersect (as it happens several times), but never do that until circumstances leave them together on the ferry at the end film. (And here it is implied that Joseph manipulated things so that Auguste is on this ferry, checking the ticket to Valentina to see which sailboat she booked on.)
