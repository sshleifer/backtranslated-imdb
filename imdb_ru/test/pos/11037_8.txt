If you are very sensitive to extreme racial stereotypes, this cartoon is not for you. But if you are very interested to see a rare fragment of wartime animation, come in! <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Popeye patrols the sea and discovers what looks like a Japanese fishing boat. Two Japanese fishermen make Pope think they want to sign a peace treaty. But appearances can be deceiving; The fishing boat turns out to be a Japanese warship! What follows is considered propaganda today, promoting the strengthening of morale. <br /> <br /> Be careful, the representation of the Japanese in the film is made in vile spirits. Keep in mind, however, that at that time there was war. But I highly recommend this cartoon to those interested in the era of the Second World War.
