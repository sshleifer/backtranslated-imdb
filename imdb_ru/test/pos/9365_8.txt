A brilliant thriller that deserved much more fame, Mitchum and Ryan are awesome in their lead roles, as are all the supporting cast. A truly spectacular film "Noir" with wonderful images and a great dialogue, based on a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on a novel about homophobia, this film attacks post-war anti-emitism and all intolerance and hatred with considerable force. Although the pieces may seem a bit attractive to the modern audience, they still have the ability to shock and work very well as a thriller. Credit to all involved.
