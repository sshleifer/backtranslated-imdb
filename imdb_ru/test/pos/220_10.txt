At the end of 1958, in the episode "M Squad" you will see Lee Marvin, who plays Lieutenant-Detective Frank Ballinger, gets out of the car, and then shoots him, and he shoots back, the beginning of the police squad is basically the same (including Jazz music), and then Lee Marvin talks about what's going on (I'm Lieutenant Detective Frank Ballinger, M Squad, Chicago Special Police Department) and in the police squad Leslie Nilsen does the same (Im Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Squad special unit of the Police Department) and ak further, in one of the M Squad episodes even have male character, Johnny, and in an episode of M Squad, entitled "A more deadly," there is an episode Police Squad, entitled "A significant gift (Broken"). I promise) "This is the same story!
