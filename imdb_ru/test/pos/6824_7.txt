The problem with the film is quite simple: Conrad's prose is very verbose and cannot be adapted to the film. Marlow's narration in the novel draws you from the first sentence, and you only "see" what Conrad writes about. In the film, everything is different, you see the visual, but the description and reflection that really makes the novel is terribly absent. But since the unadapted book was adapted, it meets good standards. There are exactly the same scenes that are fairly well defined, but they never have the same effect as in the novel. The plot in the film has been improved and it works very well to make it more interesting. References to Ancient Egypt were thoughtfully inserted. My advice, read the book and keep up the good work, there are the best films.
