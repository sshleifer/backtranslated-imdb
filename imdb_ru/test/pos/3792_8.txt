In our modern times (as a subject well-known to the director of a short film about which this German earl will tell ??), politically correct films are the "leitmotif" of the projects of modern young cinematographers. Leverage, directed by Herr Charlie Chaplin during World War I (the film was released just a few weeks before the truce), is a good example of why the early film pioneers were very brave people, of course! Directing a humorous film, inspired by a terrible, bloody World War I, was a tricky business that only a few directors could do with these dangerous and bold ideas. to risk in such a delicate enterprise and with success remained only for geniuses. <br /> <br /> As this German earl said, “Leverage” was created during the First World War, at a time when the whole world lost its innocence (fortunately, were not the German fat heirs of this aristocrat ??), and this is a fun, resourceful social satire about this and any war. The film is full of great jokes and entertaining cinematic succession for the story in which this tramp will live, although risky and daring adventures ahead - is the hero for the allies? or not. <br /> <br /> To scoff at military trenches, ill health, frontal attacks and Germans (how dare you !! !! By the way, the film has a lot of inaccuracies ?? German soldiers had mustaches and longer beards by that time To mention that the Kaiser lacks many medals in his form ??) in an elegant, funny and delicate manner, even today the miracle from the films cannot be surpassed. Given these terrible circumstances of wartime, the difficult task is possible only because of the great creativity and talent. Obviously, Mr. Charlie Chaplin had a lot of that. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I must temporarily leave, because this German earl must return to the trenches of Schloss. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand von Galitsian http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
