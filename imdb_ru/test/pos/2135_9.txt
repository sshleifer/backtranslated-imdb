Therefore, many of us who are devoted to the “art” of cinema do not pay attention or forget that films are also business. Most of the time they are too expensive to produce anything else. In the light of this, it often seems to me a miracle that they did great things from time to time. From time to time filmmakers have gone too far into the budget, creating a film that businessmen responsible for financing an enterprise will be seriously hurt financially and, of course, will get very angry about it. I would like to know exactly how this happens, which often led to the fact that both the major studios and some of the major critics “shot” the picture when it was finally released. Terrible expectations arise, and often people expect to see what they see, what they see. <br /> <br /> You can see this phenomenon in action in an imperfect, but magnificent 62nd, recreating the rebellion on “Bounty”, and you can definitely see it in the reaction to “Heaven's Gate”. Cimino took too much time and cost United Artists to create this painting. The company was mortally wounded by its excesses, and, no doubt, powerful people wanted to see how its reputation was forever corrupted when this strange, gigantic epic was finally released. There are always a lot of movie lovers who don’t like long, weighty pictures. The storytelling in this film is not achieved with great savings or a fast pace. Like Stanley Kubrick, Cimino often prefers not to indicate the specific statement he makes with a given scene. Rather, he draws it in such a way that the viewer feels that he is currently living, giving time to his own imagination for deep participation in what is presented. Many people do not respond well to this approach. They want the story to move quickly and clearly, and they easily become impatient and embarrassed by such a film. These factors undoubtedly contributed to the failure of the “Gate of Heavens” box office. <br /> <br /> By nature, editor of the film, I am deeply disappointed with two problems with this film. From time to time, the scene is clearly too long, and it could easily be cut without compromising its effectiveness. Then we come to the massive, drawn-out battle scenes at the end of the picture. As for this, the clarity of the story is really broken. If you liked the movie before it happens, your understanding of what should be happening will probably become unclear, and this is really disappointing. Without seeing all the rough footage, I cannot say whether actual re-filming would be necessary, or whether some of the critical plot elements could be clarified by carefully re-editing some points. Given the time and money that was invested in this picture, this problem should have been given more attention and thought. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, sometimes a weak game, a dialogue that does not sound believable, but these are really minor problems. The reason why I am so concerned about the above problems is that, like many other days, I also feel that all the “Gates of Heaven” are so wonderful to contemplate and so perfectly versed with the main historical, political and sociological problems that This is only a masterpiece. Despite its shortcomings, it is so impressive and visually powerful that it stands head and shoulders above most other Hollywood films I've ever seen. I would like to re-mix a lot of sound. I would like to redirect and re-edit the scene where Ella is killed, but the greatness of this picture is such that these considerations really become trivial compared to the cost of the entire production. I must add that he must always be seen on a huge wide screen in order to achieve the magnificent effect that he is able to provide.
