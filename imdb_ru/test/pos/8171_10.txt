I really like this movie: music, film, acting, history and all the Mormon cliches. The fact that they are clich√© does not mean that they are not true! It's not perfect, it's a movie after all. Although excommunications are conducted in well-lit rooms with nice large tables and chairs, it was perfectly appropriate to portray this as a dark, cold scene that they did in this film. I also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop and smoking a cigarette. I thought it was so cool. I mean, I believe angels are watching over us. What to do while waiting? Smoking is the way some people spend their time waiting. I loved the irony because the Mormons made such a smoking deal. I saw this movie 7 times in theaters in Salt Lake City, and cried every time! It takes me away. And I watched it 3 times on the video now, and it still makes me cry every time. I would take the chance to see it again on the big screen. I hope that the Tower Theater in Salt Lake City will regularly return it during general conference as a cult movie (pun intended, but no offense).
