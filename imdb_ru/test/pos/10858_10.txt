I think Andrew Davis did a wonderful job of taking a great book that imitated the rhythm and style of a Victorian novel, and turned it into a fascinating and interesting film. I am glad that I read (twice) the book in the first place, which usually happens to me. I know that you need to treat the novel and the film as different media and judge them accordingly. But, nevertheless, it is often difficult to read the original material after the film distributes the best parts. <br /> <br /> I understand that Davis is a very good adapter, but I would like the producers to choose a woman to write the script. Davis, as he admits in the commentary accompanying the film on DVD, wanted to emphasize the scatological nuances in the book. Of course, I enjoyed it, on film as in a book. But Davis missed half a dozen moments that are so painfully, painfully tender that he could turn on if his sensitivity was more feminine. <br /> <br /> I would also disagree with the fact that he used the main symbol of the book - the rose. <br /> <br /> Since the script was written by Davis, the outcome was inevitable and appropriate. But I really think that the last nod of the author Waters on the symbol of the rose was much more interesting. And I preferred the novel to allow Nan to "come of age" than the one that Davis chose. <br /> <br /> One quick comment about the four actors who write the main roles. All of them are amazingly talented - well, except for singing and dancing, perhaps - and, besides, their physical presence is so much that they see the mind reading a novel before watching a movie. I thought they were all awesome. <br /> <br /> I recommend to all lesbians and everyone who loves good fiction, to add a BOTH book and DVD “HEADPHONES” to their bookshelves.
