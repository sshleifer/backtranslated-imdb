The only way to truly understand the characters in this film and to communicate with them is to experience the situation yourself. For many people, this film is almost biographical, a kind of snapshot of one of the weekends in our life. (I did about 85 percent of the things in this film and witnessed the other 15 percent, usually all that weekend). For me and others, I know that it would be nice to have this film to look back, because apart from a few pictures about people that we kind of remember, and evenings that are stained and blurred, this film is our generation Studio 54 ", the part that can be added to our notes to look back and smile. Personally, I am glad that these days are gone, but it's great to watch this film and say: “I remember when .........”. Thank you, Justin, for making this biography over the weekend in my life.
