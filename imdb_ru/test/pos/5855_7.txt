Cassie (Sandra Bullock) is a very serious police detective. Since the ex-boyfriend once tried to kill her and, indeed, left her seriously injured, she is determined to bring to justice those who harm others. As a result of his almost deadly experience, Cassie also prefers ephemera and trusts no one. Once a woman was found dead in a forest near the Cassie community. She was brutally murdered, severely beaten and left to die alone. Naturally, Cassie will stop at nothing to find the killers. An employee Sam (Ben Chaplin) is assigned to help her. Soon he discovers Cassieâ€™s tireless attitude and all-consuming instincts when she asks him to take a sample of the vomit that was left in place for analysis, among other actions. The trail soon leads them to two high school students, Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt). Can these adolescents really be responsible for planning and executing a perfect "joyful" murder? This is an intriguing film, but viewers should be warned that the topic is really dark. Murder for the sake of "sport" is rarely the theme of films that differ in the variety of "all sweet and easy," and this one is no different. However, the cast is great. Bullock, without a hint of her talent for comedy, is terrific as a police officer, whose own past makes her bar the evil people of the world. Chaplin is also good as a detective, who is attracted and repelled by the powerful Cassie. As for Gosling, he gives the most memorable presentation as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul. Production figures for the film are also good, with correspondingly good costumes, settings and photography. If you are a fan of Bullock looking for laughter, this is not the one you need. But, if you adore riddles, even those that are the darkest of all the plots, you will find this story exciting.
