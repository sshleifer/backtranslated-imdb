It is really quite simple. The name of the film is “The Death Bed”, “The Bed That Eats”. If you are like me, you already know if you will like this movie. I stumbled upon this gem at Best Buy the other day and took it for ten bucks. From the title, I got pleasure for ten bucks, and only for the box. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of B-movies. This, in my opinion, is one of the best B-films I've ever seen. Now, this is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not even for most people. In fact, I suspect that they will be just a few of us who truly enjoy this film. <br /> <br /> For those of you who love films “B”, this film is a rough diamond, He has an excellent premise, Bed ... People eat. He does not walk, he does not move, he does not have a siren to attract people. It largely depends on the people who roam and sit on it. <br /> <br /> I liked every inch of this film, and I had already seen it three times in the meager weeks I owned. <br /> <As I said, after reading the title of the film, you already know if you will like it. If you are laughing or smiling, then try. it's worth it.
