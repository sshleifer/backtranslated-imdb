Along with minor flaws, this film is a masterpiece and, of course, the best war movie I have seen. Not to mention that this is one of the best films I have seen in all genres. I could have written this for No Man's Land before, but now I think this is better. This is VERY sad in the final, and I almost cried after two shocking scenes that appeared within 5 minutes closer to the final of the film. <br /> <br /> Karel's performance in the role of the main character was exciting, although he must be a novice, considering his age. This film makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least brings you closer to it) and hates any war and political life. Memories of a prison hospital make the film even more delightful. <br /> <br /> One tiny film flaw is not the British accents of supposedly British people. Most British people on the screen were actually English, but what about those who should be British and speak with a foreign accent? It really didn't fit into this amazing movie. But this is almost the only flaw I noticed. The effects may also be a little better, but again, we all remember many films from one particular country that have a stunning effect and absolutely nothing else. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is a real masterpiece, and everyone should see it. If you want to go to Czechoslovakia of the 40s, and if you want to virtually watch a huge amount of emotions at the same time, this film is for you. If you don't want to do this, this movie will make you want to do it.
