Thriller remains the greatest promo of pop music with a plot, great visual effects and a great song to wrap the movie around. Michael Jackson was at the top of the tree at that time (and not so much changed in his plastic surgery regime that it would matter). Here he is in good shape - the song is amazing, he leads the zombies in dance like no other. <br /> <br /> Ola Ray plays with a girl who looks with disbelief as her cute boyfriend (Jackson, of course) turns into a werewolf! Then, under the pulsing rhythms of the opening line, “It is already close to midnight,” he stomps around the cemetery with other zombies and creatures of the night. <br /> <br /> The culmination of all this is the fruity voice of the Great Horror Star Vincent Price says in the middle of the recording. Awesome
