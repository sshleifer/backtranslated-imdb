15 Park Avenue, well, the name is initially mysterious is the address from New York and the film, which is being shot in Calcutta. However, when the story unfolds, you can understand the fine line that the director is trying to pass between relationships, social affairs and, of course, the world of schizophrenia. I would say that Aparna Sen is one of the directors who can say much more, and he has so little time. Well, without a doubt, she managed to make a good movie. In a sense, it makes us realize that each of us is probably looking for our own “15 Park Avenue”. An endless search in each of us ... <br /> <br /> A powerful performance from Shaban Azmi is a pleasure worth seeing. Her presence on the screen brings a lot of life to the scene. Indeed, it was amazing to see her in such a powerful act after a long time, because I expected it to be the whole area of ​​Konkona Sen. Shabana makes you feel deeply older sister who leads the whole show for a rather unsuccessful family, and at this time she almost forgets to live her own life. She burdens all her ambitions and desires with a sick 18-year-old younger sister (who looks more like a daughter to her) and an aging mother played by veteran Vahida Rehman. As for the leading actress from the Guide (this is how I can remember her instantly), then there is almost nothing to say, except for a few lines and tears here and there. Always reliable, Rahul Bose plays another key role in the film, he shows the emotions of a middle-aged man with a repentant face of near-perfection. This man really amazes me with the diversity of his work. From a musician in Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim in Mr. & Mrs. Iyer and many others. He is one station wagon, and I would really like him to have a few more shots in the first part of the film. Cameo in the film - Shefali Shah (remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding). She looks very beautiful and very easily depicts the role of the mother of two children. She gives you an idea of ​​the modern Indian woman, who is modern in approach, but still common when it comes to her husband's previous relationship. <br /> <br /> Mithi, pictured as Konkonoy, was in focus of the camera. She and her schizophrenic world make up the core of 15 Park Avenue. She really worked a lot for the character, but there are times when she can't communicate with the audience. The fateful accident of her life tries to sympathize, and she was only partially successful. <br /> <br /> The film tells about several things at once, starting with the unique world of the disabled and ending with the unequal status of a woman even in modern modern India, as well as perverse relationships in a battered family. And I believe that Aparna has succeeded to a certain extent. Mithi's helplessness when she works as a journalist in a rural eastern state really gives us a complete picture of the country of which we are so proud. <br /> <br /> After I finished 15 Park Avenue, a feeling of insatiable thirst appeared in me. I wanted more from this film to emotionally shower me. It was a commendable effort on the part of the director, with the exception of a few hiccups. We must look to all those who like to watch another cinema, something with a strong goal.
