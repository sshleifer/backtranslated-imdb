When I watched this movie, I had no idea what it was about, and I had never heard of it before. But I must say that I was positively surprised. The first few minutes - almost the funniest of the whole movie. The clerk from India is just ridiculous! In any case, the story is not too big to talk about, but I think everything is in order. On the other hand, the acting is pretty good, and yet the only actor I recognized was Mickey Rourke, who was not in the film until the very end. And in the end, where the shutdown, I think it is not bad, but I do not feel that it really ends. I feel there must have been more. The final battle in some way. I dont know. In general, it was a good movie, and I recommend it to everyone in films like Tarantino with a bunch of violence and dark, sinister humor! I rate it 7/10.
