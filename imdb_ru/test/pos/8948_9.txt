I saw it in the preview, and it seems that it was not released in the USA. However, it was one of the most enjoyable little comedies. This concerns the competition between two funeral homes in a small British town. The plot of [the film] goes out of control in the third act, but the characters are very pleasant and memorable. <br /> <br /> The acting is great. Of course, this film is worth seeing if you lose sight of it. I know that I will try to catch it again in cinemas and / or buy a video.
