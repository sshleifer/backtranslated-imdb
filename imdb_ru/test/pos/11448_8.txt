The eighties created many horrible little horror films, most of which were in the slasher genre - thus putting this film in first place compared to the rest. "Night of the Demons" - something between the film "The Evil Dead"; and a haunted house, sperm and tears. Hell night. In films like this, the usually crazy / deformed crazy plays the main role of the bad guy; but here we have bloodthirsty demons who are always more interesting than crazy ones if you ask me. There are also many comedies in this film, and the first third of the film can easily be tuned to a direct comedic film. But as soon as the characters get to the center; an ominous funeral home, known as "House of Hull" - the film turns into a horror movie that one would expect if you give it a name. The plot line is as simple as you expect, and weâ€™ll follow the group of children who decide to have a Halloween party inside the funeral home. However, this turns out to be a bad idea as soon as it turns out that the house is possessed; and the demons begin to inhabit the bodies of children! Their only salvation lies on the other side of the underground stream ... but finding the gate to the site is not as easy as it seems. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is the Gothic mansion, in which the action takes place. This squeaky old house is great for a horror movie; the fact that it was a funeral home adds to that. Directed by Kevin Tenney shoots well at home, and is particularly well done in order to establish the fact that the house is off the beaten path and difficult to escape. The comedy to the beginning of the film is usually very funny, and I hoped that she would continue to laugh as soon as the horror began. The film does have its own comedic moments when children enter Hull House, but this is never too funny, and it is obvious that horror is the main goal of the film. Not that this is a problem; but the Night of the Demons could have been much better if she had correctly connected these elements. The characters are pretty much what you expect from such a movie; but the acting is well suited for the film, and it is clear that the young actors had a good time acting in this film, and this is well broadcast on the screen. The effects are good because they fit the film well, and since most of the death episodes are well executed; This is a good bet that most people will not get tired of watching it. This is not a classic or movie to watch; but I highly recommend it, as it offers a good time and will appeal to lovers of silly horror.
