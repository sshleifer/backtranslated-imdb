Of course, one of the most fun movies of all time. Great original music, smart, intoxicating ... it's hard to talk about something so good.

The lines thrown left and right are classic in their own right, reminding Slapshot, Caddyshack, Anchorman, Repoman, Dolemite, any comedy whose dialogue has no formal diversity. "Putney, Mironex called you tasteless!" “My organization is in favor of integration ...” “Where is Lopez?” “He’s in my head” “They don’t sound brilliant until you hear them in the context of the scene. ... This film will eat your brain, it's too good. I read reviews calling this film racist, which could not be further from the truth. Each scene is golden, from the advertisement of Etherial Cereal to the Brothers In the Black Room collection to this haunting pipe in the final scene. One word is genius.
