One of the longest and strangest short films of Starevich tells about a toy dog ​​in search of an orange after it was revived by a tear of the mother of a girl who craves for an orange. The dog bumps into an orange after it has fallen from the back of the car on the way to the sale, but at night it has to protect the orange when it enters, enters the devil's nightclub with a lot of strange and scary characters. With the help of a stuffed cat, the dog returns an orange to a little girl, and she is saved from the terrible scurvy of death. The talisman has new techniques that I have not seen in the films of Starevich. Adding a sync sound and a mix of live action with motion stop animation makes a new twist in the old Starevich puppet style. Live scenes with moving cars and people passing by when the puppet sits on a concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh. The sounds of cars and the cries of street vendors deserve attention, because the small transitions to sound in the studio were expensive, and the use of Starewicz technology looks like an old hat. New puppet characters in this film - a frightening contribution to the club scene of the devil. Twigs and newspaper scraps come to life. Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs, which hatch skeletons of chicks. Characters come from all sides for clapping, pans and rocking horses. A new editing technique uses a rapid increase, which is achieved by editing, to accelerate the pace of what could have been a slow scene before. Overall, Starewicz can update its filmmaking style to meet the demands of a new audience, which makes this film one of the best examples of its work.
