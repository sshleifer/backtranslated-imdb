Since "Harold and Maude" suicide has not been used as a theme for a love story. The acting is top notch awesome. With a well-structured scenario, everything goes at a pleasant pace. There are moments of black comedy, but I would classify My Suicidal Sweetheart as a unique romantic comedy with a touch of dark humor. The relationship between the two psychologically challenged lovers, both touching and attractive. The film makes you wonder what a normal relationship? I highly recommend "My Suicidal Sweetheart". Look for it on DVD called "Crazy Love". You will not be disappointed. - MERK
