Fantastic movie! Wow is really fun. I can not believe that I discovered such a jewel of the film. <br /> <br /> A pretty young girl, traveling south to Florida, meets a friendly older couple with RV after she has a flat on a rest stop. However, she learns that everything is not as it seems, and the couple becomes a bit creepy after she spends some time with them on the road. <br /> <br /> Everyone in this was just perfect for their roles, you just Guess you are watching how this happens in real life in front of you. <br /> <br /> Newbie Emily Grace did a fantastic job as a very sweet, but somewhat shy, Alice. Emily gives you the feeling that you can understand what she is experiencing, and you can see how she got into the situation that develops in the film. I am sure that in the future we will see Emily in other films. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others have said, the lighting and photography in this room were just perfect. Editing has also been done well - just the right way to collect images of the highway to give you the feeling that you are traveling with the actors on their trip. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this on the big screen, but I can only convince everyone to go out and see it. More movies like this are exactly what we need. <br /> <br /> SF
