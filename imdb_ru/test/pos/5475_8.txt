Wolfgang Peterson directs this thriller in which Clint Eastwood plays secret service agent Frank Horrigan, who combines wit with a clever psycho (John Malkovich) in a cat-and-mouse game with the president. Mitch Leary (Malkovich) is liaising with Horrigan, who has been teasing the agent with discouraging remarks about his abilities, as well as protecting the presidential secret service in the past. Agent Lilly Raines (Rene Rousseau) is trying to keep Horrigan alone; but he is strong in preventing Liri from fulfilling her death threats. Very good FX and fast paced plot support. Eastwood and Malkovich are great. Rousseau has a way to get your attention. Rounding out this strong cast are: Dylan McDermott, Fred Dalton Thompson, John Mahoney and Gary Cole.
