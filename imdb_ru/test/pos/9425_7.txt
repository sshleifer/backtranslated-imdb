This is a great night movie! By this I mean that I really enjoyed reproducing my copy of VHS for $ 3.00 (I now have a copy of the DVD for $ 6.99) many nights before going to bed or if I have insomnia. There is something about this movie that makes it interesting to watch it again. It may be funny that Basil Rathbone in The Secret Weapon wears a few disguises that fool the bad guys and Holmes' assistant Nigel Bruce (Watson), but not the housekeeper (Mary Gordon). This could be espionage, code breaking and the theme of the Second World War. It may even be a light touch, which the director uses to cope with the threatening situations that Holmes found himself in as he continues the story. Whatever it is, the “Secret Weapon” is just a pleasant and pleasant detective story that takes us back to the times when the Nazis were looking for world domination, and does so with the bonus of camaraderie between Watson and Holmes. Whether you agree with the patriotic speeches and noble themes of this film “Save the World” or not (I think they are right!), I believe that they only add taste and fun to this beautiful old adventure film that endures for repeated viewing. I rate this as a pleasant 83/100 points.
