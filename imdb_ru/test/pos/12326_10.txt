John Houston was seriously ill when he made his last achievement, and this is completely his covenant: uncompromising, difficult, a thousand miles from madness and fashion, he will be the best “last movie” you've ever dreamed of. Very strict scenario, no action, no real hero, but a group of people coping with the vanity of life, fleeting years and death. The party does not deceive people for long. Admittedly, warmth and affection emanate from songs and food, complete with turkey and pudding. But over time, Julia’s voice was partly spoiled, the first crackle in the mirror. Then the camera leaves the room where the guests are gathered, and searches the bedroom of an elderly woman. Surely she seems to have had a happy life, but this is a life inexorably coming to an end. At the end of the film, Julia shoots a film about her future deathbed. Maybe an unsatisfied life, because she was left a virgin, without children, to continue. Only some poor things, yellowish photos, bibelotes and trinkets s ... But have all the hopes and dreams of a person come true? Look at gretta. She is a married woman, she is about thirty-five years old, she is still beautiful and healthy, but she knows that something is broken. That Julia is today, she will be tomorrow, so in her stream of consciousness she returns to her past, only to find out how painful her memories are: the young man has committed suicide for her, the symbol of her youth is now fading. The last monologue, if we listen carefully to this, involves all of us in this eternal tragedy, the human condition doomed to failure, the masterful lesson of John Houston.
