Quite an interesting look at some of the characters from Indiaâ€™s growing middle class. Although India is rapidly modernizing, its culture does not keep pace. This film tells about a patriarchal society where women are not truly free citizens. A country of organized marriages, men who fall in love with mistresses with impunity, and women who are expected to endure all this will eventually fail. I was impressed by Nandita Das, who was quite attractive and played her character with complete seriousness. But I was even more impressed with Shabana Azmi, who, as I understand it, is the old game of Bollywood. Her quiet beauty and restrained mental suffering were excellent. The lesbian overtones of this film have never been particularly erotic, and never happen. (Damn!) It is worth looking for those who are interested in completely different cultures.
