Being a pensioner in the field of medicine and health, “a laborer in a vineyard”, I never get tired of watching this film. Paddy Chaiefsky was a friend of my computer teacher in college and visited him and us during several articles back in 1958. His writing skills stood the test of time, and the Hospital is as fresh as it was in 1971. week and still find something new. So many of the auxiliary actors took part in bigger and better roles both in television and in movies. George Scott made only a few comedies, but his time and style are as good as those of Jackie Gleason and Steve Msrtin. Mental humor, not physical / farce every time wins in my book. And yet, a family film with only one, four-letter word throughout the film.
