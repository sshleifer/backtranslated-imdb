When I went to the movies, I expected little. I did not know anything about this film, but it was the only film I could see, because then I was in a small town. So I saw this movie and was fascinated! “La stelle che non c'è” is a trip to a new industrial China, and it shows it honestly! You see most of the time in the ugly places of China, and you see what is really happening with this new industrialization. The main characters are sad, but I hope people. He is a naive Italian guy who cannot believe what he sees. She is a translator from China who misses her son. Sometimes sad, sometimes funny, but poetic every time! Wonderful movie with great actors! So only one star is missing!
