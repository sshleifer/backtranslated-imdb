The performance is thought out to the smallest detail - start with the Rainbow receptionist - and let the audience see the background unfold in his eyes. The film follows the game with great loyalty, working, no doubt, on the simple premise that it could not be improved. Now add lots of superb characters - and the result is a deafening triumph. A definite must-see.
