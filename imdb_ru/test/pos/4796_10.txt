I like the absurd and biting humor of Bunuel’s surrealistic films (for example, The Modest Charm of the Bourgeoisie and The Destroying Angel). Other, earlier works (for example, “Forgotten” about juvenile offenders from a marginal region in Mexico) are more serious and give a strong social signal. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that this is “Nazarin”, which most successfully shoots for the viewer's heart. Although it is true that he is full of irony, nevertheless, he reveals an aspect of Bunuel, who seems to be intrigued by the beauty and solemnity of his spiritual quest. Here, while the director (as a rule) throws countless blows to the Catholic Church, he also seems surprisingly to demonstrate a sense of admiration for genuine Christian thought and its practice of disinterested love. <br /> <br /> “That“ Louis Bunuel shamelessly praises a figure like Jesus ”I always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtue ... that is, until I looked at Nazarin . I appreciate the fact that he satirically exposes the difficulty of following the example of Christ in a society filled with meanness, ignorance and sin; but he also presents the hero, Nazario's father, as a real beacon of light in the sea of ​​darkness. Without a doubt, by the end of the film I was looking at him, not at him! <br /> <br /> Some argue that Nazario’s father’s doubts about his faith point to the loss of his holy values. (Alas, if he cannot do good in this world, who can?) But I would say that this “flaw”, his disappointment, makes his character even more heroic, because he shows how much he is human and how complicated his the struggle inside should be. And who said that a priest cannot finally get out of this “dark night” and regain his confidence? Perhaps we were only presented with the difficult part of his spiritual journey. The elegant, open ending (in which he desperately accepts fruits offered by a female stranger) allows us to imagine the end result of the story. <br /> <br /> In Bunuel, I recognize an aggressive, selfless atheist endowed with brilliant wit and public consciousness; but after watching “Nazarin” I also feel from him a certain warmth, depth and maturity, which are not so obvious in his other works. <br /> <br /> For the sake of contrast, I strongly recommend watching it later on the short film “Simon of the Desert” (also shot in Mexico a few years later). He deals with a similar subject - the rejection of the ego in the face of temptation - only in a hysterically ridiculous and completely disrespectful style.
