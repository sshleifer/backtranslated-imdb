From the first shot of a conveyor belt in a jar, you could say it would be a great movie. <br /> <br /> A touch minimalistic style with a retro twist, this film exudes style - a great camera — the work, the acting, the script and manner in which the protagonist’s secret life unfolds complement each other, perhaps making the best the Italian film I have ever seen (there with La Stanza Del Figlio - albeit differently). <br /> <br /> Shame on the people behind me, who made it obvious that they could not see the relevance of the slow but painfully beautiful scenes carefully created by the camera. Do not miss
