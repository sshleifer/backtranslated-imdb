This film is probably the best new French film I have ever seen in this century. There were some great ones, including Noah's “Irreversible”, Green's “Pontic Art” and Hadjihalilovich's “Innocence”, but none of them came close to the timeless glory of Les Amants Reguliers. <br /> <br /> Film - a description of the events of May 68. and what followed after that, and besides, it was an update, and a tribute to the Nouvelle Vague films of those days. Regarding the description of the riots in Paris, the film is meticulously accurate (I am only 19 and I haven’t been there myself, but you understand what I mean), and almost in real time and very long scenes of riots perfectly prepared the ground for the consequences of the events on the streets of Paris. The riots are not glorified and do not take pictures beautifully, as in Bertolucci's Dreamers (with whom the film is in many ways comparable), instead they are filmed in dirty black and white pictures, courtesy of the excellent William Lubchansky. The love story, which is the main concern of the film after the riots in 68, was filmed in stunning and much less blurred scenes, and it manages to evoke a true feeling of love and confusion among teenagers in a politically worried and seemingly cold atmosphere. <Br /> <br /> This film is a wonderful love story, and it follows from it that the director wants to portray his own experience of the mythical events of the late 60s, which makes the film even more convincing. But the film is also a tribute to the canon of Nouvelle Vague. Most of the dialogue is reminiscent of the early Truffaut, and the duration, inaction, and plot structure resemble Eustache or Rivette. There are even effects similar to Goddard when people look directly into the camera and even turn directly to Bernardo Bertolucci. This film is without a doubt the answer-song for Bertolucci's Dreamers, and it is also a tribute to Nouvelle Vague, but, nevertheless, it is an excellent and radiant love story. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: this film is incredible and if you like French cinema, you should not sleep on it. It may be the best French film from the time of "Eustache" "La Mamain et la Putain".
