Pity the monkeys. People always accused them of being made (what they were) or were nothing more than the American fake Beatles (again, who they were), but for the children of that time they were real, they were important, they were legitimate, debates about which one is better: “Monkeys” or “The Beatles” were commonplace in school yards, but critics could not believe it. Despite recording some very memorable, classic pop tunes, Monkess did not enjoy much respect for their albums. Unfortunately, the same fate befell their single-chamber machine, despite the fact that it is considered the best film of the group. Beatle fans may claim that “Hard Days Night” was better, and I’m sure that many of the children think that “8 Mile” was better, but none of these films were as bold and inventive as “Head”, and perhaps that is why he failed. <br /> <br /> If Head told a straight story from A to B, it would be possible for the young fans of the group to like it, but by opening the envelope and using the opportunity of the movie to make fun of their own image, they really sabotaged the movie by their fans. Can you imagine how Eminem turns to the camera and actually talks about how sad it is that he is the best-selling guy in the genre, in which only 5% (and I am generous) of actors are white. If you can imagine it, then you have an idea of ​​how courageous the Monks were to sing: “Hey, Hey, we are Monkeys. You know, we like to please. Artificial image, without philosophy. ” When you have a film in which Frank Zappa tells Davey that he should focus less on dancing and more on music, it becomes clear that much more is happening than you expected. <br /> <br /> History, What is, concerns boys trying to run away from their manager, who at some point causes them to play dandruff in advertising, but every time they run away, they end up in a box. I don't think you need to be Fellini to understand the symbolism of this bit. Some graceful comedy episodes accompany Davy as a boxer who has to quit playing the violin to dive in a big match, and Peter refuses to throw away the ice cream he doesn't need because there are hungry children, so the empty food is wrong, but the real selling point This film - the music and the best ever recorded by the group. Even if you are away from this story, you can relax and enjoy the amazing music. <br /> <br /> Any film that starts and ends when Mickey tries to commit suicide by jumping from the bridge (at the end of the band follows him) will never become a classic mainstream, but if you're a fan of the band or the experimental film of that era, you will like this movie.
