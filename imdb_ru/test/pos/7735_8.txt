The Storm of Paul Mazursky is an interesting, strange and strange film about a midlife crisis. Sit in New York and on a remote Greek island with John Cassavett as the world famous architect who decides to drop out. He is accompanied by his daughter (Molly Ringwald) and the living room singer (Susan Sarandon). This 25-year-old movie is a great DVD release - but without any additional details - even a theatrical trailer. Tons of gorgeous scenery and razor-sharp dialogues make this movie two and a half hours interesting Ride. Raul Julia and Gena Rowlands complete the strong cast. Good drama mixed with comedy, tension and almost madness. This latest DVD release is worth renting. B +
