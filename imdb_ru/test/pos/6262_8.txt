Unlike some films that you can surprise and do other things, this film held me in front of the screen for two hours. I loved every minute. <br /> <br /> However, I must say that the story is not very believable. Especially when a foreigner was sent by the government, and then, in fact, sent the package to the guy who helped him. Xiao Liu is a very good actor, he shows his emotions, he shows his stupidity and his love for this girl.
