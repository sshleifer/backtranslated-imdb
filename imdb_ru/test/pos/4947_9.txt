Iron Eagle has always been one of my favorite movies for a long time. This is similar to Topgun, but with a different storyline and (in my opinion, many people disagree with me), this is better than Topgun. <br /> <br /> There are several amazing fight scenes in this movie when fighters zoom in through the air. In the background also sounds the song Queen "One Vision", which, in my opinion, is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the Iron Eagle was very good, but its sequels were rubbish. <Br /> <br />
