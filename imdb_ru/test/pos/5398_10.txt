IMAGINARY HEROES - one beautiful little movie! Written and directed by Dan Harris, this story is a classic theater where comedies and tragedies are tightly woven and the climax of the film is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> The Travis family is a strange group: none of the participants is the one who everyone thinks. Starting with the suicide of reluctant champion of child swimming "hero" Matt (Kip Pardou), father Ben (Jeff Daniels) falls apart and isolates himself from his family and himself, while Sandy's mother (Sigourney Weaver) turns into a pot and rage and sarcasm , daughter Penny (Michelle Williams) returns from school, repelled by the behavior of her family, and the remaining son Tim (Emil Hirsch) takes all of the above, avoiding his classmates, girlfriend and teams with his neighbor Kyle (Ryan) Donowho) to jump into drugs and sexual experiments. Throughout the film, Tim tries to hide bruises on his body, which have their own secret, but make his girlfriend feel rejected, his mother gets angry at the bully in the trailer park, which she believes is the cause, and finally opens the window to depth of the scars this family has suffered for years. Secrets and lies are here, and their disclosure is painfully dramatic. <br /> <br /> This may be Sigourney Weaverâ€™s best role, although Emil Hirsch, Jeff Daniels, Ryan Donovo and Kip Pardue (despite the shortness of his role) all contribute to first-class performances. The story begins slowly and seems tortuous, and this fact may lose the attention of some viewers, but stay with this little film, and the effect of the work will stun you. Highly recommended.
