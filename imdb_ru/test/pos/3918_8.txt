This is one of the best horror / suspense films filmed by Hollywood over the years or maybe even decades. Despite the fact that, in my opinion, this film was predictable in parts, it has everything that should be in a good movie in this genre, “CHILLS, TRILLS And yes, a lot MORE !!” HOUSE WAX, SURE, SUPPLIES !!! In parts it was kind of contrived, the acting was not so good, but my HOUSE OF WAX capital rating is eight out of ten ...... if you like being on the edge of your seats, this I must admit, it was exactly that a movie that I liked. It was nice to see the whole city, made of wax ... I myself like these museums, but after watching this movie I will now see them in a completely new and different way!
