In "The Black Snake's Moan", writer-director Craig Brewer is so obsessed with heavy symbolism that a part of me felt that I rejected the entire film as pretentious - a sultry southern parable with some very risky topic. The film also contains heavy spiritual overtones into which religion fits - again, it is integrated without grace. After more dark introductory scenes, the film dulls its sharpness more and more, until the whole performance comes out with the artificial quality of the stage performance (and I admit that the last 15 minutes have gone too far to the territory of “Happy End”, in my opinion)). And this is not to mention the archival footage of the musician Son House, reflecting on love and death (and, of course, foreshadowing a lot). However, in a strange way, these flaws are also the qualities of "Black Serpent's Moan", the story of the aging Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), recently abandoned by his wife (for his brother, no less), who is faced with the near death of the nympho ray ( Cristina Ricci, easily showing the hottest trailer image on celluloid); returning the girl to health, he chains her to the radiator to defeat her demons and, I hope, redeem his own fallen personality. While there is a certain prosaic appeal in observing how Ricci falls out of her scanty outfits, her play is risky and mature - no trace of Addam can be found on Wednesday, and she easily copes with Jackson, who personifies the “blues” in his bleak portrait, God fearing person. While tough, the scene in which Lazarus sings a Rae song in the midst of a thunderstorm / blackout is irresistible, as is the scene in the blues club that makes you want you there. The settlement is strong, and one can argue in favor of literal symbolism (chain, emitter, strange, blurred person who pursues the libido of Rey), which is the deliberate result of superstition and spirituality. And it is the conviction with which this spirituality is played that gives “The Black Snake Moan” a large part of its strength - devotional performances of Jackson and Ricci make this film from painful to sublime with impeccable grace. While Justin Timberlake's jealous lover is a notion I couldn’t manage without, neither he nor the subtlety of a sledgehammer can prevent it from being a fascinating meditative film.
