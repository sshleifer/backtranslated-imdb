If you are going to fake James Bond, it’s a great idea to find a lead man like BOTH Sean Connery and Leonard Rossiter, so step forward, Jean Dujardin, who perfectly reflects Connery’s grin and disguise of Rossiter’s mindset. Dujardin plays it like Kluzau, who can keep himself in karate. The plot makes him look for "Our man in Schutok", which mysteriously disappeared and includes such incredible things as the Nazi cell, hidden inside the pyramid. If there is a sharp note, then it is the leading lady, Berenice Bejo, who has all the sensuality of the pudding and she has overshadowed - but only - by Aura Atika. This is good for one view, but that's all.
