Late film critic Gene Siskel said that this film shows how easy it is to make a film. He gave him a compliment, although now it could be perceived as an insult. Although I did not always agree with Gene Siskel, I agree with him here. “Love Jones” is a vivid example of what a love story should be: realistic with real characters in real situations. <br /> <br /> The story tells about the ups and downs of the relationship between Darius Lovehall (Larenz Tate) and Nina (Nia Long). Larenz Tate and Nia Long are more than just a beautiful couple on the screen. These two actually have chemistry together. You can feel the vibration between these two when they are on the screen, and this is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Bill Bellamy is pretty funny because the lying Wood and Lisa Nicole Carson are as gorgeous as Nina Simone’s girlfriend. Isaiah Washington is as good as a close friend of Darius Savon, and I sigh every time I see him in the movies. The guy is a great actor, whose career is ruined by the industrial lowlands and the children's games they play. You may believe that he called the little weasel on Gray's anatomy by his name, but anyone who knows how Follwood works knows better than to believe any "official history" from the place of pretense. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a wonderful love story, full of interesting and enjoyable characters that are in realistic situations that anyone who was in love can connect with. You love these people because they are believable and not portrayed as gangsters and tramps. There is no obscene stereotype. Compare this with romantic films about toads. Exactly. In conclusion, if you love Black Cinema, you better have a copy of this movie.
