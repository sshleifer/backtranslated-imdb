I just watched the 100 lower movies in accordance with the opinion of IMDb users about whether there is something that I can not see, and found this little gem on the screen. One of those times when you see a movie that is considered one of the worst, and you just need to be one of the few who really like it. Damn, well, I think that they will make fun of me and spit here, but for me it was a pretty good movie when I saw it. However, some time passed, I remember that he used to come to HBO late at night, I watched him two or three times, and since then I have not seen him, and I would love to watch him again, knowing that Jolie is him The story tells about a cyborg and a guy trying to escape from the clutches of this corporation, and about some bounty hunters. I think this is basically all you need to add a few scenes with Jack Palance, and we have our film. Some good actions here and there, as well as some blood and violence. There is also a love story, as well as a cyborg woman and a boyfriend who taught her to struggle to fall in love with each other. The dialogue sometimes becomes rather bad, and this is not a first-class film, but for a b-film it is really good. I don’t know if it was a theatrical release, because it doesn’t seem good enough for this, but it does one of the best live videos if it was one of them.
