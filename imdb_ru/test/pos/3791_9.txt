Charlie Chaplin's character “Little tramp” or “Little man” wins the First World War, which at that time was called the Great War, alone, even capturing Kaiser, which all the Allied forces could not do. It is a pity that all this turns out to be a dream, partly a cop and the weakest part of this hypnotizing silent short film (almost a full-length film in 46 minutes). <br /> <br /> In abundance inventive jokes including Charlie, who had to put on a gas mask to eat Limburger cheese sent from home and then use cheese as a weapon against the Germans; Charlie sleeps underwater in a flooded trench next to a soldier, whom he continues to annoy; Charlie disguised himself under a tree — one of his best sketches in history — and Charlie pretends to beat his friend who has become a prisoner of war, and then embraced him when the enemy is out of sight. <br /> <br /> One surprising feature is that Charlie, when standing behind enemy lines, dressed as a German, looks like Hitler ten years before Hitler and his Nazi thugs began to dominate German politics. Obviously, Hitler copied his appearance after Charlie from this film.
