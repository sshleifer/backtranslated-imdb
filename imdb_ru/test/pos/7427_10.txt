This film is a hidden gem. I can not understand why this film does not get more airtime. Errol and Eleanor Parker become a real attractive and dashing couple. And their chemistry is flawless. I really liked the touch of his daughters, referring to him as her Robin Hood. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Errol Flynn. Nice to see Errol play his father. According to the consensus of his own children, he was a very attentive and loving father in real life. In addition, the supporting cast is also wonderful. You can't go wrong with players like Hattie McDaniel and Lucile Watson Hattie McDaniel makes a film that is much better from the start. This film has now become a festive tradition in my home. Enjoy!!!
