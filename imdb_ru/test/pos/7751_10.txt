I have no words to truly describe this series. <br /> <br /> Sending this concept (a very hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality, which eventually turns the team of eccentrics into her own view of the world, which, after all, was Haruhi’s creation, because she wants the world with aliens Espers and Time Travelers) is a breath of fresh air in a world filled with repetitive anime series and non-innovative TV shows. <br /> <br /> Characters are well developed, and you end up loving them, some less than others. The word describing the animation work does not exist, since “excellent” does not correspond to the description of how it was done. There are many funny situations that either make you smile or make you think. Do not give in to the impression of the first episode, as this is only the tip of the iceberg, since the novels are still to come. <br /> <br /> The only problem arises from the lack of chronological order in the episodes, but you can solve this problem, no? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Undoubtedly, one of the best series of 2006.
