“The Cage” is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying journey not only in the vast mind of a serial killer, but also in one of the very talented directors. This is convincing evidence of what can be achieved if people open up their free imagination. It is courage at work, the removal of thoughts from formulas and stamps and the creation of something truly magnificent. This is the best film of the year to date. <br /> <br /> I read numerous complaints about this film, from any style and without content to poorly-played characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This film can be a milestone, a tradition that future films will follow. The Cage has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door and tell her and her director, Tarsham Singh, that we no longer want? Personally, I would love to welcome another film from Tarcem and would like someone to try to challenge him. <br /> <br /> We all heard talk about how to penetrate the consciousness of a serial killer, and yes, I agree that the “genre” is a bit overloaded. The 90s were full of films trying to portray what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. But “Cage” didn’t pave the way, we were given a new twist, we were physically transferred to the mind and presented nothing more than an exciting journey from the most mysterious object ever studied. <br /> <I like that the film doesn’t bore us with scientific jargon, trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets into the brain of another person. Instead, she just lays down on the lab table and turns into something like really long Twizzlers, and dismounts into another entity. The “cage” wants you to “see” what it is, not “how”, and I think this is something that some people don’t like. True, I like the explanation with my films, but when the film goes to a new level, you have to let him do what he wants and just accept it. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast bright visual effects when inside the brain of another. However, the set design was simply amazing. I would not be surprised if this film brings home several Oscars in film, better costumes, a better director, and the like. If it depended on me, it would at least be nominated for the best photo. <br /> <br /> I noticed that I would repeat. Not because there is nothing more to say, but because I cannot but emphasize how fantastically I thought “Cage”. If you enter the film with a biased attitude and surprise him with a wonderful holiday and a stunning feast, then you are guaranteed a good time. I guess this movie was too big for some people, writing it off as “weird” or “crazy.” I am very fond of the psychology and imagination of the human mind, so it was right in my alley. Coming out of the theater, I heard one of the spectators say: "Whoever made this film confident, he made a lot of good drugs." If so, I want him to smoke. <br /> <br /> **** (of 4)
