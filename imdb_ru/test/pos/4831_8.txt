Wicked Little Things was a really good movie. I will say that in some places it seemed incredible, and in others it seemed that the action of the characters was not enough thought out, but on the whole it was exciting and interesting. I do not understand why the rating of this film is so low. And I donâ€™t understand why the rating of all Afterdark Horrorfest films is so low. These are people from B-Movies, and nothing more. They provide great entertainment, and most of them do not. I have a lot of flaws. It is definitely worth seeing because you will not be disappointed with the result. Wicked Little Things is one of the best Afterdark Horrorfest 1st annual horror films, and compared to many other films in the series, this is one of the best in general.
