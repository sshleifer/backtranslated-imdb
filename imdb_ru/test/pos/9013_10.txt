Fans of the original movie can really love this show if they just stop constantly complaining. <br /> <br /> The Emperor's new school raises some of the old movie jokes, such as dragging a lever into Isma's lab, and Cusco stops the episode. But since this is a children's show, it’s just classic and in place. Despite the fact that the style is much simpler, the animation and characters very well retain their individuality, and this really surprised me. Eartha Kitt does great voice acting for Yzma, and J.P Manoux does a wonderful job for Cuzco’s voice instead of David Spade, who played Cuzco in the film. Magnificent plots, funny moments and amazing looks of Cusco make this show worthy of attention. (Just stop complaining about everything!)
