Filmed in the same year as the first films of Lumiere, it is a much more dramatic film than the brothers tried before Niagara the following year. The surviving imprint is very rough, but this only adds to Turneresque’s visual violence, as huge waves of water are falling on a solid pier, and seem to be ready to devour the camera, the viewer. <br /> <br /> If you watch some of these early shorts in chronological order, and the attempt to enter the mindset of the time, causes another shock in that, unlike the single frames of Lumieres, this film has editing, which for me in Anyway, it was as sharp as a razor blade in the film “Un Chien Andula”. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the monovision of the Lumiere films, Paul opens up the possibility of multiple perspectives, freeing the viewer from the power of nature, eluding her understanding in the way that Lumiere could never do. The second shot has an effect similar to the one that Niagara had, but less frightening, because thanks to editing we avoided danger. In films such as “L'Arroseur Arrosse” or “Repas du bebe”, nature stands indifferent and strong, it cannot be held in front of the camera. The basic cinematic grammar put an end to its superiority.
