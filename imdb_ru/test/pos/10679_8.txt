This lesser-known movie starring Roy Tinnes (from The Invaders) is what I consider to be lost. This was done at a time when the story was more important than special effects (although the effect is quite good for its time). The scientist believes that there is another world in Earth orbit directly behind the Sun. Since the sun always blocks it from us, we can never see it from Earth. Roy Tinnes is selected to go on a mission to get into this world. I don't want to tell the rest of the plot, because it will give the rest of the film. Let's just say, there are some real surprises. <br /> <br /> The film is British, and it has that good British acting atmosphere that was on shows like The Avengers.
