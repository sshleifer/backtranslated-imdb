If you're a fan of early duke films, this Lonely Lonely Star is a good option. What more can you ask for besides the duke, Yak and Gabby. A lot of good hooliganism and shooting !!! It seemed amazing to me that Duke’s singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele’s twin brother. It was reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and a friend of the Duke, so his twin brother Bill could also be. In any case, if you like good, clean, early western films, do not miss this one. We do not need to think about hidden values ​​or try to figure out the main topics. Just sit back, relax and enjoy a western movie from a simpler day and time. This is called people's entertainment !!!
