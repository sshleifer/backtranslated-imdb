Despite later statements, this early melodrama has very little to do with Citizen Kane: this is a biographical film about a ruthless, but human, fictional plutocrat, recounted in memories, but galloping around time. The screenwriter, Preston Sturges, shows none of his later gifts for a sparkling dialogue, and none of Kane's innumerable cinematic innovations is apparent. However, it is very watchable, with young Spencer Tracy (his old looks make him look like, well, old Spencer Tracy), showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore - a little behind his heyday, and not physically matched - play a multi-faceted woman for a man. There is also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femme fatal women in cinema history, sending the last third to ecstatic soap opera reverbs. The surviving print is agitated, there are no fragments of audio recordings in it, and there are some holes in the plot (how does she know whose son this is, if she sleeps with both of them?), And the music is terribly fake. With all this, I was completely fascinated.
