This is a simple episodic advertisement so far after watching all the episodes of the 11th season (except for the trilogy "Imagination"). This is the one that made the most laugh, definitely my favorite in the 11th season. the toy store is a child who has Tourette syndrome and Cartman has a new idea. You can imagine that Cartman now has Tourette's syndrome, and he's great, because Kyle, as soon as he finds out about it, sounds like "he pretends." Cartman, of course, on fire, saying everything he wants, teachers, director, anyone. On the other hand, we have Kyle, who is now intolerant, mainly for saying that Cartman was pretending that he was brought to a meeting with children with Tourette syndrome, just so that he would see that Tourette syndrome is really great, because Kyle is kind of good. perhaps someone is pretending that Tourette is for fun. "In short, Kyle could not explain what Cartman is pretending. Probably my favorite scene of this episode is when Cartman is in Kyle's family, but immediately after this scene another child discovers that Cartman is just pretending, the guy with Tourette, who was in the toy store, Cartman basically said to this child: “no” Tourette is cool ”. But to say what he wants and to be a brave guy for everyone is just the beginning for Cartman, his master plan: on national television, to say everything he wants (“people call it brilliant television, they probably will give me Emmy "- fiction, in this episode the word" s *** "is used 26 times, and, of course, that's not all. South Park won an Emmy about a month before the episode was aired). But there is a turn, Cartman basically removed all the bricks of the wall, he says now without hesitation, so we hear from Cartman that he wetted his bed last night, now it's not fun for Cartman, and he is like, "I can't control what I'm saying," and, of course, the person who was with him is like "well, of course, you can't control what you say, you have Tourette ", so Cartman looks like" my Tourette, it got worse before I just blurted out cool things "about the Jews limping and all that, but now it has become very bad." There is also something about Chris Hansen and “Catch a Predator”, in fact what happened to the pervert here happens to a lot more perverts, Kyle and Thomas were behind this to stop Cartman, Kyle ends up being a savior Cartman! Fantasy! <br /> <br /> TSA VOICES CONCERN about South Park, October 3rd episode <br /> <br /> On Wednesday, October 3, Comedy Central cable network will air in the animated series “South” Park "in which one of the young characters, Cartman," gets "Tourette syndrome. Given the nature of this program, we fully expect that it will be offensive and insensitive to people with TS, and will receive numerous calls and emails from our members and the TS community . <br /> <br /> We have already taken some proactive actions: strikes, such as asking Comedy Central to pass whether our public service announcement (with the participation of comedian Richard Lewis) during or after the show. In addition, after the episode is aired and we can see exactly how the vehicle is portrayed, we can answer specific questions and concerns which we had with the show for screenwriters. <br /> <br /> “We were really surprised that it took so much time for creators to use TS as a comedy feed in this program, since there are no disability issues , disease or controversial topics, can not be them banned, ”said Judith Ungar, president of TSA. <br /> <br /> “We always see TS images (good and bad) as an opportunity for awareness and education, and demonstration of such scale and popularity is certainly not an exception and gives TSA the opportunity to disseminate factual information about the disorder” - said Tracy Colletti. Flynn, public relations manager, TSA. <br /> <br /> On this site we will post an official statement with the TSA's response to the program after the broadcast. <br /> <br /> TSA RESPONDS Episode "South Park" <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as is the case with too many images of people in the media Le with Tourette syndrome (TS), new to the season in South Park ("Le Petit Tourette", 10-3-07), further perpetuating the frank myth that most of those who suffer from TS have unwitting outbursts of obscene language. In fact, 85-90% of people with TS never experience this tragically socially stigmatizing symptom (medically called coprolalia). For viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, the misleading takeaway message could not be clearer? if you don't damn, you don't have TS. <br /> <br /> Despite our election flutters, we recognize that the episode has been surprisingly well studied. Despite the exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia, an amazing amount of accurate information was conveyed to the attentive viewer. A scenario from parents, a neurologist, peers, and a therapy session with a “TS child support group” all served as a smart tool for presenting these facts to the public. “Without a doubt, this episode in South Park really led to increased awareness of the CU at the national level. However, we are very concerned that schoolchildren from the CU will be ridiculed and even mocked by insensible peers who could see the program, ”said Judith Ungar, president of TSA. “We understand that for more than ten years satirical parodies of writers have not spared any groups, whether celebrities, people with disabilities, or political figures. The fact that TS has been the subject of a popular television show, indicating that the public is much more aware of the mess. Obviously, this increased awareness, on which we worked too hard, can sometimes be a double-edged sword. ” <br /> <br /> TSA contacted the program managers before going on the air, and we will contact them again. Perhaps we can turn it into an opportunity for a positive understanding of the vehicle.
