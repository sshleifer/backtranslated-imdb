"Alone among us" is definitely one of the best episodes of the first season. The storyline, although somewhat confusing, creates a lot of uncertainty, supported by a creepy synth-controlled soundtrack. This is a typical “invasion of alien bodies” scenario, but in the end, it turned out to be without evil targets (the death of the assistant chief engineer Singh was an accident for me). Two kinds of delegates create an entertainment frame (the best makeup at the moment), finally adding a bit of black humor to the series (the final scene). Patrick Stewart obviously likes to get a little involved in Picard’s character and explore some new terrain, as Data does, posing as Sherlock Holmes (another classic of all time). The special effects are also convincing, and the director Cliff Bowl did a good job with his work. He - the first who tries to compensate for the lack of acting ability in Troy, improving its appearance. In some scenes, she looks beautiful, and the neck of her dress greatly improves her appearance. The lightning scene by Picard on the bridge reminds him of the Star Wars emperor The Return of the Jedi (this is a personal impression, but made me smile). <br /> <br /> There are also some games with corridor lighting (simulating the night aboard) and the first moving camera moving away from Picard when he enters the transporter room to get into the cloud ... Great job. Clever cutting, creating a continuous dialogue through various scenes (Troy's hypnosis report) rounds off the impression of a really well-thought out episode of TNG. The first, where even Wesley Crusher seemed almost tolerant ... <br /> <br /> The ending, however, was a little confusing, as if the producers did not have enough time. "P for Picard" is a bit far-fetched, and his return is too easy, but this can be left aside, given the many strong points this episode has to offer ...
