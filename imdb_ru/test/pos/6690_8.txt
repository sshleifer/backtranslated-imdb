This film is brilliant ...... no doubt. I watched it some time ago after constantly molesting from family members who were right in their science fiction films (which I am not), and thought it was pretty good. But after having recently watched several documentaries on space, etc. We looked at it again ... and thatâ€™s good. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is without a doubt one of the greatest actors in history, and I really like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski, Blown Away, Arlington Road). The film tells about a patient in a nursing home who claims to be from another planet. Yes, that's right, you think ... but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth. <br /> <br /> This is how the story develops when Bridges go through all kinds of emotions associated with Prot (as he is known), his fellow psychiatrists, his wife and family, his son-in-law and his fellow astronomers-cosmologists (who after receiving some data from Prot pretty much admit that he could be telling the truth!) Great movie ... that surprises you ..... <br /> <br /> 8/10 Dave
