I just watched the DVD and I liked it. In particular, I thought that the director, Jude and Nicole did an amazing job with the kiss of Inman and Ada just before the departure of Inman. It was the most romantic kiss I've ever seen in a movie. I thought it was important to set the tone for the rest of the film; he managed to make it plausible that Inman and Ada would walk / wait for each other, respectively, all this time without any real relationship. I thought that the film handled this important plot much better than the book itself. I am sure that many of you will quickly call other film kisses that are better than this, but this one is for me! Jude and Nicole showed incredible chemistry in too few scenes that they had together.
