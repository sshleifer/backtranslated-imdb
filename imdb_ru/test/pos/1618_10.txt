OK, I am a sucker. I love it. I had no expectations, and they all came true. It was a terrible movie. I like it. I managed to wear DVDs from excessive use. No one can understand my obsession. I also can not tell the truth. For those who watched the movie, it would not be a surprise, but I asked the seller at the video store if I could buy a copy, and I could, because there were two in stock, and only one was checked, and more than half of the time was me. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The game is terrible, but I liked it. The actors are stupid, the plot is stupid, numerous fools - as if they were able to see through monsters, "arachnids" looked like they were made of plastic garbage bags (maybe they were), there was light underground, TNT was you deafening and so on. <br /> <br /> You really have to love B-Movies to enjoy it ... alcohol is a great help to others.
