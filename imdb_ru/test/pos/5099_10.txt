Peter O'Toole - Arthur Chipping, a Latin teacher with strict adherence to detail and thoroughness, helps the young mind to understand the meaning and definition of Latin words and phrases. He is considered cold, unfair and not in contact with time. But after meeting with theater actress singer Kathryn Briskit (Petoula Clarke), not only at a late dinner after performing in London, but also in an amphitheater in Greece, his closed like-minded world begins to open. <br /> <br /> Goodbye, Mr. Chips is a MGM music remake from a 1939 movie also from MGM. During this time musicals were absent, and the system of Hollywood studios was completely destroyed. When its premiere took place in New York, Los Angeles and London, the musical numbers were left intact, but when it came to local main street theaters around the world, they were songs without songs, so the film became shorter and exploded to the maximum. <br /> <br /> Thanks to MGM / UA Home Video, led by Ted Turner in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when VHS and Laser Disc were the main formats for home video, the music numbers were restored and the spaces were closed. Although Laserdisc was the only format chosen for watching “Goodbye, Mr. Chips,” in a widescreen mailbox format. <br /> <br /> Some time ago, the soundtrack of the original film was only available on the original without vinyl and on the tape and can still be found today on Ebay. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the wonderful people at Film Score Monthly.com in 2006, the soundtrack was digitally remastered and remixed into a set of 3 CDs with a completely reconstructed score, the original 1969. a general release of the album, scores, narrated sequences, source music and many interviews. You also get 1 unused song, which is a real lost gem, "Tomorrow with Me" by Petula Clark, which would have been chosen instead of "You and I" before distribution. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic musical and a real tribute to teachers around the world. I would definitely buy this movie if Warner Bros. MGM and Sony have invested their money where it is, and would restore this film from all sources of the main film, and put it on a DVD and Blu Ray with all the bells and whistles with all the extras you can find and things in the release.
