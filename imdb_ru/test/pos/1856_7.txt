As a non-theist, I am not going to comment on the theory of great people that changed the world 150 years ago. It is safe to say that science is based on evidence, religion is based on blind faith. Nuff said there then. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed by the BBC, and, frankly, it could well be shown on television. While the acting is great, the film itself does not deserve a full-scale release of the film. However, if it reaches a wider audience, then so be it. But I saw a lot of dramas in the era style on BBC TV, and they were up to par. Just do not expect to see too much thrill with the budget when viewing. <br /> <br /> In a sense, I found the film almost failing to apologize to religious fundamentalists. Despite the fact that during this whole process he felt a good tension, I could not help but want him to get into the publication “The Origin of Species” much faster than it actually is (you will wait until the end). And it seemed that he was living far more than I had ever known about Darwin’s struggle with himself and his wife Emma, ​​portraying him almost like a crazy madman from time to time - which is hardly true. There are many other mistakes and facts missing in connection with the real story that led to the publication of The Origin, but the whole premise of the film is almost entirely focused on the difficulties that Darwin faced with the book in the country, and a small part of the death of his beloved daughter Annie . This gives the film the most exciting scene where Annie passed away when she last asks Darwin to tell her the story of a captive orangutan who died of pneumonia. However, you will probably feel a greater connection with the primate in this scene than with Darwin’s daughter. <br /> <br /> Due to an early argument, obviously surrounding the film in the USA, it will work well for its promotion and ensure many more people will see it. But, to be honest, there is very little in it that offends any mythical God. These are hardly headlines for a theory that has existed for about 150 years after all. But since fundamental Christians (and many other religions of which we are all knowledgeable) like to wave a poster or two when possible, I think this film is a good excuse, like any other. Personally, I do not see what is at stake. But maybe they just mess around ...
