The best romantic comedy I've seen in recent years. Not that sliding on Ben Stiller's or Adam Sandler's Hollywood things, and much less cool than Hugh Grant's epic. Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr played a great role, and both consistently demonstrate professional skills as an engaged couple who decided to spend some time sowing their sexy oats before the wedding. Instead of playing strictly for the sake of laughter, the scriptwriters and directors came up with an excellent mixture of human feelings and comedy. Nicholson is just as gorgeous as an awkward temptress, and More does an excellent job with a man who reluctantly enters the game, but soon discovers that he enjoys his throws a little more. We see enough support characters to nicely round out the plot, without being distracted from the main story. Andy Richter (sincere friend) and Helen Slater (distraught single mother) are especially good. There is enough sense and emotional complexity to do this much more than the standard boy-girl farce. In fact, with a slightly better rhythm and a little more cutting, this film would be the first ten of the comedy.
