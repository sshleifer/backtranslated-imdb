I am very surprised that so many people do not like this film. I think it's a lot better than most teenage films that have been released lately - Ten Things I Hate About You (? We can say, a little Bopper movie and what was the principle of writing these pornographic novels), Cruel (where the character refuses to be virgin because of the exciting ride on the car), and she does it all (mediocre). If you are looking for something that is just funny - I say, go with Never Been Kissed. My mom liked it, and she hates movies (one of her favorites is BEACH). This is a big fantasy about what you would do differently if you could return to high school. People who were outcasts in high school are likely to enjoy this movie more. It reminds me of the Romi and Michele High School Reunion. And the final cheers me up. Of course, the plot is already ready, but how many recent films you can honestly say has not been made in one form or another. The cast is also charming. And for those who think that Drew cannot be disgusting - she does an excellent job. Another good comedy for teenagers that I recommend that was made recently is ELECTIONS, but this is more of a satire on school and politics.
