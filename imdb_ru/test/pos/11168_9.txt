I read the comments about this film before watching it and did not expect much, but like film B is curiosity. I think you should be a certain type of person to enjoy such things, but I seriously thought it was cool. People should only watch this for experience, because it is absolutely one of a kind. Don't expect much from this. The game is bad, transitions, obviously, were made on PC, etc. Definitely movie B, but, nevertheless, really worth checking out. Very funny. Light blood and some dubious topics, so it's probably not something to show your grandmother, but for a more adventurous viewer, I would say, this is a must see.
