In many respects, this film defines the essence of everything that I love in the movie, in terms of capturing these strange, elusive moments of unprotected truth. In other ways, this is undoubtedly an amateur, focused result of drug addicts condescendingly fooling around with the camera. Ultimately, it is somewhere between pure brilliance and stealth (fortunately, much more than the first). Part of me wants to reward her solely for her absolute novelty and moments of pure height, but at the same time I cannot completely ignore the sometimes terrible "actions" and obviously bad production values. At first, editing seems extremely sloppy and unnecessarily distracting (or maybe just incorrectly formulated), but after a while I got used to it, which, after all, is a true sign of a filmâ€™s success on its own terms or not. I think this answer basically sums up my comprehensive feelings for the film. That is, despite its shortcomings, in general, it works very well. And if nothing else, a film like this really shows how false and contrived an artificial documentary, wobbly cam style can be when it is so clearly used solely for effect (for example, in films like Roger Dodger, who is amazing in the rest). Here, aesthetics clearly follows from the need for a shooting situation, and not just arbitrarily used to make it look "cool."
