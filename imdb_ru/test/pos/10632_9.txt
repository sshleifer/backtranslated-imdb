After I saw The Pianist a few years ago, I told myself that I would never see him again, so strong and disturbing. Time passed, but I could not dismiss the film and its main character, Erica Kahut. The story of a respected piano teacher at the Vienna Conservatory, classy and collected on the surface, a connoisseur of classical music, with an inner world so gloomy and disturbing to the demons of fear, self-loathing and self-destruction, strong enough to destroy it, required more than one viewing. I read the book “The Piano Teacher” by Elfriede Jelinek, an ambiguous Nobel Prize winner in literature, on whom the film is based, and after reading the film, I again watched the movie. The second time all the pieces of the puzzle were in the right places. A not often outstanding heartbreaking book is transferred to the screen with such brilliance as “Le Pianiste”. Three actors gave outstanding performances. Franz Schubert's piano music, “soaked in painful humanity”, is another bright star of the film. <br /> <br /> I have only one vision problem with Haneke. There is a scene in the film in which Haneke made some changes to Erica’s character compared to the novel. In the book, she revealed herself even deeper before Walter, a young conservatory student whom she attracted, in a letter. As soon as he understood what he was dealing with and showed her how much he had been pushed away from it, she stopped communicating with him. Erika from the book will never chase Walter to rush to him. She kept everything inside - she did not like to play, she was not a hunter - she loved to watch. The big scene during the hockey game was not needed. She tried to evoke sympathy from Erica (and, of course, Huppert was heartbreaking), but she needed a riddle that surrounded her - Jelinek did not write this scene, it sounded and looked wrong in a great movie.
