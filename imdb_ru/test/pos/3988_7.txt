I totally disagree with the person who first commented on this movie. For me, this story tells about a person with a hormonal growth disorder who is trying his best to look for the love he seeks. Trying with all my strength to fit into a society that does not seem to accept it. <br /> <br /> Then he met someone who treats him with the love of his best friend and was shown the way to get the love he always wanted to have. the person who created all this happiness in return received something important from the giant: love for family and spouse. <br /> <br /> and comedy, this is just part of the way that the audience feels some ridiculous mistakes in a certain part of the shows. <br /> <br /> and I have to admit, it made me cry a little.
