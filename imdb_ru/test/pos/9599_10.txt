I'm by no means a fan of football, but I watched it with a friend, because at that moment there was nothing on the box (thank God). Not only did we laugh from the beginning to the end, but after about a week in the pub, when we started discussing this, we made the right performance with an uncontrollable laugh. Does this inclined field really exist ??? I have released my email here, so if anyone finds out about its availability in the future or about repeating it on TV, please let me know. Definitely the funniest thing I saw on TV !!! King Lick was good too !! another classic Tim Healy
