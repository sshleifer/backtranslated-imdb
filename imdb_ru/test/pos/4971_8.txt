This is a great Italian shark film, perhaps not a full-length shark film, but it has a wonderful story about a Native American shark-killer who attacks a small beach community. there are real scenes with real sharks in the film, and some are not, but the way they did it is pretty good, the cast is not so brilliant in this shark film, but it shows that itâ€™s better to play other Italian shark films such like (for example, the brutal jaws of the last shark) they show a pretty bad game, but most Italian shark films are good, which means that this voice is considered best as the best Italian shark film, some scenes in this film show violence / bloodshed, Otori makes this movie good, it shows it, so I could tell that this is the best film for all film fans.
