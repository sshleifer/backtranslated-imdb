The sexy killer Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) is still eager to live in bliss with his ex-boyfriend, the insane killer of Charles “Chucky” Lee Ray. After she picked up the disfigured doll “The Good Guy”, which last took his spirit, and completed several repairs, she performs a satanic ritual that returns his life to a toy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for poor Tiff, a revived maniac shows no interest in marriage, and therefore she locks him in a cage with a bride doll for the company. In the end, the rather angry Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) escapes from his limits, kills Tiffany with an electric current in the bathroom and catches her soul in his “bride” as retribution. <br /> <br /> Understanding that now they are both in the same predicament, the plastic pair puts aside their differences and decides to go to Hackensack, New Jersey, where they can lay hands on the magic amulet that can move their spirit into the human body. Cheating the trailer of the park Jesse (Nick Stebyle) and his delicious girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), in order to take them to their destination, the psychopaths of the dolls begin to rage, their involuntary companions cover the blame. <br /> <br /> Although the idea that the children's doll was obsessed with the spirit of a mass murderer was always quite comical, only in the fourth film in the series “Children's play” the creators completely accepted the absolute madness of the room, choosing the play is much more to laugh than for panic (although we, the hounds, still have something to chat on the OTT). <br /> <br /> Talented Hong Kong director Ronnie Yu follows the progress of the case, deftly translating his clever language - check the script on a smooth and completely enjoyable cinematic journey. Likewise, the excellent cast makes a great job with the camp material: Stabile and Heigl create a cute couple, but hot Tilly steals the show in the form of a blonde, busty, inflated, seductive PVC Tiffany mini skirt. The impressively expressive effects of the Kevin Yager doll also contribute to the success of the film. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is unlikely to find many fans among the “serious” horror fans, but those who love strange spots of mindless entertainment with popcorn, full of twisted black humors, crazy death scenes and magnificent splits, should be explosive.
