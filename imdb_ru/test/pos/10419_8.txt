I put this movie on a whim after a recent trip to New York, and I could not believe that I had never heard of it anywhere! It has all the ideas of the cult classics, starting with the characters. These are archetypical roles that we learn in each segment of everyday life, but they were so nuanced and fully realized by the actors who played them (performances by Peter Stormare and Bai Ling are especially strong) Their interactions are sharp and well-founded, and at the same time filled with subtle, bizarre humor, which (unfortunately) is too rare in American films these days. Writer / director Ramin Niami perfectly weaves these scenes into a funny and touching portrait of a city of the past. Highly recommended!
