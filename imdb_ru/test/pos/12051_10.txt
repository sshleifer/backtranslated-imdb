The film is a very good movie. One of the best films of Yash Raj. The direction is incredible. The script is brilliant. Great story. He talks about Rahul, who is obsessed with Kiran, his college friend. He is completely delighted with the psyche doing something like a conversation with his mother on the phone (in any case, she died 15 years ago), etc. Kiran is engaged to Sunil. Rahul is doing everything he can to get it. He even tries to kill Sunil, but he survives. He even goes to the place where they are going on a honeymoon. Cinema is all we have. Shahrukh is magnificent, Juhi is pretty good, Sunny is average, Anupham is all right, like Tanvi, Dalip did good. The film belongs to SRC. The dialogues are brilliant (Shahrukh and many, if not replaying and comedy). "Jaadu Teri Nazar" and "Tu Mere Samne" are absolutely melodic tracks.
