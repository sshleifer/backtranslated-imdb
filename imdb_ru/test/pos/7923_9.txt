ALEXANDER NEVSKY is nothing more than a grandiose film of large scale. The film opens a window into the world and culture, with which most Americans will never get to know. And much has been said and written about the thinly veiled patriotism of the film in the face of the inevitable war with the German Nazis. <br /> <br /> By American standards, acting is a bit unnatural. The script is short in words and big in visuals and action. And although the action can become tedious, the visual effects are often staggering. The direction is incredible. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, fans of Ralph Bakshiâ€™s animation may notice that he stole many visual effects for WIZARDS directly from a copy of ALEXANDER NEVSKI.
