It would be something to try to tell someone that Fata Morgana is very simple about. Or maybe it is not so: Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to shoot different landscapes and local residents. But this is only the widest bar. This is a feat to which you either surrender or not. He completely takes the form of the world around him, without a story connected only with certain aspects of written poetry, since his camera (filmed on a supposedly discarded film) wanders like on a pure journey. You can even come to such a simple conclusion when he raises these huge landscapes, then moves on to a rougher civilized culture (although not to a real “normal” culture) and to point levels too abstract to be correctly conveyed here. . Sometimes it takes some time to get closer to cleanliness in the “creation” section, but cleanliness is in how parts manipulate either nature or broken machines. Soon the story, reading from Popol Vuh (which, by the way, plays music for most of its films), with the gradual processing of really very stylized frames, adds a completely different level to it. This is a hybrid film, and it is not easy, but the rewards are what best fits Herzog’s idea of ​​“ecstatic truth,” images that he missed throughout his career. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the images end up, by the time the second section, Paradise, leading by the words, or if it's the other way around. Your eyes move along with stops and panning, and the wording is close to religious writing, but there is also a choice of music, like bizarrely spare singing and restrained classical music combined with Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith. I think that each side ends up praising the other, and this is what still * seems * that this should not work. Perhaps this is precisely his merit, the chances of passing through the desert wastelands and the smallest parts of any civilized life (in this case, in the shacks of the desert) that make it so exciting. At least because of the cinematic sense, this is a miracle too indescribable for the casual fan of photography due to the various techniques of technology and some strange images of any Duke film. There are pots, there are long shots, there are hands when they travel through cities, there is a bus a dozen miles away, which through the mirage seems only a couple, there are close-ups of fire and a man holding a reptile and talking about his radar (truly classic comedies) there are people who still hold in fake poses, and a man and a woman play meaningless music. But, most importantly, it ultimately seems, at least for me, natural to the personal nature of the approach. <br /> <br /> I am sure that only the Duke will surely know why he made this film, unlike the simple “how”; he was already shooting "Even the dwarves started out small," and he had to go through many dangers to finish it. However, this is what makes Fata Morgana such an amazing feat - someone will like it, depending on what it actually brings. This is definitely alarming, but there is a temptation to want to see it again very soon, just to experience all the ideas and realities turned into abstract strange vibrations (yes, the word "vibrations" applies here). This is one of the truly impressive "art films" ever created.
