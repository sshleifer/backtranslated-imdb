I adore this movie. The chemistry between the two leading Millers and Carlisle is amazing, they will light up so well from each other, creating an unexpected comedy duet. Alan Cumming is cheerful, his enthusiasm for the role becomes apparent when he does this. The acting is great and it's a really fun and touching movie. I admit that this is not the best movie ever made, but it is a great pleasure, and I would recommend it to those who love other British films. Includes some of the best British actors, including Michael Gambon, so you can't go wrong. Look for cameos from David Walliams and Matt Lucas from Little Britain and Rock: Profile Fame.
