I caught this movie on tv yesterday. I had a certain curiosity about this, because it was directed by Emilio Estevez and played the main role of him and his real father, Martin Sheen. I like to watch a film about the relationship between father and son, which tells about real father and son. Naturally, instant chemistry occurs between Sheen and Estevez, and their conflict scenes become even more intense, knowing that they are actually connected. Of course, it helps that they are both awesome actors. I used to see Martin Sheen in intense roles, but I think that this is the most tense role of Emilio - I remember him mostly from the “Mighty Ducks” series - and I was very impressed. Talent really works in this family. And Katie Bates steals the film in an Oscar-worthy performance. She pulled me to the heart with every word of dialogue. Kimberly Williams - a great actress from the film “Father of the Bride” - is also very good, she keeps herself among a group of talented veteran actors. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit scenic, with dialogs that are clearly focused on the stage, but it didn’t bother me. It is not intended for an action movie; This is a study of character. And for a film that is based on a play, it never becomes too claustrophobic. When Emilio's character, Jeremy, remembers his days in Vietnam, we actually see his heartbreaking memories. <br /> <br /> The film is very powerful and realistic, but not sentimental. In the end, I expected that all conflicts would be resolved and the family would become clumsy, but this was not the case. The ending made me cry without resorting to standard Hollywood melodrama. This proves that reality is much more exciting than anything Hollywood can come up with. <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for a beautiful, powerful drama with incredibly beautiful performances that will knock out your socks ... please look at this undervalued gem. Hopefully, one day, Martin and Emilio will team up with Charlie, and they will all make a great movie together. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9 (out of 10)
