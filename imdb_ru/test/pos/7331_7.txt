"Flipper" - a good spiritual film for the whole family. This is obviously not a very good movie, Free Willy looks much better in almost all components of filmmaking. Maybe sometimes it gets a little naive, and the script and the script are not the best part of the film, but this is an entertainment film with very good cinematography (including underwater shots) and some important moral messages. Elijah Wood again proves that he is an incredibly talented and underrated actor. He can make a bad movie watchable, well a movie is a good, good one is a great and great movie becomes classic all the time. Paul Hoganâ€™s performance was also very good, and he fully matched his role. As I said above, all the cinematography was very good. But underwater shots are definitely the best parts. So Flipper is the perfect way if you want to watch a good, cute and entertaining movie. If you, like me, are tired of modern Hollywood junk filled with sex, violence, vulgarity and profanity, you will likely like this movie. <br /> <br /> My rating is 7.7 out of 10.
