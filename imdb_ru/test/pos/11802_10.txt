The Cure is one of the few films that I rated 10 out of 10. I mean that everything in this film is impeccable for me. I saw it almost a year ago, and yet I remember many scenes, especially the final touching scene that comes with captions. <br /> <br /> Two boy-actors clearly gave everything they could, and this contributes in many ways to the Excellent storyline, making the movie perfect. <br /> <br /> The idea is clear - friendship, and it manifests itself in everything. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say here. Simplicity is one of the things I like so much about this movie. And, of course, it is fun and touching at the same time, suitable for people of any age. <br /> <br /> 10/10, beautifully done!
