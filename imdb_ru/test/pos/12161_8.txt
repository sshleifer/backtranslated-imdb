Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939, but by that time almost all of Europe fell under the influence of the Nazi war machine. Entering the war, Britain actually started from scratch, with scarce reserves and with the air force, which was in the German minority by ten to one. But the British will was firm, encouraged by their new Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who said: "We will never go further." <br /> <br /> The battle for Britain began on August 8, 1940. However, for the first time since Hitler declared his position to conquer the world, he hit the wall. Despite the massive superiority in numbers, the British Royal Air Force launched an offensive, and within twenty-eight days in September and October 1940 the losses of the German Luftwaffe increased to two thousand three hundred and seventy-five lost aircraft and crew members. Hitler's fury was seething, but he should have called instant waiting time. Responding later this year, Hitler launched a massive bombardment of London at Christmas of 1940. When I say that there has never been a disaster film that could compete with the real London live shots on fire during this attack, it would be an understatement. Perhaps the most surreal effect of this chapter in the “Why We Fight” series will be that British citizens will come out of their underground shelters after the bombing to renew what is left of their lives above the ground. Even when you look, there is no way of realizing the living horror that these people must have experienced, since London was left in virtual ruin. <br /> <br /> Yet the Nazis were stunned and deadlocked. All that Hitler wanted to believe in freedom and democracy, now turned upside down. Instead of being weak and complacent, like the French, the British were not going to surrender without a fight. And they fought, taking an air battle to Germany and responding in kind to the attacks on the German homeland. It was a turning point, forcing Hitler to rethink his strategy.
