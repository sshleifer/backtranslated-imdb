All three protagonists are hopeless, and yet you only feel sorry for one of them: Ernesto, hopelessly devoted Mercedes. It was part of the frustration: screaming at Mercedes to get the key and ruin the useless Harry, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> Then there is satisfaction: Steve Buscemi plays an important role as a transvestite, and Harvey Keitelâ€™s touching story of his indignation playing a gorilla for a cheap television film is incredible. When you least expect it, Quentin Tarintino makes half the monologue, and Anthony Quinn turns Ernesto into a rich man. <br /> <br /> Beautiful moments appear again and again in history, but in the end it is difficult to understand. what to feel about this movie. He has no happy ending or even a complete ending, but for some reason he seems to be right. <br /> <br /> This film is strange, but I, too; No wonder I liked it.
