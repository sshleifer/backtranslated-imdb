spoiler-- <br /> <br /> In 1993, African-American filmmaker / actor Mario Van Peebles made an extremely popular film about the action movie New Jack City and released Posse. The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also plays the lead role in the lead role, Jesse Lee. <br /> <br /> Story: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was dragged into the Spanish-American War. Apparently, at a time when the US justice system could send convicts to military service, Jesse Lee is reluctant to be recruited by a man serving with fully cavalry units in Cuba. Some of his compatriots include Little J (Stephen Baldwin), the fast-talking Wizzie (Charles Lane) and the towering, but simple Obo (Tiny Lister). They find the hidden chest of gold during the reconnaissance run and decide to leave it. However, the ambitious, fanatical Colonel Graham (Zane) learns about gold and is obviously ready to kill Jesse Lee and the company for him. The exchange of fire between Graham and Jesse Lee leaves the colonel blind in one eye, and his forces are retreating. The crew of Jesse Lee manages to smuggle himself (and gold) back to New Orleans, but it turns out that Graham is not far behind. Jesse Lee and his allies are forced to flee, heading west to a city called Freemanville. Apparently, Freemanville was founded by blacks in the years after the civil war. Jesse Lee's father, King David, was a charismatic preacher who became one of the founders of the city. However, as random memories show, King David was soon brutally murdered by a white mob, in parallel with the terrorist campaigns of the Ku Klux Klan, which began at about the same time. Jessie Lee and the company eventually get to Freemanville, but find that the townspeople are not quite happy to see him, especially when Sheriff Bates (Richard Jordan) from a nearby white town makes it clear that he wants Jessie Lee and his partners dead or alive. . Carver (Blair Underwood) is the sheriff and de facto mayor of Freemanville, and his own agenda may not coincide with the presence of Jesse Lee. <br /> <br /> Analysis of the sequence of actions is very credible, and Mario Van Peebles turns into a good performance as a thoughtful hero. After the success of New Jack City, it was almost expected that Van Peebles would lead a sequel, or at least a similar sequel to a city event. Instead, Van Peebles looked into the past for 100 years, creating mostly a black western (effectively “updating” the black themes of the 1970s) and continuing the legacy of largely forgotten black films about cowboys of the early 20th century. Unlike New Jack City, the film was independently funded and was originally released through Gramercy / Polygram Entertainment. Presumably, the heads of major studios refused when Van Peebles gave them Posse. Some of the more "curious" castings at the time included rappers Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc as Father Time and Angel, respectively. In some interviews, Mario Van Peebles said that he often likes to play against the type; since then, the trend of turning rap singers into non-musical films has become almost commonplace. Captured audiences will notice several episodic roles from various entertainment industry figures: black action veterans will appear, such as Isaac Hayes (Turner's Tracker), Pam Grier (Foxy Brown) and Larry Cook (Ghost Sitting by the Door) Similarly, as the counterfeiter legend Nipsey Russell, not to mention television producer Steven J. Cannell (who hired younger Van Peebles to star in Sonny Spoon several years earlier). The film is marked by Woody Strode ("Spartak") in the title role.
