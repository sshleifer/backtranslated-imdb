People who say that what the Looney Tunes cartoons show are not suitable for children obviously have forgotten something: they were not originally intended for children. They were created for the cinema to appear before the feature films, and therefore they could show everything they wanted. "Tweety's S.O.S." This bad idiot Sylvester finds Tweety aboard an ocean liner and gets on a ship to try to get it. But two things work against Sylvester: grandmother furiously protects the canary, and Sylvester easily fell ill with seasickness (we do not see his nausea, but with his green face, they make it clear that he did just that!) darling tweety have a bad ass lane. <br /> <br /> Itâ€™s just great to see how these cartoons were not afraid to give their best; whatever they wanted to show, they showed. We must understand that cartoons did not always have to be fun entertainment for children. Really funny.
