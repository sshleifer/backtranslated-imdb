Bridget Bardot, who looks sexy as always, plays the spoiled but innocent daughter of the French ambassador. She entices one of her fatherâ€™s chief assistants (a MICHEL womanizer) to marry her, and this turns out to be the best for both of them. Soon Michelle flirts with her old girlfriends, and to teach him a lesson, Bridget flirts heavily with the married prince Charles. Michel is surprised by his jealousy. Between Brigetta and Michel begins the game of cat and mouse ("I will have a romance" ... "No, you will not" ...) of life. Bridgette and Michelle comfortably settle in their own happily ever after, while Prince Charles goes home to England. <br /> <br /> This is admittedly an easy piece, but incredibly charming. While some may blame it as a product of their time, I found it completely enjoyable. Worthy of rent.
