I watched this film at the local Silver Sprocket International Film Festival in Florida. What a beautiful movie. A simple, unpretentious, moralizing story about a young, carefree young man who should be responsible for his actions. It was neither pretentious nor screaming that my two teenage daughters loved him, and for a change I was not embarrassed by either the content of the film or the language. A true family movie and the best British comedy movie I have seen since the days of Billy Elliot. The film, not surprisingly, won the highest festival awards for best film and best director. Ten out of ten.
