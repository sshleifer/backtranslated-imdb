It occurred to me when the final scene of the film froze to show meager details of the death of Buddy Holly that people who were in that place in Clearlake, Iowa, who remember this well are still alive today. It must be an obsessive memory, given even more sharpness by the lyrics of “American Pie,” as it pays tribute to the day when the music died. On that day, the world lost some amazing talent, life was cut short shortly before its heyday, and one can only wonder what could have happened if the trio of musicians who died that day survived, creating an even greater musical legacy. <br /> <Today I watched the film thirty years after its original theatrical release. For thirty years I have had trouble thinking about it. I forgot a lot about it, remembering some little things, like cricket in the wall, immortalized by the name of the group. But most of all I remember the music. It's hard to just sit there and not start knocking to the beat of "Oh Boy" or "That is the Day", and you need to wonder where the threat of our morality with these melodies really came from. At least I'm with Buddy on this, how can they be jungle rhythms if he came up with them? It's funny that each subsequent decade brought its threat to the fabric of society - The Beatles, Motown, Disco and a variety of other musical forms. We still listen and dance to the beat, so I think they could not be so bad. <br /> <br /> There was another excerpt from the film, which I forgot. Here I learned to knock on the phone on the phone, when the person at the other end did not see things in my opinion. I have done this several times over the years, but by now forgot the source. Well, I have to be good for another thirty years or so. <br /> <br /> Of course, you must pay tribute to Gary Busey for his image of Buddy Holly. Seeing him today, one could never imagine him as a sophisticated rocker with horn-rimmed glasses, but it was a characteristic of the strength and performance that brought the Oosse Blouse. Don Strood and Charles Martin Smith are competent as members of the Buddy group, although their characters have faded into the background. I enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were included in the picture, such as Sam Cook and King Curtis, without even stopping at their presence. <br /> <br /> I will always be a fan and follower of the music of the fifties and sixties - the “oldies” they now call. I think it makes me a little old-fashioned, but you can't replace the experience of growing up with a musical story that is now coming out on the big screen. This only confirms the idea that I will continue to enjoy music until the very day I die.
