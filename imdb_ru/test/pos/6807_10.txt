I am 13 years old and I write this review at the entrance of my mom. She will write her review later. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite movie of all time. He was filmed in England in 1944. I watched it so many times when I was little that I shot a videotape. I love this movie, and it changed my life! Beautiful landscapes. Mighty pie with a fat thoroughbred horse. A simple little Irish village with a young girl who wanted to do something that no other girl did is compete in the Great National Steeple Chase in London with her favorite horse, the Pirate. All this made me want to ride horses (which I have been doing for 7 years) and find out everything I could about their breeds, so that I could draw and draw them. This is a terrific movie about how to win, despite everything, overcome your fears, believe in yourself and achieve difficult goals by working very hard. In addition, the horse racing scene was one of the best ever made, and I saw a lot of movies with horse racing. I never get tired of watching this movie. Everything is perfect. Especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses!
