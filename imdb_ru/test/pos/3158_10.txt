I like movies that show real people "Americans" and tell the truth. The film is simple, and this seems to be the most interesting. He played here in Norway, excellent (Amazon says above that this is the USA / Kanda, but the box says "All regions." I have to say that this is not for American audiences. He played here at the World Raw Views theater. I saw it and later I ordered it. The cut was different and much better. Look at it and you will love it or maybe hate it. Sorry Bush lovers, but this film drives you crazy because it makes sense. Get mad and hate This. I do not agree with everything in it, but I, for one, support it. It is not for empty minds. It is too long I'm happy to keep up with it, but from the second viewing it makes more sense. I loved the words of Owen, and the poem made me cry.
