We start all our reviews with the following information. Over the past 15 years, my wife and I watched nearly 100 films a year. Recently, we were honored to receive passes to any film at any time for free! Thus, we can see everything we want, whenever we want. The bottom line is that CRITICISTS count on ZERO. Your local critics or national critics, such as Ebert, are really no different from you or me. The only difference is that they write about the film and are forced to watch hundreds of films, whether they like it or not. Therefore, we believe that if you get your money in two hours of pleasure, that is enough for us! We NEVER listen and read critics. We only care about our friends and those we know, like us. Good enough about that. <br /> <br /> When Meryl Streep, the head of the NSC in the film, says: “The United States is not tortured,” this film laughed a lot. This, of course, is a lie that the Bush administration has repeatedly rejected. This is a very good film, and it’s scary what they can do with us when we lose all our civil rights. They can just “grab” you anywhere and tell one that they did it. In this case, they kidnap a person whose name is similar to those who killed thousands of people 9-11. He, of course, is the same as you or me. And so they take him to a secret place outside the United States to torture and put him in the water. <br /> <br /> Very scary. Well played Jake, Reese and the entire cast.
