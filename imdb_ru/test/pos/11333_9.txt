How do you describe perfection? Love mood! Maggie Cheung and Tony Leong practically dance on the screen and give star performances that stay with you a few hours after you left the theater. Each scene in the film echoes the powerful combination of excellent cinema and frame selection, first-class action and sensual soundtrack. Nat King Cole, singing in French, absolutely sets the tone for the entire film. Maggie and Tony look amazing, Maggie loafs in some really glorious cheongsams, and Tony always looks great. I have seen this film several times already, and every time I see it, I find something new to admire. Love it!
