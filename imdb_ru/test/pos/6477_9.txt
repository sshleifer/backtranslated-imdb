It is difficult to imagine in our time how popular and how strong the Norwegian immigrant and chemist would have an impact on the American public, and how serious his national tragedy was his sudden death in 1931. But Knut Rockn was an extraordinary man who revolutionized and popularized college football and put on the map a small, little-known Catholic college. <br /> <br /> I heard fragments of Rockn's famous speeches about pep, and it's strange how Pat O “Brian understood the voice and intonation perfectly well. In what turned out to be his career role, Pat O'Brien captures Rockney's honesty and morale. Rocky is well helped by Gail Page as Bonnie Stiles Rockn, who complained that her house was a training camp for Notre Dame, but never drove anyone out of her house. <br /> <br /> Rockna’s first influence on football was a player with Notre Dame not a coach. One fine day in the second half of a lost football match against the much-loved army team Rockney and team-mate Gus Dorays, played by Owen Davis, used a forward pass as an offensive weapon. Before that, football was just a game where you simply took the big guys to your side and ran through the defense. Rockney did not invent the front passage, but he popularized, and football became a strategy game, and also a muscle after that. <br /> <br /> Rockne knew how to work with the media. These well-advertised conversations about his vivacity not only inspired his players. They received wide publicity, and in large part thanks to him that American football became the main sport in that golden age of sport in the turbulent twenties. <br /> <br /> Ronald Reagan plays a small but key role. Like George Gipp, the first player that Rockney coached to achieve greatness, Reagan not only achieved good results, but also received a name that was useful in his subsequent political career. That deathbed scene that Rockney swore was accurate, became the Republican's battle cry, as many losers of the Republican Party came out to win one for Gipper. <br /> <br /> I still remember the widespread photograph in 1981, which was one of the first restoration of President Ronald Reagan at the final exam in Notre Dame with his old friend Pat O'Brien. Reagan always considered O'Brien and Dick Powell of all the Warner Brothers stars of that period to be the kindest and most encouraging for a young player in a game trying to succeed. <br /> <br /> Notre Dame itself owes its prestige to Rockne. It is possible that Notre Dame would have been an incomprehensible small Catholic college without the reputation that football brought to it. <br /> <br /> Although George Gipp and the later famous arena of the Four Horsemen must have had their place in the sun, Rockney, who had a reputation. It is not by chance that Warner Brothers were able to get Amos Alonzo Stagga, Glenn “Pop” Warner, Howard Jones and William Spalding, contemporaries and trainers with great reputation in their own right to perform in Knut Rockne, all American. It was a way to honor the guy who was number one in his profession. <br /> <br /> I think that more than football fans will like Knut Rokn, all American. Although you can become one after watching the movie.
