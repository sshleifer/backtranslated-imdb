An extremely good cinematic story about gays, embittered by a former teen star, now waiting tables. Sexual vagueness is investigated here with a real human face. That, and throw the serial killer on the loose, and you have love and the person remains. A well-depicted drama, a strange sense of humor and a mystery. The script is smooth and believable. The performances are much above average, and the plot in the plot is sharp. <br /> <br /> This, of course, is far from a perfect idea of ​​the film, but for those who appreciate something different and beautifully written, very worthy of your time. Highly recommended.
