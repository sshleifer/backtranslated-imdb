To date, there is not a single film that I have seen more than Chipmunk, and no film has brought me more happiness. It is by no means the best film or even the best animated film, but for 1988 to an 8-year-old girl it was the coolest, funniest, most exciting film in history! I am still equally impressed with the musical numbers, each of which is an outstanding song with surprisingly dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of pop music of the 80s (remember Pat Benetar about helium, just catchy). <br /> <br /> The controversy was caused by the frankly impressive tone of Chipett's song “Gettin 'Lucky With You”, which at that time seemed to me much more innocent. However, looking at it as a reasonable adult, I can fully understand the problem; you have three young girls in scanty harem outfits, passionately declaring that "lucky - that's the point." The Chipetts were definitely sexualized ten times for this film. <br /> <br /> But this controversial issue does not even come close to overshadowing the otherwise fabulous animated adventure for the entire length of Chipmunks, I urge parents and childless adults to check out this movie. Especially if you were a child of the eighties / early nineties, like me. :-)
