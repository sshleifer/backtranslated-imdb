Hal Hartley’s participation in the European film series is one of two or three of his best works to date, and, fortunately, one of the few available on DVD. In the 63rd minute of my run, my only argument would be with Hartley, whom I always left wanting more, but not as much as this time. Martin Donovan is amazing like Jesus. PJ Harvey is beautiful and interesting, like Magdelen, but the star for me was Thomas J. Ryan (Henry the Fool) in the role of Satan. Hartley gives him a great dialogue and the ability to use his loud voice for full effect. Look for three scenes in which a microphone is waiting for him, as if the devil is about to win a poetic blow. I read other comments on this film and had to add my own, because there is not enough praise. If you like Henry the Fool, Martin Donovan in anything (“The Opposite of Sex”) and / or very clever comedies based on biblical ideas, do it as quickly as possible.
