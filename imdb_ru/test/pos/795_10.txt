Along with Cops, The Goat is one of Keaton’s two funniest shorts. Which makes it one of the best shorts ever made. It has a decent “plot” for short, and it forms the perfect line on which you can hang some great jokes. Keton is mistaken for an escaped convict (a classic mistake), and then he must escape from power. Best fun - a line of bread and so on. N. Elevator.
