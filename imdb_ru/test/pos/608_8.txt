Naruse is usually considered one of the 3 main founders of Japanese cinema, the other two are Ozu and Mizoguchi. This is an interesting and honest film about the life of retired geishas. What happens when such a woman grows old and loses her charm and mysticism? Well, for those who are interested, watch this movie. One: Okin, succeeds as a lender, but the other two are forced to borrow money from her and take offense. Okina has no children, while others have. Okin learns that her old love is visiting her, and is excited. Naruse is a master of subtle research on the characters of his heroines. Banguik ultimately attracts the viewer to the study of the issues of happiness and the value of life. Very good movie indeed.
