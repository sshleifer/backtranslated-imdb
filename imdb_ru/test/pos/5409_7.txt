The kinks warned about media heroes. Outside the cinema, most of the characters are also "ordinary people." Society requires some role-playing, but what happens when it extends to the relationship between parents and children? Do parents try to improve themselves through their children, and not vice versa? How do you provide a role model but not a role? A brilliant swimmer who hates swimming; brilliant musician who will not play. Unique, funny (despite the description of "serious" problems), a very good multi-faceted game of all. A lot of plot twists complement the emotional tension. Celluloid heroes never feel any pain. I don't remember ever being disappointed in the Sigourney Weaver film (I even liked The Village!).
