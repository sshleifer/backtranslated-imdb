In any case, William Girdler was an opportunist who wanted part of the action as to what was popular for a time. I mean, a film about explosive exploitation in Louisville, Kentucky ... who would have thought so?!?! I can only imagine the enthusiasm that he must have made Pam Greer, a rather hot subject, appear in his picture. If you are pretty familiar with the genre of Girdler's Sheba, Baby does not necessarily deviate from the formula. Despite the change of place, the film still tells about the ruthless businessman nicknamed Shark, who works with credit companies, using puppets to threaten them in order to get their signatures. <br /> <br /> Greer is Sheba Shein, a former Louisville police officer who works in Chicago, who returns home at the request of his fatherâ€™s partner, Brick (Austin Stoker, assault on the 13th precinct). Sheva's father, despite the shark's hooligan tactics (... his man in the city is the Pilot, a sneaky gangster equipped with puppets who are not so formidable, quite playful by nature, so thin-skinned that they hire hired killers outside the city to shoot the building Shayne Loan) will not give up his company, and ultimately it will cost him his life when a warning with the help of brute force will lead to his death. Sheva will avenge all those who are guilty of the death of his father. In other words, Shark's ass is grass. <br /> <br /> Enough to see Grayer with a magnum to sell this particular film, and the novelty of the production in Louisville is part of the package. You can even see a chase on a speedboat, Greer in gunfights with gangsters (... not necessarily the most polished look that could have been seen in Chicago or New York during this period during the hacking) , torn by firearms, and colorful characters (such as the meager pawnbroker's dress for pimps called Walker and Pilot, who is one of the least scary thugs you will probably see) drinking in contact with a very angry Sheba. The plot itself is not something special, but Grier is always worth a look, and Girdler organizes many action sequences to entertain his target audience. Modest success for Girdler and one of his more advanced films.
