You have to love the spaghetti of the western universe. The vision of the West, where the good guys are shooting point-blank without warning, cartoon villains chew the landscape in extreme close-ups, and in the end the anti-hero leaves the girl. Many people call films Korbuchchi "depressing." I find it a little tricky as far as descriptions go. I think that the sad and implacable are more appropriate mainly because “depression” implies a level of sentimentality that almost every director of Eurowwest ignores in favor of drawing characters in broad strokes. <br /> <br /> GLI SPECIALISTI should be seen in all its widescreen fame before it can take its place in the canon Sergio Corbucci. This is a beautiful film. And it makes sense that Korbucci wanted to blow off steam with COMPANEROS after a steady one or two blows of BIG SILENCE and this (although later he will return to his usual tricks with dirty voices of Sonny and Jed). There are still a certain number of caricatures that distract from the general gloom of the film, although it hurts more than any benefit from the unnecessary inclusion of three children dressed like hippies running around the city in search of gold and trouble. And it hurts that Mario Adorf plays the Mexican one-armed gangster El Diablo just as he always plays his characters. <br /> <br /> In addition to these minor issues, there is more than enough to soak the taste of spaghetti. fan. Election skirmishes, the population of an entire city is reduced to crawling naked in the mud, a typical cult tactlessness of a laconic anti-hero (played by Johnny Holliday), the moral bankruptcy of almost every character in the film. Korbucci may never receive the recognition of the more famous Sergio or the American patriarchs of the genre, but we all know that this is very unfair to a very talented director. His dynamic selection of shots, the deep staging of objects sticking out next to the camera and retreating in the background, his desire for a fast pace and hectic energy in advancing history that was not always so long as he photographs open spaces, everything that if Corbucci was an American and appeared 15 years later with Mann and Hawks, critics of Cahiers du Cinema would praise him as an author worthy of serious critical consideration.
