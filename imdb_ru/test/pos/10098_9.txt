This is not an ordinary hack-and-slash film with orchestral bites, created so that you are not afraid of anything in particular. The Tale of the Two Sisters slowly creates an atmosphere of terror, the horror of the unknown and the fear of things that shy away from explanation to the very end. Even when the final conclusion is revealed, it is not so harsh and obvious as to make the entire film carefully fall into place. The film requires the viewer to think about what they saw, and try to reconcile it with the frightening revelation of the final scene. Some things will still be open to interpretation, and this is one of the joys of watching a movie like this. <br /> <br /> The true fear of The Tale of Two Sisters is not about shocks or obvious fears. ; it is a psychological, heart-rending horror that defies agreement and extends the genre to proportions that have not yet been explored by the traditional horror film.
