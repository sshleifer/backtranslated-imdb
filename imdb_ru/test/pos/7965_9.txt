I was very happy and at the same time very surprised by other positive comments written by non-Koreans below. This film is amazingly heartbreaking and shows a very “sad but warm” outlook on life, typical of Koreans. I thought that other foreigners would not understand this delicate feeling and underestimate this silent film as boring, but I was wrong. Attraction of this film can be difficult to avoid and foreigners. (Even without subtitles ...) <br /> <br /> I would like to mention some points that others have missed. Of course, this film depicts the love between a man and a woman. However, the topic itself goes beyond that. Actually, it is about time, the value of memory and death. In this film, the focus is not on the “love affair” between two people. As noted by some, they do not kiss, they do not embrace, not even holding hands. So the love itself is not complete (positively or negatively) in the film. Rather, what haunts Jungwon (lead actor) is his impending death. He is running out of time, he cannot keep him, leaving behind some, including his father and, of course, Darima (the maid). So the problem is how he can meet with death and leave something valuable in his short life, and not how he can make love with Darima. <br /> <br /> This theme sounds very familiar to us. There are many films about patients with an incurable disease, such as The Love Story. However, what makes this film outstanding is the way Jungwon deals with his death. He is a loser, but he tried his best while he was alive, in a silent way. He does not tell anyone about his death. He hides something in his mind, but without rage, hatred, revenge. He just tried his best while he was alive. Such limited communication and obedience to fate is typical Korean thinking, and most Westerners do not understand or, at best, misunderstand. <br /> <br /> This theme is very effectively expressed by the director of this film (surprisingly, his debut). Some say that it was strongly influenced by the Japanese director Ozu Yasujiro, who shot Tokyo Story. Indeed, I remember, I read in some magazine that the director himself admitted that he was influenced by Oz. I am not so knowledgeable to analyze his style compared to Ozu, but they have some common features, and some do not. The low viewing angle and the static camera especially remind us of the Ozu style. But, again, from the point of view of the theme, this Korean director seems to have a warmer and more encouraging vision. <br /> <br /> This is condensed with the latest photo of Jungwon. I think a very well done and truly heartbreaking scene. In fact, the director first came up with the idea of ​​this film when he participated in the funeral of a very famous Korean folk singer who died young from a mysterious suicide. They say that he saw a photo of a singer at a funeral and thought about a film about death and memory. (And, perhaps, I hope for the remnants, I think ...) <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone deeply interested in cinema and Korean culture. This film, in my opinion, can compete with other films, such as the history of Tokyo and a kind of “American beauty”. It is great if without a language barrier. The DVD version will be released on the market in February of this year, so it may be a little useful for foreigners with English subtitles.
