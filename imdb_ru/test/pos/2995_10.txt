First of all, I'm not one of those who are crazy about movies. I saw Friends in the 70s when it was first released. I was about 17 years old at the time. Even now, at 50, I still remember some scenes. The film is sweet and sad, and in fact it may be too boring for teenagers today, but I liked it. The story of the innocence, purity of young love and the determination of two young people to make a better life for themselves than at home. At that time it was quite risky to make a film about a couple of young fugitives who successfully made a house and gave birth to a child on their own. I'm not surprised that the film and soundtrack of Elton John are almost unknown today. The music is beautiful. It was unforgettable.
