I love this movie .... one of my favorite! It was the first movie on the big screen that my mother took me to watch when I was 9 years old. I highly recommend it to every African American. This story is about love, trust, problems and everyday life of a black family. All the actors worked well together. I would like it to be in the video, but at the moment, it is not available, which I know. I caught it on TV a few years ago and recorded it, so whenever I wanted to watch it ... I have it! The soundtrack is amazing too! Must see!
