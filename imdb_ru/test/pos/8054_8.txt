** SPOILERS ** A shocking but true story of the horror that struck the border town of Alabama / Georgia Phoenix, when it was captured by a gang of organized hooligans who turned it into the City of Sins in the south. <br /> <br /> In connection with the sharp increase in crime and the inability to appeal to a group of interested citizens, the respected lawyer of Phenix Albert Patterson, John McIntyre, will run for the post of state prosecutor. Phoenix's criminal element does everything from intimidation to outright murder to prevent voters from getting Patterson’s candidacy, which he still wins in other 86 states, not including Russell Phoenix, which gives him just over 1000 votes. <br /> <br /> Horrified by the actions of Patterson, when he takes the office of the head of the Phoenix-mob Rhett Tanner, Edward Andrews, he was hit. Patterson is shot while driving to his office, but his killers are spotted by Ellie Rhodes, Catherine Grant, who soon becomes an Tanner’s next person through an informant in Patterson’s office, who will be the victim of a murder. What Tanner and Co. did not expect was that John, Richard Keely, the son of the late Albert Patterson, heard from Ellie about the murder of his father before his boys could shut her up! This serious miscalculation on the part of Tanner will ultimately put an end to both his criminal organization and his freedom! <br /> <br /> Powerful documentary about the criminal style with the participation of real people who participated in the events, in 15 minutes, at the beginning of the film, to tell their stories. And this is despite the fact that they were still in danger of being killed by the Tanner crowd, which was still at large during the filming of their interview! <br /> <br /> After completing what his brave father began, John Patterson single-handedly brought the History of the City of Phoenix on the front pages of state and national newspapers, giving Tanner a very negative publicity that he had tried so hard to avoid. Now that the Alabama National Guard is flooding the city of Phoenix, hungry for blood, not wanting to confront people in arms, Tanner Mob has evaporated out of sight, like the morning mist after sunlight hit him! And with John Patterson, who is now taking the place of his murdered dad as the new Attorney General of Alabama, you can be sure that Patterson Mob has seen his last days pushing people and killing them. The only thing they will see now in the future is the gray prison walls and bars that will become their home as a sweet home for the rest of their lives in their rotten and pitiful life! <br /> <br /> This is probably the most brutal graphic image. The film that comes out of Hollywood before that time, “The Story of the City of Phoenix,” pulled no matter what, showing how a group of lawless and powerful criminals could transform The American city is a real hell for all who live in it. No one was struck by these ruthless gangsters who did not even think twice when it came to killing even women and children, if that was what they needed to keep them in power! As for the Phoenix City Police Department, they had a better job than complying with the law, which they swore and paid for compliance. They had no coffee and donut, while their city was burned on the ground by such gangsters like Tanner, who had them in their hips pocket!
