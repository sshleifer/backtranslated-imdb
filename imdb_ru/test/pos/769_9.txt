Lessons learned - a small film that sneaks up on you. What at first glance seems like a fluffy meaningless British-style comedy is a very good story about coming of age and the need for significant friendship between both young and old people. The writer Jeremy Brock (“Mrs. Brown”, “Charlotte Gray”, “The Last King of Scotland”) here runs his own script, and the result is a coherent, gradually incorporating a tale filled with exciting and diverse characters, each of which is performed by sterling actors . <br /> <br /> Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint, firmly in the role of director Harry Potter) is a quiet, simple poetic seventeen-year-old boy who lives with his bird and watches the vicar's father. (Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessed obsessive, tough, evangelical kind mother (Laura Linney) in a house where “people in need”, such as Mr. Fincham’s (Jim Norton) murderous disguises, take precedence over family issues: by the way, mother has an affair with priest Peter (Oliver Milburn) using Ben as cover! Ben sad, among other things, is trying to learn how to drive a car. His mother is a bad teacher and decides that he needs professional lessons, and she needs to get a job in order to pay for the needs of poor Mr. Fincham. Ben follows the advertisement and meets the lady Yves Walton (Julie Walters), an elderly actress who is as insane as any other character. She hires Ben, and the fireworks begin. Through a series of incidents, including a trip to the camp that Evie requires of them, both learn life lessons absent from each other's nature: Ben learns self-esteem and self-confidence, and Evi finds a true friend who will allow her to give up his stagnant facade and be expensive the man she hid. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, always offering the best qualities of acting in every character she creates, finds here a role that is not similar to any other: she is wildly wild and attractive. Rupert Grint - this is exactly what you need for a mature ben. The chemistry between them is as delicate as in the classic film Harold and Maud. Laura Linni, as always, is a great actress playing a role that is completely different from her usual repertoire. And the auxiliary composition is a panorama of excellent characteristics. This film is a delightful surprise that will surely warm the heart and entertain those who love good writing, directing and acting - and a message! Grady harp
