Extremely adorable Suzy Delaire plays a stately performer obsessed with success in the theater. Her husband and accompanist, played by Bernard Bleere, is a discreet but jealous person. When he learns in a less than preferable way that his bright wife has scheduled a meeting with a depraved old businessman with the intention of advancing in his career, he loses all control and threatens the businessman with murder. Now, at this moment, I have to stop describing the film for you, because it rolls on such thin ice with its curves, revelations, ambiguities and uncertainties that would mean putting it at risk to imply any of this. I'm not sure how good or bad it is for this French police procedure coming from the song and dance community, although of course it’s interesting that we know who did not. We just don't know who did it. <br /> <br /> The story depends on the procedure for following the prompts, when ideal alibis fail and where carefully crafted fabrications and frauds are destroyed. Interestingly, this is an unknown film, in which anxiety is created, despite the fact that it is traditionally thought of too early. <br /> <br /> Jewelers' Quay is the least gloomy of the films of Henri-Georges Clos. It is nowhere more ominous than the shocking Les Diaboliques, as tragic as the exciting Fear Wage or as creepy as Le Corbo. Perhaps this is due to the vibration of the dance halls and theatrical installations of France of the 1940s, all of which are the medium of this criminal thriller. <br /> <br /> Kloso understands and approves of his characters, even the more rotten ones, where he has a more vengeful streak with his other films. Where he may have understood the intrigues of women in Les Diabolique or truck drivers who descend to the level of horrible death to drive themselves out of a miserable life in The Wages of Fear, there is not necessarily support or agreement about the director’s part, because these are characters who explicitly made direct decisions determining their fate. All the characters of this more placating film have scenes and moments that fascinate us, even the harsh, cold detective played by Louis Jouve, who worries about his young adopted son against all the troubles and despair that happen in his life at any time. with a hood. <br /> <br /> There is humor and shameless sexuality, the latter mainly from Dehler, who to some extent neutralizes pressure. Clouzot quietly engaged in his craft, patiently, until he made his inexorable later films, in which he would not allow his audience not to forgive from the strain.
