I won't go into details, but Showtime was a pretty funny movie. There were no funny slapping scenes (as I remember), but there were moments. The cast is pretty good, Robert De Niro is good as usual, and Eddie Murphy performs a pretty funny performance. Rene Rousseau was just beautiful in the film, there are no complaints. There were two characters in the story that I liked, and they explained little. The first was Trey Sellars' friend (Eddie Murphy) in the gym where Ken Campbell played. I assumed he was just a friend of Trey, but I wanted to know more about him. Another character I liked was a colleague / partner of Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro), played by Nestor Serrano. I think he was just another cop who worked with Mitch Preston, but I wanted to know if he was his partner or not. I think maybe I put too many thoughts into the film, I mean, after all, it's a comedy ... who do the characters care about? I think I do though. I was really glad to see that it was directed by Tom Day, who also sent the Shanghai Noon. Since I saw this film, I have been looking forward to his next work. I think he did a pretty good job with this film, and again I look forward to his next job. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a good movie, but I wouldn’t recommend paying the full price for a ticket if you are not stubborn Robert De Niro / Eddie Murphy / Rene Russo. It was worth seeing in the theater, but not at full price, I would recommend watching it at the price of a matinee. <br /> <br /> In addition, here are some movie trivia for you. The guy who played the cameraman, played by Judah Friedlander, is the guy from Dave Matthews Everyday music video. He was also a clerk in the movie Meet the Parents, which also starred Robert De Niro. ... And on top of that, he also played Derek Zuolander’s brother in The Zoolander (both The Zoolander and Ben Stiller's star Meet With Parents). Just useless little things for you. <br /> <br /> I hope you enjoy the movie. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> - Chris
