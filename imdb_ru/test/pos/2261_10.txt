If you have ever been to Ukraine, this film is absolutely funny. From teenagers wearing gold chains, listening to hip-hop and break dancing on the side to jokes about airbags in cars and waitresses in complete shock from meeting a vegetarian, this film really captures pieces of Ukraine that you will never know if you don’t there. I spent most of the movie, nodding my head and thinking, “Yes. That's for sure". Very fun, if you understand Russian, because subtitles do not always do it correctly. The actors are so believable, and Elijah Wood perfectly plays the role of a socially inept Jewish child. My favorite character is definitely Sammy Davis Jr., the grandfather, the guide dog, a truly psychopathic border collie. The characters are so eclectic and pleasant that you believe that they are real people.
