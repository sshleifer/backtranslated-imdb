Let's face it, a lot of bad movies are being shot all the time. For those people who work in the cinema, you probably spent a lot of time and effort on many of these wonderful stories. Sometimes, and this is my opinion, the act of making a film is important for us. Tell a story (no matter how simple and unreal it is). In addition, the collaborative process is one of the key characteristics that are unique to film and theater. To deliver the production of any caliber requires talents of a different number of people, depending on its scale, to bring its history to life. However, the most intriguing part of American cinema is not a film that is being shot. It is the film director, as a character of his own life, that requires our attention. None of them serves as a model for filmmakers with whom we are familiar and worked with. But I will argue that they are the archetypes of small parts of us who are trying to be part of this cult activity of independent filmmaking. (Ok, very small part of us). These are people who live under the stones of their own lives and are just so embraced by the romance of the cinema. This leads me to my next argument. American film is breathtaking independent filmmaking. Bad stories tell (now) digital films with sloppy effects and terrible performances - because this is the best thing they can do with a budget of a couple of thousand dollars, and not a budget of several million dollars a day. This is the difference between low-low-low-production-production-studio. An independent director just wants to create a linear or even non-linear story to shoot as well as he can with the money he invests in himself and with his resources to the finished product on your worn TV. Stormy individualism materializes in any form of art. I consider this film a brilliant document of truth for many directors. And no, I'm not full of myself. Dude, these people are funny. Their problems seem fun, their characteristics are fun. The best line of the film: â€œIt's all right! ... This is normal! .... There is something to live for! ... Jesus told me about it !!! "The funny old man said a million times. The hat is removed from Tom Beach. Chicago Rules.
