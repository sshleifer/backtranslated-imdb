The 1979 film HAIR was based on the infamous 1960s Broadway musical that became famous for its infamous naked scene. A stage musical is not much more than a group of parodies, joined together with some funny musical numbers; however, for film director Miloš Forman (who won an Oscar for directing One Flight Over the Cuckoo’s Nest) and the writers took the basic premise of the plays and musical scores and created a real story to make the show more “user-friendly” for the big screen. In the film, the naive country boy Claude Hooper Buchowski (John Savage) is going to join the army and decides to spend a couple of days in New York, where he meets a group of aging hippies (Trith Williams, Dorsey Wright, Annie Golden, Don Dacus), which involves him in a group of crazy misadventures, including in pursuit of a disgruntled girl from society (Beverly D'Angelo). The story is divided into a series of vignettes, which range from ridiculous to sublime, but all of this is superbly photographed with clever use of New York places and creatively staged musical numbers (an outstanding choreographer of the legendary Twyla Tharp). Treat Williams illuminates the screen as Berger, an unconventional and energetic hippie who does his best to make Claude relax, and he suits the scene behind the scenes in which Savage plays the role of Claude, who brings wonderful sweetness to the role of Claude. Annie Golden is charming because Ginny, a pregnant hippie who is pregnant with Wright or Dacus, does not know which one of them is the father, and does not seem to care. There is one outstanding musical number after another ... "Aquarius" is a tour of Central Park, which includes dancing horses ... Williams breaks an unusual dinner in "I Got Life" ... "Black Boys / White Boys" The Dead Nell Carter and Ellen Fowley praise the ethnic virtues of men, and Easy to Be Hard is a powerful show of one of the best songs on the show of the original actor Cheryl Barnes, who plays Wright's ex-girlfriend and mother, and is beautifully photographed, well played, sung and dancing psychedelic acid film that You only have to look and see once, it will open several views, as this blind has a lot to offer to catch it all in one show.
