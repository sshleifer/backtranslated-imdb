One of the greatest tragedies of life is that Disney is so successful in everything they do. If they weren't, we could have more unique little animation gems, such as Mr. Wonderbird's Curious Adventures. The story is that the evil king usurped the throne of a place called Up and down the earth (I could have mistaken the name). Everybody hates him. His favorite hobby is bird shooting, and at some point in the past he apparently killed the wife of Mr. Wonderberd (a bird played by Peter Ustinov with typical instinct), leaving him with four young chickens to grow. Meanwhile, we see that another passion of the evil king - drawing. In particular, he created three paintings: a self-portrait, a picture of a shepherdess (with whom he fell in love) and a picture of a chimney sweep (which he is jealous of). One night, the cowgirl and the chimney sweep out of their paintings and run away together. The king’s self-portrait also crawls out of his frame and ends the real king (do you think I make this up? This is a real conspiracy) and sends the royal police after the young lovers. Then Mr. Wonderful Bird helps lovers to try to escape from the forces of the king. <br /> <br /> The plot is surprisingly surreal, and the “Up and Down” setting is an incredibly imaginary place full of tall buildings accessible only by elevators. This is an equal combination of the worlds of "Metropolis" and "1984" and the drawings of Dr. Suze. <br /> <br /> Look it up for a unique viewing experience that does not fit the standard formula for most animated features.
