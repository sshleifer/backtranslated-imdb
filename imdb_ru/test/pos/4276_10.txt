I just watched this movie and recommend it. He has a very good plot, he keeps your close attention, the acting is great, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic, and Emily Watson is also very good. Very good movie about great and unconditional love. The character of Tom Wilkinson is a person who is not prepared for the upcoming test, but he takes matters into his own hands as the story progresses, and this great actor gives an idea that makes you feel the characterâ€™s suffering and suffering. Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she only needs to take a quick look, and you all understand. I will not say anymore, because you better go down in history when it unfolds.
