Jamie Fox leads a brilliant cast on this powerful journey through the life of the blind, emotionally concerned African American genius of pop jazz Mr. Ray Charles. Although the entire cast plays beautifully, Mr. Fox earned more than just an Oscar. If it were possible to appoint an actor for several years in a row, I would have thought of doing this for Mr. Fox. Fox doesn't just play Charles, he recreates it. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for portraying Ray's mother (the inspiration for his life) and young Ray. These two provided the strongest support in the film. <br /> <br /> Charles's struggles with guilt feelings, the death of his younger brother and mother, blindness, discrimination, dependence, and success are neatly woven into the tapestries of his music. The music is beautiful, the script, as far as I can tell, is flawless, and the acting is nothing but legendary. <br /> <br /> The film's directorial method requires discussion. Taylor Hackford — the director with whom I generally have an ambivalent attitude — had to choose which aspects of Mr. Charles’s more complex and complex life story would tell his story most honestly, dramatically and clearly. Although some disagree (seemingly want a documentary instead of a dramatic biopic), I think he chose his themes perfectly. Much of the success of this film is his constant attention to several of the constant themes in Charles’s life - his deep love and respect for his mother, his need to be loved and accepted, his addiction and guilt complex, his musical genius, and his deep-rooted fear of responsibility by others. Charles is depicted as a man valiantly fighting an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could have imagined about one of the men I listened to in my old player with my father in his living room on Sunday evening, when football games were shown on TV. And nothing was coated with sugar in the Ray. Topics are promoted with strength and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama that spans all his long and illuminated life. The strength of these themes, the strong script and direction, the music and acting skills make this film one of the most enjoyable and memorable biographical films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
