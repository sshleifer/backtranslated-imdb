I would like the series not to end so soon. Although the action may not be the greatest in the world, it ends in a positive note and teaches the morals and values ​​of the audience. Hilary Swank did a good job at depicting a high school student who lost her parents, and so on. D. Miyagi was gorgeous, as in the previous 3 !! If you are not in a happy ending, this film, like the previous 3 in the series, is not for you. On this day in which we live, you cannot see enough that the bad guys get what they deserve, and the good guys come out on top. The Bible teaches that good always triumphs over evil. This is exactly what is happening in this. This is a great family movie. Please see if you have not done so yet.
