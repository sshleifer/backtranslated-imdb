The effectiveness of this picture was best proven for the target audience, namely adolescents. My 14-year-old son is so fascinated by this film that I rate him much higher than his imitator Mad City. This caused controversy in our family on issues such as peer pressure, loyalty and the right actions. Just for that, I rate this movie at 10! Parents should watch this with their teenagers and then discuss it. <br /> <br /> I really liked the intelligent dialogue and consistent play. I thought that James Remar was adequate in his role, but the cast really carried this picture. Other IMDB users praised Corey Feldmanâ€™s work, which is truly inspiring. Overall, I give this picture of my highest recommendation. Go get it!
