I think I was one of the people who found this other Roth pearl. his performance, as awarded, was overwhelming. The story that Francis Ford Coppola so eloquently told 25 years ago really unfolds gradually and leaves room for character development. Rogue proves once again that it does not have to be military to be interesting. In the most wonderful place is a contrasting story. Ruthlessness and beauty go hand in hand, and loneliness should be your best friend. This shows the more sinister past of a small kingdom of the golden age that lands on the coast, full of wealth for the country of the 1st world, if you send the right people. In general, a great directorial film from the film of Nicholas with a great cast.
