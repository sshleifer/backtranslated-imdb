This film was full of anticipation and well directed, the black and white effect made it a big mystery. Faye Emerson, (Hilda Fenchurch), who was twice married to the famous musician Skich Henderson, as well as the son of Elliott Roosevelt (son of FDR), fell madly in love with Zachary Scott (Ronnie Mason / Marsh). Ronnie wins the hearts of all the ladies in the picture, even Mona Freeman (Ann Fenchurch), and proposes marriage when he can. Rosemary DeCamp (Dr. Jane Silla) (a famous radio and television actress played mostly in the small town of MOM'S) in the 30s and 40s warned about Ronnie Masonâ€™s sick mind and his offensive childhood when he grew up what caused his love / hate relationship with women. Faye Emerson and Zachary Scott would be better stars with more rewarding roles, but their life was short in real life. This film is not subject to criticism, it is truly a great classic of 1945 to watch and enjoy for many generations!
