I'm a big fan of this movie and I found the mini-series “Children of Dust,” the version that fans should look for. The DVD version of this movie is at least 20 minutes or more. <br /> <br /> I would also suggest viewers who liked this movie to watch a book. There is a more rounded storyline with Corby / White Wolf and Rachel. , more on Black History and Buffalo Soldiers. In the series or in this film there were two plot lines. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier only shows that with age he gets better, talent only continues to grow chemistry between his character from “Gypsy Smith” and Regina Taylor, who look great. I also liked the storyline "Billy Wirth / Joanna Going", they seem to go well together. <br /> <br /> Billy Wirth, of course, is the “Model of Indian Vision.” The look, the attitude, the dream of every woman that a local hero wanted to captivate in one of these romantic novels. It also worked for me. <br /> <br /> Much more could have been done with this storyline, but it gave the viewer a brief overview of racial problems as early as the 1880s, the transition of white schools to their own school, the absence of black pioneers. set up cities in the west. Michael Moriarty (Maxwell), as always a great actor, looks like a very caring and confused teacher, not sure if “whites” should interfere with their native culture. <br /> <br /> For those who love characters and are watching them change this movie for you. I thought that the chemistry between the character of Poitiers and the character of the orphan of the White Wolf is very touching, and I thought that Wirth and Poitiers work very well together. Billy Wirth shot some of his best scenes while working with Poitiers. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I had to be nervous when I just wanted to stop and shake her up or call her “wake up and grow up”, But overall it was a great evening of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Look for a two-channel version of this mini-series; if you are a fan, you will really feel the difference.
