One unfortunate reality of post-Soviet Russia was that people's well-being had not changed much since Soviet times. As we see in the Window to Paris, most people are still depressed, as before, although they want to look for money. <br /> <br /> Then everything changes for music teacher Nikolai Chizhov (Sergey Dontsov) he finds a window that leads to Paris. He and his friends are naturally very surprised by what they find. In this film, one of the funniest discussions of Elvis Presley and Edith Piaf I have ever heard. So watch this movie. You definitely love it. This is a kind of predecessor of "Being John Malkovich."
