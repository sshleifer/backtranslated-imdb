This film is strange, but I really liked it. about a good girl who loves her bad boy and their spoiled honeymoon. he does not love her back, and he is an evil son of a bitch. he begins to love her after something really spoiled happens on their honeymoon, I won't give it up. that's weird yes !! but I think that differs from other films in a good way. I do not know what to compare with, but this is a love story. but there are a lot of fun things too. how to see james franco in a wig. I really liked the laptop, and it seemed to me like a love story. but the rest is completely different. nothing like this. Sienna Miller is really good. I saw this movie on a test screen, because I really like her fashion too. I liked her on the factory girl, but this is a better film than he was. she and James Franco look really in love with this film, and I hope that they are together in real life, but I donâ€™t know, <br /> <br /> it can be seen !!!!
