When the 70s came to an end, rumors began to spread in the entertainment industry about the possible return of Sean Connery to the role he glorified in 1962 - James Bond. <br /> <br /> Cubby Broccoli was asked onsite in Brazil during the creation of Moonraker Barry Norman BBC as he considered the prospect. It is clear that the producer reluctantly agreed with the opinion. <br /> <br /> When Moonraker opened, Bond fans were outraged at what they perceived as a cheaper character, and with a leap at Star. The war, like Live & Let Die, did with a cracking craze a few years ago. Many have publicly expressed the hope that Connery will return, if only to show Eon what a real Bond movie should look like. <br /> <br /> Years of legal battles followed. The original script, entitled “James Bond on the Secret Service” (later called “The Warhead”), was written by Kevin McClory, Len Dayton and Connery, has never been filmed and remains one of the greatest un-cleaned blockbusters. <br /> <br /> A new script, closer to the Thunderball storyline, was commissioned. It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior, best known as the man who put the camp in "Batman." He also wrote Parallax View, one of the best conspirators in the last ten years. Feeling that the script needs a British approach, Connery brought Dick Clement and Jan La Fren, the authors of the British sitcoms Probable Guys and Porridge. Witty title was proposed by wife Connery Micheline. <br /> <br /> “Never Say Never”, which opened shortly before Christmas 1983 for acceptance of critical praise; usually reasonable critics were so enthusiastic upon Connery's return that they ignored all other aspects of the film. Many have used it to viciously attack the Roger Moore series, especially this year's Octopussy. In truth, Octopussy is superior in every way. "Never" lacks excitement and spectacle, which everyone associates with Bond, sometimes it looks like "made for T.". movie. The story was made earlier and better in 1965 in Thunderball, so Never was always about to take second place. It was also hampered by the fact that he was not part of the official series, which meant that the “James Bond theme” by Monty Norman and Maurice Binder's pistol barrel logo could not be used. <br /> <br /> Like Bond, Connery is great, effortlessly returning to his most famous role. Playing for Bond, an older, wiser agent worked. Barbara Carrera got her best role in the film as the villain of "Fatima Blush", a lady whose love of murder is such that she dances after (as she thinks) the Bond murder. Kim Basinger smolders like Domino. Like S.P.E.C.T.R.E. The Maximilian Largo agent, Klaus Maria Brandauer, gives an amazing presentation. However, Max Von Sydow as Blofeld is a big disappointment. The posters created the impression that he would become the main character, in fact he only appears in a few scenes. With a stronger script, he could be one of Bond's greatest villains. <br /> <br /> “Never” promised to be a return to the early Eon Bonds, such as “From Russia with Love”, but did not bring it. The gadgets were there, but were used almost in an apologetic way. Bond's rocket motorbike was a weary trick even in the 60s. The film tried to compete with Eon's Bonds in terms of humor. A bond that saves itself by throwing its own urine sample into the killer’s face is a farcical moment that you find in the Moon Rakeer. But the nadir comes with the introduction of Rowan Atkinson as the awkward foreign ministry official Nigel Small-Fawcett. He gives an idea so overwhelmingly awful that you wonder if he thought he was in the Footlights review. <br /> <br /> The music of Michel Legrand is terrible, the man seems to have never seen the Bond film in his life. <br /> <br /> Although the film was a financial success, in a few years it is considered the weakest bond of the 80s. Connery himself was disappointed by this and had not been in a movie for several years. <br /> <br /> 1983 was a good year for the 007 maniacs, in addition to the films about Connery and Moore, George Lazenby made an amazing film. a cameo in the body for television "The Return of a Man from the USA": a Fifteen Years Later Case.
