In the first transformation scene, what is music? I heard that it was "Greeks do not get any freaks". It is right? I really liked this sound. I also liked the movie "Hyde's Got's Nothing to Hide" in the final scenes. A truly stupid film, but with lots of laughter and puns, gags and farce Madame Woo-Woo's place reminded me of some of the places I visited myself. Venus ivy has appeared in some other things that are truly amazing. She looks completely different in the film we are talking about, but her maturity did not hurt her a bit. Mark Blankfield is a bit like Gene Wilder. Bess Armstrong was beautiful and long maintained her beauty.
