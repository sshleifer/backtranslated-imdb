I have to admit that I have a particular penchant for the humor and style of telling British films, although not everyone succeeds, of course. <br /> <br /> This film made me think and left me in the end with a quiet smile on my face. It is about developing character and relationships, truth and lies, and also about whether love is enough sometimes. Some very understated actions of all the participants, especially the two main characters, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of fuss around Gosford Park, but I believe that with this piece Fellows really produced the best film, although it was not a mainstream release. <br /> <br /> A smart mature story about real people who, no doubt, have flaws, but are also capable of acts of genuine grace.
