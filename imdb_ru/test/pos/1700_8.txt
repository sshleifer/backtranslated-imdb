I have never seen “American Werewolf in London”, but this film was very interesting. When shooting it, I thought it was a horror movie, but it turned out to be more like a comedy with some aspects of horror. I thought the transformation sequences were well done, but the effects are wise, the best scenes were those where the effects and lighting were built on top of each other, well. Transformations reminded me of many transformations of werewolves in other films, but werewolves themselves are very brutal and not very doggy. Gore: I believe that there is too much in this film, which really takes away the horror, when there is blood in every frame, to be serious about violence. <br /> <br /> J. Hurst (Grade 8)
