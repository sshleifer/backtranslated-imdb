I was expecting a good movie. What I got was an even better movie. The chemistry between James and Smith is incredible. Glad to see him starring this time! <br /> <br /> The film works because the actors play their part perfectly. Will Smith is fantastic with his infinite charm; Kevin James is hilarious, and Eva Mendez ... well, let's say, she plays this bitch / sweet / annoying role to the best of her abilities. <br /> <br /> What I liked about the film is that Will Smith didn’t even try to be nice. He just was !! The “doctor on a date” had all the right movements, he spoke in the most perfect way and never went over. <br /> <br /> Fun parts are fun ... and cute, romantic pieces are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I fully recommend this movie. And no, this is not a chick.
