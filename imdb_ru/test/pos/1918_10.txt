A well-made documentary about the sailing race, sanity and the loss of both. <br /> <br /> I remembered reading Sir Francis Chichesterâ€™s story about his world tour when I was in high school and watched this movie. what was this adventure. <br /> <br /> Deep water tells an equally fascinating story. <br /> <br /> It takes a special person and a great sailor to constantly travel the world ... alone. <br /> <br /> This film perfectly demonstrates this. <br /> <br /> I love to swim, and my brother participates in J-30 races. <br /> <br /> but I could never accomplish such a feat.
