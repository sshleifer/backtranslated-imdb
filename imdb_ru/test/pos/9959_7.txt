The plays of William Shakespeare are classified as comedy, tragedy or history. Some of his most memorable - and most frequently read - creations give us pensive humor, gentle poetry and a cheerful farce. Some of them survive as unforgettable dramas of irresistible depth and seriousness. Despite this, he was able to write with unprecedented skill and ingenuity, making a great contribution to our young language. So which category is the merchant of Venice? I was very surprised to find out that this is one of Shakespeare's comedies. I have never read or seen before, but after watching this latest version of the film, I decided that this was neither. This is one of many questions that the viewer should try to answer when he comes to an agreement with what is clearly confusing and the moral tragedy is deeply disturbing. <br /> <br /> Players get to know each other quickly and easily. One of them, firstly, is Venice itself; Director Michael Radford filmed Venetian scenes in a real city, creating an impressively bright, noisy background for the work of the play. This landscape includes the young Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes), returning to Venice to see a dear old friend Antonio (Jeremy Irons). It seems that poor Bassanio heard about the princess, whose father died, and left some lottery to the potential suitors. In the island estate of a beautiful lady, three small chests are waiting, <br /> <br /> only one of which contains “images of a princess”. Anyone who can guess the right, using only the blind intuition and the mysterious teasers written on them, will sacrifice the father's enormous wealth for life. Oh, and I forgot to mention his daughter and her eternal love in marriage. Here, Shakespeare's light comedy takes on a movie. This farcical plot plot moves the plot as well as fills most of the screen time of the film, as several painful-minded opportunists arrive on the island who struggle with humor and cannot earn this very rich hand in marriage. But before that happens, Bassanio, who is very short of finances, begs Antonio to lend him three thousand ducats to pay for the long journey he must take to get a chance to win a prize. <br /> <br /> Antonio, who himself is almost penniless, must reluctantly accept humility by seeking financial help from Shylock (Al Pacino), one of the countless Jewish usurers who keep the sagging economy afloat, but subject to ridicule and harassment without end. The zealous Christian majority of the city. Thus, they live in the depths of society, and it is here that two borrowers must leave. Shylock, without hesitation, reminds both men of a certain incident, when Antonio insulted him and spat on him in the city market, and he proudly reproached this man, who, frankly, has a lot of courage and now comes to ask for help. But help him Shylock. He even erases any interest on the loan, most likely feeling that he has no reason to be concerned if Antonio can repay him within three months. However, Shylock's one contractual demand is Antonio’s pound of flesh if he refuses their consent. This is an alarming request, of course, for Antonio and Bassanio, as well as for us. But it seems that, despite its justified pride, Shylock really does not foresee that such a terrible thing will happen. <br /> <br /> So, there is a dramatic foundation here. And while the film is leaving to explore its softer side with its lottery of love and erroneous personalities, there still looms the dim prospect of the loan itself. In the end, what will become of this ominous agreement? In the meantime, we take turns to explore the true central character of Shylock. Al Pacino has enough dramatic weight to carry him here, and he does it with convincing grit and passion. Sometimes he is given a place for theatrical performances that we used to expect from such a colorful actor. But his most impressive scenes are those where he assimilates this energy, showing a controversial personality: honest, sincere and proud, but brooding, vengeful and completely ruthless. This is one of the most emotional performances of Pacino today. And while the rest of the actors played their roles authentically and convincingly, it was Pacino who actually owned the film - especially towards the end, when Shakespeare unfolds this seemingly romantic comedy with the roar of the third act. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal much here; all I can say is that it includes an initial loan — a mighty boot that was expected to fall sooner or later. And does it ever. By the end, Shakespeare put many dilemmas before his audience: seemingly intractable questions of faith, morality, law and mercy are put before us in the final scenes, and although by the end of the curtain the position of the playwright may seem somewhat understandable, we are left completely at loggerheads. Are there winners and losers in this, but have the winners earned their mining for a good reason, or have they also lost in a broader sense? Was virtue rewarded or simply neglected? Was justice fair this time? By the end of the performance, some of the destinies are painfully clear and unambiguously sealed. But the audience should be the one who really decides the sentence for all involved. And for some, the verdict is still not put on the scene. Comedy or tragedy? The author slyly veiled a tense final in the courtroom with a little fun and romantic decisions. Does he say that all is well, what ends well, or is this his final ironic condemnation? The humor of the play serves to prepare us well for such a severe accident. And although this, unfortunately, also prevents the “Venetian merchant” from achieving the greatness of many other works of Shakespeare, it is still attractive, funny and thought-provoking.
