I first saw Heimat 2 on BBC2 in the 90s, when I studied at an art college, lived and moved among artists and musicians, hoping for future success. Thus, the “Second Home” - the friendship that has developed since leaving the family home, the desire for professional excellence, strongly echoed my living reality. I was fascinated by characters, storytelling, lyrical cinematography and, above all, music. In it, I could predict the beginning of the German electronic music of the 50s: Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Can, Neue, Faust of the 70s, the sound experiments of John Cage, Walter Carlos and the British electronic psychedelia The White Noise. The composer of the soundtrack, Nikos Mamangakis, studied with Carl Orff from Carmina Burana-glory, so I found his taste in the modern electronic pop / sound effects world. <br /> <br /> I did not see Heimat or Heimat 3, so I looked at it as if it was without before or after. As someone else commented, he is epic and lyrical - historical and artistic. A lot of favorite moments, including the beautiful voice of Gisela Muller (Evelyn), Bach Daniel Smith's marimba (Juan), Henry Arnold (Hermann) playing the piano and cello Salome Kammer (Clarissa). <br /> <br /> I could write more, but this has already been said here. Why can't British or American television produce such masterpieces? The Wire was realistic, the politics and the epic scope of the city, David Lynch and Dennis Potter had creative ways to their serialized television works, but this art-house and soap in the most cinematic and sublime narrative. It is never included in the selection of critics of the best films, but it should be so. Still as poetic and powerful as when I first saw him more than 17 years ago. Every autumn I watch 3 sets in boxes for their “soft fecundity”. Inspired and inspiring.
