I was a little scared when I went to the movies to watch this movie. Indeed, it is always difficult to make a film from comics, and the first episode of the adventures of the French two greatest heroes was good, but not fantastic. Finally, it's very funny from the very beginning to the end: unexpected jokes, some animated scenes, no timeouts, great FX, great cast, great landscapes, great everything !!! <br /> <br /> However, I’m wondering how they will be able to translate all French names into English or German, because of course it’s funny in French, but how will it be in another language ???
