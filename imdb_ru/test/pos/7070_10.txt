Yes. Watch this movie if you like brave movies. This is arguably the best Mexican film ever since Midaq Alley because it’s a great cast, outrageous direction and a great soundtrack. Many people didn’t like “Cronica ??”, they think it is very aggressive, but they didn’t understand that it was just a hyperrealistic presentation of Mexican society, but so similar to all the families of the third world. I hope that Benjamin Cannes and Bruno Bichir (who gives another example of his greatness as an actor in this film) will soon gather again with the new film. Just remember how Los Olvidados (Luis Bunuel) was misunderstood when released, but now we consider it one of the best films of all time. Please get ready and watch this movie.
