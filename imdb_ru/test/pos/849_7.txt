Earth Final Conflict began as a new world, a new vision from the creator of Star Trek, something fresh and unique, full of great elements. A very good cast with extremely reliable Kevin Kilner as William Boone, an ex-policeman, begins to work as a security guard for some ambassador of a mysterious alien race (Claws) after his wife dies in strange circumstances. But soon Kilner's character joins the group with a mission to find out what the true intentions of the aliens are, why they seem so cute and care about the human race. Soon, this resistance group begins to detect the evil plans of the Claws, using people in their own problems to survive in their own destruction. As I said before, the show started great, everything was almost perfect, including characters like Daan, the original Daan was a big mystery because he seems to be a good creature, but at the same time he has his evil plans manipulating some people on the ground. Soon Zoor came, who was not bad, but ... marked the beginning of the fall of this show, because he became the first great enemy of the people, the embodiment of evil, who killed what could be something big in Daan. The first seasons end up perfectly dead from Buna, and in the second, the new lead character (Liam), a hybrid human being and Kimera (another alien race) with some very interesting abilities. He is a good substitute for Kilnerâ€™s character, so other plot lines make him better, including conflict with the Jaridians and atavus. But, as I said, the lines before the evil of the Zo'ora begins to take on more importance, the new conflicts were less realistic than the same Claws. Over time, the whole great plot of Liam's alien roots has almost completely faded with other things from previous seasons. Therefore, when the final season began, the Earth Final's initial conflict was just almost forgotten dreams, all the magic was out, just to allow some vain intentions to save the show, including the return of Kilner and Liam for several episodes. The last episode was only proof of how bad the show was with so many bad changes (although the authors of some episodes did not know anything about the first stories), this was one of the worst results I've ever seen on a TV show. It's a real shame, because Earth Final Conflict began as something unique, fresh, made up by actors, after watching so many shows from the USA, something from Canada, from the point of view of the creator of Star Trek, it was fine, but in the end everything changed for the worst. I hope that someday someone will do a remake of this show, of course, without using anything from the fourth and fifth season (except for the cast, everyone was flawless in their work). I can still dream of better things.
