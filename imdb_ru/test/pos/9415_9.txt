One funny thing I will say is that I am not the biggest fan of Seisun Suzuki. I actually saw a lot of his work (thanks to a retrospective of the film festival), and I found his films just tiny, controlled by the yakuza for my tastes. So, I went to the princess raccoon, for fear of what I was going to see. Boy! I was knocked out! Raccoon is an attempt by Suzuki to create a musical using elements of Japanese opera, mixed with many modern elements (both Audio and Visual), Raccoon is a pleasure from start to finish. Main actor Joe Ogdari proves that he is one of the hottest actors in Japan in this role. I have to admire the fact that young Japanese actors still play roles that take place in the feudal period in Japan, fully dressing up in samurai gear. The story itself becomes a bit confusing, if you don’t watch it very carefully, but even if you don’t, prepare for the treasures that Princess Raccoon has.
