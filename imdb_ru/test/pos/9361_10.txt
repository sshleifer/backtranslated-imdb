*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** In the early post-war years, there must have been something in the air that made night cities attractive for cinema. At that time, many nightly city films were made, and not only in America. One of the most notable was the film “The Odd Man Carol Reed”, an English-language film about a wounded action movie, wandering through the streets of Belfast. In America, it was noon, or, more precisely, midnight, film noir. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not really a film noir, but has noir attributes, although it uses them for its own purposes. that are related to fanaticism. Directed by Edward Dmitrik, written by John Paxton, was adapted from the novel by Richard Brooks. The book concerned the murder of a homosexual; in the film, the victim turns into a Jew. Although the film was shot as a mystery, there is little expectation in the film, since it is clear who the killer is at an early stage. What makes the film so watchable and beautiful is the memory of the city, Washington, DC, immediately after the Second World War, one of the most talented artists who worked at the time in the cinema. Unlike many nightly films, Crossfire is set up mostly indoors, in police stations, apartment buildings and night theaters. Soldiers are everywhere in the film, and most are eager to return to their civilian lives. However, from the majority of the men with whom we meet, it is felt that their personality was so shaped because of their military experience that it would be difficult for them to return to their old areas; for some, maybe even impossible. They seem to be more connected with each other than with anything or anyone else. <br /> <br /> However, some men have never truly been associated with anyone in the army. Monty's killer is one of those people. One feels that he has never been associated with his civil life, either. He is a lone wolf who needs people too. In desperate solitude, he has a sadistic mile-wide streak, and he always needs someone nearby to be a joke. The man he killed did not cause him any harm and was in fact unfamiliar to him. But as soon as Monty found out the religion of man, that was enough. In fact, he did not want to kill the guy, because he intended to “just” humiliate him and just beat him up. But since he was quite drunk at the time, Monty's fists had overpowered him. It is this act that sets the story in motion. <br /> <br /> As the movie grows, other characters quickly get into focus. The opposite number of Monty - Keels, another soldier who, although introspective, like Monty, and somewhat detached, does not harbor resentment on anyone and seems reasonable, even a friendly guy. Finley, a detective killer who smokes a pipe, compared to men in military uniform, is manly crappy, but it turns out to be more than suitable for the various and mostly disobedient soldiers with whom he deals. The actors who play these roles, Roberts Ryan, Mitchum and Young, give excellent performances, each in its own key. Ryan, like Monty, is tense and paranoid, always looking around for someone to choose; and you can feel his anxiety about becoming a victim himself. Like Keely, Mitchum is restrained, almost carefree; he never raises his voice; and he seems to be able to say more, offer more than is allowed by the script. Yang's performance has often been criticized for being too soft, but I find it deceptively strong and pleasant. He contradicts the stereotype of a hard-boiled policeman and makes the character Finley the prince of crime even brilliant. Character actor Paul Kelly gives one of the best short films in the role of "woman's boyfriend", which a soldier takes in a bar. Kelly may or may not be her husband; and he may or may not live with her, although he seems quite relaxed in her apartment. The beauty of these scenes is that nothing is clarified, and this person himself seems more than a little confused about what his role was or should be. In a sense, these several scenes form the thematic core of the film - anomie. With the exception of the detective, all the people in the film are drifting, aimless and mostly lost, some more serious than others. In this regard, Crossfire is, despite all the sermons at the end, a film about the vagueness of identity and how easily it can be lost or distorted. In this film, men move from one bar to another, participating in some strange camaraderie, their personalities merge into a kind of common American male pattern. Then something happens, something gets nailed. The word "Jew" or "redneck" is mentioned, and things suddenly become strained, and the very notion of individuality, identity outside the group, anyone who is not like them, becomes deeply offensive, even disgusting. Then, after the mood flared up and everything that excited them was resolved or forgotten, the men returned to their free, impersonal group normality, and order was restored.
