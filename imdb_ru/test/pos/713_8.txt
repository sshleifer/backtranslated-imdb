An interesting and fascinating film about "lifer" that just tries to live its days peacefully. Elements of the main character appear in later films by Michael Mann, such as Thief (1981), Heat (1995), and so on. You can see it at UCLA Media Teaching Laboratories, one of the few places in the country where there are copies available to the general public. It's great!
