As a fan of the old gangster films of Warner Brothers, I had to check it out, this is the 2nd best DVD movie with adventure classic, which also included one of my favorite films: “Scott from Antarctica”. It was made in 1939 a good year for many Warner Brothers films, it boasts a great cast: John Garfield, Claude Rains, Ann Sheridan and the children of the deadlock, who would later become known as Bowery boys on monograms. Well, the boxer (Garfield) is accused of murder, which he did not commit, and is on the run, and he is watched by a tough New York detective (Claude Raines), who ends up in a fruit gathering place run by a pretty woman )) and dead-end children (Hantz Hall, Leo Gorsy, Benard Pensley, Billy Helop, Bobby Jordan, Gabrell Dell), he later returns to boxing, but tries to keep a low profile. It was directed by the famous director Busby Berkeley, who led the eternal classics such as the 42nd street, the gold games of 1933 and the 35th, a parade of light illumination and many others. I would like to thank platinum DVD / video for releasing a variety of inexpensive DVDs that are similar to adventure classics (see my Scott from Antarctica). review) I give, they made me a criminal 10 out of 10, a great movie. I must point out that I have only seen 2 John Garfield films, this one and the body and the soul. I thought he was a very good actor.
