While both this film and the car chase signatures were demonstrated by disrespect by many critics, both are far above average. Roy Shader plays a great role; a tough, courageous policeman who works hard to do his job, despite the drivers and politicians who have to support him, and not interfere. (He played a suburban version of the same role as the police chief of the tourist camp in Jaws. Not so rude, but the same "did the job, despite the politicians" and a bold approach. If a person who does not know how to swim and is terrified that everything in the water goes to the old boat with a copycat Ahab and a nerd to confront a huge killer shark, don't dare, then tell me that ...). <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain; most villains, in fact, have some depth and complexity. This is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewing. In general, it reflects the atmosphere of some parts of New York: sandy, unsightly, often dangerous, but full of energy. History is scarce, difficult and subtle; It does the job without extraneous items. This may not be one of the greatest people of all time, but it is an exceptionally good movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own opinion about car chases. My being this one right there with the chase Mustang against the Dodge Charger in Bullitt. The Pontiac Ventura / Chevy Nova was similar to the Mustang in that it was a compact car chassis with a reinforced suspension and a powerful small V8 unit inserted into the engine compartment for a tasteless 6. Ventura / Novas was almost not respected by the resistance band, but with proper models suspension, they made affordable performance cars that could handle both on the road and on the track. The cry of those GM V8 when they wind up is music for the enthusiast's ear. I heard that this chase is criticized for "imitating" the chase of Bullitt. The truth is that these are two works by the same master Bill Hickman, who also choreographed and participated in the race for the French connection. In addition to driving most of the car chase scenes, he created a pensive, wicked presence and a good match with Richard Lynch as a pair of cold-blooded killers. <br /> <br /> Yes, “realism mistakes” are often encountered in the chase. For example, using three different roads in New York to represent Palisades Boulevard, stopping the chase in an accident with wheel 18 on the carriageway only for cars and a wonderful time, which allows all pedestrians to avoid harm. This is not relevant. Let's face it: the car chases of the movie are "unreal" in nature. However, in the films Bullitt, The French Connection and Seven Ups, Bill Hickman and Philippe D'Antoni created chases that were much more realistic and therefore more exciting than the pursuit of fantasies about flying, rolling and exploding vehicles, common in recent movies.
