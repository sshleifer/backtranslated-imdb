I was a guest at the Eddie Monroe show on September 30 and was pleasantly surprised by the story, a great game and a talented director. It was hard for me to believe that all this talent can be found in an independent film. Powerful speeches by Vario (Uncle Benny), Sarah (Jessica Tsunis) and Morris (Eddie Monroe). The cast was full of colorful and funny characters. This film reminds me of one of those films that you will remember in 20 years, and you will find that it has caused many actors to win fame. Much like the "Outsiders" where you can find Tom Cruise, Emilio Estaves, Patrick Swazi, Ralph Macchio and others. Look at Hollywood, new stars are appearing on the horizon, and they can be found in a small Long Island independent film called Eddie Monroe. Great job!
