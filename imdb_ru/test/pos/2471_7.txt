The strengths in the film were clear to the beginning and the middle part of the film. It showed how very strong, reactive power can react to resistance. Filmed in the form of a documentary, the director records what would have happened if the United States had accepted martial law. Volunteering at the “park of punishments”, a police training ground where you are being bullied and harassed, will offer you a way out of this terrible scenario. It switches between trials against those who are being charged, those who are in the park, avoiding the attention of the police, the training of officers preparing to work with these prisoners, judges in their free time and many others. It was a very strong, deeply touching film. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I encountered was its realism. Officers often hold their pistols, as if they were seven years old with a plastic toy (that is, bent at an elbow angle of 90 degrees, when someone points the gun at his face, or how one policeman creates the impression that it is difficult to kick someone when they are ') down, etc., etc.). It all starts with an honest and interesting attempt to capture the very critical state of political affairs. By the end of the film, the viewer is slowly and again reminded of the prejudices of the director and producers. Antagonist characters in this story begin as real, real people, and then towards the very end they gradually turn into "stereotypical, objectified forces of evil." The mistakes they make are stupid, the power they demonstrate is unreal, and unlike the actual police, the judges during this court hearing, among other things, are shown to make stupid and unrealistic mistakes. <br /> <br /> The reality of the film began to fall apart when it became apparent that it was just another check to make the government look bad. And this comes from the anarchist. The scenes at the end began to become more and more unreal, unreal and a thousand times too dramatic. However, for the earlier part, this promises a very moving plot.
