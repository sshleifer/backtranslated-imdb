This is one of my favorite movies of all time, if you don't like cars, then forget about it !! This film shows one of the most powerful cars of Australians - XYGTHO. Yes, so the game is not the best - it was never created to win an Oscar. The action of the machine will keep you again and again. There is a cool collection of muscle cars from the 70s and awesome Chev '57 - with a real cool cat! There is also a really cool song performed by Terri Serio, the main actor. Acting quite funny, if you take it lightly, but the tire, smoky and drag racing, is the main focus of this film. Big, fast cars with nice steel (NO PLASTIC CARS), and some steep streets. I recommend this only to people who are interested in cars, and not those who are looking for a great game.
