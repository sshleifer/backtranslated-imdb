I really like Lords Tracy. She may not be the best actress in the world, but she is pretty good at it. She plays a stupid, conservative reporter with the letter "T". This is a great little thriller that makes you wonder for a long time. Jeff Fahey is also good as Tracy's boss. I think that considering the decent break, Tracy could be the best actress. She is certainly no worse than some of today's leading women.
