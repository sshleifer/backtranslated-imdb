The two new OSS 117 films have a kind of humor that is both smart and dumb, which I find extremely funny. It really reminds me of the classic Pink Panther films, with almost as good a leader as Peter Sellers in the Jean Dujardin film. And unlike Steve Martin, who completely destroys Cluzau, Dujardin is quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> Comments on anti-Semitism films are obviously an example of complete lack of humor and understanding. <br /> Whether you will enjoy this movie or hate it, in fact, it all depends on your humor. I can not wait to continue!
