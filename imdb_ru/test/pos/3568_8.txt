“When I die, someone will bury me. And if not, what's the difference. Who cares, eh? ”Thus, the philosophy of life (or its absence) is summarized once and for all in this non-classical, but, nevertheless, gay side effect of the“ Dollar trilogy ”of Sergio Leone. <br /> <br /> In the first scene, three apparently evil militants enter the western city and with threatening eyes intimidate all the wretched normal people who hide in their homes. The observant observer will note that each of these three has a striking resemblance to the characters “For a few dollars more” from Leone. There is one guy in Eastwood's poncho, one in a black suit by Lee Van Cleef, and one seems to act like an indio Gian Marie Volonte. But this film is not about these guys. They were barely going to the city when they were shot by someone even cooler than them, the mysterious bounty hunter, known simply as the Stranger. <br /> <br /> No. it is a completely different story. <br /> <br /> In Leon’s “Good, Bad and Ugly” Obvious Copy, three militants again fight for hidden treasure. Once again there is a bounty hunter and a Mexican thug. The Stranger (George Hilton) is a super-cold-headed bounty hunter, prone to shooting people, dressed as a priest. He is after the award for the gangster Monetero (Gilbert Roland). But when the Monethero gang steals three hundred thousand gold coins, the Stranger is distracted from his usual work. <br /> <br /> To complete the trio, there is a corrupt bank manager Edda Byrne, Clayton. He also wants money for himself. But after the money is hidden, they shoot the only person who knows where they are. Now the only key to the shelter is the medallion with the family coat of arms. In the game, too, find the treasure before anyone else. And any gun can play. <br /> <br /> With a lot of firefights, fistfights and double crosses, the action leads these three to the ultimate robbery of the autopsy, a three-sided rally for the hidden treasure a la Good Bad and Ugly - but with a twist. <br /> <br /> This film is certainly not as good as Leone’s films, but in the end, who cares, eh? This film is hilarious - the nihilism of the 60s, spaghetti in the western style. There are no rules, no permanent loyalty, no right or wrong - just a treasure and everything you need to get it. And, although the film is not a classic, the ending is definitely the case. Hey, maybe we can all manage for a hundred thousand apiece. <br /> <br /> If you like spaghetti westerns, check it out. It is fast, violent and worth seeing.
