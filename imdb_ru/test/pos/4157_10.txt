This film is an impressionistic, poetic look at the experience of immigrants, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear that may be associated with emigration. These are aspects that are not often dealt with in films about emigration to America in particular and to any country more generally, and the film vividly and convincingly reflects the nervousness and enthusiasm of the poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. . <br /> <br /> They have some fantastic, unreal ideas about the United States that spread during the trip. One of them is that rivers flow with milk, an image that is depicted in a film with a poetic, impressionistic effect. The film is devoid of sound, and the silence seems to reflect the anxiety of the locals about life in America or, if not ignorance, a vision significantly tinged with superstition and fantasy. <br /> <br /> However, the film portrays with reverent realism a boat trip to the United States and the reception process that was to take place on Ellis Island. The boat ride is pretty boring, which most certainly was. The quarters in which the arriving residents sleep are depicted as being extremely crowded with beds located at a distance of four or five inches from each other and devoid of much light, which undoubtedly took place below the deck. <br /> <br /> Again, the film is not complemented by inappropriate music or overly bright lighting, and the result is a fairly realistic idea of ​​how it really was for people emigrating to the United States. The villagers cannot be worldly, but they are quite reasonable, and interaction with the senior emigrant, Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocci), with an immigration officer who insists on concrete results, is very bitter-sweet, because they are not diluted or mitigated by the benefits of syrup conclusions, and everyone sees the merging of Sicilian realism with the extensive rules that define life in the United States. <br /> <br /> Immigrants and their history are very interesting, and the combination of realism of the eyes and the magical imagination of the imagination of people create a convincing vision of the beliefs that Sicilians or any people with a small formal education who move to the United States. The game is similar to sandals; it is not at all demonstrative or ostentatious, but it seems more realistic for that. Nevertheless, all the main performers, in particular Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), the clear leader of the group is excellent. Despite the fact that he never smiles, his character’s actions speak much louder and it is clear that (fortunately) the other members of the group, his two sons and the elder Fortunat mentioned above, the boys grandmother, believe in his leadership abilities and respect his leadership . Amato gives his character greater decency and straightness, and this indicates his abilities that his character looks so capable and confident, while his character gives out very little emotion. <br /> <br /> The film’s oddity is a chance encounter with a mysterious English woman (beautiful and amazingly mysterious Charlotte Heinsburg), who speaks Italian, and during the whole movie we wonder why she goes to the United States or what attitude she has has to the unanimous Sicilian immigrant group. In the end, it is finally revealed, and the revelation is usually realistic and does not seem particularly melodramatic or spectacular. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Emmanuel Crialese, who firmly understands the realistic, though sometimes superstitious, view of the world in which his characters live and presents him competently and confidently. This is actually fantastically confident, considering how awkward realism and superstition could be combined in a film. This is a worthy study of the experience of immigrants.
