At first I didn’t think that Lauren Ambrose’s performance was unreliable, but as her character developed, the image became more meaningful.

His character development made the audience think about why the young characters punished him, and he could have been achieved more directly with <br /> <br /> The overwhelming glue to this somewhat vague storyline was Taylor Roberts’s game. Her comprehensive delivery of simplistic nature kept the film together. In this key role, Taylor was able to promote realistic family relationships between the characters, acting as an antagonist for all other relationships in the film.
