Mario's series is back, and, in my opinion, better than ever. The galaxy is the most creative marion; even more than Super Mario 64. The controls are great; one of the best for the Wii. beautiful graphic design. the levels are very large, and the good old bosses are back. in this game there is a lot of interesting; certainly a high level of reproduction cost. I have only 2 complaints: 1: the story is a bit like Mario 64. and 2: the complexity is not very high; although it requires some patience. Mario fans: the game you've been waiting for. Casual games: this game is more than worthy of purchase. 9.8 out of 10.
