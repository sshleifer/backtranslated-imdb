The plot of “Sally Sawdust” is an ordinary melodramatic plot - an orphan, from riches to riches - but the film rises above most silence thanks to three people: <br /> <br /> This is not true, of course, D.V. Griffith's masterpiece, but he really demonstrates his production in full maturity. He uses all his innovations that we now take for granted: close-ups, walk-through shots, a mobile camera and the ability to change the action from theatrical exaggeration to cinematic sophistication. <br /> <br /> W. K. Fields also demonstrates his skills - not his coarse signature supply, but his remarkable dexterity as a physical comic. He performs several inventive juggling actions that are too short to be fully appreciated, and some very clever pickpockets, but it seems that every support that is within reach is used for a comic effect - a hat, a cane, a car roof, a dog, cash. He is glad to see. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is Carol Dempster. Much has been said against this actress, but her performance here is also richly comical. At the time, she was 22 years old, she played a teenager, and her approach to the role is a combination of grace and embarrassment that may not be entirely convincing, but she does attract attention when she is on the screen - especially when she is dancing. She is not beautiful - although she shines positively in one scene where she is dressed as Talmadge's sister - but her simplicity only adds to Sally’s character, especially in many moments when she shows a very obvious attachment to Fields as her guardian / "father." Few, if any, Hollywood performers could compete with Fields when it came to comedy, but Griffith gives his lead woman every chance to compare with her partner, and Dempster is absolutely confident in his abilities.
