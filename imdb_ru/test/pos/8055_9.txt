"Phoenix City Story" is cruel, tough documentation of what was once called the "strangest city in America." The film documents the events that led to the killing of Phoenix City criminal syndicate Albert Patterson, the Alabama State Attorney, who relied on the state attorney general as a way to eliminate vice and corruption in his hometown. His son, John Patterson, raised his father's mantle after his death and won the post, making the cleaning of the city of Phoenix the main theme of his agenda. <br /> <br /> Directed by Phil Carlson created the film, which has the ability to shock even today. The gloominess is so ruthless that the film is really hard to watch. We see a crime syndicate beating and killing to get what he wants - women and children are among the beatings and murders, and especially the one scene in which the death of a little dark-skinned girl revolves, causes particular alarm. This is not a very nice movie, because at the end there is very little gain to reward the viewer for sitting among the fierce events leading to it, but it is a well-made film, full of intense and evil energy. <br /> The 15-minute prologue includes a series of interviews with real residents of the city of Phoenix, some of which are then portrayed as actors in the fictional part of the film. This gives the film the quality of urgency, which is transferred to the narrative, so that we feel that we are always watching a documentary film, a feeling that Carlsonâ€™s choice to shoot in real places helped. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I watched this movie, but this is one of those movies that fills you with a sense of righteous indignation and then makes you feel helpless because you can't do anything about it. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
