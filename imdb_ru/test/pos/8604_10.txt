This is a fairly true adaptation of the novel “Black Rain” by Masuji Ibus. Like the book, it is very touching and makes you think. The story revolves around a couple trying to see their niece successfully married. They are having trouble finding grooms because of rumors that she suffers from radiation sickness after walking in Hiroshima on the day of the explosion. Well shot, well played, touching, tragic, terrifying and funny.
