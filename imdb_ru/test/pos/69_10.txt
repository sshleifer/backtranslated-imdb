It seemed to me that this story was enough for a thriller so that the wonderful music of Henry Manchichi would not put me to sleep. Julie Andrews was great, and I don’t really understand why this film had problems at the box office when it came out, because in the end I’m just happy when everyone sings. and I love happy parties, which, I think we can say that there is some traditional Blake Edwards humor in this film ...
