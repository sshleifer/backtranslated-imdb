I have so far all the family seasons, and I have to say Vol. 6 was the biggest disappointment of them all. There is still a lot of laughter, but I think Vol. 6, as the last few volumes, slowly give less and less laughter. At least for me. <br /> <br /> The biggest annoyance I experienced to Vol. 6 it seems VERY difficult in the politics of the left wing. I really believe that if you can laugh at other people, you should laugh at yourself, but this volume really seems to throw their political views down the drain, and I think it takes a lot of the show. The insinuations of all conservative countries are terrible places, the hint that we need more control over weapons, the insinuated schools are funded, the insinuated religious people are crazy, Bush is friends with the devil ... I could continue, and this is only from the first three episodes. <br /> Of course, some of them were funny, but there comes a moment when you are not shooting a comedy, but simply imposing your political views on other people.
