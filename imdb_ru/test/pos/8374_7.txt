Unusual film for viewers outside the United States. Lena Horn looks great, like Ralph Cooper. There is no added background of tap steps like in other musicals, so you donâ€™t hear the tap rhythm, which is a great realism. The music is muffled to hear what dance steps are. Acting is a bit unnatural, and the actors speak slowly, so you think the film is older than it is. Costumes dare to time in the dance programs at the end. It often seems that you are part of an audience on a stage show. What furniture you see is very modern, which adds to the cinema a sense of the underworld. A must for all movie lovers.
