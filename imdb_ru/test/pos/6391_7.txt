During a routine mission in Iraq, a group of Delta soldiers retrieves a computer hard drive from Alkeda training camp, which details the location of Dr. Walsh’s weapons specialist. After completing his top secret weapons program, Dr. Walsh finds an alternative source of funding and creates a new research center in the depths of the notorious Belzansky Forest in Chechnya, where he develops weapons and sells them to Chechen rebels. The Deltas team sent a “black squad” mission to find a doctor and his technology before the Russians find him and his laboratory. The Delta team will soon discover that the doctors' latest weapon is a flock of large carnivorous bats that have been genetically modified to develop a taste for human flesh. I found that this film is much better than I expected. There is a lot of action and a lot of blood. This is more or less what you expect from the creature. The game is not great, but bearable. I, of course, saw worse. In general, this is a nice movie for what it is. Good popcorn movie.
