Most of the other subscribers' reactions to this service were very appropriate, although some found it to be slow or ambiguous, I was puzzled. Rather ambiguously, it was complex and multi-layered in its meanings. You can see it as an anti-war, because of the opening and closing scenes and because of the insanity of feigned greatness, how amazing the cavalry looked when preparing for the great attack in Aylau, compared to such a terrible and alarming conclusion when we see a bloody, boyish dead, etc., but basically I see a film about a moral person in an immoral society. In the end, Chaber chooses a retreat from the corrupt post-Napoleonic French world and chooses the simple pleasures provided by Derville (who himself saves his recognition of the basic decency of the Shaber and the morality of his renunciation) because of the wealth that he leaves his wife, as well as her and the dishonor of society. In her case, we can view the film as also feminist, in the position of women of that time, in which the only weapon Madame Schaber has is her charm, beauty, cunning and, ultimately, money.
