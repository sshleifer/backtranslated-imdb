This is the one that you can watch again and again and laugh the same way every time. We were at the Keaton festival after buying some of his films. In this one, Buster is mistaken for the killer who escaped, and there are many scenes of chasing and crazy scenes in him, as well as what works best in Buster - his work. The opening scene is really funny, and it just keeps going from there.
