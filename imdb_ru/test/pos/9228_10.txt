I found this film in one of my old videos after Godzilla vs. Sea Monster (which should instantly give you an idea of ​​its tone), and I haven’t seen it for a long time, so I decided to watch it. I didn’t really remember Rainbow Brite, except that I used to like a cartoon, and it was cute. Most people treat her like that. You probably do. <br /> <br /> Well, when the movie started, I wondered if it was the right one! It didn’t fit Rainbow Bright, as I remembered it. But it turns out she kicks ass! It must be the weirdest animated movie ever! I can not believe that these characters were so popular (the series is not much different), being so strange. As soon as I watched this movie again, it became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> I really don't want to give too much away. Just know that if you see a movie in a video store, rent it and see it. No questions were asked. You will enjoy it. Especially the outrageous character of the princess. And a horse-robot. And hypnotized sprites. <br /> <br /> If you can’t tell by knowledge, this is a cartoon of the 80s, which is actually a hidden hidden “head” movie! Have fun!
