Hehehe. It was one of the best funny road movies in history! I laughed and fell off the chair. With many Norwegian and foreign celebrities play themselves. Harald Zwart is a producer known for films such as Agent Cody's banks, and of course One Night at McCool's. <br /> <br /> This is a Norwegian crazy fan who is going to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. the crazy fun that comes with this. It was fun. I could not stop laughing. I have not had so much fun in the ages. Rumors say that number two will come, but I don't know. It will be hard to beat this. <br /> <br /> all recommended! This is a must see movie. I should have seen it in the movie, but I had a job at the time when it was shown. And I tried to rent it for a month, but I rented it all the time. Got it today on DVD. It's worth it.
