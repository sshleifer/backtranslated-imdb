I had the opportunity to talk with a co-author, Rebecca Kammisa, at the High Falls Film Festival 2002 in Rochester, New York. She said that her style should be completely open and unimpeded in the film industry, but she was very glad that she was so severely constrained in the crowded home of the group. Narrow corridors and small rooms were cleverly removed with realism that would have been lost with more controlled and deliberate camera work. <br /> <br /> Helen's sister is in itself a remarkable person, who came from the tragedy in her life to an unusual combination of care, toughness and street clever. The way the film introduces us to its past is wonderful, spending only a few carefully selected minutes scattered everywhere. <br /> <br /> In general, I can't begin to praise properly the praise for this film. This is really the treasure of the movie, and the subject is the treasure of humanity.
