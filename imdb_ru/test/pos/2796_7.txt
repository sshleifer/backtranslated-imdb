Cedric Clapisch's L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE film is a light, fresh charm, enveloped in nostalgia for our young and attractive young people. At its core, this is a full-length presentation of the long MTV soap opera known as The Real World, under the motto that says, “This is the real story of the seven strangers chosen to live at home and glue their lives ... so look, what happens when people stop being polite and start becoming a reality. "This is exactly what is happening - with the exception of cameras installed in every small corner of the house in Barcelona, ​​Spain, where Xavier (Romain Duris) comes to, who has to learn Spanish, h to fulfill the requirements of his work. Outside in many ways, he slowly forms a camaraderie with his housemates who come from all over Europe except America ... this is a film that shows only one American - an unattractive character with whom Wendy (charming Kelly Reilly)) has an affair with (“For sex only,” she admits, since she has her own boyfriend who looks late but dumbfounded). During his stay there, he tries to maintain a relationship at a distance with his girlfriend, who plays Audrey Tautou, while he begins a test flirt with the wife of the owner of the Spanish house in which he lives, and receives some advice from the lesbian Brother House (Cecile de Frans) on how to seduce a woman. L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE — a cute little feature that represents a moment in time that more than twenty will never be seen again — is unforgettable fun that encompasses the threshold of the “real world” experienced by Xavier's eyes.
