After my personal study of the expected “end of cycle” time of 2012, represented by the Mayan calendar system, I believe that this film should be watched in the same way as “What do we know?” communicate only at the doctoral level, “say”, “Elegant Universe” overcomes such barriers. Visual effects and the selection dialog make it easy to understand this step in the history of physics. There are numerous messages in this film, at least academic science should always be ready to revise what is being taught. True, the science of pure discoveries is beautiful, because there is always something extra and exciting to highlight if we have the courage to look for it in the face of "established" science.
