This film by Friedrick Thor, the director of Children of Nature, is very strong. He has great Sigurr√≥s music and a good acting game. It shows how sad madness can be like a disease. There are a lot of good jokes, but humor is gloomy. If this is not a problem, you should watch this movie. Please note that this is not a comedy, but a drama.
