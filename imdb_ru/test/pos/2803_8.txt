In France, Xavier (Romain Duris) is a young economist with twenty years of experience, trying to get a job in a government department through a friend of his father. He is recommended to have a specialization in Spanish economics and language in order to get a good position. He decides to apply for a European exchange program called Erasmus and move to Barcelona to improve his knowledge of Spanish culture and language. She leaves her friend Martin (Audry Tautou), promising to maintain close contact with her, and once in Barcelona he is temporarily accommodated by the French doctor Jean-Michel (Xavier de Guillon) and his young and single wife Anne-Sophie (Judith Godres) he met in the airport. Later, he moved into an apartment with foreign students: Wendy (Kelly Reilly), Spanish Soledad (Cristina Brondo), Italian Alessandro (Federico D'Anna), Danish Lars (Christian Pag) and German Tobias (Barnaby). Metschurat). Then Belgian Isabel (Cecile de France) and brother Wendy William (Kevin Bishop) join the group, and Xavier studies Spanish and finds friendship and love in her experience while living abroad. "L 'Auberge Espagnole" is one of those films that the viewer becomes sad when he ends. This story is a delightful and funny story about friendship and love in a globalized world and a united Europe. This very charming film made me feel good and happy, although I never had to live in a student republic. Newcomer William provokes the most amusing situations in history with his big mouth and short brain. In addition, it is great to see the new approach of students living together, different from those stupid American fraternities and their stereotypes common in American films. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Albergue Espanhol" (Spanish Auberge ")
