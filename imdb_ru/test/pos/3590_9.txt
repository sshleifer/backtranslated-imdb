I confess that I was delighted with the sea and spent several years in the fleet, so I am somewhat biased in this. I missed this documentary when it first came out, but I didn’t let various people buy it on DVD this Christmas (2002), and I got it! Some of these films are amazing, and I really respect those who shoot such documentaries. Seeing the 200-ton blue whales "traveling" on the sea is an incredible sight, they look like submarines. I like the level of information and facts conveyed through the story, it’s just right, I don’t want to know science just some of the basics to see these things enough for most people. BBC is able to put things up to the mark for the target audience. <br /> <br /> Excellent documentary "World in War for Me", DVD of excellent quality. If I had a little criticism, it would be some of the obviously added sound effects here and there, I think they distract from some of the scenes. But the BBC and Discovery.
