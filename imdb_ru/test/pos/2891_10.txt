I recently bought this DVD, and I was completely shocked that Rush's songs sounded the same as they did when I first listened to them in 1980. The composition of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart is so talented that I want them to play on their list. again and again. <br /> <br /> Songs that I remember, such as Tom Sawyer, XYZ, Big Money, Trees, Free Will, Closer to Heart, 2112, Limelight and Radio Spirit ”, And 40,000 plus there were fans singing together and having a great time, and I swear that half of the listeners are under 25 years old! <br /> <br /> Writers who suppress the Rush as much as it concerns me are a bunch of envious doodles who like the taste of rancid sour cream mixed with lemonade in tacos. <br /> <br /> Rush doesn’t apply makeup, doesn’t use spikes, lip-sync, lipstick, gets into trouble with the law and brags about a band member. how long they have not been married. All they do is entertain! <br /> <br /> I give this DVD 100 out of 100.
