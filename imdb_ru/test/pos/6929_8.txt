I like Dylan Moran from his work in The Black Books, although I found that some of his speeches were really lenient in terms of long, tangled gaps ... however I was intrigued to see this film, in which he and Michael Kane acted and curiosity got better than me. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. <br /> <br /> Dylan’s vocal range and the characteristics of the different people he played in the film were absolutely impeccable, which went beyond the skills of a simple stand-up comedian and really truly on a par with Alec Guinness, John Hurt and other great people - he was really skilled in his image. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine was a very convincing prima donna and the standard British film way to have a premature child on hand to be overly wise and withering worked - the only aspect I really didn’t like was the incredible chemistry plot between Dolores and the tough cockney gangster man played by Dylan. <br /> Also, it was great. <br /> <br /> I also like the ending without interruption, where it all ended happily, but the MC was defeated. Okay, this is not really thrilled by your fools and deprivation of rights (as a real criminal boss would have done if you dropped 50,000 pounds sterling from them), but it showed at least a small degree of reality in history. /> <br /> I liked the movie, and I would recommend it to everyone, but I would also warn them not to turn it off after 15 minutes, because it started a little slow. If you do, then everything will come back. <br /> <br /> As for the oath, well, they are in Ireland. Otherwise it would not be real.
