Bill, Jeremy Theobald, inspirational writer who has not published anything yet. Bill also has a strange and strange habit, he likes to follow people. <br /> <br /> Bill chooses a stranger on the street, subway or subway, and follows them as if he is their shadow. Maybe Bill does this to help him inspire himself to write the great novel he dreamed of, or to publish his article in a major journal? Maybe this is because it fills Bill’s lonely life with purpose and even makes a person of his curiosity face in a crowd with meaning and content, as he pays attention to him? Or maybe it gives Bill someone to take care of, take care of and take responsibility for himself? Bill has a simple rule: he follows religiously when he follows someone: after you follow him to her home or work, you stop. <br /> <br /> Once Bill follows Cobb, Alex Howe, at home, and instead of following his rule of stopping, he still continues to follow Cobb. Soon, Bill will understand how right he was with the rule he set for himself in following people, and at the same time how wrong he was when he broke it. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly good low-budget film made by Christopher Noland in 1998, before he achieved great success in Hollywood with his innovative and original classic film “Momento”, which two years later became a major cult film. <br /> <br /> “Follow” is a much better movie than “Momento” because it’s a simple and easy-to-understand story. Compared to Momento, which at first was confusing, and then, when you understand what the film is telling you, it's very difficult in its reverse storyline. What makes “following” is much better, simply because it is simple, but at the same time brainy - it affects those who watch it. The film is much more direct and destructive, and you don’t need to watch it again and again to get what he was trying to tell them, as Momento did. “Following” is a story in a story in a story with one of the most amazing and easily manipulated endings if you watch the movie again and notice the clues you will ever see. <br /> <br /> Made with an incredibly small budget of $ 6,000.00, this is less than most Hollywood films spend on coffee breaks, without a name in black and white and just over an hour, 71 minutes. Hollywood as well as the film industry outside Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Noland in how a person with nothing more than talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars can't do in most cases; make an intelligent and at the same time insightful film, in which there is practically no money and no celebrities.
