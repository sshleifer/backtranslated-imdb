When I watched Cold Mountain, I got the impression that its director Anthony Minghella was intentionally trying to surpass himself, and his own film, in which he tried to win, was practically flawless 1996 English patient. films, the premise is quite similar. We have a passionate love relationship between two people who are experiencing a turbulent time of war, and they ultimately perceive the war more or less as excitement in the background, trying to find themselves again in each other’s arms. The main difference in the plot lies in the fact that the character Nicole Kidman is not married, the character Jude Law is a deserter, and the conflict is a civil war in the United States. <br /> <br /> “Cold Mountain”, in its plot, is more blurred and softer than saying “The English Patient”, and this is more for people who want a simple love story with some kind of external turbulence causing the problem. This is a shorter movie, which is a plus for people with less patience. However, this is not as impressive, original or truly exciting as the “English patient”. My * only * big complaint about Cold Mountain is, surprisingly, the love affair between the characters of Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Surprisingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. They have no real relationship; we do not feel any real passion from them, and the passion we see is more physical than emotional. I was more fascinated by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and the Oscar-winner Renee Zellwegger, as well as Jude Law's travels across the country, dodging warriors and enemy soldiers. If Minghella had reinforced the importance of a love story, then he would have, I feel, a better picture. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is interesting, even if the love story is uninteresting. The sequences of the Civil War are absolutely magnificent; they have a modern tradition that shows war as terrible and inhuman. Recreation of the St. Petersburg campaign, in which tons of explosives were blown up from the ground, and then hand-to-hand fighting followed, is terrifying. Minghella is not shy about showing blood and blood in an artistic and sensible manner, and he is not afraid to show the victims of innocence and life in these scenes. There are times when women and men are killed, often from crossfire. And that is not all. Just the sound design of the film creates tension. There is a scene where Inman and another deserter cook their own food, cutting off the head of a dead cow. We do not see cuts, but the sound effects of a blade penetrating through a bone are disgusting. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to congratulate the cast with the performances. Jude Law was awesome in the film and earned an Academy Award nomination that he received. I feel that Nicole Kidman also deserves it, although her character was a bit superficial. Renee Zellwegger had a great personality and atmosphere of theft of the screen. In addition, there are only a few details that really help to complete this stylistic world, recreating the terrible time in the past of America. <br /> <br /> Maybe “Cold Mountain” would be better as a war picture, but it would certainly be impressive, like “The English Patient”, if the script and director Anthony Minghella strengthened his love story . In fact, this is the most pleasant picture, I was not tired of it, and I recommend it. I'm just saying that his love story — although the plot’s central point — is a bit softer than it should be, and everything that was around was what really worked.
