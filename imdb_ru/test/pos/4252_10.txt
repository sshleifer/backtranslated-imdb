1969 was the year. New York was the place. Putney Swoop was Robert Downey’s second acclaimed film. The first was cracked elbows (1966). Putney Swoop achieved a much wider release. Pound (1970) and the Palace of the Griser (1972) were even more polluted and nasty. These two films were mean to the point that they actually stopped the career of the Prince’s feature film for several years. <br /> <br /> It's about Putney Swoop. And this is a crazy farce / satire to be believed. I'm not going to go through the plot here. What plot ?? People who are looking for a plot will scratch their heads. Keep on scratching! This movie is not about PLOT! You can compare it with Mel Brooks film; only without the Hollywood parody party that Mel always arranged. I also see some Monty Python in this. By the way: this film was shot before Monty debuted on the BBC !!! <br /> <br /> I notice that Gags and Lines, which are awesomely ridiculous, are NOT passed from mouth to mouth. You should see them in the context of the movie. There are some flaws in the film; but even the flaws are unique. For example: actors often repeat the same line over and over; and somehow it works. How many syllables are Mario? Putney says that Borman Six Girl should have a soul! etc ... <br /> <br /> B / w photo is outstanding. Sound / Score is even better! Editing is only so-so. The game is above average. The script is priceless. Jokes are as unaccustomed as possible: MR. “Bad news” says: “Sonny Williams just got into a motel with a 13-year-old girl,” Putney says: “At least he's not superstitious.” Beware persistent conservatives. The anti-establishment mentality of this film will lead you right out of the room. Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> In this film there are many things that relate to today: NO SMOKING !!! Reverse racism; with African Americans treat Caucasians as trash. Manipulating the media over the masses; Madison Avenue, Derou, Hollywood, deliberately pedaling on something that any eight-year-old child can say is clean rubbish; On the Internet, I'm talking about the "drum"; Interracial dating; I could go on and on .... <br /> <br /> I should also mention that there are about 8 minutes of this film, which was shot in 16mm Color. These are commercials for the Putney agency. Stains work quite well the first time. They become tedious, although on repeated views. The real magic here is in the b / w sections of the film. These are not the stage lines that they leave with you: "Take off yourselves, CHORT, CHMO." "I love you, I love you, I love you ... did you take a pill?" "All I have to say is simply superfluous." And many others. I also like the bit with the mounted minnow on the wall: “The game guard wanted me to throw it back ... I arranged such a fight, I decided to mount it!” <br /> <br /> Among the actors is Buddy Battler in the role of Putney's bodyguard # 1. He should have been a much bigger star. Antonio Fargas as an Arab. He continued to be famous on television and in films. Arnold Johnson looks like Putney Swoop. Instead, Robert Downey used his own voice because Arnold could not recall some of his lines. Downey also realized that he could fill in any additional dialogues / jokes later if he called his lead actor. <br /> <br /> The film has some flaws. The short term is one. I would like the start with the members of the Whiteboard to be extended. Stan Gottlieb and Allen Garfield are outstanding. The end seams should have been joined together, as if he simply could not think more about the gags. In general, this is one of the best low-budget independent films of its time. A time when very few Indians played outside of New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Anyone who loves satire and comedy should see it at least twice. Putney Sweep Downey is ahead and farther than time.
