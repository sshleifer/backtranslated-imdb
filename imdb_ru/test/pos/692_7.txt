This is an excellent trick from the war years. <br /> <br /> John Mills heads a series of action films from the British B-film in a single underwater attack on a fictional enemy battleship. <br /> <br /> Filmed in black and white, it is well located and well located, given that at that time there was war. In any case, this shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda. <br /> <br /> The mission of the film takes place on authentic submarines. Things are tight and claustrophobic. The actors look dirty and sweaty, respectively, without being too offensive to the heroic taste. Other commentators have already paid attention to such genuine trifles as maintaining vessel trimming and forgetfulness of reading tools, as well as actions in the engine room. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first film in which garbage (and a dead German) is blown out of a torpedo tube to deceive an enemy destroyer. And ONLY since I saw how part of the ship was exposed under the pretext of flooding - a risky game, if ever existed. <br /> <br /> I’m a bit skeptical about whether a submarine or not could make its way through the wire mesh. The speed of immersion in water was almost twice the walking speed of a person, and there would be a lot of "return" on the network. In addition, the engineer was on the same workstation and used the same levers both on the surface and under water. This also seems implausible, since either diesel or electric engines were used, and they were located in different parts of the ship - or so they told me. <br /> <br /> There was too much drama on the beach for my taste. But on the other hand, it was propaganda work, in which civilians clearly pointed out that civilians should be mindful of their behavior, since this could adversely affect morale and, consequently, military efforts. <br /> <br /> With the exception of these vanities, this is a rather interesting little adventure. Nowadays, films of this vintage are usually shown in the afternoon, while much more modern and worst films enjoy prime time. But then; it is politically incorrect to mention war in the presence of our European friends (too many of them have a conscience) or our left fascists (none of whom have ever fought for the freedoms that they now take for granted). <br /> <br /> As an underwater film, it is highly collectible. I think it is better than “Enemy lower”, although less clearly. Not as authentic as Das Boot, but not as rude.
