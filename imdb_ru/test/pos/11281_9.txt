God cut himself with a straight razor, after which he gives birth to mother earth, which then gives birth through the sperm of the gods, the son of the earth. <br /> <br /> This is an hour and a half film depicting a dark version of how God created the world. It is surreal, gloomy and poetic. The most important aspect of the film for me are the visual effects. It was shot in a very grainy black and white film, using both slow motion and normal shooting. Sometimes even a quick movie and stop motion. The scenes are long and drawn out, which creates a very strange mood. When shooting, no sound was recorded (I think), later sound effects were added, such as cricket, water and other surrounding sounds, repeated over and over. As you probably understand, this film is definitely not for an impatient person ... <br /> <br /> I often felt that he was like David Lynch's Eraserhead, only this one is even harder to understand and more tight but this is normal me, i like these things. This, of course, is not entertainment (at least, not Hollywood), so if you are going to check it out, I recommend you prepare for it. Be open-minded, and, moreover, something like the end of 2001: a space odyssey.
