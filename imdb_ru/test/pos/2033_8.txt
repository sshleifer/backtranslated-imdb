I have to admit, I did not expect much from this film. I was surprised that I really enjoyed it as much as I did. The script was not an Oscar, but it was not terrible. The game was gorgeous by Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston played a great secondary role and looked great as always. What made this film for me was music. If you don't like the 80s glam metal or hair bands, then you probably won't like this movie. It's all about being a rock star. Some clich√©s were present, but the film did not break at all. I would recommend it to anyone who loves rock and roll and does not forget to get up and scream !!! 8 out of 10 for a great game and amazing music. <br /> <br /> Jason
