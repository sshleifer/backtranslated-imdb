“Alexander Nevsky” is a series of excellent sequences of cinematographic opera, which go from pastoral to deplorable and end with a triumphal cantata. The story takes place in 1242. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) defeats the Teutonic knights in a battle on the ice of Lake Peipsi. <br /> <br /> The film is a magnificent historical contest in which director Sergei Eisenstein is at his most imaginatively imaginative, and culminating moment in an excellent battle sequence, using music instead of natural sounds. Several films have scenes strongly influenced by the Battle of Lake Peipsi, including Doctor Zhivago (1965), Mulan (1998) and King Arthur (2004). Alexander Nevsky did not get into circulation due to the change of political winds, and then was assigned to perhaps the most influential historical film of the Soviet production.
