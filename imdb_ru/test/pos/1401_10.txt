Of course, most people will call Fishman Island a stupid and crappy hock, but can you honestly name another movie that puts forth a REAL topic? This Italian gem means pure entertainment and includes such things as voodoo, volcanic eruptions, mutant fish, the mysterious continent of Atlantis, a treasure hunt, a remote island filled with deadly traps and completely insane scientists! All this and more in one movie? Yes please! Close opponents of Italian horror films can easily mark this film as a cheap version of Dr. Moreau's Island, but the truth is that it is much more! “Fishman Island” delivers thrills and adventures from start to finish with amazingly convincing special effects and surprisingly stylish camera work. The story begins promisingly with a small group of prisoners who survived a shipwreck, washing a tropical island ashore. They encounter a sadistic Edmond Rackham, who rules a local tribe, and a legion of genetically engineered amphibian monsters who live in the marshes of the island. There are so many twists and turns in the story that it’s almost impossible to write a resume, but believe me, this gem is worth checking out. Sergio Martino once again proves that he is a brilliant director who has the talent to be commercially minded and creative at the same time. He perfectly uses the beautiful location of the island, and interior sets look very impressive. The stunning underwater shots and imaginative landscapes really raise this film above the usual operating standards of the late 1970s. I don’t quite understand why Roger Korman reworked the original so much and released it to the American market under a different name (Screamers), because there are very few elements open to improvement. All the cast members are loyal customers of Sergio Martino (with the exception of the great Joseph Cotton - an elegant supporting rule) and distribute excellent performances. In case you can get your hands on the newly restored German version, you are given fifteen unprocessed minutes of additional action. See it!
