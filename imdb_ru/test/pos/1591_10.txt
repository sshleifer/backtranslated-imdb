<br /> <br /> This film is a summary of Visconti's obsessive ideas: the decline of nobility, death, aesthetic search, homosexuality ... Everything is mixed with melancholic skill. Slow, just so you can contemplate all its beauty (in music and images, as well as in history) - this is a type of film that we no longer like, bold, deeply personal and intelligent. The real fruit of genius, as Visconti.
