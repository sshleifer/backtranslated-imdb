Daring selfish army cadet arrives at WEST POINT with a dangerous wise attitude to the body. <br /> <br /> In a role clearly intended for him, William Haynes shines in this very pleasant story of honor and friendship. Haynes, who stole the scene during the first half of the film, comes to his usual behavior as Silly Billy, who under normal circumstances would have forced him to limit himself to protection. The latter half, however, becomes very serious, which leads to the moral redemption of Haynes and gives him an excellent opportunity to show his acting talents. If the WEST POINT does not reach the level of the Haynes mentioned earlier (1926), this is undoubtedly due to the fact that there is no cradle of charisma and quality of Lon Chaney for interaction with Haines. However, this tribute to the army is very effective entertainment and should be appreciated by itself. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is showing love interest to Haynes, playing the virgin daughter of a local innkeeper. Joan is very sweet and good and especially shines in her first scenes when she meets Haynes on a ferry on the Hudson River and is exposed to his usual immature antics. Haynes and Crawford starred in five silent art films together and were terrific lifelong friends. He was a much bigger celebrity during this period and gave her a lot of clues to promote in Hollywood. The superstar herself in the early 1930s, she reciprocated after his departure from MGM in 1932, encouraging his career to change the interior. <br /> <br /> Little William Bakewell, in fact, plays the role of Pleb, the goddess of Heins; their relationship is actually being given more sentimental attitudes than Haynes and Crawford relations. <br /> <br /> The film was shot with the full cooperation of the military department. The extensive film set at the Academy helps immensely in the production atmosphere, to which MGM attaches excellent production values. <br /> <br /> WEST POINT was recently restored and David Davidson received a new rating.
