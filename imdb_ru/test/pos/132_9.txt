This film convincingly demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture deeply rooted in rituals and traditions. All this against the backdrop of India, which itself is fighting for freedom from these very values. This film is both political and personal in nature and is never too preaching or idealistic on both sides. It is easy to understand why the “Fire” caused unrest in India, but, nevertheless, tragic. A real film like this deserves to be watched by all the people of the world, and not just the privileged residents of the West.
