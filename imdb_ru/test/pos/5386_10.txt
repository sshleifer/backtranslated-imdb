I saw "Heaven-Ship" ("Himmelskibet") at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile, Italy. What a great movie! This Danish steampunk saga is a fascinating story about the first trip to Mars in an era when wireless telegraphy was not perfected. The spacecraft does not have a radio, and the heroes return from the landing site via a horse-drawn carriage. Even the headlines are amazing ... some of them are written in rhymed verses in the original Danish language. <br /> <br /> Acting is a ridiculous, mostly handwritten story. But the sets are amazing, easily surpassing everything that was done by Georges Melies a decade earlier (or a decade later in Die Frau im Mond). Of course, the plot is simplified. The crew of the spacecraft consists of seven thin guys and one fat man. Guess what hack I wonder that everyone in this film (except for the dubious professor Dubius) strongly believes in God. Even the Martians. <br /> <br /> Impressively, the writers have a reason to admit that a trip to Mars is not a trifle: title cards establish that it takes two years for scientists to build their spacecraft (which has an air screw)) and six months, to get to mars. During the construction sequence there is one extremely impressive installation that had to be delivered: dozens of workers are all pushed around the workplace in different directions, without hesitation and collisions. Danish scientists christened their ship "Excelsior" ("packaging materials?") And headed for Mars, although the Moon and Venus are closer. When a ship (which flies horizontally, not vertically) lands on Mars, it is met by "Marsburns" - Martians, who turn out to be Nordic blondes, all highly developed pacifists and vegetarians. (As a highly developed meat eater, I was offended by this part.) It is quite convenient that Mars has an atmosphere similar to that of Earth, and equal gravity. In the external image of the Martian landscape, the apparent magnitude of the Sun, visible from Mars, is the same as from Earth. I also could not help but notice that all the wise older Martians are men. In fact, the old women are skinny here: both a hero born on Earth and a Martian maiden without a mother. Martians speak a universal language, wear ankhs on their clothes and greet visitors to the Earth with a globe ... which, of course, is held up by the North Pole. <br /> <br /> This Martian girl - Maria performed by an incredibly beautiful Danish actress. (Waiter, I will have some of this Danish!) We see a Martian chastity dance, which may have been laughable or ridiculous, but actually quite touching and beautiful. In addition, the Martian funeral scene shows one shot that reminded me of the sequence in the Seventh Seal. I wonder if Ingmar Bergman saw this movie? <br /> <br /> Himmelskibet has several drawbacks, but its production design and other advantages far outweigh its drawbacks. Ole Olsen, who is named in the credits (and who appears in the short prologue), has nothing to do with the Vaudeville partner Shick Johnson of "Hellzapoppin". I would give Himmelbibet 12 points, but the scale exceeded 10 ... so, 10 out of 10 for this amazing journey to Mars, the planet of blondes!
