I bought this video on a VCR at a goodwill store for 50 US cents. I took quite a few videos that I bought for them to sell to others after I looked at them, considering the cost of 50 cents as rent. This is the only one that will never return. This is an explosion of artistic talent, color and sound. I don't know if I should call it a circus, a dance, or both. It is more than life itself. They can do it well only for a few short years of their life. These are performers for performers. If Gene Kelly and Bert Lancaster were alive today and saw them live, they would be amazed. I would like to lend it to others, but I know that if I do this, I will never return it.
