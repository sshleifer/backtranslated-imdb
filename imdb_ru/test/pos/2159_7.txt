Night Hunter - sold action in the style of "B". Take life and grow people. Don "Dragon" Wilson is a kickboxer (hall of fame), not an actor. If you're looking for an Oscar, it's not here, brother. Look for a thriller with an ass with a smaller budget, that's all. The storyline may have been a bit thin, but B is not. I understand that everyone is being criticized, and how the garbage of one person is the treasure of another person. Get real people, judging by each film, as if he is an Oscar candidate, just silly. Stunning battle scenes mixed with the new twist of the vampire's movements. See if you are a fan, rent something else if you are a hater.
