It was a really deeply touching film in every sense of the word. I myself was a Mormon missionary, and I know firsthand the desire to complete my mission, but at the same time I was hiding the fact that I was gay. Like the character of Aaron, I was sent home for being recognized and excommunicated, but being the only Mormon in a Catholic family was not as bad as the main character. This film really brought me back to those times and helped me understand, years later, how lucky I was to have a family that accepted me and understood what I went through. I applauded the end of the film when Aaron and Christian again accidentally find each other in Lailaâ€™s restaurant. I was really moved to tears. I highly recommend this film to anyone who reads this review, and also declares it a mandatory acquisition.
