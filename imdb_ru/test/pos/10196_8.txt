It looks like the RoboCop writer massively robbed The Vindicator. This is a very solid horror film / action movie about a man who had an accident, which will be used in a cruel experiment. Anyone who has seen Robocop knows the story. Watch out for Pam Grier as a bitch and a damn good looking killer. This very effective, brutal and bloody horror film may not please everyone, but this Canadian picnic is worth it to find for anyone who is a fan of the genre. 8/10
