The rise of punk music has hardly been documented in films, and most people tend to focus on the events of other cities, such as London or New York. Penelope Sferis managed to keep a snapshot of Los Angeles around 79-181, which proves that a vibrant and diverse community of artists and musicians appeared that competed with any other. For some groups, they read like who is who now from legendary American punk; Black flag, X, Round jerks, Microbes, Fear. Purists claim that they missed vital groups (Weirdos, Zeros, Flesheaters) and that the film caused the onslaught of suburban posers and macho violence. Nevertheless, the issues raised in the film remain relevant, the intensity of the music remains unsurpassed, and the influence can still be seen and heard in today's clique / fashion.
