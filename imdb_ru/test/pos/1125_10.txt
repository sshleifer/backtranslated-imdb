I'm so excited that the Greek is back! This season looks really intense. I am glad that Casey is trying to be serious about school, but still participates in women's society. It's really funny that she wants to go into politics and that they highlight her "intriguing talent". I liked Calvin's new haircut! It makes him look more mature. They should also shave Cappie's head. All the guys are hot, but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I can not wait to see more of him! I am particularly interested in what happens between Calvin, Adam and Rusty! I also love Rebecca. She is really beautiful. I really think that Rebecca and Calvin should connect. Dare, Calvin! Join my team!
