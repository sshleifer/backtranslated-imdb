If you have seen the trailer for this film, you pretty much know what to expect, because what you see here is what you get. And even if you haven’t seen the preview yet, you don’t need much time to understand what you are doing - in particular, have a good time and a lot of laughter - from this smart satire “Reality TV” also shows the films “Buddy Cop”, “Showtime , Directed by Tom Day, starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a Los Angeles police detective, and he is good at what he does; but one night while working on a case, things suddenly went south when another policeman, Trey Sellars (Murphy), involuntarily intervened, a television news team appeared, and Mitch lost composure, leading to a lawsuit from a television station that would cost the Department some big money. Except that they might be able to get around this, thanks to Chase Renzi (René Rousseau), who works for the station and loves what she sees in Mitch - enough to give an idea to her boss for the police show "Reality" among them would be none other than Mitch Preston, whom Chase sees in real life "Dirty Harry." <br /> <br /> Her boss likes this idea and he gives Chase the green light. Now all she needs to do is convince Mitch to take part, which should not be too difficult, as the station agreed to cancel the lawsuit if he makes the show. But Mitch is a policeman, not an actor, and he wants nothing to do with it - until he has a frank attitude towards his boss, captain Winship (Frankie Faison), who puts the future on Mitch in a short time. perspective for him. And so the show begins. Oh yes, there is one more thing; Mitch will need a partner for the show. And who do you think they will come up with for this? Let's just say: Trey Sellars - more than one of the usual suspects. <br /> <br /> This is Dey's second film as a director, his first film is Shanghai Midday - also a comedy - and he definitely shows a penchant for the genre. From the initial frames, he sets the pace that makes history move forward, and it allows its stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal qualities, including their impeccable timing. With stars such as De Niro and Murphy, Dey, of course, began his work with this project, but it is he who keeps him on the right track, demonstrating that he knows what works, achieving only the right combination of physical comedy and action and the use of subtleties dialogue with great effect. <br /> <br /> In business, there is no more natural actor than De Niro, and he enters Mitch's skin, as if he was born for this. And after many years of creating an advanced directorial drama (in which he turned into one wonderful performance after another), with films such as Analyze It, Meet the Parents, and now with this, he firmly established his mastery for comedy too. Mitch is not a particularly complex character; in fact, he is something like an “ordinary” guy, but this is the task for the actor to make him believable, to make him look like a guy who can be your neighbor and just another member of the community. And de Niro seems to be doing well. This is Mitch, the guy you come across at the grocery store or at the bank or say good morning on your way to work; who likes to watch the game on TV and has a life like you and me, who makes a living being a cop. This is Mitch's character to make this film work, because it makes it plausible to look at "an ordinary guy in unusual circumstances." This is one of those roles — and work — that is often mistakenly fired because it looks so simple; and, of course, this is what makes De Niro so exceptional - he really makes it easy, and he does it with skill. <br /> <br /> Like Trey Sellars, Eddie Murphy turns into a winning game, as well, and this is a role that suits him like a saying. Trey is a cop, but also an aspiring actor — and a bad one — and he gives Murphy the opportunity to play on the excessively abundant side of his personality (however, Day has enough rules to keep him from taking off - the top of Jim Carrey’s territory), which is ideal character and this movie. From his melodramatic role while listening to his line-ups of one-line players - delivered, if you look directly at the camera (which, in his opinion, not even) during the filming of a reality show - Murphy is a riot. And he has chemistry with De Niro, which really clicks (which is not unexpected, as this is another of De Niro’s many talents; his ability to connect and identify the best in his colleagues, all of which - the evidence will support-- better in after his work with him, including Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, and these are just some of them). Most importantly, this is the part that allows Murphy to succeed in what he does best, and he certainly does it as efficiently as possible. <br /> <br /> Rousseau also uses her role as Chase, as a character who is not very artistic, but she presents her delightfully, with a strong, believable performance. And William Shatner (playing himself) absolutely steals a couple of scenes as a show director. <br /> <br /> The supporting team cast is Drena De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Rodey (camera operator). ). “Showtime” is a well-thought-out and staged comedy, and this is exactly what it should be: pure entertainment, which gives a lot of laughter and a pleasant couple of hours that will make you laugh some time later. This is the magic of movies. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
