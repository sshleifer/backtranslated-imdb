Living a few steps from Georgetown, Co. ... I remember this film well and thought it was great! It seems that this is a story that John would make even in real life, but there is something that I will always remember most about the film. For those of you who don't live in Denver ... every Christmas, the city of Denver, Co exhibits incredible lights and decorations at the Civic Center in downtown Denver. Well ... as it happened, during the filming of this film was needed a Christmas scene. So ... it was borrowed from the display of the Civic Center ... with permission, by the way! Someone forgot to advise those in power, and it was reported about the hijacking! The frantic search began with law enforcement within a few days. Finally, someone spoke and remembered that he lent it to the film crew in Georgetown! He was returned and returned to the place! It turns out ... in the film it is not so much thought ... it can hardly be seen during the Christmas show with the children. It really created excitement, though ...
