What a surprise this movie was. I saw a lot of horror movies and zombies Fulci and was amazed that it was the same director. He also wrote the script, which shows that the guy is quite capable of creating a detailed, complex storyline. Voicing this is not very good, but far from a horrific recession, which only further hinders later roars, such as the Manhattan Kid. <br /> <br /> The photo in this movie is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic route appears throughout the entire film, which focuses on a small town where boys are killed. On the scene, including the beating of a woman, look uncomfortable, but it is fresh compared to the usual violence in the movies. <br /> <br /> What went wrong, Lucio? Perhaps there is good reason to believe that he reached his peak in this film, and after that he gradually went down.
