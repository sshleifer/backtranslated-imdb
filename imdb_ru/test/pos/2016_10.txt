I like this movie. This is a very simple plot, and as I understand it, it is based on a true story. Educating hard rock / metal in the 80s may be related to my love for this film, but even besides music, this is a really funny movie. Try it, you will like it if you are not the toughest of critics and just love the films of the “Citizen Kane” caliber
