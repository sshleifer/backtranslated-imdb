Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) begins this disguised story by helping to take out the famous physicist "Dr. Franz Tobel" (William Post) from Sviseralnad and under the watchful eye of the Nazis, who want his plans to detonate a bomb. The allies obviously want it too, and Sherlock is here to help. Dr. Tobel invented a tool that helps a lot with the accuracy of aerial bombardment. <br /> <br /> Holmes and Dr. Tobel returned safely to Baker Street, but the scientist would have preferred to remain alone for some mysterious reason, although he promised to help the British, not the Germans. He remains true to this promise, but there are some desperate moments for Holmes and the British. <br /> <br /> This is an entertaining film in which our famous detective uses not one, but three different disguises. He needs all the help he can get when he confronts his main rival, "Professor Moriarnosti." One complaint: if Moriariti were this evil, he would have treated Holmes without blinking an eyelash, instead of giving him the opportunity to escape. It's also pretty sad when the usual fool Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) saves his boss a couple of times from certain death! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some problems with plausibility in this story, but if you can hold your brain a few times, this is a funny movie that you can watch ... and it looks great thanks to the excellent restoration work done on this DVD . This causes the old print to come alive with some wonderful visual effects, especially with night shots. <br /> <br /> Another remark: whoever did the English subtitles here, they incorrectly wrote or misinterpreted at least half a dozen words. This is a very messy job, and this is not the first time I've come across this when I watch the entire series on a restored DVD.
