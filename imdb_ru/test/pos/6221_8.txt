All the films of Risto Jarva are worthy of attention. Some of them, such as “Jäniksen vuosi” and “Loma”, are the best films in their genre and have achieved the status of classics in Finnish cinema history. <br /> <br /> Most people have formed an impression about the actor Antti Lity thanks to the film Järvi. films. Litya played a leading role in three films by Jarva, who all became successful at the box office and at the cinema reviews. <br /> <br /> It’s nice to see that the idea of ​​"Jäniksen Vuosi" still lives in commercials (I think it was the body of the TV company Sonéra’s operator adds that Lithuania, walking in the mountains, fell on Lapland with a hare Everyone who saw the movie knows what I'm talking about ..) "Jäniksen Vuosi" is a beautiful film with excellent actors and good filming locations - like the famous town in Lapland Sodankylä, where the best film festival in the world is held - the film festival "Night Sun" . I recommend everyone to go there in June - but remember warm clothes and a raincoat :)
