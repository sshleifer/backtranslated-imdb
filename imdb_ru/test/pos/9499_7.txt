Gloria Swanson (like Leila Porter) is for obvious reasons a bored wife. The workaholic husband Elliot Dexter (like James Denby Porter) "lost his romance" along with his waist; he also smokes cigars in bed, eats onions and snores. He can barely remember his own anniversary — which was attended by the torch Lew Cody (as Schuyler Van Sutphen); the young man looks at the voluptuous figure of Miss Swanson and shyly flirts. Soon Swenson turns to Mr. Cody. Then Mr. Dexter decides to try to get her back. Who will win? <br /> <br /> Everything is in order with these three principles, and Swanson most impressively plays a key role in the role of a torn woman. Julia Fay captures support honors as Cody's other interest, "Toodles"; off-screen she seduced director Cecil B. DeMil. The touch of DeMille is obvious; especially in an imaginary sequence in which Cody promises Swanson: “Pleasure, wealth, love” <br /> <br /> ******* Don't change your husband (01/26/19) Cecil B. Demil ~ Gloria Swanson, Elliot Dexter, Lew Cody
