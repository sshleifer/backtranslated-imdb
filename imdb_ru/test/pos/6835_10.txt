But not too fashionable. And not too wise. "Judas Kiss" nails a new noir, just a magnificent tempo and nuance complete the perverted story, filled with sex, betrayal and unmistakable behavior. Inspiring work around. The prestige attitude towards HalHolbrook (his best work ever), Gil Bellows (Ally Mc-what?) And Carla Gugino (the best family company at the age ... clever, funny and ultra HOT) ... I give it 9 (of 10), and this is because 10 should be reserved for films like "Humphrey Bogart" and "Cohen Bros."
