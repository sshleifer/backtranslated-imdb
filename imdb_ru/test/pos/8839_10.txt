When the masterful version of John Carpenter’s “The Thing” was released in the summer of 1982, it was criticized by critics and bombed at the box office. The viewers could not cope with another “bad” alien, they wanted aliens. Their loss in the long run. <br /> <br /> I would kill to see this wonderful movie on the big screen. This is a film that is well ahead of its time; now it has influenced a new generation of cinematographers, showing his footprint on such things as “Se7en”, “Alien 3” and even “The X Files”, which unceremoniously tore him to the page. And a structure that refrains from character development in favor of an incredible SFX is common in modern blockbuster films. <br /> <br /> Carpenter demonstrates the same skills that he honed in Halloween, using the camera to create an alarming and claustrophobic atmosphere. The performances are all right, and the finale is stunning - still unique today. <br /> <br /> Paranoid masterpiece.
