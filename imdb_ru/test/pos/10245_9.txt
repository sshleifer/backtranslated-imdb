Leading actor Yuko Tanaka plays so much in an exceptionally meditative “Milkmaid”, in quiet propaganda of missed chances in a 50-something woman’s life, outlining her routine with genuinely sharp motives. Akira Ogata's unusual romantic film, played in the picturesque quiet town of Nagasaki, is, so to speak, a less outspoken melodrama than a deliberate self-analysis of putting its characters in their present life as a result of the tragic past that made Tanaka played by Minako Obu, a middle-aged woman who, before her Shifts in the supermarket, before working in the supermarket, chose the choice that they did not apply. <br /> <br /> Perfectly embodying the necessary fatigue of the world and heartless routine. undertakes the duty of delivering bottles of milk among the inhabitants of hilly Nagasaki. One of the houses she constantly passes by to make such a delivery is the house of Kaita Takanashi (Ittoka Kishibe), a local government employee who cares for his terminally ill wife (Akiko Nishina). Minako and Kaita were school sweethearts, who since then, thanks to the disgraceful event associated with their parents, have diverged. <br /> <br /> Opening his film with the anticipation of a story about young Minako who promises never to leave Nagasaki, Ogata makes as a result of the story, patiently sticking to Minako, since he, skillfully supported by an understated but very effective performance by Tanako, follows her - whether it’s chatter with her aunt (Misako Watanabe) because she is lonely, or when she runs up and down the countless steps of their hilly city to hand out milk - as she and Kaita gradually overcome the obstacles that I shook them for many years. Such unhurried development may not be suitable for viewers who have been taken away from a rapidly evolving story, but otherwise, this is spiritual self-analysis, which has a strong and decisive influence.
