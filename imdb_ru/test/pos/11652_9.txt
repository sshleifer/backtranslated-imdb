Tim Robbins makes a great movie. His wife (Susan Sarandon) is perfectly playing the role of Helen Perjanâ€™s sister, who wants to help Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), who is accused of murder and who will also die from an injection ... what you get. Great acting, and this film makes you wonder! <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon deserves the title of Best Actress of 1995. This is probably one of her best films ever. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen The Cradle Will Swing, but I'm sure I should see more Robbins movies. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9/10 or *** 1/2 of 4. Go and see .....
