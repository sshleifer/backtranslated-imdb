If we take his ideas and analysis of the current bipartisan system and the political process as a whole, I think this is a great film. Of course, the film was not the comedy I was expecting, but as soon as I realized that this film really made me think. Much of what we see and hear about any election is such a joke. In this film, in particular, there is a debate scene, which, in my opinion, was a skilful critique of our political debates and how politicians are “discussed” in them. I encourage everyone who thinks that our process is in order to watch this movie. However, if you want to laugh at something, Robin Williams and Christopher Walken are not ordinary people. In this film, they show us that the truth hurts, and not the truth is ridiculous.
