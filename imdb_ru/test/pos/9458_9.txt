When I went to see this movie, I thought it would be just another awesome movie that I would have to endure with my sister. In addition, Amanda Baines' latest film was not so hot, which made me doubt the film because she is the lead actress. However, for 5 minutes I was laughing so hard, I had tears in my eyes, the jokes were not “there”, which took more then a second to figure it out, but very funny. The script was not too complicated, so that I could not understand the love triangle, but was very faithful to the original play by Shekpir. I liked every minute so much that I kicked a guy in two places from me in a fit of laughter, laughs !!! very awkward! I would definitely advise people to watch this movie, especially girls, because the guys in this movie are very hot and hot !! (laughs), so I could just burn it to DVD.
