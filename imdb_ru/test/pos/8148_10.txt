“The Last Days” was a very touching film for me, he showed how hard and disrespectful the gay community is. The film demonstrates true passion and truly explores the feelings of these two characters, the film carries with it a real depth of compassion for the gay community, as it really speaks of gays / women. Personally, I think the time has come for the homosexual community of all religions to no longer hold their heads in shame, simply because there was a beautiful me there. The film was a revelation to me, since I could not believe how homosexual this world really is. Even in schools, if a child doesn't like something, they will call him “gay.” I sincerely hope that more such films will be made, and that they will be labeled not just as “gay”, but as a love story, since I believe that gay directors should stand up for themselves and tell their own story.
