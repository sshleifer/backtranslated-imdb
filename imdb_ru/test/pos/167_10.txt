Bloody birthday plays on the supposed innocence of children and shows them bloodthirsty monsters. Stephen (Andy Freeman), Curtis (Billy Jane; credited as Billy Jacobi) and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) were born on the same day during an eclipse. In addition to sharing their birthday, they also share the love of murder (and they are not picky about who they are killing). Young Billy, Elizabeth and Andy play well the role of these insensitive monsters, but they also know when to put on charm. But they cannot deceive everyone. This is generally a good horror movie, itâ€™s not too unrealistic, there are a few good moments of waiting, and the children have played quite well the roles (although the adults are quite cute). I would say that it is worth a look (I have a copy).
