That's right, we have a 2008 film using the themes “Brief Encounter” and “The Bridges of Madison County”. This is basically a story about lost love, redemption and the triumph of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> The speeches of Richard Gere and especially Diane Lane are very good. Gere here gives a low profile as a doctor who seeks meaning after the patient dies on the operating table. Lane is the mother of a rebellious daughter and a cute little son who broke up with her wandering husband, and also lost her father that same year. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn gives a show in one scene of a meeting with Gear. He is a grieving husband, and he talks about his love for his late wife, this will cause tears in your eyes. <br /> <br /> Just after her triumph, like a sweet mother in “Doubts”, Viola Davis looks like an understanding of the girlfriend in the film and literally hangs her hair in a rather soft performance.
