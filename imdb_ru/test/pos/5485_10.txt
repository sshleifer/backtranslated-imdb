I am a big fan of big, loud, dirty, completely stupid action films such as The Rock, Con Air, etc. All this is very interesting to watch, but, if you think about it, it is extremely silly. IN LINE OF FIRE tells the story, and she tells it well. With plausibility, as well as excitement and uncertainty, he also raised several important moral issues that really make you think. The last frame of the film - Eastwood and Rousseau, who sit together on the steps of the White House, watching the pigeons to the soft, quiet music, and I experienced a deep sense of satisfaction. This is because I took care of the characters and was happy for them that their story came to a happy end. It was like a true story. Since an aging secret service agent was tormented by the fact that he was unable to protect John Kennedy on that fateful day in Dallas, Clint Eastwood is fantastic. He brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his adversary. On the other side of the spectrum is John Malkovich, a creepy predator who torments Eastwood about what happened in 1963, openly telling him about his plan to kill the current president. This performance, nominated for an Oscar, really falls under your skin. Throughout the film, Malkovich talks with Eastwood as if they were friends. He does not threaten him, he does not lie to him, he does not laugh at him, but he torments him with his intolerable friendliness right up to the last moment. In addition to this exciting main story, there is a charming love story with Rene Rousseau, another agent and Eastwood. Despite the difference in age, they have great chemistry on the screen, and the director wisely does not allow it to dominate too much, but it keeps it as part of the background, which works well. To summarize, I love this film because it has a mind.
