What was the quote from Archbishop Tutu at the end of the movie about a personâ€™s past? this film was very disturbing to watch in the sense that it was a true story, and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years, I am ashamed. <br /> <br /> all people, and everyone has the right to live their lives in peace and harmony <br /> <br /> live and let live to others <br /> <br /> if anyone knows the quote please let me know. <br /> <br /> this film should be shown much more publicly, as real events, as terrifying as those shown in the film, should be known to everyone in the hope that everything will change before later.
