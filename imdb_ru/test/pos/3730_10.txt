A great movie. Postapocalyptic films tear ass. This one is no exception. Maintain the pace and interest without a stain on the dialogue (mainly due to good character development). The fight between Renault and Hero was tough. I also liked the use of rock paintings and medieval weapons to show how primitive and wild humanity became without their technology and greed. The connection between the beginning and the end was a bit spacious, that is, it was difficult for me to understand the distance between the hotel and the order of opening. In general, the character's progressive character, design, history without a cushion of dialogue and, most importantly, the always valued desert landscapes of the post-apocalyptic desert.
