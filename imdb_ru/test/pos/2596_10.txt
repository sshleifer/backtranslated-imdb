"Seasoning for rabbits," Chuck Jones, the second in the beloved hunting trilogy, is often considered the best of the three. While I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons, I would have to admit that “Rabbit Spice” is the most elaborate script. Here, the emphasis is on language, as Bugs and Duffy go through a series of complex dialogues in the great tradition of Abbott and Costello's “Who's Next”. As a longtime admirer of Duffy, I have always been delighted with the hunting trilogy, because Duffy gets all the best features (the famous “pronoun problem” is one of the classic things of all time) and does most of the work. Bedbugs play the role of a classy manipulator, and Elmer, as always, is confused. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so funny is that Duffy and Elmer pose so little threat to Bugs that he just throws back and laughs a little. Elmer falls into every trap designed for him, but this poor old Duffy, who falls off the worst, gets in his face again and again, and his beak is becoming more and more ridiculous. All this is based on the inevitable climate declaration "You are despicable." An equally complex example of Chuck Jones' flawless timing, like "Rabbit Seasoning" is a real classic.
