We really liked this film because it was so interesting and unusual that it wasnâ€™t an ordinary Hollywood occupation. <br /> <br /> My husband had a coupon for a blockbuster, and he passed on a series of new releases of Hollywood songs. He was about to leave when he saw this and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy - and with some glitches on the DVD, which we finally switched to the widescreen version and then returned to the fullscreen version so that it would stop braking. But it was worth it. Kathy Bates is so good and she was perfect for this role. And she can sing too! <br /> <br /> If only Hollywood had studied with independent directors! Maybe we will come back to real movies. But now we stick to unusual and really interesting films like this! Other examples we enjoyed included: A box full of moonlight, Pieces of April, The Liberation of Milo, The Prophecy of Celestine. Most of them are from Christopher Guest, such as: Best in Show, at your discretion, strong wind and waiting for Guffman
