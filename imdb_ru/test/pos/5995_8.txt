<br /> <br /> This movie is really impressive action films. Humor and action are well combined, although the intensity of the film does not stand up to the end. The last scene is a small anti-climax in terms of the quality of the action and the amazing explosiveness of the scenes that precede it. Humor does not seem as ridiculously awkward as in many other Hong Kong films, and this film is of a completely different class than most American action films of recent years. Lau Ching-Wan acts as a typical, intuitive police hero who mocks invalid orders from incompetent police chiefs. The dialectic of the film is built on superhuman coolness and ruthlessness of the drug business, which degrades the police forces, while at the same time providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with various machine guns. Leaving many corpses in its wake. Yu Rong-Guan is particularly impressive as a very cool, merciless gangster in this story, similar to Wu, where the cool guys are really die-hard.
