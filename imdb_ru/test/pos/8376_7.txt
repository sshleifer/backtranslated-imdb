Previous commentators have noted the similarity in appearance between this film and the film The Third Man, the film Noir directed by Carol Reed, starring Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. This similarity amazes the viewer almost immediately. This is really high praise compared to the award-winning cinema of Robert Krasker in the film The Third Man. <br /> <br /> The essence of the stolen identity was also identified quite accurately, but in fairly simple terms. I found it very creative and interesting. The “erroneous - or stolen - identity” device, as common in both theater and cinema, is just a device that cannot be mistaken for a plot. Consequently, although the viewer could see this device “a thousand” times, the plot “Stolen Identity” is full of surprises and turns based on this device. It is unexpected turns that make this film much fresher, more original and more interesting than the plot synopsis can give. The stolen identity does not depend on the type of uncertainty that is characteristic of most films, because there is no real secret here. Instead, it relies on constant, smaller surprises. In short, the Mistaken Identity device is quite common; but this plot is not. <br /> <br /> Finally, although I was not familiar with the cast, I found that the action was equally good, sometimes outstanding. I could easily imagine other actors turning this film into a melodrama, with bombs, bloated gestures and obvious facial expressions. The game is always more restrained and subtle. Donald Buk is particularly restrained and trustworthy, never “blowing a cover” with a pronounced facial expression, as we often see in films that depend on how to maintain a trick to withstand dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment of this otherwise wonderful film was a very weak development of the plot of a love story. In its current form, this seems like an afterthought — in fact, a mild surprise — to the end. Or, maybe, during their general test, the actors simply could not convey a significant level of chemistry, which I could appreciate. This story should have become more apparent as the story progresses. In general, I thought this film was a beautiful little gem, and I wondered why I hadn’t seen it before. Try it, you will like it.
