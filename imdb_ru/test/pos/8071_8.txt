Some will argue that Argentine director Esteban Sapir "La Antena" is an exercise in anachronistic futility; that while silent films, to which Sapir pays homage, were at the forefront of cinema when they were made, they became obsolete today, leaving La Antena as meaningless strangeness. <br /> <br /> I would not agree. Fervently. “La Antena” combines the conventions of a silent film with the technology of the 21st century, which makes it an ideal exercise in postmodern filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The action of the film takes place in the eternal film “The City without a Voice,” as they call it, because citizens have lost the gift of speech from Mr. T.V., a dictator / media magnate with painted hair. The city is reminiscent of the title in the original Fritz Lang Metropolis (1927), perhaps 100 years before this film. These are all expressionist skyscrapers, television antennas and animated billboards. <br /> <br /> City residents are soothed by La Voz (Voice), the only person with the gift of speech. Her face is constantly hidden by a hood (it persists even when she is naked), La Voz is forced to sing on Mr. TV’s television network. But when Mr. T.V. comes up with a plan to also steal the written word, La Voz and her eyeless son join forces with the renegade family, trying to restore freedom of speech to the people. <br /> <br /> La Antena is nothing but a pure movie. Burdened by the conventions of a silent film, Sapir is forced to rely on images to tell his story. There is sound, especially in Lev Sudzhatovich’s almost continuous score. It evokes the best of silent music for the film, and ingeniously invests itself in the film's digestion, such as the hum of car hooters or the rhythmic ra-ta-tat-tat shots. And at the heart of the whole film is a familiar buzz, as if it were shown on an ancient projector. <br /> <br /> There is also quite a bit of dialogue. But instead of using captions in Sapir, the words of the characters appear in the frame. They are more or less filling the screen or dutifully floating in the air, depending on what is being said. Think of a more original version of the subtitles in "Night Watch" (2004). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, words do not distract from images. What is really very successful, because La Antena boasts some of the most creative and original images that we have seen in a long time, and all of them were captured by a luxurious black and white photograph of Christian Kettet. There are expressionist cityscapes. Singer with a hood and her eyeless son. There is an abandoned city antenna, which looks like the decomposed remains of some colossal spider. And there is an ominous doctor Y, whose mouthy mouth is displayed on a television screen attached to his face. <br /> <br /> La Antena was criticized for relying too heavily on his images, while saving on allegorical depth. But, again, I would not agree. It is true that the sudden appearance of a mind control machine in the form of a swastika or a eyeless boy appearing crucified on the star of David seems out of place, just above the top, otherwise it is just a well-designed fairy tale. <br /> <br /> But the absence of explicit characters (with the exception of the two previous examples) works in favor of the film. This allows us to form our own opinion: to decide whether to display a political sense, to consider “La Antena” as an allegory of fascism, the danger of capitalist monopolies, as well as the power and responsibility of the media; or just take the film at face value, as a stunning visual adventure in a world that is both unique and familiar. <br /> <br /> Sacrifice of clear depth in favor of unique images may seem like a compromise. But in fact, when a movie looks just as good, it's hard to take care. Each frame of La Antena has more imagination and skill than in Hollywood. Calling movies for almost 100 years may be useless, but at the same time Sapir can show us what is missing in modern films. Perhaps he tells us that the time has come for another artistic revolution. And he may be right.
