I do not know how this film went unnoticed for so long. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on TV, flipped through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well-made movie. I missed the first, probably 10 minutes, but it doesn’t matter .. this film literally swept me, it’s a real spinal cooler. <br /> <br /> The absence of famous actors in the film adds to the effect; you don’t know what to expect from the actors because they are new. You never know when they will be killed or what they are plotting. so it is all the more stressful. Even though many new faces appeared, their performances were top notch. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers play with your mind, revealing enough blood to imagine everything else. Shock, fear, horror and helplessness are also clearly visible to the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Well-written situations with turns, fast camera movement, smooth editing and superb direction make it an excellent thrilling thriller. This film actually switches between genres - thriller of horror and suspense, leaving the viewer ignorant and tense. Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I could not even move away from the TV even during commercial breaks ... I was a helpless silent witness to this great movie.
