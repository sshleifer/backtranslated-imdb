This film was definitely written only for FF VII fans. I'm the one who never played the original game and watched it with a friend who was a fan of the show. From a visual and technical point of view, this film is as good as “Perfume inside”, if not better, but from the point of view of history I was rather confused. One of the main weaknesses in the conspiracy, which seemed to me, was the scene in which “all” children dying from geostigma were brought to healing by “reunion” by three Hennites. Everyone said that there were about 15 children in total ... Hmmmm ... I thought this Geostigma was a pandemic-scale disease ... I understand why they did it this way (time, budget, processor), but it only seemed cheesy after all the explanation about how the bad guys had to collect all those who had Jenova cells so that Jenova could be reincarnated. The subtitled version that we had (some fan from the Internet) was a fairly direct translation and therefore probably added my confusion. <br /> <br /> However, this really pierced my interest in FF VII, and I spent a few hours on FF VII reading the wiki about the main characters and the plot. After I read the Advent Children wiki, everything became much clearer. If you're a fan of video games or fiction, this movie is a pretty good movie, but, as mentioned in the previous review, it looks like a 90-minute battle scene. You will never recognize any of the characters, and the story seems to be just jumping from stage to stage without much explanation, even if some explanation may be required. Thank God for Wikipedia.
