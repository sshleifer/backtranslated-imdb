Now, the original sci-fi TV company has shot some pretty crappy films (“House of the Dead 2”, “Day of All Souls”, etc.), but when you completely leave the work for the main actor / horror writer, and now director Bruce Campbell, you Get one of the best damned for television independent horror films ever made! I usually hate these films, in my previous review, House of the Dead 2, I could not believe how horrible the film was! But somehow I loved this movie, I really liked this movie. Violence is good, like the black comedy in the film, and I recommend you get it, a true masterpiece of Bruce Campbell! Well, since there are only a few lines left, I can say everything I want about this film: IJAIKIFIF JJJN NHD FENCH FHNCHFNFVHS JJKEALZHVSNS.
