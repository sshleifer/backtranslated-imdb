I watched this film because of Kostas Mandilora and Lauren Holly. I adored them together on Picket Fences, so it was great to see them together again. It was not the best movie ever made, but it was cute. Very predictable, but sometimes insanely funny movies - this is just what I need. <br /> <br /> Desserts were great and I wanted to eat them all. I really loved it when he fell apart though. I bet he was still nice. <br /> <br /> Kostas and Lauren still had the great chemistry they had on picket fences, and I fainted when they kissed this movie. <br /> <br /> I would not watch it again, but it was a great filler for one night.
