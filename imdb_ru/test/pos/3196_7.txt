This short film was part of the fourth “Short Cinema Journal” - a film I rented from Netflix, but which seems to have originally been a monthly show for people who like mediocre modern short films And they like a DVD full of commercials. So far I have tried two DVD magazines and felt the rage of the terrible way the viewer had to navigate the disc to see movies. Talk about an overly complicated and too complicated way to do it! Despite the fact that I have and will continue to view as many shorts as possible, I really doubt if I will worry about magazines because of these factors. <br /> <br /> Now this can happen because I did not like the disc so much. much that I was not favorably disposed towards this Portuguese animated short film. This is definitely possible. However, even if this is the case, I feel that other reviews were too positive about this simple little movie. Some of the artwork was really good — I liked how simple black and white drawings suddenly turned into a three-dimensional environment when the camera took a boring long shot and dived into the city below. It was wonderful and it took a little work. But as for the story of a cat that wants to go to the moon, it just did nothing for me. <br /> <br /> IMPORTANT UPDATE - I saw this movie again on DVD called “Cartoon Noir” 5/09. It was a rather unattractive collection of feature films. However, this time I saw the “HISTORY OF THE CAT AND THE MOON” with a completely different sound track, and the boy changed that. Instead of Portuguese with subtitles, he had a narrator with a French accent who spoke English in the style of the film Noir. Although I usually hate dubbing, this time he really made the film. The narrative of the Portuguese version leaves much to be desired, if you do not know the language or do not understand the subtleties. If you do not speak the language, try searching for another version (assuming you understand English).
