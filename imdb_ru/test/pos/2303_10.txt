The Empire of Passion begins deceptively, that is, if you immediately expect it to be a horror movie. At first it looks like a riff in the James M. Cain film The Postman Always Rings Twice: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two children and an obedient, hard-working wife of a rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he is not around, and she is at home with a child, the angry and aimless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes to bring Seki some goodies ... and a little more. Soon they sleep together, but after he does something with her (say, “shaved”), he knows what he finds out, and immediately offers to kill Gisaburo. They drink it, choke it, and then throw it into the well. Naturally, it will come back to haunt them - but it is literally, at least for them (first super-scared Seki, and then only later skeptical Tojoji), shifts gears to Kaidan, the Japanese ghost story. /> <br /> This is a movie in which horror comes not just from “oh, the ghost, oh”, but from the general fear that is created for the characters. In a sense, film noir mechanics works in everything, if only freely translating a 19th-century Japanese village as opposed to an American town or small town (that is, the policeman discovering himself is “proof” found, possibly, by others). , bypasses the ear, causes suspicion, etc.). This is convincing, because Seiko was opposed to the plan from the very beginning, which the lustful, but poorly trained Toyoji manipulated, and her reactions to Gizaburo's repeated appearance overwhelm her. Take the one that comes closest to poetry: the ghost of Gisaburo, a pale blue face and a mostly silent, chilling look, Seiko's movements to sit on a rickshaw. She reluctantly, and he pushes her along the road, which she does not know, in the first hours before dawn, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories want the heavens to have this heartbreaking atmosphere. <br /> <br /> By the end it starts to turn into hysterics, but there are so many things here that director Oshima gets the right to do this distinctive work. After tremendous success in the international film world with "In the realm of feelings" (which, ironically, was banned in his own country), he did something that he claimed was even more courageous than "Feelings." Maybe he was right; Empire of Passion has less graphic sexual content than its predecessor (also starring Tatsuya Fuji, a superbly physical actor with a huge range of possibilities), but her courage is to create a world of horror. You may believe in the ghosts in this story, but you must also believe how far these two potential lovebirds go to their personal hell. A worried detective or gossiping citizens are the least worried: the fate of their souls is at stake. <br /> <br /> And Oshima takes what in other hands may be just juicy flesh (unfortunately, it’s not so) it won’t surprise me if the American remake was already preparing for the shoot) and the craft taken after the great shot, with a repetition making its way into the mise-en-scene (for example, shots of Seiko and Toyoji walking this road, the camera is in Dutch), the world tilts and surrounds them with a deep blue tint, as well as some influencing movements that will remain with me long after when I finish typing this (for example, Toyoji throws leaves at one hand in the well in slow motion, or how Seiko naked body is revealed after it becomes blind). It is boldly to unite at the level of the spirit - not to be confused with the spiritual, although there can also be something with it - in the inseparable connection of life and death with each other. This is a classic wait to be discovered.
