Following the lines of the classic formula before making another leap from the material, the remake of The Thing becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter portrayed what should have been a rather vague scenario about some things (or perhaps very descriptive, who knows), creating an incredibly miserable, brilliant puppet and animatronic work of Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston on the team). These effects help set the tone in the harsh conditions that Carpenter adjusts with his characters. The film tells about a group located in a research bunker in the middle of the arctic climate, opposing an evil force that takes on the appearance of others. It gives a full life from the choice of Carpenter tones and surprises. For those who follow in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the director here is much more trusted and talented in the performance of the material than the majority, if he has a chance to play with the old film again. <br /> <br /> With spectacular people working in full force - among the things that are likely to follow Backdraft as containing the most fire on the stage (this can become redundant, but after a while it all goes into obscurity) - actors stretch like a beautiful ensemble. Unlike the team at Predator, these are mostly ordinary working guys, the leader of which is McCready Kurt Russell (a very good role for his style, really great). Juicy support roles are chosen for players like Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is very nice to see how some absurdity of what happens in the film (an alien who starts with dogs and then switches to others in a bloody, insane transforming form) opposes such a tone of timing with everyone. From time to time I liked the long silence, with Ennio Morriconeâ€™s eerie, curious music in the background (and this bass line itself is a virtue). <br /> <br /> She is associated with, if nothing else, delivering what he aspires to his genre / cult audience. This remains one of Carpenter's best; A rare breed of horror films, where the story is told clearly and precisely through the camera's position, the dialogue and the time of shooting scenes. This is not to say that the film is not full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it is almost ridiculous. But, given that this goes back to what is ridiculously similar to the past epoch, the creatures / makeup, along with a stable, well-calculated scenario, were made entirely without CGI. It's disgusting, but real and atmospheric for T.
