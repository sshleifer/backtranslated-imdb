If you are looking for a frivolous film about the mafia, where the leading role is played by a woman, you have come to the right place. Pfiffer acted much better than this. You can see that she has matured outside of this picture. <br /> <br /> When I first brought up this film, I expected Pfeiffer to make a bad mistake, but she plays her part as a mafia wife until the very end. Baldwin's good performance. <br /> <br /> If you donâ€™t pay attention to the hairstyle, you might like this movie. But don't take it too seriously ...
