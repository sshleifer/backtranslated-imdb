I first saw this film on TV in 1959, when I was eight years old. I didn’t know anything about westerns then, but I recognized Ben Johnson from the film Mighty Joe Young. I was attracted to the “Master of Carriages” wonderful songs performed by “Sons of Pioneers”. Merian Cooper, who produced the film, was the first to order original music that matches the mood of a particular scene, and created a soundtrack for a modern film. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic King Kong. Later, Steiner will receive an Oscar for the topic "Gone With the Wind." Cooper also produced Mighty Joe Young. If you remember, the music was important for the big monkey, which responded only to the sound of “The Perfect Dreamer” by Stephen Foster. In 1947, Cooper became a partner of John Ford, who led the "Wagon Master". Of all the famous westerns of Ford, this one is my favorite, in which his brother Francis and the sullen Jane Arness appear.
