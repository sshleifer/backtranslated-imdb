Hoops McCann's friendly beginner multiplier (John Cusack's amazingly attractive presentation) and his best friend George (the delightfully unflappable Joel Murray) go to Nantucket for the summer after high school. Hoop, George and a few newly-made friends come to the aid of Cassandra (Demi Moore in her most charming), a singer whose family home is in danger of being torn down by the greedy clan of Beckersted. Writer / director Savage Steve Holland offers often funny and witty continuous squall of notoriously wide and silly, but still very funny jokes. Permanent insane madness has a real dizzying, good-natured and contagiously meaningless life force, which is impossible neither to love nor resist. In addition, lively and enthusiastic action from a great cast is extremely adding fun: Bobcat Goldthwait is like a spastic Egg Stork, Tom Villard is like his stupid brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong is like sweet Ack Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf is like the wicked rich dork Ackville Beckersted, Matt Matt Beckersted, Matt Mattt Mattalf, as the wicked rich moron of Aquville Beckersted, Matt Matt Beckersted, Matt Matt as the meanest Teddy, Kimberly Foster as the cookie, Joe Flaherty as the insane general Raymond, William Hickey as the naughty old man Beckersted, Jeremy Piven as the self-satisfied bully Ty and John Matushak as the uncouth biker Stean chard, unbeaten, unbeaten. Isidore Mancofsky's fia, hoarse movie soundtrack, Corey Lerios' cool rock and roll score, and funny animation are all equally excellent. The only funny scene: an egg in a Godzilla costume is terrorizing a gorgeous dinner. Absolute scream.
