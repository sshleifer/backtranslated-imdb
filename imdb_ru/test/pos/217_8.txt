When I was a kid, I was a big fan of Naked Gun movies, but I recently watched the Police Sqaud show! and I think it's great! Leslie Nilsson is awesome, Alan North is awesome, and who the hell is Rex Hamilton? But in any case, this is one stupid show. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of this show when they shoot a scene during the final credits. I think that my favorite, when Norberg (not O.J.) enters during the scene, and he tries to fit into the freeze frame. Classic! <br /> <br /> The only problem for me is that the cigarette gag becomes very old (when Drebin shows someone a cigarette and asks "Cigarette?" I think they used it too many times. <br /> <br /> Good game, good jokes, great show! <br /> <br /> 7/10
