She insists on accompanying him. Thus, the unmatched couple begins their adventure together. <br /> <br /> REVIEW So this is another film, Journey to the West, which is not bad for me, since I love this story and the characters associated with it. , so I was a little excited to get my hands on a DVD. So I think that I will start my review with a story that is everywhere, first it was your standard fantasy film, then it turned into a funny comedy, and then suddenly turned into fantastic science fiction, if director Jeff Lau experimented with mixing genres, and then did pretty skatological work with this film. I think this is a rather unique approach when the plot focuses on a character different from the infamous Monkey King, especially accepting a pacifist character like Tripitaka, and then putting him in what is essentially a love story. In general, I liked it. <br /> <br /> The acting is mostly solid, with presenters Nicholas Tse and Charlene Choi in some really good performances, although Char really spends most of his screen time behind some pretty ugly makeup. The auxiliary cast is well composed, it includes all the usual major EEG episodes, so Boy'Z and Isabella Leong appear among the actors, one of the actors I would like to mention is Wilson Chen, who plays the Monkey King, he is good worked with limited material that seemed to be given to him, he played the Monkey King version, which was subdued, but arrogant, I had a feeling that he would revise the territory of Twins Effect II, but fortunately this is not the case. I hope he gets a sequel to this with himself in the lead role, since the film really remains open to the sequel. <br /> <br /> Okay, so let's move on to directing, which again seems to be everywhere, Lau gives way too much time to Stephen Chow-Esquire's senseless comedy, which includes a scene in which Tripitaka, to get tougher, dresses like Spiderman, which, I believe, leads to many moments of scratching the head as the film is intended for filming in Ancient China. He creates some really pleasant and tender moments between the two leads and delves into the juicy territory, but this reviewer sometimes gets some juice, so it didn't bother me at all. <br /> <br /> True Now about the CGI, which for the most part is quite tolerable, there are many moments that probably belong to the PS2, as many other reviews have argued, but there are some cool moments, especially the scene in which Monkey fights with a flying minion. Many CG jokes are presented in the form of a golden staff, which turns into a number of different things, from a giant fly swatter to a fur suit directly from the Matrix Revolutions. So yes, it sounds crazy, but I suppose you would need to see it in order to believe it. <br /> <br /> That's right, so the closing of “Chinese high history” is not a film without flaws, but in unity. long enough to be able to have fun and generally be a generally pleasant movie. If all of the above doesn't make you think about it, then it's better than Twins Effect II.
