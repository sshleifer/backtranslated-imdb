Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye is a great family movie. Salman Khan looks beautiful and gorgeous as ever! There is even a scene where he takes off his shirt! What a surprise!!! Rani Mukherjee is great too. Puja Batra had very few words to say, but I am glad that she was recognized for her role, because she definitely has potential. <br /> <br /> This is about Prem (Salman Khan), and he is a wedding singer. He is going to marry Niche (Ravina Tandon), but he gets up. Prem goes to Nishi’s house and asks her why he was abandoned, and that’s because her brother is sick and she needs to marry NRA, Rahula (Inder Kumar), to get money to treat him. Prem moves on and comes Priya (Rani Mukherjee). Prem falls in love with Priya, but it is a pity that she is going to marry NRI! Who can be this NRI ?! Priya also falls in love with Prem, while Rahul is next to her. Prem once gives Priya an offensive comment, and she leaves and goes to Agra for a wedding with Rahul. Prem will stop her? See KPNHJ to find out! <br /> <br /> The movie was very funny! The songs were great, especially the song "O Priya O Priya". It is a pity that the film failed in India, and I do not know why?! Every film in India is currently failing !! This film deserves to be hit. The only problem I discovered in the film is that they had an obsession with NRI! They think ALL NRI are rich! The film deserves 9/10!
