“... the rhythm is too strong ... we are now deaf mutants - just like them”, Rex Vorhas Ormin <br /> <br /> I am surprised that this film is obsessed with the idea. Let me be the first one to actually discuss the merits of “Kick” and why YOU SHOULD SEE THIS FILM NOW. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this film is stupid and “bad” in the generally accepted sense: the story is ridiculous, poetry is stupid, and the actors are contradictory. <br /> <br /> But it EXISTS the film - all these ingredients make up the recipe for one of the most unattractive rawish films of the 80s. <br /> <br /> If the mention of “deaf mutants” did not arouse your interest, then perhaps it will be: “What name is“ Rex Voorhas Ormine ”?” This is such an unusual name (for North American audience), what I said to myself: "Even the names of the characters in this damn movie are stupid." <br /> <br /> Well, “Strike” is so fabulously stupid that the “meaning” and “symbolism” behind “Rex Voorhas Ormine” is not revealed too thinly by Bart Waxman (an erroneous consultant whom you love to hate). I won’t spoil the revelation behind Rex’s name, but please don’t worry too much, okay? <br /> <br /> In general, acting is controversial (John Savage - who plays an “interested teacher,” Mr. Ellsworth is pretty good, like the guy who plays Bart Waxman, but the rest of the actors are not convincing). However, acting is NOT detracting from the film. What for? In every action of the actors there is SENSITIVITY, which makes the characters they play cute. So, although the performances may be lame, you still have the impression that the actors are really trying their best. As a result, the sincerity of the actors succeeds where their actors fail (which is quite common). <br /> <br /> The homage to “beat poetry” in this film is bad, bad, bad. But this is good, good, good, when it comes to entertainment. Would you really enjoy "better quality" or "more respectable" poetry - especially in a movie like this? <br /> <br /> People, that would be boring (think of the fools who made us read in high school ... -sanitized to avoid "youth corruption", politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis, etc. .) Even if you do not like poems or “feature films” (with all the “intellectual” postures that mean), you can certainly (and should) most appreciate the FUNNY POETRY IN WANABE ART FILM !!!! How could you not enjoy the following? <br /> <br /> "Do you remember the dinosaur roar? Scotty on the woman’s back is bad, Scotty is bad, oh, the woman is so sad that she washes her hands, and then she waits for the door today, yeah - today!" <br /> < br /> Yes, this is an example of some of the wonderful poems loosely sprinkled everywhere in "Strike." But what about the story, you ask? <br /> <br /> Well, the story is ridiculous. But then again, this is the beauty of this film. In addition to some stamps, stereotypes, and predictable plot points, there are enough truly unique elements in the plot / plot to make things interesting. Who is Rex? Where is he from? What the hell is he talking about? Deaf mutants? Illiterate angels? Do Billy and Kate REALLY understand what Rex is saying? Should the public understand Rex and his poetic squad? (I watched the movie several times, but I still don’t understand everything.) <br /> <br /> Can bad poetry and talent shows in high school really end with violence in the gang? <br /> <br /> I guarantee that you have never seen anything like “The Beat” - the perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry, mediocre but sincere acting and the plot of “Mythopoetics overcomes violence in a gang” in which WILL BE GATHERED BY ANY FILM EVER MADE. <br /> <br /> Bonus for fans of the classic hardcore from New York: Cro-Mags appear in rare films like "Iron Skulls", and really want to see how they perform a few songs. I would like them to include more concert videos, but perhaps this will be “additional” material on the “Collector's Edition” DVD, about which I fantasize. <br /> <br />
