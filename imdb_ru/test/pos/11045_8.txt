Simultaneous viewing of both films is not a bad idea to get an idea of ​​the early production of the film and the action in accordance with the styles of the camera. I nod Garbo (but not really) regarding its naturalness. Robson is majestic. But his performance is aimed at the big theater proscenium. Something else that struck me was the themes of the movie empowering women and minorities. There were no films coming out of Hollywood that would allow the voices of marginal characters, such as Anna and Brutus, to come to the fore. These were very progressive films for their time. It is likely that O'Neal saw the inscription on the wall before everyone else told about the future of America.
