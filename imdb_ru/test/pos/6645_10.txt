First of all, the story is not as simple as many earlier reviewers emphasize; in fact, this is a very complex story, unlike other Bergman films, which are more inclined to study the character. In Scammen, we have two main characters, but since we are abandoned from the very beginning in the middle of the war, we have no idea who is fighting and why, everything is open to any permission. This creates tremendous tension and makes each event significant. As history develops, we become familiar with numerous characters that turn into symbols of humanity, both its dark and luminous sides. We have an example of innocent bystanders trying to do during an absurd war, a cynical doctor who makes fun of his patients and provides the only bitter humor of the entire film, perverted opportunists who are trying to capitalize on the brutal event (Bjornstrand character), innocent dead children, nameless figures almost transformed from a boat into animals, etc. All of them are somehow visible through the eyes of Jan (von Sidow) and Eva (Ullmann), their characters are more restrained in other Begrman films (En Passion), and this is precisely because thu But here history is important, how external events can radically change human nature. <br /> <br /> Bergman made this film two years after Persona, where the main conclusion, expressed by the only word uttered by the character Liv Ullmann, is “INSERT”, nothing. That's all: the meaning of art and the meaning of life, and the latter is nothing more than a play, including all the plays. But what about the war? And especially destroy the twentieth century. In Persona, the only real emotion that Ulman's character suffers from is when she sees the victim of the Vietnam War turned into a human torch. In Scammen, this idea extends to a comprehensive analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. In a nameless region of a nameless country (we only assume that it is Sweden), two factions speaking the same language lead an absurd war. Jan and Eva are two dreamers caught in the middle, but their dreams are woven into a kind of counterpoint. At first, Jan is an idealist, unable to properly respond to the world and submitting to his wife’s will. By the end, he turns into a completely different person, capable of unmotivated murder, strong-willed, ruthless (watch out for suicide on the boat. The simplicity of this act is painful). On the other hand, Eve gradually loses touch with reality, and in the end she is completely immersed in her unfulfilled dream. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the entire film very effectively conveys its message. Bergman puts the viewer next to the character, putting the camera in the car with the actors or in the extreme close-up behind the actor. Nykvist controls the extraordinary control of the camera, there are several workshops of “manual” effects, very good at making everything seem “real”. Frames, when characters are captured by the army, look surprisingly documented. The script is minimalistic, but the story is rather complicated in this respect. In fact, the whole film is paradoxical, its intensity in the subject contrasts sharply with the coldness and lack of emotional involvement with which it is shot and removed. There is nothing melodramatic, there is no compassion, hope and visible redemption. But, as in the dream of Liv Ulmann at the end, everything is so beautiful that it is impossible not to be surprised ... It was not so terrible, because it was so beautiful!
