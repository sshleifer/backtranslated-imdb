I honestly do not know why so many people hate this film, I always thought it was one of my favorite films. the fight against the tiger and its people was rocked, the fight against pirates with swinging axes, the whole parody of all who try to avoid each other in the house is purely brilliant ... well, so she did not have the necessary final confrontation, but the Manchus were pretty good . I give it 8/10.
