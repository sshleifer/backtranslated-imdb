Come on. Anyone who does not understand the greatness of this cartoon should be kicked out of the panel of any critic. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they clearly have no sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Anyone who doesn’t like this cartoon, shot by Tex Avery, should be chained to the chair and forced to watch “Hound Dogs” episodes for 20 years in a row! <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, "Wolves" and "double blows" are the best examples of this important comedy past that has ever been filmed in a movie. <br /> <br /> Tex Avery should receive an Oscar posthumous prize for this cartoon. This is the best.
