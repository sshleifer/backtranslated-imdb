I remember watching this movie when it came out as a TV. film of the week of the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen this film for more than 30 years, I remember how terrible it was ... my sister's dead body in the basement, a storm in the street, a creepy house without electricity, and the killer still indoors. <br /> <br /> They just don't make TV movies like that anymore. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very underrated actress, and I liked her not only in “Enchanted”, but also in several of her post-magical roles, such as this one and “Legend of Lizzie Borden” in 1975. I would very much like someone to come out with a DVD, which has several TVs from the 1970s. Film of the week on one DVD. Wouldn't it be great to watch “When Michael Zoveth,” “Bad Ronald,” “Don't Be Afraid of the Dark,” “Farm Crouchen,” etc., all on one DVD? I know that for all of us who were born in the 1960s and 1970s, there is a market for similar DVDs. Maybe if we are lucky, someday someone will offer us a DVD with a large selection of TV shows. movies like this.
