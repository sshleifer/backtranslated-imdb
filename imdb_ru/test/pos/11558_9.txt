When Melville "Pierre or Ambiguity" hit bookstores in 1852, his first publication after "Moby Dick" a year earlier, the public outcry was similar to that found in the IMDB reviews "POLA X". Newspapers even published headlines like: “Melville is insane!” Which, of course, was not. But when someone compares the writing styles found in Moby Dick and Pierre, he finds in the latter a sharp deviation from the simple and often declarative style found in the former. It is clear that he imitated the excessively ornate style of the now forgotten Victorian romances, which easily surpassed his immortal "Moby Dick." However, he was not ready to release a product that his publishers wanted, and which would undoubtedly be sold. His version of the Victorian novel was perhaps cynical, but brilliant in its synthesis. Alternative title: "Uncertainties" is appropriate. As Pierre seeks and thinks that he is finding the truth, we increasingly doubt what to believe and who to believe. As he seeks happiness, he becomes more and more unhappy. <br /> <br /> POLA X is a fascinating adaptation of this novel, created in modern or almost modern France. Although, in a sense, this gives little to the imagination and clearly shows us the incestuous relationships that Melville could only hint at, the ambiguities that make the novel and its message so tempting, perfectly in tact. The questions he raises are asked by few films, but the answers are left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading the novel, which is much shorter than “Moby Dick”, before seeing this film. I hope more people will find this tantalizing film.
