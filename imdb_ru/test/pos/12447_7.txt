This DVD usually sells for about $ 20. I would not pay so much for the DVD if I knew what I was getting, but, despite this, this is a pretty good disc. He displays the knot in all its glory, with footage from their concerts ... playing Surfacing, Wait and Bleed and Scissors among other tracks, including the music video "Spit it Out", which apparently was banned by MTV. <br /> <br /> Slipknot for those who do not know, in fact, a symphony of the damned: nine masked men who demonstrate complete chaos on the stage, with machine-gun drums, squealing guitar and vocals that will tear your face off wishing you more. For those who have never seen Slipknot, I can't recommend you buy this DVD ... perhaps with eBay or Amazon so you can get a better deal. <br /> <br /> A short but well-made show Knot. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten.
