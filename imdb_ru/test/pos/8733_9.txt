I continuously played this movie this month and I just adore it. I was around the 60s (oh, dear), so this is nostalgia in some sense. However, this is a fun premise, lively dialogue and excellent presentations that make me look. <br /> <br /> Dr. Winston's Reaction to Stephanie at the end of the film is priceless. (I would say more specifically, but I don’t want to spoil it to anyone.) Who, apart from Mattau, can play a person not quite in the spirit, but do we still love him? As for Bergman's costumes, I think she looks as stupid as she should be. I think "she was robbed" once when she appears in an evening dress. It does not suit her at all, which is very bad. I never liked it when I first saw it on her, and I still don’t see. <br /> <br /> Goldie won an Oscar for her role. People thought it was a terrific show at the time, and yet it’s one thing that I don’t like so much as the others. However, she has enough sweetness and attractiveness, which is important for this role. <br /> <br /> And I agree - I thought Rick Lenz was great at it, and it’s a pity that his movie career wasn’t "after that. <br /> <br /> I hope more people will see this movie ... they will like it!
