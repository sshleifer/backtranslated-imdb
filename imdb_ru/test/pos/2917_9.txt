After reading all the comments on this film, I'm still amazed at Fox’s reluctance to release the full-screen, restored version on DVD. Yes, the story may be a little inaccurate, and it’s certainly not as powerful as the book, BUT it was Fox’s second film, shot in Real Cinemascope, and only production values ​​deserve restoration and distribution. I saw this film in the second grade, and this sparked my lifelong interest in everything Egyptian, which culminated in my visit to Egypt 4 years ago! The film’s amazing power on a child’s imagination, eh? In high school I read a book and promised myself one day to go on a trip of my dreams. Now, however, this film was made in the style of "old school", which means that the Egyptians portrayed skinheads with pink skin and blue-eyed Britons. However, has anyone seen the current series of HBO "ROME"? Everything old is old again. It is impossible to imagine why in our time we are still playing actors playing the role of aristocrats Mayfair in Roman dramas. Not a single actor in ROME could have passed for an ancient Italian. At the same time, the AMARNA period in Egypt is still one of the most exciting events in the history of mankind. This film is very attractive (if you borrow a word from NEFER) due to its historical information (BEER! BRAIN SURGERY! IRON!), As well as excellent cinematography and evaluation. I have a terrible Taiwanese DVD version, which I watch again and again, praying that a truly restored widescreen version would be available once. For anyone interested in this topic, I strongly recommend the author of the novel “Advice and consent” the historical novel “God against the gods”. If any movie lover knows how to contact Fox to convince them, please let me know!
