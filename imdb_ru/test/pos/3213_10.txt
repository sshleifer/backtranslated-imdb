when girls started in Germany, I didnâ€™t want to watch them, because for me it was something unique. it was a TV show, and I didn't even know anyone in it. I later realized that Edward Hermann is part of the cast (film, I absolutely adore). I had to watch it once with a friend and have never stopped since. it's just fun. You feel that it is normal to have sex before you get married, and it is normal to be a coffee addict and constantly eat junk food Gilmore even my boyfriend started to look at them, and that says something. from season to season it became better with scenarios and stories. they have an unbiased opinion, and, unlike any other show, you want to be like them.
