River's Edge is a great movie, and it's a shame that he left no trace in the history of cinema. In the eighties there were a lot of sand films about schoolchildren, but from all that I saw; it is by far the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film takes the storyline, which in itself is alarming, and adds the theme of teenage idlers and their indifference to things that takes the story to a new level. The film works because the central story is interesting and played out by complex characters. The film begins with a murder. Then we follow the killer nicknamed John when he returns to school and tells all his friends about what he did. Instead of giving the expected reaction, most of them practically do not react, and the strongest reaction that the killer receives comes from Lane; who makes him number one priority to help John sort out the mess he is in and get him out of it Other friends ponder the crime, and soon one of them goes to the police ... <br /> <br /> B River's Edge has a lot of great performances by a young actor. Keanu Reeves has a reputation as a wooden actor, and for good reason; but he fits very well with this early role, and this performance is definitely one of his best. Crispin Glover is the most outstanding, like the slightly insane Lane. Glover always stands out in every film in which he acts, and while he rises a bit above his head; He convincingly plays the main role in this film. Reeves and Glover receive good support from a talented young team that includes Daniel Roebuck and Joshua John Miller, as well as the great Dennis Hopper in another wild role. The film is a very rough picture, which foreshadows its nihilistic tone. All the main characters are a generation of “loafers / stoners,” and the way they think they really don’t care about killing their friend is more shocking than the killing itself; and the point that the film is trying to make about contemporary society is both strong and well defined. The film is also quite funny, due to some lines of characters; but the humor is absolutely black, and it is clear that this film was never a comedy. In general, this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth a look!
