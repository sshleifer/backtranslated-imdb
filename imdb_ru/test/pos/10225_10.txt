This film is a great example of Barker's cinematic gifts to the horror / monster genre. I thought that this film did a great job in order to preserve the feeling and appearance of the novel and comics (or, actually, comics may have taken second place, I forgot) It helps to read the book in advance, but itâ€™s not so important if you can follow the film. I saw everyone standing on the fence about this film, read a book, and then watched the movie again. You can find a new respect for the film. I came to this film as a big fan of Barker, and after reading the previous book, I immediately fell in love with the movie. This film has excellent cameos, make-up, writing, directing, etc. This film does what most horror / horror films fail, shown by monsters. They are there full-color, not hidden in the shadows and take most of the time on the screen. Unlike other films that use quick cuts or tricky lighting to hide a creature, this film glorifies the grotesque and puts them on the forefront as a good guy. Two thumbs up, Clive. Waiting for the Thief Always :)
