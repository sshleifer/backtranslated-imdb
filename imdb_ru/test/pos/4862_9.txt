Cleopatra 2525 is a very fun, entertaining show. You don't have to take the whole show seriously, but if you want to have fun, this is your TV show. Making Xena is a guarantee of quality, and Cleopatra 2525 is no different from Xena. The formula of women warriors is transferred to the future, where they do not need to fight with warriors or gods, but dangerous robots that live on the surface, and people are forced to live underground. For two seasons of Cleopatra, they develop an interesting and amusing underworld, and we meet three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They are all different, but as a team, they work very well. The three main actresses have previously appeared in Xena, like most of the regular actors / guest actors (there are also some famous faces from Hercules or from both shows). I especially liked the character performed by Daniel Cormac (“Efini in Xena”), which is very different from any of her roles that I knew before. So if you like Xena and Hercules, you'll love Cleopatra 2525. If you don't know them, try it: I'm sure you will like it.
