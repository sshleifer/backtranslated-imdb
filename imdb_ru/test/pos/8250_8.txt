Pearl of the British caper comedy. The poor American schoolboy Pinky Green (Richard Jordan, playing another bad guy, but this time amazing) comes out of a British prison and tries to go straight, but his job in the bank is too attractive for his never-reformed criminal friends led by really nasty Ivan David Niven in one of his last roles). Pinky resists, but the temptation of all this money is too great for him. Things unravel and unravel, and it's all a joy to watch. Jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career, but he never played the same thing twice - itâ€™s too much to love to hate. Niven never played the bad guy with butter. We lost two beautiful actors that I would like to return.
