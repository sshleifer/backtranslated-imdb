Plunkett and Macklin are a fascinating, dynamic and refreshing movie. Refreshing because, unlike most other films of the period, he does not seek to give the audience a lesson in history or pompous preaching - indeed, historical accuracy is almost ignored. This film does not take itself too seriously, and seeks to entertain, not to enlighten. Plunkett and McLean were established in the 18th century, but director Jake Scott proposes a full 90s. There is action, sex and a lot of curses, and in the inevitable ballroom scene the aristocracy dances under the disco. Johnny Lee Miller and Robert Carlisle are great as always, and the rest of the cast, especially Alan Cumming as a flirtatious dog, is also very interesting. The film is visually spectacular in places and is a mixture of comedy, action movie and drama with love interest provided by Liv Tyler with a wobbly English accent. In short, if you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours, this movie is for you. It does not make you think, but may well cause a smile on your face.
