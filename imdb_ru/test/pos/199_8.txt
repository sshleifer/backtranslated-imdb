When watching this film recently, I constantly had to remind myself that it was made in 1957 .......... and in the USSR! It makes it all more wonderful. Many of the cinematic effects in the film seem circumcised in 2002, but they were quite original in 1957. I first saw this film in 1963, when it was first released in the USA, and then I was struck by its originality. Now, seeing this 40 years later, I have no reason to change my mind.
