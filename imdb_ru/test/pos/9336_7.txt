Back in 1983, the popularity of Michael Jackson was such that if he wanted to make a million dollar clip with the American Werewolf team and voice Vincent Price’s voice, that was exactly what he was going to do. Never before has a music video created such a sensation either before or after ... when it was released on VHS, this 13-minute short film became the world's best-selling musical of all time. But, most likely, you already know everything about it, because whenever there is a list of the greatest music videos of all time, this one almost always takes first place. <br /> <br /> It all starts with Michael Jackson walking through the dark street with his date after their car broke down. He explains to her that he is “not like other men” (damn right), and then a full moon appears from behind the clouds. His girlfriend stands there, screaming and screaming, and then screaming a little more, during a generous transformation when Michael Jackson becomes a werewolf. He chases her through the forest, catches her, and we ... cut in the cinema. Oh, it all happens in a horror movie that Michael Jackson and his date are watching. <br /> <br /> So, we have five minutes, and so far there is no sign of the song "Thriller." Extravagant, a lot? Anyway, you need to know how it comes from here ... dancing, singing ... cemetery ... Vincent Price ... zombies ... "What's the problem?" ... then finish the credits. End credits for a damn music video. "Thriller" is not one of the most memorable songs of Michael Jackon, but even by today's standards it is definitely a bitch of visual experience. If you still haven't seen it all, then you definitely should be sometime soon.
