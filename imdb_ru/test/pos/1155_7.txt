The idea, drawn from the present diplomatic incident “Wind and the Lion”, is a very good adventure film, shot in the deserts of Africa. <br /> <br /> El-Raisuli (Sean Connery), the head of an Arab tribe, abducts an American (Candice Bergen) and her two children received some concessions for their country from American President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith). From this simple plot, John Milius gets a very complete and enjoyable film in the genre. <br /> <br /> Outdoor dessert places, impressive color photography, very well-crafted workflows and perfect settings turn the picture into a kind. epic with an undeniable sense of grandeur. The musical score is also great and fits accordingly. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is very good as an Arab leader and proves he can handle almost any role. The same applies to Candace Bergen as a woman who manifests strength in dangerous circumstances, but deep inside is afraid and has its weaknesses; she admires Connery and even understands his completely different orientation towards life, originating from their completely different cultures. Brian Keith plays one of his best roles in the history of US President Teddy Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> The most interesting and very good cinematic sample in the genre. Give him a chance, you will not regret it.
