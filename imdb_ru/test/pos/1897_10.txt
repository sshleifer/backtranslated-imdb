The best film "So bad, it's good" ever created. Rudy Ray Moore is my personal hero. Whether it is everyday life or pimping, I can always turn to him for inspiration and guidance. When it comes to hacking, Rudy is a man. No one is meaner. Watch as Dolemeit and his army of female-only Kung Fu assassins kill Mr. Big and Willie Green. Awesome story, eh? There are so many lines that you need a few views to improve your vocabulary. If you say a couple lines from Dolemite, you're instantly awesome. If you are set on a violent laugh, rent this movie. Also check out the Human Tornado, Disco's Godfather and Petey Wheatrow, The Devil's Son-in-law. Now can you dig it out? <br /> <br /> "You have no business, no need, it is not safe, eat rat soup, mota !!"
