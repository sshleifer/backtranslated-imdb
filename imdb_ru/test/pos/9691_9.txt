I would give this movie 8.5 or 9 points. I thought it was just fun, I don’t know how you couldn’t think this movie was funny, but the only thing that disappointed me was that there were too many rude things because I personally think that when they fly out of bicycles and the like, it's much funnier, but I'm sure there are people who think that other things are very funny, so this is not my decision, but in any case, an excellent film, watch it, and after that it's worth going to buy it, if you don't like this movie, it's good, because I have Eren, there are many people who think that this film shows how demeaning our society or whatever it was, it is my personal opinion and you have yours. In addition, the boxing set is definitely worth downloading or buying, or doing what you do to get the video.
