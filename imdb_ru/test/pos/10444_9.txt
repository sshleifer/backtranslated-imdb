as I said in another comment, this is one of the best films for teens of all time and one of my favorites. For me, this film is the second best film for teens of all time. second only to the breakfast club. The Last American Virgin may also be the most honest teen movie of all time. it is underestimated, and largely unknown film for many people. this comes on TBS maybe once a year, but sometimes longer. The first half of this film is a comedy sex with a few honest scenes. then the second half is pure honest, and most of the time is serious. with just a few comic scenes. In my opinion, this is the best soundtrack of all time. I have never heard so many great songs in one movie before. There are 4 love songs in this movie that I think are one of the best love songs in history. a film about a pizza boy named Gary, a virgin. he is in high school who has a couple of best friends. his two friends are sexually retarded teenagers. The first half of the film is mostly sexual unhappiness. it's very funny Gary is in love with a new girl in school. he later learns that his best friend is dating her. he also cheats on the side. You can feel Gary’s love for this girl very much. You can feel it even more in the second half. Gary's friend turns out to be a scum. but his other friend is pretty cool. The film shows how vile people can be. You can relate to many of this movie. the plot sounds like your typical teen sex comedy. but it is much more than that. this is a very honest film this is also very 80th which i love. if you love the 80s or grew up in the 80s, rent this movie. but there may be people who don’t like the 80s, but may still like this movie. I first saw this film back in 1987, I think. it is very interesting and very funny. he combines very touching moments with very funny moments. This is an underrated gem! I have a movie I love it! I give the last American virgin *** 1/2 of ****
