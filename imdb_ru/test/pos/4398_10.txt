I was at the cinema right away. I saw other Coen films, with the exception of Arizona's Parenting, and noticed that each of their films has a different color. Fargo is gray / white, Lebowski is bright orange, and this film is a nice yellow. <br /> <br /> The bright, pleasing qualities of this film begin immediately. Soon the appearance is accompanied by great, gorgeous music. This is an old folk sound, the kind of music that was written at the time when music was part of everyday life. Enjoy all, chain gangs, church choirs and even escapes from prison. <br /> <br /> Now about the jailbreak. I do not know what crime their characters could have committed, because they are a very close-knit group of guys. Clooney is fantastic, he plays his part very well. <br /> <br /> Go look at it as soon as possible. I believe that anyone on some level can enjoy it. For some reason, the theater in which I was was full of elderly women and old people, and they liked it. <br /> <br /> You will like it too, I promise. I was forced to immediately take over the soundtrack.
