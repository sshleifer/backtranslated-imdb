CACTUS FLOWER was an amazing 1969 comedy based on Neal Simonâ€™s play on the dentist (Walter Mattau), having an affair with a young, free-spirited woman (Goldie Hawn), completely unaware that his dedicated nurse / assistant (Ingrid Bergman) was in love with him. Mattau can play such a role in a dream, and he does not disappoint, like a fooling dentist, Dr. Julian Winston, who meets with one woman, but does not really have the slightest idea that he is in love with another. Goldie Hawn received an Oscar for her brilliant performance in the role of Tony Simmons, an aging flower child, who gradually comes to realize that she is stuck in a deadlock and not as dull as she seems on the surface. But the real pleasure for me in this film was the performance of the legendary Ingrid Bergman in the role of Stephanie Dickinson, a completely devoted assistant of Dr. Winston, who is ready to bury and sacrifice his happiness, while Dr. Winston is pleased with Tony. Bergman glows in this film, looks absolutely beautiful (although the camera has always loved her) and demonstrates an unforeseen dexterity of light comedy. Yes, the dialogues and settings are a bit outdated, but the story is not subject to time, and the performances of the stars make it inevitably observable.
