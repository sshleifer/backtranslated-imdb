I was lucky enough to catch watching this movie at midnight tonight. I must say, I was expecting a horribly cheap movie with a bad game and a mediocre plot. I was completely wrong. This film was not only incredibly interesting, but everything that I liked about it. Bruce Campbell was awesome as ever. The biggest surprise was none other than Ted Raymi, you know, Sam's younger brother. He played the mercenary of the mad doctor to the greatest extent. Somewhere between physical comedy and intelligent dialogue, he did nothing but shine. But I really can't ignore the magic of Bruce Campbell. Although I thought Ted Raimy stole the show, Bruce did what he did best on the big screen. Somewhere between the sketchy nasty American businessman and the tragic victim, he showed the same energy that he always showed, incredibly attractive to the audience. The film itself was often interrupted by applause from the audience. The crowd was definitely thrilled with every little turn that took the film. <br /> <br /> This film may not have been Oscar material, but, my God, it was amazing. I highly recommend this to any Bruce Campbell fan. Also, anyone who likes science fiction movies, do yourself a favor and watch this. Can't wait for it to be released on DVD. <br /> <br /> Take what you want .... <br /> <br /> - Fed
