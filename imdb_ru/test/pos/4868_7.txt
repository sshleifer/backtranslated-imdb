Chuck Jones's “Beep Beep” (so named, despite the fact that Road Runner clearly says “Meep Meep”) is the second of the extremely popular Road Runner series and is a significant improvement over its predecessor, historically important, but boring “Fast and Furry-OE. Although there are several predictable fast-fire jokes in it, Beep Beep also expands this initial cartoon with more ambitious, longer sequences. Chief among them is the fantastic, long chase through the old mine, in which we see Coyote and Road Runner, represented by two small lights. There is also a very funny long joke involving some rocket-driven roller skates. Beep Beep also sees a significant improvement in the presentation of Wile E. Coyote. Not only does he look more beautiful than his clumsy prototype in Fast and Fluffy, he also draws the attention of viewers to a cartoon with lots of looks into the camera to show the brilliance of his ideas or his fear of inevitable pain. Despite the fact that moving a little slower (too many protracted drawings of the drawings impede the pace in some of the early jokes), as soon as the Beep Beep arrives in a sequence of shafts, it becomes clear that Jones really started to deal with it. characters and great possibilities of what he could do with them. There are better road runner cartoons than Beep Beep, but there’s a real sense of triumph in this cartoon, as if it were proof that you had to milk the show from this script.
