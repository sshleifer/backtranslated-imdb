Being familiar with Hatley Hartley for a long time, both in the original book form and in the disappointing film adaptation of the Pinter Lozie film, it was an interesting material. "Hireling" sometimes turns out to be almost a mirror image; set in a slightly less distant period for the main part, showing the exposure of the British class system and containing the sports match with the given parts (box replaces cricket), which reveals quite a lot. <br /> <br /> This is refreshing in a shallow, characteristic focus. You are not entirely “familiar” with Lady Franklin and Leadbitter in an innovative sense, but this distance is appropriately played out, telling the body language and excesses from the actors. Your distance from ever full sympathy to any true character reflects an inactive "difference" that so dooms the central relationship. Miles and Shaw are amazingly thin, and we see more in their “lesser”; never are these acting, spectacular performances. These are suitable interpretations of Stanislavsky, which create the impression that these characters live outside the film. All the other parts do a very good job, although in this film they are much smaller than I suppose in the novel, and they really compare it with “Neighborhood”, a terrific work of disappointment. <br /> <br /> Disappointment at the center of this film is so sadly and touchingly conveyed in the later scenes where Shaw kisses Miles and rejects him, and then when the drunk presenter encounters Country and Lady Franklin. It is a pity that what would have been an incredibly sharp end to a spoiled, desolate life on both sides of the screen is “decorated” with a clearly strange little coda. One of them is completely taken aback by the jump in tone, as Leadbitter Shaw is confused and, ironically, sings "The Rule of Britain" and "God Save the Queen" when she crashes into her car. The political point is largely clouded by this pompous, rather dismal operatic ending. All the sense of subtlety, so effectively transmitted so far, is lost, since the implicit view is made hard and noisy. Agit-prop is definitely not a place in this delicate period drama. <br /> <br /> In general, however, one cannot be too harsh. While this absurd ending is a serious flaw, the rest of the film should be rated as a sensitive, evocative film of sadness and detailed observation of how British society was in the past. Heavy, but crystal clear touch Hartley very clearly visible in everything. It’s just a shame that we don’t end with the crushing conclusion of Shaw’s drunken scene. The tragic, deceptive figure of Lady Franklin Sarah Miles suddenly loses her place in the epicenter of the film, as an excellent human drama bizarrely rolls into the realm of political scoring. The show also - this is the driest and yet deepest sense of the actors - betrayed by the excessive redundant character that closes the film. In this way, petty triumph is trivial; but we have to remember a lot of good moments. <br /> <br /> Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
