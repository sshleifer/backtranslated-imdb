Great show! At about the same time, a reality show arrives that closes the gaps between generations. Competitors vary in age, some seem old enough to watch a movie when it first came out. But others looked so young that perhaps the parents or teachers would broadcast the film in the hope that it would affect their lives just as they had once been. The lubricant really became an American icon. Lubrication is a fun and exciting film in which young and old can communicate. “You're the one we want” will surely get even more Grease followers. The only thing I would like more of them to be is the stories of the characters, but again, it would be nice to leave some of this nostalgic imagination from the 50s. Can't wait to watch the next show ... and then on Broadway !!!
