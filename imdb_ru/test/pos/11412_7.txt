When A Stranger Calls is actually a pretty good movie. I never saw the original and therefore, when I watched it, I thought it was unique. When they advertised "Alien Calls" on television, the trailer gave the ending. Well, I never saw the trailer, so when I saw this movie, I was surprised how well it turned out. Once I passed by him and decided that I would buy it, and now I was lucky, because I thought it was a very nice movie, and it was a good little movie. It is treated unfairly, and if you are generally interested in this film, do not listen to the negative. Camilla Belle is not so bad about the actress as everyone thinks about her, and she did a great job in this film, so everything you hate, overcome yourself, brighten and actually try to enjoy this movie Funny tiny kitten, popcorn. If you have not yet seen, do it, because it is much more pleasant than many other slashers made recently ...
