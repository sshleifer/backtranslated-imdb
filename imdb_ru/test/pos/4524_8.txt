considering Chan's subsequent films, that's not bad. Many stereotypes begin with a black man at the beginning and when the police captain orders to "round off all Hindus in the city." A parade of stereotypical characters takes the stage, including the Shemp of the Three Stooges. Charlie seems to be moving quickly around the city, coming from Sutton Pl. in W. Village in no time. The end is stupid. A clear toy plane is used, which climbs across the sky and then dives into the nose. Ed Wood couldn't do it better. The final scene is absurd, since the killer will obviously accuse himself of trying to reassure a person who knows his identity. Overall worth seeing.
