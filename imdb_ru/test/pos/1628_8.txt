This is a good adaptation of Dan Brown's breathtaking book. I can not say that this is a novel or very good, but they made a film that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could be better, though. The film is quite long, but in the end I felt that something was missing. The sound effects and soundtracks were very good. It was good to act, but the characterâ€™s developmental stage was very weak. For people who have not read the book, things may look too fast. From my point of view, instead of doing something from the book, they could try to make important scenes more appropriate. What makes the book very good was the whole mystery as a story combined with an excellent portrait of the Vatican. You do not see any of this in the film. Too much hype and inefficient use of time - these are the main problems of the film. So it's worth a look, but one could do better.
