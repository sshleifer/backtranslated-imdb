The summary is intended only for those who hate this film, since the search for the film is normal or average. Visiting this movie on IMDb made me nostalgic, since I can't help going back to 1994. I was one of the lucky few who saw this movie in cinemas. It immediately became one of my favorite comedies, and it took several years to make her my favorite. How can I tell what made this film my favorite? It was a great piece of writing (the story was fine, but the script and the dialogue were incredible) Was it an excellent presentation? Was that the mood of the movie? <br /> <br /> After much deliberation, I say that it should be a mixture. This is one of those films in which there were no flaws, even his music. (Another film that comes to my mind now is Sholey) <br /> <br /> PS: Rajkumar Santoshi, please observe the balance of drama and comedy. Comedy alone is not enough. I want more than her ..........
