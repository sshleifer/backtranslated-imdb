When I was 10 (currently 14), I vowed never to watch a movie that I knew wouldn’t have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I was fine, except for Shakespeare for English classes ... and so on ... I still watched only what ended up happy. But then I saw Ramola Garay in Havana Nights, which was sweet, not very good, but interesting enough to see. After seeing it a few times over two or so years since I first saw it, I liked it, especially the music. So I searched for it and found IMDb ... I saw "I'm dancing inside" and suggested that she shot another dance film, and watched it again. Later, when looking for the image (Rory, looking for a Gilmore poster for the locker girls), I took an image from this movie ... Then I searched for a trailer, I found a trailer, and when I saw the hospital and heard Rory say, "You have a future" I remembered my oath and realized that this would not be a good film for me. But it just stayed in my head until we were in the video store, and there it was used for $ 5, so I went ahead and bought it. Seeing this, I just wanted to get it out of my head, because it was so sad. I still would not approach this until I had cerebral palsy as a verbal word. Then I just had to see it again, and this time all I did was laugh, even in the saddest places I didn’t feel depressed anymore, because I realized that this whole film was happy and uplifting ... I’m sure this is the worst comment you’ve ever read. But watch the movie, it's worth it.
