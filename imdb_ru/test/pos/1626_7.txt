Until now, I have not read a single book by Dan Brown, but I watched all of his films. I will not go into the game to rate it with the previous one, because the scale is not exactly the same: in fact, this is a thriller, a time trial filled with puzzles. <br /> <br /> The plot is very twisted, creative, the cast is great: I've never been a big fan of Hanks, but he does a good job. I noticed his denim shirt (the one that was drenched in blood), because I'm looking for something like that in vain! The Italian seeker is a brilliant newcomer to me, but I really applauded the image of Evan MacGregor: his inner faith and serenity are really impressive. <br /> <br /> I really like the debate between science and religion. The action taking place in the Vatican was like a rest. Finally, I'm not sure that this helps add new converts to Christianity. With all the manifestations of the presence of gold and men, anyone would ask what charity means and why women are so excluded from church life, while they support half or more believers.
