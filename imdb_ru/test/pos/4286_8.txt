A few years ago, when I first read John Irving’s World on the Harp book, I was amazed that most young people with whom I spoke did not like the book when I liked it. I began to realize that it was a thing of age and experience. I experienced some deja vu while reading some comments on this site that were clearly written by young viewers. Full enjoyment Separate lies - this is certainly age and experience. <br /> <br /> In this film, the viewer sees a seemingly happy couple from upper middle class — he is a successful lawyer — she is the ideal wife of a successful lawyer. They have a townhouse in London and a house outside the city. All is well, until the "villain" enters the image of the son of the richest man in the village. This guy seems to suck on the word "go." He despises everyone and everything, including his children. In the traditional form of the good guys ending up last, the lawyer's wife enters into an affair with a rider. You see, a lawyer is a really nice guy, but with a dash of an organized perfectionist killed by marriage. Although he really loves her, he is bored to death by his wife. A bad boy is much more exciting. <br /> <br /> All this is confused in the death penalty of a man in the village, in which all the facts indicate that Cad was the driver of the vehicle. . <br /> <br /> It is easy to determine that this film does not come to a happy end, but it does lead to a very pleasant end, in which a man and his wife study and grow based on their experience and will probably be able to conduct their personal life in a more successful way. <br /> <br /> Three great actors play the main characters of this film, and it is there that there are performances that make it all enjoyable to watch. Tom Wilkinson is beautiful as a husband. His image shows us a kind person who so controls his emotions that he has lost contact with the world. Emily Watson shows us a woman who is so trapped in the role of the perfect wife that she almost lost her knowledge of passion. This passion is revived by a character skilfully played by Rupert Everett. <br /> <br /> If you have reached that point in life when you realize that everyone has feet of clay, and everyone — even with gifts of intelligence and opportunity — makes a lot of wrong decisions, then you will probably enjoy watching these wonderful actors creating the lives of three such people. This is a beautifully filmed and directed adult film about realistic adults.
