Awesome, deeply touching crime thriller featuring Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan. <br /> <br /> From a dizzying introductory sequence to an extremely pleasant conclusion, this cat and herd hardly miss a beat. <br /> <br /> Johnny To, again working with composer-ace Arthur Wong, creates another opera actor who encounters his contemporaries. <br /> <br /> Images That are strong and touching. Its cutting in combination with unusual musical remarks is exemplary. You are in the hands of the main filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Two sequences in which Andy Lau “hides” from the police in the bus, pretending to accompany the flexible beauty (Ruby Wong) are evidence of the uniqueness of To. directing skills. <br /> <br /> Lau Ching Wan is strong and commanding as a harassed policeman, and Andy Lau is dynamic as dying, avenging the death of his father. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie, only slightly compromised by poor English dubbing in the same scene with the criminal Waze Lee.
