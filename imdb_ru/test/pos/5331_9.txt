Leland Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to prison for killing an autistic child. When pressure is put with the question “Why?” He has no answer. In prison, he meets Pearl (Don Cheadle), his teacher, who decides to take matters into his own hands and helps Leland understand why he did it. In this film, we learn all about Leland's hectic life, including his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone), his famous father Albert (Kevin Spacey) and his entire sad life. <br /> <br /> This film is Matthew Ryan Hoge’s second film, and it’s impressive in almost every respect. This is one movie that makes you think about how it all works. The film is rather dark, but if you can handle it, you will understand how good it is. <br /> <br /> There is no bad guy in this movie. No one can blame everything that happens. There are no stereotypes, and the public is not trying to prove Leland guilty. Instead, we sit back, relax, and watch the life of this boy unfold throughout the film. All the problems described in the story are very real. Drug addiction, parental expectation, all-consuming sadness; they all exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling gives one of the greatest achievements of his career in this film, being a depressed teenager Leland. His father lives in Europe and does not care much about his son. The only person he loves is Becky, but she has her own problems. He knows exactly what he did, but, as he says in the film: “You want why, but perhaps not alone. Maybe this is what just happened. There is a reason, but we will not know about it to the end. When you watch a movie, viewers are surprised that such a young man can know so much about the world. Leland notices things that people tend to ignore. <br /> <br /> A very thoughtful scene that really affected me was during one of Leland's conversations with Pearl. Pearl has just changed his wife, and when Leland asks why, Pearl replies that he is just a man. Then Leland says something that really doesn't occur to anyone: “Why do people say it only when they do something wrong?” <br /> <br /> Chris Klein provided another fantastic acting job . In the film, he plays Allen Harris, boyfriend of sister Becky Julie (Michelle Williams). Although he is not one of the main characters, I was amazed at how deep his character was. You can relate to Allen a lot. You know how much he cares for the Pollard family. As if they were his own flesh and blood. By the end of the film, you understand how far he will go to help them. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a masterpiece that was not noticed by many people. However, if you spend time viewing it, you will most likely see that everything I mentioned above is true. And as soon as you finish watching it, you will never again look at the world in the same way. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
