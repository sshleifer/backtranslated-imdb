The adaptation of 1978 contained all the components of a potentially remarkable film. It is based on the absolutely charming book of Charles Kingsley. This is really a talented cast from such artists as James Mason, Bernard Cribbons and David Tomblinson, not to mention the vocal talents of David Jason and John Pertwee. There are also Lionel Jeffreys, the director of such great classics as "Children of the Railway" and "The Amazing Mr. Blandin", and although the film is mostly good, it is also a little disappointing. I had no problem playing, especially with Mason and Tomblinson as Grimes and Sir John Harriet, respectively, and Tommy Pender and Samantha Gates are as believable as Tom and Ellie. The voice act also deserves praise, especially John Pertwee, who voices charming characters on his own. I also liked random music, it is so intrusive and beautiful, and the script was pretty faithful and generally well written, especially at the beginning. The characters, especially the Water Babies, are very adorable, and the villains are ominous and funny at the same time, I liked the role, when Tom and his friends help the Water Infants escape, seeing the shark chasing an electric eel with an ax, was very funny. Nevertheless, I will say that the film looks outdated, especially the animated episodes, live action films were not so bad if you forgive the rather dark cinematography. The character's animation was fairly even, and the backgrounds were sometimes a bit dull, although there were some nice moments, such as the scene with Krakon and, of course, the first meeting with the Water Babies. I also had mixed feelings for the songs, the song Water Babies was beautiful, but I found the first song to be forgotten when Tom was under water. Hi-Cockallorum is an example of a song that looks like a food warmer, you either love it or hate it. Personally, I do not know what to do with this song, at first it was interesting to listen, but when it is in your head, it may be annoying. No matter how much I like Lionel Jeffries and his films, his leadership simply lacked the miracle and magic that it usually does. In general, of course, not a terrible film, but perhaps it would be better artistically. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
