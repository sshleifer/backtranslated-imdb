This is such a fun and funny movie. Very interesting at all angles. This shows a strange array of unforgettable, psychotic, but attractive nuts. We have; the judge, Sargent, child, terrible old woman, whore, clown. And, unfortunately, they all live in a big house that does not have locks and is understaffed. Therefore, for our pleasure, we see them running, playing games, and dangerous. We will also learn a lesson along the way ... never give your patient an ax! <br /> <br /> This was before the Zuccos Nest, and surpasses it. At least on a fun level. He even has his sweet moments. “Love is pure. Love is mercy. Love is power. You love me, your love is pure, you will always love me. ” Now, who could resist it? Nuts are people too. Just a few loose wires. Be a little careful, otherwise you will get an ax in the back! Kids are playing. Hehe. <br /> <br /> The phone repair specialist was really funny, and his reaction to the crazy and irritable boss was truly sincere. All the characters in this movie are extremely well played. And I really found them ridiculous. No, cheerful! They may even give you dirty thoughts about how you can use them. Or how they can use you. <br /> <br /> This is actually a very smart movie. A brilliant turn ends. I have to say that I expected it to be good, but I never expected IT. This is terrible. You no longer control the situation! ”I love it. The ending is so SO beautiful ... you are watery. <br /> <br /> I am so excited to see such a movie. I will never forget it now. This is not just a cult ... this is a CLASSIC cult. Whatever you do ... Do not look in the basement !!!
