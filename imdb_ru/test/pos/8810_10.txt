The film takes a long time to get to the already numb particles of my brain that have not yet been extracted because of the recharge and reappraisal of the world of film copies. But this film was on my list of “Magic Films”. To become a “magic film”, he must leave every string of my thrill in what I can only define as “bliss” and “complete satisfaction”. This film penetrated the fibers of what my mind thinks, and if it were not for the personal connection between my head and the head of the one who did this action, it would be like another movie “dead rave scene” when the 90s exploded Ecstasy craze. This is not at all how the film seemed to me. It came to me and raised something that I considered dead for a very long time, and pushed me enough to give it my own criticism. I forgot how long ago I saw something that made me feel so good inside. I highly recommend watching this movie.
