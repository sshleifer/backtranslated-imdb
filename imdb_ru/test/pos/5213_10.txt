The only reason I decided to watch this film was because of the great acting talents of Karen Syllas, (Alison Haywood), Bad Money, 99, which is closely related to Gary Cole (Dave), "Crying Wolf", '05, who is a great war hero and has all the ways to make money and never stops telling FALSE. Alison and Dave are trying to restore the old house and restore it in comfortable living conditions. The relationship becomes unpleasant, and Alison decides to find out what is happening, and the plot becomes very mysterious. If you're a big Karen Sillas fan, this movie is for you. I just wish Karen would appear in more films, I miss her great talents.
