The great British director Christopher Nolan (Momento, Insomnia) makes this strange film about a writer fighting a writer obsessed with the following people. At first, this turns out to be harmless, but it soon becomes dangerous after moving further, having met a like-minded person who shows him all the entrances and exits. Soon, two men fall over their heads into a strange world in which the mafia and prostitution are involved. Jeremy Theobald plays the writer, and Alex Howe is a like-minded person. Both are great. This low-budget film was shot in a full partisan style, without permission for any locations and without big stars, but it has something that many huge budget films lack, which is a smart script and creative guide. The impressive debut of one of the best directors of today. A good thing!
