Rush in Rio is a terrific DVD. This concert is one of the peak moments in Rush history, and they deliver their music superbly and with more power than ever. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to attend this concert, and not only, I was in the front row, grabbing the gate that separated the audience from the stage !! This is the first and only time I saw Rush live, and for me it was a dream. I have no words to accurately describe this experience, but I can say that this is one of the most vivid moments in my life. <br /> <br /> Some people complain about the sound of this DVD, saying that it is not very clear and sharp, but the sound you listen to is real, true to the way it was at the concert. It is raw, powerful and so authentic that every time I watch it, I come back and relive this beautiful moment again. Many artists record live performances, and then they make a lot of changes, so the end product is far from what a real concert was. Of course, you can achieve a very complex and sharp sound in this way, but you will not get the real thing. This is not the case with Rush in Rio, this is the real deal !! I admit that I like these unusually sounding live DVDs, I love music, and sound is a very important aspect, but it's nice to listen to an honest concert. You listen to Rush just as they sound live, without tricks and tweaks. This is a real live DVD. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Rush in Rio, the set list is fantastic, and the performances of Geddy, Alex and Nil are simply amazing. Not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they love Rush and sing to every melody, even YYZ, which plays an important role! I actually seem to sing twice; in Tom Sawyer, I sing "always with hope, but discontent," and in Earthshine I sing "just reflect." It's only a few seconds, but I just could not believe my eyes when I saw myself in a hurried DVD! Awesome !! I hope you enjoy this magnificent concert of the greatest band on earth.
