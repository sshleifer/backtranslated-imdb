I really liked this movie. I have a real sense of justice and an “eye for an eye,” and this film demonstrates this at its peak. A large valley ranch offers Glenn Ford a very low price for his ranch; then one of his hands on the ranch is beaten and fired, "to help him make a decision to sell." When the ranch hand dies and the sheriff refuses to do anything, Ford at first doesn’t seem to want to do anything, warning his people not to take things in their hands. But this is exactly what he is going to do. I knew that this film was going to catch fire when he entered the salon and ran into a guy (Richard Djekel, one of my favorite actors with a bad guy) who killed his ranch; after a gentle dialogue with him, Glenn Ford slaps his face and shoots him. Something like a careful addition of justice, he kills this guy with a pistol that belonged to his killed cow. Soon we turn to Ford, which allows him to burn his ranch, so his people justify the ambush of the crew from another ranch; then Ford and his men run a horse and a large bad guy ranch cattle; then they appear and burn the outbuildings and the big fancy house to the ground. Talk about becoming even big. Lots of action in this movie. There is more to this than this, but I just recommend you watch a movie. Glenn Ford was the one who showed again and again what can happen if you are mistaken, and I really liked to watch him seek justice in the old way.
