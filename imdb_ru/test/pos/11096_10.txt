FALCON AND SNOWMAN is an excellent example of a film against the 80s. Although many other films of the decade lacked substance at all, this film is pure substance. There is nothing stylish, fake or superfluous. He boasts two great performances: Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as lifelong friends Christopher Boyce and Donton Lee, respectively. Hatton, Penn and Tom Cruise were a triumvirate of actors from the early 80s who seemed to be inclined to much more and better (all 3 starred in TAPS). While the popularity of Penn and Cruise soared, Hutton was largely forgotten, and that is a shame. In fact, Hatton is the first of three who won an Oscar for a supporting role in the film “Ordinary People” in 1980, but I think his performance in this film is even more outstanding. <br /> <br /> Hatton truly captures the post-Vietnamese rebellion of the war in his character Chris Boyce. An unsuccessful student at the seminary, Chris has a love-hate relationship with his father, a well-played great character actor Pat Hingle. The scene where Chris quotes a poem that his father thought he had long forgotten is particularly strong. <br /> <br /> Chris takes a job at the Department of Defense and uses his hatred for the US government and its foreign policy. sell seemingly useless plans for old projects to the Soviets. He invites his friend Dalton, who is involved in drug self-care, to be a courier for microfilm plans. As long as Chris does this based on his beliefs, Donton does it strictly for money. The Soviet representative plays great David Suchet. Penn and Suchet have very strange chemistry, and this is a kind of funny exchange between them. But do not be mistaken, this film is not the same. This is a serious character study of pessimism, malaise, paranoia and distrust. <br /> <br /> Again, the main roles in this film. Hatton demonstrates a brilliantly understated view, like Chris, a rather intelligent young man who had so much potential. Penn, as usual, makes an amazing testimonial like Dalton, a pathetic loser who acts earlier than he thinks, and most of the time does not think at all. The ending of this movie based on facts is very sad on several levels. Really powerful character research.
