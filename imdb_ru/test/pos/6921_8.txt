i will tell you that it was great. Dylan Moran is just the funniest actor on the screen (and on stage), and with Michelle Kane as your partner is also good, and it’s great to watch both in a really funny movie. True, not all jokes are removed, but it is worth taking the time to do it, but Michelle Kane is wearing a dress (the entire cost of the entrance ticket), and every time Dylan Moran’s screen looks more like Bernard’s black film. the story of two actors (Moran and Kane) who decide to steal money from a group of gangsters, playing different characters to fool them all, but getting away with hands is another matter. mostly “actors” is a great British comedy that many somehow missed, seriously, if you are a Moran fan (or want to see Michel Kane in a dress), they will definitely see it
