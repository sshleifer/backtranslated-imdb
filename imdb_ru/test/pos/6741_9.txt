The spectator, who said he was disappointed, seems wildly to lose sight of the point here. This is an excellent film, excellent and realistic images of a middle-class Jewish family in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, a long time ago. The nuances are beautiful, and I felt that the casting of all was superb. Especially it seemed to me that the acting of Judith Ivy was simply perfection, especially the speech that she gives to her daughter when the daughter comes home late at night. This scene was Oscar-worthy. But, in fact, everything was fine. I recommend this movie. It is a fun, family-friendly film and delightful to see how a beautiful middle-class family lived in Brooklyn so long ago. Take a look, and you'll be glad you did. He has very funny lines, and Eugene's character is a real comedian - very funny.
