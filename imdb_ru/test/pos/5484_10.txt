I just saw this movie for the first time last night. Blimey! What movie! This is a movie that you want everyone in the world to see, because it's so cool and so interesting. <br /> <br /> I don’t want to say a word about the plot, because I think it would be better for people to walk in the cold. DO NOT READ THE SUMMARY BEFORE watching a movie! All I'm going to say is that Eastwood, Malkovich, Peterson, and Jeff Maguire’s script are top notch. I would like all thrillers to be more like this.
