Anyone know where I could get this video or movie for this. I have been looking for a long time to show my daughter, to show her, and I cannot find it anywhere. probably because it was only on video and they never made a DVD or VHS or idk. <br /> <br /> I saw it right away from Disney in 1996, and I think it will be the best video to show it. such a good movie in which all kinds of emotions are displayed throughout the entire movie. There are also many actors who began their careers with this film. If someone knows how to get a copy of this film or has a copy, and wants to sell it to me for 50 bucks or so, call 201-566-0148. thank you
