Cleverly written, well acted, intensely and intensely. This show lives in the real world, not as fantastic as “24” (by the way, I'm a big fan of 24). He has believable characters, and in many ways he is much smarter than most in this genre. He tries to present both sides of Islam. So far I have watched the first 4 episodes and find the story more evenly balanced. Terrorists are more complicated and not one-dimensional. And as a result of this balance, terrorists become more frightening than typical villains, who are portrayed in movies and on television. And last but not least: the hero is truly heroic, without being a cartoon. I recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of 24 and such.
