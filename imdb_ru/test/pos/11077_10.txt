I'm not one of those who love these anime cartoons (like Pokemon, Dragonball Z, Naruto), but in my opinion, Zatch Bell is different from others. Zatch Bell is more exciting, has better characters and does not pay much attention to weapons or Mamodo, as many as the episodes I have seen, for example, “The Big Brother Kanchome episodes”, “Zach vs Kiyo”. Zatch Bell really focuses on the life of the strange Zach, the Clever Kiyo, the Silent Stupid, and WeIrD Ponygon. <br /> <br /> -Robbie H. (aka Vectorman)
