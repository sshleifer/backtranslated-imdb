This film is considered to be another of the recent drama drama imposed on us by Hollywood, and is notable for the fact that others have completely failed (especially considering the underestimated role in the recent dramatic image of Natalie Portman), this film is unanimously moved by chemistry that shares both Susan and Natali. They seem so natural during the movie that you would take them for a real family. In the story, they experience so many conflicts between mother and daughter that it is difficult not to understand their acting skills. I feel that the talented performances of these two actresses took places where the story was absent and was almost too familiar (full of clich√©), and really saved the suffering plot. I would recommend this film mainly to those who love one of two actresses or such dramatic films.
