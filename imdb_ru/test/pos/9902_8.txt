“Departure” is a very witty and honest image of a strange family that turns out to be Jewish. Judaism plays little or no role in the film, but American Jewish culture and behavior are carefully described ... with love. I would like the film to relate to a religious perspective on the topics that it explores, because I think it would be interesting. <br /> <br /> I have never been a fan of Colombo, so I was not familiar with Peter Falk - it is very interesting to watch him. It's nice to see Judge Reinhold, Laura San Giacomo and David Paymer again - why are they not working anymore? They are all funny. The script is awesome, with many memorable one-line players, which I will definitely use with my family. Watch out for Gavin MacLeod (Captain Stabing!) As the doorman.
