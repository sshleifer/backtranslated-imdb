If I look closely enough, you can find flaws in this film, primarily with the help of the script. I found Wolf's character not entirely convincing. However, these were my only “complaints”. Because when this movie started on Kabel, I was just going to record it and watch it later. However, from the very beginning, when creepy music and Cameron Diaz were performing their 60s dance, I was chained. I never got up until the movie ended. It seemed that I did not even blink. <br /> <br /> Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster played great. The scenes were beautiful, the girls were beautiful, and the music was ghostly and very touching. The story was completely unique and sometimes had a surreal quality. The viewer would have liked the picture more if he understood the state of mind of young people in the 60s and 70s, especially in America. Many of the scenes have largely succeeded in showing something from an era that is difficult to determine. It was a bit more complicated than the simplistic statement that they wanted to change the world and were disappointed, although this may be the most obvious aspect. Phoebe learns more and more about it as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> One aspect that other reviewers do not seem to cover, which is worth mentioning is how two daughters seem to float through life after the death of their father. They both adored him, and his presence was a stabilizing factor in their lives, and, obviously, he loved them very much. Today we read so much about boys who lose their fathers too early just to get lost themselves. This film tells about the wave effect of the loss of a father on the remaining daughters, first on the older sister Faith, and then on her younger sister. Their mother feels inadequate to try to be both parents. This type of dynamics is not considered in any other films, especially in very many different layers of the plot and the plot. Phoebe's inner struggle for reality versus perception is gradually moving aside, like onion layers. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the plot, this film should be higher than here. I kept waiting for some great conspiracy to learn about the death of the Faith. The way it was decided in itself surprised me, even if others could have guessed much earlier. <br /> <br /> Maybe not for everyone, but I could watch this movie many, many times.
