Once upon a time, Troma, the company that brought us the classics of cinema, such as: "Toxic Avenger", "Mad Grannies", "Poultry farmer", "Handsome Zombie" and "Surfing Nazis", should die), long ago decided Adapt Shakespeare's famous play Romeo and Juliet. This adaptation decided to revive the story by adding bizarre sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, piercing and incest, and she managed to create a whimsical, but funny movie. Anyone who goes into production Troma should know what to expect, and this is an irreverent and perverse comedy with a lot of political mistakes. Expect a lot of nods to other Trome movies and a lot of re-used jokes (turning machines over and twisting the head). Many may think that this sounds like complete nonsense, that only morons will find it ridiculous ... they may be right, but at the same time they may need to lighten up and enjoy the madness and torpor of the mind, which is Tromao and Juliet. <Br /> <br /> With a great cast, a funny script (by James Gann and Lloyd Kaufman), a suitable soundtrack and lots of great visual jokes, Kaufman again managed to turn what was right upside down and get a hell of a lot of power. each. Take popcorn, have a beer, invite your friends and enjoy Thromeo and Juliet - an adaptation of Shakespeare with lots of balls. The end. <br /> <br /> 4/5
