I'm not sure that I've ever seen a black comedy from Denamark, but in fact it's pretty good. Humor is suitably restrained and unfazed to go with some horrible actions. Svendu and Bjarne are tired of working for their boss, because he always suppresses them (in fact, he mentions that they were not smart enough to unzip the zipper before peeing in one place). They do what they need to open their own butcher shop, and when a worker accidentally locks himself in the fridge for the night, fixing the light, they come across something that makes their butcher shop much more popular than their old boss . In fact, he is the one to whom they sold their first fillets, and this is partly his fault, since he served them at a Rotary dinner at his house, and the guests came to the delight of this and came to Svend and Bjarn the next day . Bjarne is somewhat frightened by what Svend did, but it does not stop there. Svend rose above his sad little existence to become someone with some popularity that is new to him, and he does not want to refuse it, so the freezer continues to fill with all sorts of acquaintances (and, at some point, "Little Swede from parka"). However, there are suspicions, because the ex-boss Holger believes that something is wrong. Bjarne is also haunted by his twin brother, Eigil, who for many years lived in a sanatorium in a coma and on whom Bjarne wanted the plug to be put on so that he could receive inheritance money to help open the store. When Eigil was removed from his respirator, he came to life, much to the horror of Bjarne. And Bjarne has a love interest in Astrid, who works at the cemetery. Neither Svend nor Bjarne are well-adapted people, and therefore everything starts to get out of control. Fairy-tale humor really does it, and although it’s not really funny stuff, it’s certainly fun. This is somewhat creepy, although it treats cuts of meat and body parts that are randomly lying around, especially since these two take it for granted. If you are a fan of black comedies, it is recommended, I really liked it. 8 out of 10.
