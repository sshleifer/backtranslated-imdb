A great movie. The film was even better than advertising. And believe it or not, it was very, very inspiring. I really think that anyone who comes out of the film at the end will be somehow inspired. <br /> <br /> It was pretty trite at the very beginning, but it quickly leaves. I was laughing. I laughed very hard at some of the details. The game is mostly above average, nothing special, but better than average. I can say with confidence that this was the second funniest film to be released this summer (the 1st funniest film is CLERKS II). Therefore, after all this, I give him 7/10 (high seven, but not quite eight).
