DI. (4 out of 5 stars) Wow, I certainly didn’t expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I never heard of it until one day I saw it in the discount compartment for video. I thought that Jack Webb, an instructor for an army drill, might be good for a laugh, but I thought that the drama would turn pale compared to the recent D.I.s film, as in “Full Metal Jacket” or “Officer and Gentleman”. Boy, I was wrong. This is probably the best work Webb has ever done ... much better than his performances on the same note "Dragnet". His dialogue with the cool guy is just great ... done in his patented monotone of equanimity, and yet you * know * that guy means every word of it. This story may seem a bit strange compared to the following dirtier war films, but I still found the film fascinating and convincing. Even a completely unnecessary musical interlude in an army nightclub hooked me. Does anyone know where I can get a copy of this amazing song by Ray Konif "If'n You Don't Somebody Else Will"? Webb plays the toughest drag trainer in history ... and he is under pressure to knock out dead fighter Owen, but damn, he sees a man buried somewhere in this sisiboe, and he will pull him out, kicking and screaming! Quality goods!
