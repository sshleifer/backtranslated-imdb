For all viewers who watched The Cure, I would agree with this commentary that this is an excellent film and very touching. Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro prove their stellar quality in this film with Dexter (Mazzello) mom Annabella Skyhorra. <br /> <br /> When I first watched The Cure on TV, I didn’t know what to expect, but when I watched this masterpiece, it soon became clear what he was talking about. Dexter, an 11-year-old boy who suffers from AIDS, sits in his backyard, playing with his toys, when one day he meets his neighbor Eric, who is at first a little uncomfortable for two boys, but they soon became good friends. <br /> <br /> During the film, I kept wondering what would happen to these two boys, as they made me wonder. I wonder how the hell they get to New Orleans, sitting behind the door with a sea biscuit, pulling an inflatable crocodile. There were other great scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> But the part that reached me was the part when Dexter’s health began to deteriorate. You just could not help but wonder if he was going to do it, but by the end you will find out. At the first draw, they thought that Dexter was really dead, he was clearly not a stupid me. But when they play the third, something is very wrong. Dexter does not get up to laugh and shows no laughter. At this point, the victim of their pranks soon announces that poor Dexter is dead. In this part I lost it. I closed my eyes and I cried from this scene. You just have to. As the end draws closer, you begin to understand the loss of Eric, and then the film ends with a pleasant note when Dexters' shoe swims very slowly downstream. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was excellent. It has laughter, adventures, emotions, sadness, etc. When you put it in a blender, you get a great one, be sure to watch the movie. Peter Horton did an excellent job with the film, and I’m sure he’s one of the best. But now I will try to find this movie on DVD, if one exists. Once again, an excellent film that takes you to an emotional roller cone.
