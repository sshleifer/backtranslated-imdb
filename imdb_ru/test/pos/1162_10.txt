This is one of my favorites for all time. All the actors do an excellent job. Comparing this film with Lawrence of Arabia is not fair for both films. Wind and Lion create a much smaller budget, fantastic actors portray spiritual characters in a soulful atmosphere. As well as action and beautiful pictures that together guarantee my favorite movie.
