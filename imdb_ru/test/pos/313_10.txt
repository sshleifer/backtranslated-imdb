The Apocalypse Now by Francis Ford Coppola is not a film about the Vietnam War. Do not confuse it with one. This is the back of the war, but it is a metaphorical exposition about the deteriorating impact of war on the human psyche. It is also one of the wildest films ever made, created, or even conceived (the second after the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To call it a masterpiece is an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the levels of film production. <br /> <br Opening without captions and following the unforgettable first scene playing to the melody of the Doors “The End” in which captain Martin Sheen Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates images of helicopters and napalm, the plot is essentially set forth in the first 15 minutes. "Stop ... with prejudice" Colonel Kurz (Marlon Brando), who invariably went AWOL to the far corners of the Cambodian jungle and, as his general said, “works there without any actions.” Decent restraint, completely beyond any acceptable human behavior. And he is still in the field commander of the troops. "Kurtz is a delusional colonel who is now worshiped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god. For Willard, this secret Operati he seems somewhat more manageable than a real fight, but the journey that he is about to accomplish will be a personal task that will challenge the limitations of his human behavior. <br /> <br /> Teaming up with a small team, they hit the road. down the vast river in a shaky boat. On the way, Willard teaches himself everything, Kurtz. During Shin's hoarse voice, he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was highly decorated and respected by the Green Beret. He was a normal man with his family, until part of him succumbed to the horrors of human cruelty and acted along the path that Willard leads. The descent into the jungle is marked by a fascinating aura, which echoes the battles that are not far away. Ultimately, the power of experience affects the group like drugs and a kind of solitary confinement attacks their feelings. But Willard seems indifferent and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. When he reads about this mythical figure, he is attracted by the power of man and why he became what he became. We know that Willard’s slow decay will go hand in hand with Kurtz’s decay. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando has been honored for decades. His presence: incomparable. His genius: undeniable. But for those who are not familiar with his acting skills and are not used to their physical nuance, Brando can be perceived in the eyes of an uncompromising viewer as a cracker. He is definitely not. It was difficult to work with Brando, it is difficult to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for incomprehensible irritations and unprecedented monologues is irrefutable. The man clearly knew what he was doing, even if we did not know it. His colonel Kurtz is a man of unlimited delusions and deep depth. <br /> <br /> If the film demonstrates traveling to hell, then the real experience of Francis Ford Coppola in creating this masterpiece is the real story of the life of one person. fanatical struggle to create a movie. It is reported that during the filming of the principle of more than 200 days in the film Coppola was thinking about suicide. The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; This is a grueling movie to watch. Coppola sweat and blood seep through the pores of paired locals, and his self-sacrificing filters seep through the holes of the ghostly soldier Martin Shin Willard. <br /> <br /> I cannot help but feel a warm feeling of nostalgia for this type of film. At the dawn of everything that was original and unprecedented, films that defied and stimulated were commonplace. In addition to audacity, “Apocalypse Now” is a pure movie. I respect and admire Mr. Coppola of the highest order. But I shudder at returning to what has become the norm for modern cinema standards: the lack of innovation. This is not just the non-originality of the world of cinema today; it is a fact that no one seems to want to tell a story or tell it from the heart anymore. But we still have such great ones as Coppola's masterpiece, a film bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than what we could understand. <br /> <br /> This depth in the Apocalypse Now is a step into insanity. Murder may be a bother. Losing innocence can be frustrating. But it is damage from within; countless images that grieve, unnerve and separate us from our everyday world, and memories that plague our deepest thoughts, which ultimately separate us from humanity and push us into the realm of instinct, savage and animalism. If the thought of killing does not provide for a livelihood, the act of killing provides the person with his fundamental catharsis.
