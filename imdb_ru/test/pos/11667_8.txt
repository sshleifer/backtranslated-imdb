"It is easy to kill a monster, but it is difficult to kill a person." <br /> <br /> In the St. Thomas residential project and the Angola prison in New Orleans, The Walking Dead is the true story of Helen Prezhan (Susan Sarandon), sister of the Louisiana nun who became friends with Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn ), a murderer and a rapist, heading into a lethal teenage couple injection killing machine ?? Sister Helen agrees to help the convict and stay with him until the end - an act that had never before been committed by a woman. <br /> <br /> At her first meeting, Poncelet swears to a nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both children and pleads with her to help in a new trial to convince the hearing of the pardon board to save his life ?? <br /> <br /> The film sets for the audience the task of thinking about the consequences of the death penalty for a person, but voices angry parents, whose children were shot, killed, raped and left in the forest to die alone ?? <br /> <br /> As Poncelet’s execution draws closer and closer, his character looks deceptively complex, in which there are doubts about the correctness of what they did to him ?? At one moment, we hear how he sensitively asks for a lie detector test to tell his mother that he is innocent, and at another we see him in a rage playing the victim, accusing the government, drugs, blacks, children of are they there ?? Poncelet never realized that he had so much robbed Percy and Delacroix that he left them nothing but sorrow ?? They will never see their children again, never hug them, love them, laugh at them ?? <br /> <br /> In the scenes that led to his execution, a death row inmate throws off his terrible facade and reveals his identity ?? Fortunately, both Sarandon and Penn are exceptional here, successfully implementing the refined, tangible harmony of souls. When Sarandon looked at Penn, did she project compassionate eyes full of tears? She asks him to visualize her, how does he die? “I want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love,” “at that moment we truly believed that she would become the face of love for him.”
