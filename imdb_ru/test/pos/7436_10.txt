It's really not hard to understand this movie! I watched it without expectations and without knowing the story from the games. I was completely shocked! <br /> <br /> Initially, I was surprised how most characters have some kind of superpower, but this is called "Final FANTASY ..." I also wondered about Clouds past, but it was easy enough to look up. However, these questions in no way spoiled the pleasure of the film. Just the opposite; this shows that I kept thinking about the story long after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most beautiful films my eyes have ever seen. Music fully supports the movie. The characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> I want more!
