Like the Circle around the human condition, 2001 begins from the beginning, skips the middle and continues to the end, right where we started. Noting the weakness of words in comparison with images, Kubrick wisely does without dialogue, preferring the power and essence of the scenery and allowing intellectual possibilities to decipher the audience. Or not, depending on the audience. <br /> <br /> Monolith in the history of cinema, 2001, is the highest sign of direction, performance and achievement. If we take into account the ambitions of the film (film about everything) and the measure of success that the film has achieved for this purpose, we can give very strong arguments that this film is the greatest of all films. >
