Prue and Piper bring Dr. Griffiths to his home to save him from Sous's killer. While Phoebe looks in the Book of Shadows, how to defeat a demon, Prue and Piper fight and pursue Shaks in the streets to destroy him. However, they are filmed and posted live on television news as witches. They become a national sensation with the crowd in front of their home. Phoebe trusts Cole and goes to the underworld with Leo to ask him to call on Tempus and turn around while the fanatical woman shoots Piper, who is dying. The source invites Phoebe to stay with him, and in return he will save her sister. Phoebe accepts the deal, and time returns to the moment when Shakes attacks Prue, Piper and Dr. Griffiths. <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a good, but incoherent episode. When Piper is dead and the Power of Three is destroyed, why should the Source take the time to save her? But this dramatic show is certainly one of the best in the third season and allows viewers to look forward to the next episode. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Voltando no Tempo” (“Back in time”)
