I read a book at the summer book club, and we all liked it there. My friends from this club agreed not to watch the film so that the book would not be destroyed. I did not agree and recently watched it with my younger brother and my parents. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. The film was very faithful to the book, without losing its own spirit. The “new baby” theme was shown enough for us to feel it, but that’s not the essence of the story. <br /> <br /> The game was not the best I've ever seen, but it was still good, and the children especially had a lot of energy. The characters were interesting, and the plot was cute and not too overpriced. It was a children's film that works great for both adults and teenagers. <br /> <br /> I would like Beatrice to have a tougher attitude towards the girl, but she was still a great character. The mullet fingers were a bit like what I imagined, except that his hair was slightly visibly dyed, with blond hair and dark eyebrows. Roy worked very well, like a little guy and a new kid, especially talking to his parents and friends. <br /> <br /> The message and the ending (which I will not discuss, except for what I liked) teamed up to make an excellent film to set the mood for a rainy day. In general, it was a great movie that you can watch again and again when you need to be reminded that the world is not a terrible place after all.
