I love this film. Here everyone will find something for themselves. It's funny, sad, passionate and dramatic. The combination of two completely different cultures creates a completely new world, a part of which the viewer cannot but want to become. I have to admit that I am slightly biased because Colin Firth is my favorite actor, and therefore in my eyes (!) his colleagues in the film Nia Long. The problems afflicting their love affair make it, ironically, more believable, and such simple features as the contrast between the colors of Matthew and Themâ€™s clothes make this film even more charming. I challenge anyone who cannot be moved by this story. I find it fascinating and have watched it at least ten times since I bought the movie a week ago!
