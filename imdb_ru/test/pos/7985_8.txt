What can I say, this movie is awesome. He has his flaws, as in every film, for example, shaky gravestones in a cemetery, a well-visible sliding board during a penguin death scene, Max Shrek loses his heavy coat in a split second between shots during a scene with image consultants, Batman loses black Eye Suddenly, make up between shots so that he can show Bruce Wayne to the catwoman, the dialogue was recorded, but reproduced and pronounced differently than when he spoke first, and finally the catwoman suddenly knows how to use it. To lick a bull whip without any training at all. these flaws are insignificant compared to some that you might see, for example, in “Batman” forever, where you can see how mysterious he is when his remark or Val Kilmer's hair changes between frames. <br /> <br /> what makes this movie so worthy of 8/10 is a great game because the performances are amazing. Michael Keaton repeats his role in the role of Batman, and he still has a lot of work in this film. He looks more comfortable in the role for the second time and is on par with the actions of the villains. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like turning a penguin into a grotesque penguin instead of a non-threatening character from a comic or television show, because now the character has more depth and a much more interesting story, derived from the basic needs of the family and the feelings he accepted and wanted. it gives us an evil character, to which we feel sympathy, because he was rejected because he is who he is, which is not his fault. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman. she is cool and sexy and she is also a villain we can regret for how she became a victim. Christopher Walken is a great minor villain and such an interesting character, although he is not even in the Batman universe. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is much better than the first one, and Danny Elfman is more likely to show off his musical talents this time. The sets are awesome. They are detailed, attract attention, ominous, gothic, unique, dark and many other adjectives can describe how they look amazing. The costumes and make-up are great, and obviously a lot of work went into their creation, and all the work pays off, because the jumpsuit is better, the cat costume looks amazing, and the penguin's makeup and effects are so convincing. Animatronic Penguins look very realistic and play with good effect. The script is really good, and Storyline, in my opinion, is believable. In general, because of all these factors, this film deserves 8/10 and stands as my favorite of all Batman films.
