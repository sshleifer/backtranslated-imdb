This is one of my favorite comedies "Capra-esque". This film is simply meant for enjoyment, not deconstruction, analysis under the microscope. This is not a religious comment. It's fun. This is a fantasy. The surprisingly negative comments (IMHO) reflect the level of expectation that professional film critics made us think that they should be part of every film. <br /> <br /> Others described the role of Travolta (which is why you watch the movie again and again) and an excellent cast (including Sparky!). <br /> <br /> Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; sometimes a movie is just fun. <br /> <br /> Enjoy your viewing!
