Impeccable writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and ingenious twist plot one of the best American films I have seen this year. The stunning cast and cynical leadership of Neil Labuette does not allow this film to become too sentimental, while the authentic performances of Renee Zellweger and Morgan Freeman give him soul. Cruel, provocative and with a sense of humor at the same time with a truly beautiful finale. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear, Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Jenny all perform in a noisy show. The greatest parody of soap operas from the time of the film "Soap", but better and smarter. 9 out of 10
