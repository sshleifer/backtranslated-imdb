A humorous journey into the usually gloomy funeral business. It's easy to watch, and even suggests Blethyn & Molina to steal a scene from the old Fred & Ginger movie. Walken, as Molina’s zealous competitor in this business, extols, trying to bring a new style to the old Welsh city. We see a couple of very funny examples of “new style”. The plot is strengthened when Pugh has an affair with Watts, and she invites them to play Bletin. Meanwhile, Molina kindles his long-suffering romantic feeling for Bletin and convinces her to fake her death so that they can escape to the southern seas and dance their days together. During the "fake" funeral Bletin learns about the betrayals of their husbands and prepares his revenge. Look to see what kind of funeral should probably be - a celebration of life!
