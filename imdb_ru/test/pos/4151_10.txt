This film was played in Lexington, Kentucky for 7 days. I saw it on the last day of his show and regretted that I could not recommend it to others, because this is a film that calls out to the big screen. An aerial shot, when a crowded ship drives away from an equally crowded dock, is a masterpiece, as is the scene in which the two main characters flirt on deck - almost ballet and sexier in their thought-provoking information than in much more explicit films these days. I'm just afraid to think that more people will not be able to see this beautiful film in the theater; The DVD experience will not be the same. Here's an idea: if you live on campus, see if you can lobby for him to appear at a film festival on campus.
