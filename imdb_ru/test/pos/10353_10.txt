Absolutely disgusting and cheap obscene humor. I like it!!! This is the most disgusting and utterly terribly played film, with the exception of Nicolas Reed, who plays the not-dead Court Jester, to a comic brilliance. But be that as it may, I laughed so many times, and I had to convey it to the directors, it was not pretentious or ordinary in any way. Rape, fighting, vomiting zombies on their rape victims. What other movie has it? Not for this, but with pizza, bong and six packs of beer, you get it if you have a cast-iron stomach and a juvenile sense of humor, just like mine.
