I have never seen a show with so many stories, secrets, expectations and great excitement. I watch TV more, but I own every season of this show, and it's amazing. Each episode is extremely well played, written and prepared. Toward the end of the show, I felt that the stories were becoming too contrived to be in prison, but the actors coped with this. Soprano sucks huge compared to OZ. in fact, any show that is in the cable network, HBO or not just, cannot hold a candle in front of OZ. I would like him to return for another season. if this happened, they probably would have killed every character in the series, but hey, we all have to go. As for the characters, I would say that O'Reilly and Alverez were my favorites. both were hardley in the same scene, but their individual stories, I think, were the strongest of all except Beecher, of course, but still ... in any case, the best show in the whole story, the best network in the whole story, one of the best actors in history, PERIOD!
