This film is one of my favorite Christmas classics. Of course, this is fluff, it is not “relevant”, but when movies became just entertaining and fun, became a bad thing? No, this film is definitely “The Good Thing”, as Martha Stewart would say (respectively)! Barbara Stenvik is so attractive in this film, and Dennis Morgan perfectly compliments her. They both have charm and warmth to spare. They are assisted by a team of those incredible characters who seem to have disappeared from the 40s and 50s - among them Sidney Greenstreet, SZ Where are the characters today? No role could be better played. Bette Davis, fortunately, refused this role under her, and she was right to refuse her. She would try to turn everyone around and completely destroy the film. Stanvik was a strong actress, but she was smart enough to play it easily. She was rarely more attractive and perfect. Morgan is the essence of a good guy. Since his role is the least sensational, there is a tendency to ignore his skill. The very fact that he could keep himself surrounded by such great actors is in itself an achievement, but he is also absolutely perfect, like Jefferson Jones. Skip the 1992 defiled (and meaningless) remake and see this bright, sparkling holiday gift!
