I recently saw this movie for the first time. I liked it so much that I went and bought a DVD. This film is pure genius, and with each viewing it becomes only funnier. Anyone can write jokes or funny dialogues and ask the actors to remember them, but the basis of this film is improving !! How do they do it? Thank you, Christopher Guest!
