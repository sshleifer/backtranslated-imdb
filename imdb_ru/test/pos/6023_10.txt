This is the best version of "Gypsy", which was filmed. Bette Midler is just as gorgeous as Rose's mom. She has a voice, gestures, appearance and, most importantly, the highest acting ability to play the role and make it. The character comes to life. Her singing, simply put, is AMAZING! She especially shines in two rooms - "Everything goes up through the roses" and "Turn the roses." With other actors, too, everything is in order, especially with Christina Ebersall in the role of Tessie. Peter Rigert is also good, his image of Herbie is shown with great style and believability. The direction of this film is very, very good. This entire film is much better than the Rose Russell version of 1962. After watching, I can say that the three greatest Rosy Moms are: Ethel Merman, Bette Midler, and Angela Lansbury. Watch this movie. You will be glad you did.
