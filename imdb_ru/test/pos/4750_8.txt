This film is a classic policeman film of the seventies, which for some reason is overlooked. Basically this “French Connection” meets Bullitt. <br /> <br /> Roy Shader plays the head of an elite group of detectives known as the "seven take-offs." <br /> <br /> One of their men was found during an undercover operator killed. <br /> <br /> Scheider and his team must find their killers. They are engaged in a battle with the crowd. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the film should be the car chase, which is obviously included in order to capitalize on the success of Bullit. Nevertheless, this pursuit of the car overshadows the Bullitt due to its length, speed and apparent excitement. This is an exciting ride on a roller coaster, which ends quite unexpectedly and effectively. Do not miss this little gem!
