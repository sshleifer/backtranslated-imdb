Chellen Kates does a wonderful job portraying a conflicted bride, torn between challenges that await her professionally, memories of freedom that she thought she would get in college (inspired by a famous author) and the security of her expecting marriage to a man she really didnâ€™t loves This film is definitely worth seeing - as predictable as it is, acting is inspiring, and real chemistry exists between Challen Cates and Malcolm Jamaal Warner.
