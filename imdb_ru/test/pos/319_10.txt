My favorite movie of all time. This was Coppola’s flawed work, and watching the Heart of Darkness documentary made him even more convincing. Coppola was the king of Hollywood after the creation of The Godfather and The Godfather II, and he developed the ego necessary even to dare to try to make a film like Apocalypse Now. Through obvious arrogance, he went to the Philippines with a partial script and thought that he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do when he got to Colonel Kurtz's house. And just like Willard, he did not know what he was going to do when he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed, and the river is such an ideal metaphor and background for history. What I like most about Apocalypse Now is that it does not offer any answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this openness, this infuriates some viewers who like their films to be much more obvious. <br /> <br /> This film is not categorized. Some call it a war film, which is not at all like it, in fact it is rather a personal research of a person. In my opinion, the best picture about Vietnam is “Platoon”, and if the viewer wants to retell the war in Vietnam, go there first to get answers. <br /> <br /> Coppola should be thanked for his view of the bureaucracy of the war, which he very effectively conveys during his meeting with General Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. Kilgore’s sheer boldness makes him an unforgettable character, and an attack at dawn will always be a Hollywood classic. <br /> <br /> This is an almost psychedelic cruise with a very surrealistic ending that makes the film not accessible to everyone. Very difficult to watch, but also useful. I could offer my explanations for each scene, but it would be completely meaningless. This film is intended for interpretation and reflection, and not for immediate satisfaction. <br /> <br /> A small footnote, definitely, if you are viewing Apocalypse Now for the first time, first look at the original version, the version of “Redux” the movie.
