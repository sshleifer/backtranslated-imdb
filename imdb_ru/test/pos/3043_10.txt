I first saw this film a little over a year ago. I have seen it 4 more times since. I have never heard of this before, and I consider myself to know classic cinema. Real, polished, unprocessed diamond. <br /> <br /> This film’s gem revolves around John Vojta (the main character of Konrak) as a young school teacher assigned to Yamakro Island to teach the children of the islands, all in the same school. First, students say that they know very little about the world outside their island home. The heart of the film is Konrak, who finds inspiration to awaken their young minds to the world around them. Pupils quickly reward their teachers with a desire for learning and a remarkable ability to understand concepts that were recently alien to them. Konrak uses unconventional and smart teaching methods, which, as it turned out, are a bit funny! God forbid. Learn and have fun? Together? It can not be, or so they say responsible. To avoid a spoiler, I just say that Konrak meets resistance with the boss .... and the end is really bitter-sweet. <br /> <br /> I'm a 35-year-old white man with some teaching experience, so I have to identify myself with the main character, Pat Conroy (aka Konrak, Mr. Petra). But I do not identify with black children. When I was a child, I was sent to school in another part of the city from the 4th to the 6th grade, around 1979. These children in the film remind me of my classmates. Fortunately, in the 4th grade, being 8 or 9 years old, racism is not understood. I just remember that we were all children, played in a 4-square, played kickball, played hide-and-seek and worked with the relay. <br /> <br /> This film is very touching. There are delightful and sharp moments from beginning to end, without stopping. I found myself many times with tears in my eyes, and then suddenly laughed out loud. This is a funny movie. <br /> <br /> "Get away from this Windows !!" .... "Sir, if you are ready to accept shit, I have to tell you that the rabbit just did it on your lap" ..... "So, you white school teacher, Mr. Konrak. My graces LOVE, Mr. Konrak. You are a good teacher, you look good white man. "....." The wind is 15 miles per hour from the east. Warning about a small boat. Beware of small boats. Large boats, okay, do not worry, about anything. "...." Not a fried cook, but Eleanor Roosevelt, not a long-timer, but (something Latin) ... this is in Latin .. hey, wait! "...." Konrak sings like a frog .. I sing well What are you talking about? ". <br /> <br /> It’s still mysterious to me that I still haven’t heard anything about this film or that it has very little reputation or followers. I intend to look for more reviews, comments, stories and "making" tidbits, if they are there. What amazes me is the acting skills of untrained children. I understand that one of the children, Mary, was an actress, and you can tell. However, other children have many lines and genuine reactions. I wonder how they did it! I assume that Conrac and Mary had an exact dialogue, while some of the scenes took place in a natural or arbitrary manner. <br /> <br /> Konrak is a special film. In my opinion, this is one of the very few films that are so good and so unknown. Others in this category are King Rat ('65), Dark Passage ('47 with Bogie and Bacall), Gods Must Be Crazy ('80) and Bad Day at Black Rock ('55). I recommend them all. But first, take a place in Mr. Conrac's class.
