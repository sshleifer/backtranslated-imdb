"Black Water" - one of the most intense films that I watched for a long time. The story develops very quickly when three tourists (all great actors) follow the swamp on a small boat with a tour guide. Soon after the anchor was cast in a remote area of ​​the marsh, something huge in the water turned over. <br /> <br /> The three quickly turn it into a tall tree nearby, because they understand that the crocodile has attacked them. For the next two days they will have to desperately try to escape from the evil watchful eye of the crocodile, and he does not seem to want to leave. The film is a bit addictive, but what can you expect from the situation and the limited budget? This is much better than Primeval and other recent crocodile / underwater thrillers. The voltage is heavy, and all three leads produce amazing results. Truly frightening, this film caused me a deep string of claustrophobic fear. Apparently, based on real events.
