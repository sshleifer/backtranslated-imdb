The story of a strange love and desire to fall. A poem about beauty and its perfection, fear and touch. A slice of Visconti, Mahler and Mann. And painful Venice. I do not know if this is a masterpiece, a poem or a reflection of the world of the film director. This is definitely "Memento Mori". and the study of illusion. The old mirror of limits, signs and the delicacy of death. A trip to the old space, nostalgic, cruel and luxurious. “Death” is a travel copy of Orpheus in immediate reality. And the essence is music. Soft, sweet music, like honey or winter fire. Like every regret and every sadness. As a refuge in deep solitude. Gustav happened to be gay. He is the Explorer of the last form of God's presence. Beauty, the beauty that gives meaning to life, which is sin and virtue at the same time, the gift of expectation and suffering. He dies because he has the right to hope, to believe in the reality of a miracle and in his own way. Victim? Never! Only Tadzio can give freedom as a minor sacrifice. Who has seen that the sun can hope to live in the same condition?
