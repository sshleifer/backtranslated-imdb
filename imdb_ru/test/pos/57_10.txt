I gave this film my rare 10 stars. <br /> <br /> When I first started watching it and realized that it would not be a movie with a strong storyline, I almost turned it off. I am very glad I did not do that. <br /> <br /> This is a character-driven movie, a true story that revolves around the life of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, strong, beautiful (inside and out). The black woman and the way she touched the lives of many in the Lackawanna community. <br /> <br /> Not only her strong characteristics of the nanny and the people who lived in her boarding house are very interesting, but also the views on what the life and society of African Americans in the 1950s looked like before the integration, both good and bad side segregation and how it ultimately influenced and changed the black community. <br /> <br /> In addition to the excellent results by all the cast members, there are some beautiful songs and dances from that era.
