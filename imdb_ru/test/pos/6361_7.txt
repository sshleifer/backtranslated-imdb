Dan Ackroyd is in his main stars, like John Burns, a mental refugee refugee who impersonates his visit to go to La La Land and arrange a popular radio talk show, while a permanent host (Charles Groden in his heyday ) takes a vacation. Along the way, Akroyd communicates with Walter Mattau, who is just as crazy, and the rest is just fun. Aroyd and Mattau play very well with each other. Ekroyd's stunning real wife, Donna Dickson, is preparing for the trip as another psychiatrist. The ending looks a bit hasty and contrived, and this is the only thing that keeps me from giving this film my highest rating - the 80s gem.
