Good dock stuff! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the original film didn’t work out the way you wanted, you have fantastic work and excellent viewing. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying how much you have invested in it. <br /> <br /> This is true for everyone else. It is great to see the warts and the entire process report, without being “too good.” <br /> <br /> I liked it! Worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The author of the “original” movie script, Quy Pena, cannot appreciate what you have achieved. <br /> <br /> I also like this attitude. Great piece. We are waiting for the next work. <br /> <br /> Go on, brother! Paully
