The original plot and funny irresistible characters perfectly suited for the movie "Hen Night" (now 2 times) I liked it, it was fun and quickly moved, no boring lingering scenes. This is violence and some language (although most of this is hidden). This is a great movie. David Strickland was a terrific actor. Ron Eldard gave a wonderful presentation. I watch it with girls every time.
