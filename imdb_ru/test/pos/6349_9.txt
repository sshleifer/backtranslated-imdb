Watching this movie, you can get a rich experience. <br /> <br /> This is a seemingly simple story about a gifted student of Yuu Kwok, who later becomes a teacher of classical Chinese poetry. He is married, has two sons, and at home everything seems normal. He still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage, and his sons alternately fill him with pride (elder) and disappointment (younger). <br /> <br /> His passion for poetry makes him the object of a fascination for the senior student in one of his classes. During the lesson, a student Choi Lam draws him, one of them with a flower from his mouth. She teases him more with her mind than with her sexuality, although this is also an element. Of course, he is not immune to her attention, although for some time he is trying to keep the line of demarcation between the teacher and the student. <br /> <br /> The reason he is not successful is complex. First, there is a real depth of communication between him and Choi Lam. It becomes clear that she genuinely likes her, and this is mutual. Secondly, in his marriage there is a long-standing problem that is revealed when an old friend of him and his wife fall ill. The consequences of his wifeâ€™s involvement in this friend, both in the past and in the present, are too sad to be tolerated. <br /> <br /> In this film, nothing is considered trivial. All characters have a bright inner life and easily distinguishable story. The two leaders, Jackie Chung and Anita Mui, are outstanding, as are Karen Lam as the student Choi Lam and Sean Tam as the eldest son He Yin. <br /> <br /> Recommended without reservation.
