As a former (atomic) officer of a submarine, I must admit that this is my favorite film about a submarine (even surpassing “The Hunt for Red October”). Someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the film. Good - not realistic - but this is a comedy - and it has all the "internal jokes" of the submarine forces. Excellent cast with stereotypically-tuned submariner guys at Orlando and our heroes on a diesel boat. Definitely "DBF", by the way, means that diesel boats are forever. But they want ten lines to publish it - Jees, is the admiral in charge here? <br /> <br /> Line 10.
