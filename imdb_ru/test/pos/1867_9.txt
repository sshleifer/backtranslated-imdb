Simply put, Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly were wonderful. The film tells not only about the natural science of Darwin's beliefs, but also about his relationship with his family, first of all his wife Emma and daughter Annie. <br /> <br /> Toby Jones gives a wonderful twist. like Thomas Huxley, the great advocate for Darwinâ€™s beliefs, and the rest of the cast are sharing the time on screen with Bettany and Connelly. <br /> <br /> But these two carry the film. Their real chemistry is obvious from start to finish, but it develops transcendence when Darwin wrestles with his demons. The scene where Darwin connects the ending of the story of the orangutan Jenny with his dying daughter Annie is absolutely fascinating. The world premiere audience at TIFF was mesmerized. Bettany results will be recognized as one of the best this year in a short time. No less magnificent is the work of Connelly, who plays the religious wife of a man who, according to Huxley, "killed God." <br /> <br /> The film slowly passes through the entire spectrum of Darwin's grief, enjoying every detail of Bettany and Connelly acting. <br /> <br /> Brilliant.
