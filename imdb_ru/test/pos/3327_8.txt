Side Show is one of the strangest horror films ever made from a full moon. Very bloody in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer says (The trailer for this film shows all the bloody parts). In addition, the acting and visual effects are well made. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Horror Fans. Such films as this one should see “Master of the Dolls”, “Live in the Skin”, “Massacre at a Night Sleep Party”, “Dream” Away Camp and other full moon.
