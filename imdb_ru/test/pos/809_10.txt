In a better civilization, this and many other films of David Suchet will be released in cinemas. The plots are unbelievable (no, I would not guess who did it, but the clues were all if I were more inventive - the best kind of riddle), amazing production values, acting (from Edward Fox, Sarah Miles, Lysette Anthony, Megan Dodds and, of course, David Suchet in the role of Hercule Poirot) are just perfect, the dialogue is beautiful, the music and the feeling of tension and tension are just wonderful things. <br /> <br /> One of the pleasures These films about Hercules Poirot for men are how many beautiful women play them! There were two here - sexy winding Megan Doods and amazing Lysette Anthony. <br /> <br /> You really can't go wrong by renting them - they are just wonderful - like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind is constantly working, because all this is there , and you fight, but, constantly thinking, you can keep up with everything - and great settings. <br /> <br /> I cannot remember films that stimulate thought more than these films by Hercule Poirot / David Suchet Itâ€™s impossible to overestimate them - and I have never seen one before that a few months ago and have not read Agatha Christie.
