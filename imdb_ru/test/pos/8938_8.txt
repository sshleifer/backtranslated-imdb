I watched it the night before on demand and thought: "This is the type of film in which Alec Guinness and Glynis Jones could play if it were shot in the late 50s." Farce in the English tradition. Alfred Molina and Brenda Bletin are very sweet and sincere in their images. Naomi Watts just dumbfounded Janey Mansfield (if she could do that). The rest of the actors have excellent turns and beats. The Welsh landscape is amazing. The absurd premise is actually not at all believable, but this does not interfere with enjoying. Notice, not a BIG movie, but a really fun time. And Walken is at his wacky best. Joy to contemplate!
