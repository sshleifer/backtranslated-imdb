This is a classic western. Good, Glenn Ford, dashing hero, former soldier, a man who will no longer hold a gun. In the end, he has to confront the evil baron Edward J. Robinson, who owns most of the valley and wants it all. Then there is Barbara Stanwick, the real ruler of the roost. The wife of Edward G. Robinson, who will not allow anyone to stand in her way, even making Edward G. Robinson look weak. She is so evil that everyone else turns pale next to her blind ambitions and ruthlessness to rule the valley and everyone in it. The glitter in her eyes, when she sees people facing death, is unnerving. It is worth the wait. Add a young Brian Keith and a few others, and you have a drama that stands on its own. With the necessary hustle, shootings, ambushes and close-ups of hard-riding cowboys, and you have a bloody western. -before.
