Okay, this is too long and too pleased with himself. Yet the “Great Dictator” is a fascinating film. Chaplin does an amazing job, ridiculing Hitler and trying to portray the oppression of Jews in Nazi Germany (this was before concentration camps became well-known). Not Chaplin's masterpiece, but still worth seeing. <br /> <br />
