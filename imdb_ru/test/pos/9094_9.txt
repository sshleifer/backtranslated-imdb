It is worth the price of admission only for Rock-off! Any D fan will LOVE this film (even if it's a bit short), and the comedies of John Reilly, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Mitlofafa and Dave Grohl (almost recognizable) prove that D is swinging hard enough for anyone. Even Dio ... Sasquatch / mushroom scene will become an instant classic (I don’t want to talk anymore and be blamed for placing spoilers here). Fans of the original HBO series will see a pair of nods at the beginning of the appearance of D on characters such as Lee and the presenter with an open microphone. I just wish they had played a few songs from the first album, and the omission of the “government completely sucks” from the POD album is also a shame. In addition, this movie is swinging. Obey D!
