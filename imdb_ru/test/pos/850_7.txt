I remember this film with love when I saw it in the theater. I recently found a copy on VHS, and it is preserved in my memory of this. Although this is clearly not a film with a big budget, the acting is completely trustworthy, and the scenery, locales and costumes are very well made. I only wish mammoths were in most of the picture, but when you see them, they are also well made (remember, SFX was done on those days without using computers, some poor devil had to actually put all this hair and a fake tusks of real elephants!) ... the same effect was used for the elephants in "Quest for Fire". The best adventure film and chance for the star, Rod Cameron has played something besides a cowboy that he has also done very well over the years.
