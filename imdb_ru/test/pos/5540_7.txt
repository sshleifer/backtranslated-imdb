Michelle Pfeiffer ideally played the role of a frustrated mafia widow in this colorful black comedy. Matthew Modin plays a clumsy FBI agent who she really liked. Dean Stockwell entered the series as the main character, who continues to pester Pfeiffer; Mercedes RÃ¼hle is dynamic as his jealous wife. It's all very eighties, but it only adds to the fun. Nice little click, although not for every taste.
