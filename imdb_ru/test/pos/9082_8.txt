Despite the fact that Flatliners is 15 years old, today I saw it for the first time. I heard about the movie Flatliners, but there was never any noise in it to make me go out and rent it or make a point to see it. Well, I caught it on one of the premium channels and have to say that it was very good. <br /> <br /> This film was about brilliant young medical students who decided to investigate death. They found a way to make a person die for a short time and bring him back to life. Besides the cast, this film had a serious bite. Just thinking about researching death is enough, but I really thought the writer and director did an excellent job of providing a different, but amazing view. It was not a general attempt to agitate, scare and make your mind rush ... it was a real bargain. <br /> <br /> Instead of turning it into an empty, shallow, star-studded thriller, this film contained an essence, a piece of nail, a white knuckle, the point of a sharp thriller. I give it 8/10.
