Greetings to all the wonderful fans of this film, who not only saw and appreciate it, but (based on many literate comments) actually get it! For example, I always thought of Paul Mazursky's The Tempest as a reflection on the Shakespeare play of the same name, as noted in several other reviews here. On the other hand, if you are looking for a simpler adaptation of the game, you should look elsewhere. As an experiment, however, this is simply amazing. Charming, touching, funny, sad, dramatic ... that's all and much more. Actors, locations, script, music are fantastic. Cassavetis and Rowland have never been better. Susan Sarandon's lineup more than hinted at the great work she had to do in the future. Molly Ringwald makes her movie debut unforgettable, and you just need to admire Raul Julia's play ... he plays in several scenes. Moreover, the great Cassavetes was always confident and sure enough that the performer allowed him! The study of what thematic elements of the classic of Shakespeare can be life, if you go into more "modern times", Mazurysky's "Storm" burns brilliantly!
