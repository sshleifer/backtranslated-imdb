“Driving lessons” show how two typical British middle-class families meet each other when the character of Grinth comes in contact with Eve (Walters), a slightly insane actress without communication with the ego. Grint betrays her irresistible and super-Christian mother (Linney) and travels with Eve to Scotland to accompany her on a trip to participate in the reading of "Poetry", which, according to her, may be her last due to illness. <br /> <br /> The masterpiece of this film is the image of Grint in a cell in a cage, which is dominated by an imperious and even hypocritical mother. His image of an oppressed teenager in search of his true morality and happiness is captivating by the fact that he is everywhere. The film is shot sharply and at a good pace, with very few moments that leave you tired. This achievement, especially given the nature of the plot. Walters really captures her character with both hands and successfully attracts the audience to her side of things, emphasizing Linney's ironic immorality everywhere. Her role in Driving Lessons is pleasant and memorable in every sense. <br /> <br /> The plot evolves well, leaving the audience in awe of Grint when he returns to Eve’s place during the lunch break during his stay at the local bookstore to apologize for his wrongdoings. The values ​​in part continue and are revealed completely before the final drag, in a very consistent way. The imperious (and liberating) main idea is that religion does not lead to happiness and, of course, does not lead to morality. <br /> <br /> Spectators have to sympathize with the radical, but sweet Eve, she and Grint concluded an irresistible partnership on the big screen, brought straight from their debut in the series Harry Potter. A charismatic and beautiful game along with a tough and actual scenario make it a must-see for this Christmas.
