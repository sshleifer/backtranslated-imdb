This is the third Short Three Stooges the team has ever made, and, like many of their early ones, it is absolutely hysterical! He now belongs on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Vol. 1, when I want, I watch it! <br /> <br /> In this short film, Moe, Larry and Curly play three doctors in the hospital who are trying to help everyone out, but, man, in the end they all messed up! <br /> <br /> This short film is one of my all-time favorite Three Stooges shorts of all time, I'm also a very big fan of comedic comets, and Three Stooges are the kings of farce players! <br /> <br /> When I heard that he was nominated for an Oscar for best short film, I was very curious when I heard that he lost, I was very disappointed with this! <br /> <br /> This short is one of the funniest “Three Marionette” stories in the history, I highly recommend you to see this hysterical rebellion! <br /> <br /> 10/10
