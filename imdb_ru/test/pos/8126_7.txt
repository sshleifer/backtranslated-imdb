This film was a pleasant surprise, because I did not expect much. I did not know that some of the actors had become big stars in the lead roles. Although the transition to the Matrix is ​​not a plus in my book (I hated it), I am sure that this is a career plus for Hugo. James Purefoy is great in this, and Jennifer Ele is sweet and wonderful. 30 years later, it looked like the noisy Carnaby Street, but I liked the Janis Joplin clothing store, mixed with modern thinking of sexual and gender blur. A real estate agent who has an erotic relationship with his listings is a lot of fun. Iron John's men's collections are a bit outdated, but I still loved them. This is a social satirical comedy that best reminds me of old movies about "Carry On". The British know how to make sex comedies, and this is an old tradition, unlike the United States, which is too stupid to truly understand that sex is ridiculous.
