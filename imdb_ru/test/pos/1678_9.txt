RIFIFI (Jules Dassin - France, 1955) <br /> <br /> It seems to me a very risky attempt to remake the Hollywood remake of the 1955 classic RIFIFI Jules Dassin. Al Pacino, scheduled for release in 2007, is likely to play a leading role, assuming the role of Tony Le Stefano. Risky business ... How do they cope? <br /> <br /> Ironically, Dassin was blacklisted in Hollywood and tried his luck in France and made this little masterpiece aptly named by some "The Grandfather of all caper and robbery films." In my opinion, it remains a one-of-a-kind classics, beautifully shot with one of the most memorable endings ever put on the film. Whatever the opinion of the film. <br /> <br /> Over the past couple of years, RIFIFI has become excessively overpriced. However, this French classic noir should not be forgotten. Watch it before the remake is released to get ammunition for comparison. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
