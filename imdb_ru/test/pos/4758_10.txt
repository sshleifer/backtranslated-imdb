Growing up in New Jersey and having spent many days and nights on the sandy streets of New York in the 1970s, watching the movie “The Seven” or its sister spirit “French Connection” always evokes memories of time and place, which for some, may have been the darkest hour of New York, but which for me, in my early twenty years, has always been one fun adventure after another. I really miss those days. As one reviewer noted: “This film very well reflects the harsh, cold and extraordinary feeling of the winter season in New York, at the same time, clearly revealing the lower part of the notorious underworld and police activities in the region. time and culture ". An exact description of both the film and the city. The star attributes of this film - the plot, the actors, the characters and, of course, the car chase - are described in detail in many reviews here, so I will not go into details except How to say that one of My favorite moments occurs during a car chase when the camera focuses on driving with Richard Lynch's shotgun and manic Bill Hickman. The expression of horror on Richard Lynch's face, along with defensive gestures, is not so typical of an actor, a cat Orogo is much more called the source of terror, not its object, which is actually funny to watch. I get a laugh from it every time.
