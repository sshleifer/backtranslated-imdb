Peter Falk shines like a 90-year-old Morris Applebaum, the patriarch, who decided it was time to “check out” after the last explosive attack. His three children, Lauran San Giacomo, David Paymer and Judge Reinhold, receive a notice / invitation by mail and immediately arrive at his doorstep to deal with his eccentric father. Laura San Giacomo has a wonderful chemistry of a father and daughter, whose character seems to be experiencing the greatest growth after severe tests. This is a well-rounded example of your average, dysfunctional family and its memories, pains, growth and ignorance / tolerance in each other’s lives. Musical accompaniment is what you enjoy, and liners are well-designed and fun. Although I think the Departure Party was disappointing, the rest of the film will surely make you laugh, cry and leave the theater with a smile on your face. Move over to the “Big fat Greek wedding” ... It is “Big fat Jewish suicide”.
