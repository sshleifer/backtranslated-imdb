I just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and still in love with it. It still makes me cry, sing, worry and celebrate. <br /> <br /> I almost wrote a letter to Bonnie Hunt to tell her how much I love it. David Duchovny's grief scene is so frivolous! Minnie Driver is so natural and honest. My favorite phrase is when Duchovny says: "I miss Elizabeth, but I miss Grace." Oh man! I'm crying just thinking about it. ALSO ... Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi ooooooooooooooooochen perfect match chicago !! I know them, I swear! I am connected with them, I am sure. <br /> <br /> This film is in my rotation three times a year !!! I would watch it once a week, but I'm afraid I'll get used to it !!! I always want to make it special during the day when I watch it !!
