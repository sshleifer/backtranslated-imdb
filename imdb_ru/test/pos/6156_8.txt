Amazingly beautiful movie. Perfectly thoughtful, beautifully directed, beautifully played, beautifully played and most beautifully photographed ..... cinematography is nothing short of magnificence. This film is about the war, but it is epic in its scope and combines romance, tragedy and comedy with a story as scary as provocative.
