By 1952, Hollywood decided to remake the first talking classic Al Jolson. <br /> <br /> This time Danny Thomas played Kantorâ€™s son. It is expected that, returning home from the army, he will follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives, becoming a cantor. However, the young Mr. Golding has a great interest in show business. <br /> <br /> At this time, he meets the beginning singer Peggy Lee. She works very well, and her performance of her favorite song, Lover, is wonderful. The filmmakers were smart not to connect the obvious Jewish guy and non-Jewish relationship with a girlfriend. In any case, it is shaded. In his anger for the fact that he had betrayed his promise to become a cantor, his father makes the traditional Jewish sign an indication of loss in the family. This will not be done under the circumstances of the violation of the promise; this will be done if there is an interfaith marriage among the Orthodox. <br /> <br /> Thomas is really good at playing the son of cantor. His singing is up to standard as the film ends on a positive note. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that technical advisers did not understand that women do not carry wallets in the synagogue on Saturday or during this period at all.
