I saw this film while flying from Philadelphia to Denver. The screen was in front of me in three rows and about 12 "x 10". So I really wasn't going to watch it. But I like Malcolm in the middle, so I decided to see just a few minutes. The next thing I know is that I am absorbed, have a great time and was pleased with how good it was and how quickly it seemed that time was passing. I agree that acting is very good for this level of entertainment. Being one of the older baby boomers, I was also pleased to see Lee Major with the role in the film, as well as with a couple of other actors who were known (Jamil?) "Yesterday", but today are not the focus of attention, teasing themselves . <br /> <br /> This is your main “child offended, the child becomes equal (and then some), and everyone gets pleasure from the process.” No hard thinking, no big analysis needed. Just a good way to spend time. <br /> <br /> 3.5 out of 5.
