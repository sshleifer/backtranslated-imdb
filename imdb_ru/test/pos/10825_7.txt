An interesting couple of stories, this small film will be able to bring together, it would seem, different characters and plot lines against the background of the Second World War and succeed in combining them without losing the audience. I was impressed with the depth that the different characters portrayed, as well as how I really felt that I understood them and their motives, although the time spent on the development of each character was very limited. Outstanding acting skills of people involved in this picture, it is easy to notice. A fun, stylized film with many comic moments and many other amazing events. <br /> <br /> 7/10
