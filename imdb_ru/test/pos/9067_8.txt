Peter Lorre was born to play Stephen Danela with the lines: "Mr. Smith, you must not hold my wife like that." and "I told you not to keep a monkey in the house!" The poster for this film is creepy green and Peter Lorre, which makes you never want to go to his correctional colony / island. This film is not available on DVD, although it is classic and is rarely shown on TV. What exactly is the relationship between Stephen Danel and the monkey? Why did the monkey upset him so much? We will never know. The film must be painted by someone, and the passages must be turned into video Kinks. The film was reissued in the 1950s, and only a few biographies of Peter Lorre devote any text to this film. Casablanca was just around the corner. Bogart could be on this island, but they definitely did not have a budget for him.
