This film took me by surprise. For years I avoided many of the sound pictures of Harold Lloyd (as well as the images of Keaton), because they generally have a well-deserved reputation for being lousy compared to silent films, because the basic formula was lost. However, when I saw this film, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really liked it ... as soon as I realized that it really was not the film "Harold Lloyd" (despite the fact that he starred in it) . This is because, although this is not similar to the style of his earlier films, it is very original, and Lloyd plays quite a different type of character well. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the formula for old films is almost completely absent here. Lloyd does not perform the old familiar stunt work, the novel is completely different from his earlier film versions, and the plot is just strange! Instead of the usual roles, he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to America for the first time since childhood. Because of this, although he looks like an American (except for his white suit and researcher's helmet), he thinks and behaves much like someone from the Chinese. In many respects, he is very naive about America and resembles the innocent among wolves. Soon he meets a man who turns out to be a local party boss. This boss ALWAYS produces a losing candidate in the mayoral election, because the corrupt mayor bought him and paid to give him a token for a candidate who HAS NO CHANCE to win. Well, the old crank, whom they traditionally ran for the office, just died, and he decides to control the naive Lloyd - he has no prayer for victory! Well, the incredible happens, and Lloyd wins !!! This, and Lloydâ€™s decision to clear the city, greatly upsets the old political machine, and they stop at nothing to destroy honest Lloyd. As soon as it seems that Lloyd is sent to prison on trumped-up charges of corruption, he creates a scheme that is 100% impossible and very illegal to get signed confessions from scammers. However, despite this, this is an incredibly funny and excellent ending. So my advice at the end, just stop disbelief and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Important note: this film is definitely NOT politically correct. The word "Chink" is used repeatedly. I thought it was offensive, but, given the time, I also ignored it, just like you. However, if you're the one who CAN'T and likes to get angry, I advise you never to watch movies - because you will be offended again and again.
