The film is incredible, it has a soundtrack that sets the tone for the film. The lines in the movie are great, such as “No Good for Friends” and “Charlie's Gathering Time”. I can watch this movie again and again and still laugh, because the lines and the action are one of a kind. I feel that when I watch this movie, I want to go out and shoot the bad guys, if there is a movie that you don’t want to miss, this one. “They killed Giggler, they killed Giggler” “They had no right to do so, he will not take care of it badly in our territory” The lines just continue to appear in the film. Deff. Go out and don't rent, but buy this film, it costs money, trust me.
