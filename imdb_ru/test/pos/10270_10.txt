This is a great comedy telling what it was like living next door to a racist fanatic. But it also shows that both the main characters are in fact as bad as the others. Based on the popular comedy ITV, it is very politically incorrect. And so much the better for him, because comedy is to entertain. The only real lack of films is not so much plot. However, the actors are as good as usual. Jack Smeturst and Rudolph Walker form one goddamn team, playing each other in the spirit of one-man craftsmanship. Many years have passed since I watched this film, and last week he was finally able to buy it on DVD. The fact that the film still contains loud moments of laughter means that I can recommend this film, as I did in the 1970s.
