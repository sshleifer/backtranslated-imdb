It is true that this film defies conventionality without telling the plot to the viewer. Although some may have a problem with having to figure it out for themselves, I take Uzumaki for its disrespect. There is a PLOT, it just may not be immediately accessible to a lazy viewer. This film, which, like all great art, offers many interpretations, but this film is also very interesting, which makes it a rare film. It is both provocative and fun.
