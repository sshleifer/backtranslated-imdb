Some time ago I watched the video of Paul Thomas Anderson, in which he expressed great interest in what he has in porn movies and how this industry could produce the best films as a result of the full genre and not just sex in a videotape. Paul Thomas Anderson set his own beliefs in the porn industry to the character played in a stunning way of Bert Reynolds. His name is Jack Horner, the director, whose biggest dream is to make a “real” film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and, at the same time, the breathtaking beauty ?? and with "big cocks and tits." As soon as he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), he believes he has found a new star for his films. And that's how the story about the young Eddie in the porn industry begins. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a sequence inside the nightclub, where we can see the whole face, which will be part of Eddie’s life and later we can see them outside the porn industry, living their daily lives. But soon we can see them in the porn industry and after just one batch, the story of the new Eddie begins the story of Dirk Diggler. They all feel the taste of real success with Dirk as the main star, winning many prizes and helping Jack realize his biggest dream with the help of a series of films about Brock Landers, the new character of Dirk. Such films about exploitation are an amazing success, and for Jack his first "real" films. But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the "terrible 80s", when there will be $ ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and pals. But we all know that excesses can kill any person, and erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film is dedicated to their lives after complete success, and like all this, it's really a bad time with many problems because of the bad opinion of society on the porn industry and in the period with many excesses. In the demise of Dirk, after attempts and failures in the music industry, there is a brilliant sequence that can ideally resume how things are going for Dirk and his friends. This sequence is one of his first drug deal, with the advent of Alfred Molina, which ends in complete disarray. This is ridiculous for us and terrible for Dirk and his friends, but there is always a solution, if you return to what you know, and when Dirk returns, Brock will return. <br /> <br /> Well, I didn’t mention the most characters in my resume form, but I must say that they are all surprisingly well developed. The cast is great with the best performance I've ever seen with Mark Wahlberg. Julianne Moore has a powerful insight into a truly touching character; Raleigh, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc. Just unforgettable, all their characters with funny and sad moments. <br /> <br /> Finally, I really like Anderson's amazing cinematic style with a unique look in the porn industry of the late 70s and early 80s. I used to say that Magnolia was my favorite Anderson, but now, after watching everything except Syd, I can't say that I have a favorite, because I love them all! <br /> <br /> PS I read somewhere that this film is Anderson's Scorsese, so I'm more than sure that if you like Goodfellas and Casino, you will also like this movie. I fucking love "Boogie Nights"!
