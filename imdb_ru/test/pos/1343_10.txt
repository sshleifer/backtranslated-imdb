One of the best memories of my childhood. Must be on DVD. It captures everything that we grew up with in the seventies - peace, gentleness, the power of colors and excellent acoustic music. The two hosts, Carol and Paula, were real hippies from the world, with long hair, peasant blouses and down-padded coats (they looked like Katherine Ross (ala "Graduate") and Ali McGraw (ala "Love Story") respectively. > <br /> They delighted us with the chucklepatch chamomile jokes, gave us lessons on how to be nice talking to the naughty garden squirrel, and entertained us with music from their guitar. They were the best, and Carol was also the original Sandy in the original production of "Grease" (cool). <br /> <br /> This show should be in the time capsule of that era, which will also include: Yellow submarine, Arrow to the Sun and Marlo Thomas, Free to be ... You and I, and also “Sunshine” and “Point”. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, this theme song: “See you, see you, I hope you had a good time, oh, ha, I’m glad we have to say good morning to you, I hope see you again, see yes, see you, glad that you could stay for a while, ah, I hope we see you again, see you, see you.
