Seriously. If this was the first film "Shaq", it would be tolerable, funny, stupid and stupid. A light satirical commentary on the class system would make this pleasant nightly rental. <br /> <br /> However, everyone wants to compare it with the first film, and perhaps this is not fair. The first film is a cult classic; What can follow? Nothing. So take this second movie alone, and it certainly has its moments. <br /> <br /> Jackie Mason is funny, trying to imitate Rodney. Is he as good as Rodney? Not. Are his lines so good? No, but he is funny. The rest of the cast goes into the lineup as decent, but not outstanding. You will recognize faces among the actors and wonder how they got to where they are today. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable, but isn't it the majority in this genre? Again, this is not the best comedy that you will see, but if you enjoy the fun of the Cannonball Run type, you will love this comedy.
