I saw this film at night when I couldn’t fall asleep, I really liked it, and I was looking to find out when it will be again, perhaps the best film I have ever seen at that time, and even now the film is full people. I've never seen it before, but it looks like a real story from New York. This is a movie that enhances the pleasure of watching, because you see it, hear it and feel it, from the moment I saw Wiley drinking beer and watching the game, I imagined what it was like growing up without a father, in this the movie has so many lines that I use daily, for example, “personal time alone” in the bathroom, drinking a 7-11 drink, BIG FILM
