Ladies and gentlemen, the show begins with this documentary. It consists of three chapters, each in chronological order. The first is classical physics and references to Einstein. The second is deeply studying quantum physics and enters string theory. The latter reveals the theory of Everything ... The complex concepts used here are introduced very simply, with daily objects; although you must believe them without checking yourself - if you are not a scientist - (and even if you are a scientist !!). The film is not a masterpiece in its incredible technique or method of production; what really imports is history, and what a story !!!
