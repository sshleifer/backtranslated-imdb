I could not help but enjoy the whole “Cat in the Brain” package, because it meekly explains how the director was constantly going crazy, seeing people killed from past films that he had shot. Even ordinary actions, such as cooking in the microwave or water tap, lead to a terrible movie slaughter in the past. Director Fulci plays himself, directs the ghosts of Sodom (?) And, it seems, can not deprive him of mental well-being from constant murder. He turns to a psychiatrist for help, who instead uses Fulci’s work as a method of executing a number of innocent people, hypnotizing the director, thinking that perhaps he is to blame. <br /> <br /> This is obviously a film that is playfully teasing in the image of Fulci, exploring topics about how such a profession that produces so much death and destruction, rarely remaining unharmed, can shape and shape the legacy. The film tells a promising story of continuous graphic violence with all possible ways to kill a woman, expressed in gloomy detail. This murder in the shower Hitchcock could never direct, or probably wants. The savage of the film complements the mental state of Fulci Fulci (I know) while running. Reality and fiction have joined, and Fulci cannot find a way out. The end (.. explaining the old cliché: "This is just a film") could not work better than here. Fulci's boat says "Perversion" (... great touch), and he sails ... I can only wish it was his last film, because this is the perfect ending, if ever. David L. Thompson is a mentally deranged psychiatrist who plans to kill his unfaithful wife. Jeffrey Kennedy is a cop. Fears that Fulci killed a family by a monster. <br /> <br /> Ultra-violence in the film contains many unique ways to remove the head, for example, the door to the chest, braid. , chainsaw and hatchet. The most violent violence results from the vile activity of a chainsaw when a dead body is smashed into pieces (... as the work of a gardener chainsaw fits perfectly into one nightmarish sequence of hallucinations) ... the most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy is decapitated! The opening scene with the tearing off of a puppet cat feasting on Fulci’s brain is a roar. The scenes that are connected in the film with the image of the frightened Fulci are obvious, but I still could not help but enjoy it.
