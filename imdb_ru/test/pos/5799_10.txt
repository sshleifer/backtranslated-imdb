Today and in the USA it is difficult to understand this film. We have nothing to compare. Here is an attempt to compare: as if in the last years of Saddam’s rule, the filmmaker in Iraq somehow managed to make a film that first showed life as it really was in this country. The life of an ordinary young girl, with all the horrors and repressions. Then the film was freely exposed in Iraq. If you could imagine this unlikely event, then you might have an idea of ​​what happened with this film in the last few years of the Soviet Union. Before this film, Soviet cinema was subject to strict censorship. Soviet films show only the ideal life in a working paradise. Then suddenly it is. Alcoholism, random sex, the ugly wasteland, which was a Soviet city, suffocating pollution, the proletariat sacrificing each other and themselves, complete hopelessness - all that is. People were stunned. Soviet women often cried during shows. Many will say that this is their life story. It was a cultural earthquake, which filmmakers only dreamed of. This undoubtedly accelerated the collapse of the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Reading the reviews here, I see that few people understand this film. One says it was groundbreaking because there was real sex in it. For Soviet viewers of the time, sex was an insignificant event compared to the fact that he first presented reality in Soviet cinema. <br /> <br /> Others compare it to current films, such as "As well, as it turns out." Perhaps they compare Homer's Iliad with the latest novel by John Grissam. They simply do not compare. This is not just a film, it was a social document, but a transforming social force. It is necessary to look this way, otherwise you will not understand the film. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers view this as a film about a dysfunctional Russian family. Someone even says that Vera is hard to regret, because she continues to return to her family. The fact is that Faith and her family are symbols of the entire Soviet life. There was nowhere else to go, because the family in the neighborhood and in the neighboring town were the same. It was life in the Soviet Union for most people. <br /> <br /> This is a film that can be watched on many levels: as a drama that traces the landscape of despair, as a social document showing the living conditions of the time, as a political document - people's attitude and many of the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union, and as a moral document, it shows the evil of a dictatorship that is out of control, and the cruelty that victims will practice against each other. <br /> <br /> Little Faith clearly shows the human sacrifices that socialism ultimately takes on, despite any good intentions the system may have. This helped end the Soviet regime, which contributed to one of the major changes in modern history. This film achieves what only a few films have achieved. This is not only an amazing presentation of history, but also a strength in this historical history.
