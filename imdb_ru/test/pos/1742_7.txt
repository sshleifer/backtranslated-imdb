I was really starting to enjoy this show. It began slowly, and he was not given the chance he deserved. Summer, so many people do not watch TV at home. I know that there are several talent contests and singers, but I enjoy them, like many others. Believe it or not, when the American idol is ready in a year, I miss him. Although it was not an American idol, I thought he had potential. I feel bad for singers on the show who are really starting to grow on me. I would like them to review and return the show. I think it was a hasty move to cancel. My only complaint about the show was that I didnâ€™t care what the judges wanted.
