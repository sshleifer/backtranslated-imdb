I'm a big fan of Lonely Pigeon and all the books in the series, and I love this movie. I was glad to see that they ended up with the Comanche Luna. For a long time I was a fan of Steve Zana and really wanted to see him in a serious role. I personally think that Steve Zahn did an amazing job of recreating Gus. I can't think of another actor who would be better. He has a voice, manners, the pronunciation of the word - right up to T. Of course, no one could keep Robert Duvall in the role of Gus, but I think that Steve Zahn did a damn good job. Karl Urban acts in the same way in all the films he has been in, so he approached Woodrow Cal well. As for the film itself, yes, it is a bit trite, but can you really beat the Lonely Pigeon? No, I do not think so.
