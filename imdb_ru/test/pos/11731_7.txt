“Sharkey’s car” finds Burt Reynolds a drug addict policeman who, after a failed purchase and ruin, which was not his fault, but because of which several people died, is degraded in the rank of vice-officer squadron in Atlanta. <br /> <br /> Prestige is hardly as good as drugs, but it has its own added value. One night after a round-up of working girls, where one of their books falls into their hands, the guys are asked to look after the house of Rachel Ward. She is an expensive thing, serving both the notorious gangster Vittorio Gassman and the candidate for governor of law and order, Earl Holliman. <br /> <br /> Their observation, however, captures the murder, and the rest of the film - Sharkey and his new colleagues from the clutches trying to understand this prestigious affair. <br /> <br /> Although this is a film by Bert Reynolds, and they usually have some kind of humor, the comedy is kept under control, as the film becomes as deadly serious as Dirty Harry. In fact, it was reported that Clint Eastwood was offered this film. <br /> <br /> Look for the good speeches of fellow vice-policemen Bernie Casey and Brian Keith, as well as Henry Silva, Gassman's sworn brother, who does the dirty work of the organization and loves his work. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad film, a mixture of Dirty Harry and Laura. Why is Laura? You should see Sharkey's Car for this answer.
