In my opinion, the army of dads is the best British sitcom of all time. I believe that if you just watch one episode of the series, in which you cannot judge fully about this episode (including the film), you should at least watch the series of this series, get to know the characters, get to know others and situations in which they are. When you get to know the show, it will start attracting you. Now the film has a few changes in the series, which is a bit disappointing, but still works. Watch a series or two shows first, before watching this. You will not be disappointed. A good episode for watching "There is no spring for Fraser"
