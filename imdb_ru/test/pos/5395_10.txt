This movie was great! I like how dark humor and drama mix in it. There are times when you think that there is no way you can laugh at the presented situation, and yet you experience an amazing giggle. It is beautifully played, with great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels and Emile Hirsch. It is well written with a stylish, awesome finish. I'm not one of those who say that everyone will like it as much as I do, but give him a chance and rent it. The DVD features great features, including full-length comments by director Dan Harris and Emile Hirsch and one by Sigourney Weaver, which gives you interesting information about the film. I hope that my comment will be useful, and that you will like the movie!
