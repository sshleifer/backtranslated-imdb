Like a film, ITALIAN WORK is, at best, good; good (not great) acting, <br /> <br /> good visual effects and tempo, mediocre plot, but nothing bad to go out. But, as a promotional video for the new generation MINI <br /> <br /> Coopers, this film is impressive! <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Well, this is a typical film robbery with a strange twist (underwater safe hacking was good, if not incredible), and the cast was pretty hard <br /> <br /> (with the exception of the rotten Wahlberg), but when it all happened <br /> right up to the present, the real "stars" of this painting were three MINI <br /> <br /> Coopers, in all their high flights, speed races, ski jumping, /> <br /> Machine-gun, gold, new brilliant glory. The audience I <br /> <br /> sat among was actually “oooh” and “ahe” when Teron’s little red number <br /> <br /> first hit the screen (oddly enough, neither she nor < br /> <br /> Wahlberg got the same reaction). <br /> <br /> The film starts promisingly. Mos Def, Seth Green, Donald <br /> <br /> Sutherland, Edward Norton and Jason Statham begin as an <br /> <br /> interesting and funny group of characters with a single real <br /> not inspiring performance like a good brand usually <br /> <br /> wahlberg. Why he claims that this is his best film, I can not imagine; his character <br /> <br /> is completely on one note, and he plays it so affectionately that <br /> <br /> it seems that Mr. Rogers came back from the dead and inhabited <br /> his body. Charlize is fine, like Sutherland's daughter, although there is nothing magical about this. Seth Green's character is perfect, and <br /> <br /> walking Napster jokes (including the Napster founder’s cameo, <br /> <br /> Shawn Fanning) are fun; he and some of the early lines of Mos Def <br /> <br /> add the much needed spark of humor. Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland do not have enough time to <br /> <br /> screen time. <br /> <br /> You can see most of the story with a mile away, and the dialogue <br /> <br /> is replete with bad linewriters and handouts, but I doubt that <br /> <br /> the cinematographers have tried re-invent the wheel, so taken as a typical action / disturbing click, everything is fine. Worth a look at a <br /> <br /> cheap night, I would recommend. <br /> <br /> 7/10. Not worth its weight in gold, but makes for a good filling.
