So I turned on the TV today at 13:00 on Sunday, expecting to see shit and commercials, and this wonderful film was just beginning, I didn’t know what it was, but I was attracted almost immediately. The film was excellent. <br /> <br /> There were several things that didn’t make sense for one, I don’t understand why the dead guy talked about doing something to get himself out of a bad situation, but then Jimmy is really nothing does not do, in addition to basic things, to survive, what someone does in his situation, in other words, not his initiative led him out of his bad position, it was just luck, and secondly, I did not find out at the end that the girl was killing gangsters because it was all kind of stolen by thieves who steal money from Panda and then another Second kills the thief Panda at the end, so they double steal his money and kill him as well?
