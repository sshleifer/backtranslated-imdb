I agree that this is ONE of the best episodes of the entire series - my only drawback would be the somewhat abrupt appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan commander. I reason like this: if you weren't there for the first run of this episode, then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek, the father of Spock. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker - your preference), he first removes you from the scene. Nevertheless, he is an excellent commander, as well as an opponent for our captain, and this episode is well written and works well for all. Both sides made excellent remarks about the price of war and the price of peace and, of course, remind one of the best films about the Second World War and later. This is not my favorite genre, but I would recommend a fan of this to watch this episode through this filter. You will see it holding. I will never understand why Sci-Fi is so little respected - the best drama comes when ordinary people end up in unusual circumstances.
