Acting as a kind of middle ground between Waiting for Guffman and Mighty Wind, Best in Show depicts a dog show and various people who bring their canine friends to participate. Some weird, some crazy and others, but they all make the film a good one. Directed by Christopher Gest is particularly funny, as is gay Harlan Pepper, who is trying very hard to promote his dog. Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara and Bob Balaban also do an excellent job (I can't imagine that they donâ€™t cope with this job, at least in the Christopher Guest film). As a person who has never attended a dog show, this film is my main acquaintance with them. They look neat.
