One of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is how Tory or British-American loyalists are portrayed, and some gloss is attached to their fervent support from King George III. In many ways, the American revolution was definitely a family affair, as some of the richer colonial families were divided by it. If this film is subjected to harsh criticism, then perhaps the people in this story look a little better than in real life. <br /> <br /> In some respects, the actions of Major Boulton’s character, played by Cornel Wilde, make him the least attractive cast member and lack of storyline. It seems that it can vary from a thorny patriot to some "business for business". This film largely concentrates on the concepts of personal honor and personal prestige that were the main social “norm” in those days and at that time. <br /> <br /> In its subtext, it says that about twenty-five percent of the colonial population was clearly pro-British, also shaded. But the strength of the Tory element is clearly not malicious, although a good doctoral character is about 85% of the upper class (to steal a beautiful phrase from Monty Python's Flying Circus). Anne Francis does a lot with the rather thin part of the script, and she stands out. She was a good choice for a woman of divided allegiance, a “gal,” which would have been much more modern than the social conventions of the time would allow - if there had been no struggle between life and death. <br /> <br /> One good aspect of the film is how the rivalry of American revolutionary leaders grew into frank jealousy, and how these personal conflicts almost sabotaged all revolutionary efforts. In general, the main characters are very well traced, the secondary characters are not just the “props” of the person, and the scenes of battles are plausible enough to withstand dramatic action. <br /> <br /> This is a great spy movie. This is not a very big historical drama, but it satisfies quite well. He appreciates the seven, largely because Cornell Wilde is so deeply involved in his role, and he does it so well, and also because Ann Francis makes the most of her support efforts. <br /> <br /> Color printing used in Turner Classic Movies films. it was very clear, and therefore it was a pleasant presentation in this important respect. <br /> <br /> I hope it will resume soon.
