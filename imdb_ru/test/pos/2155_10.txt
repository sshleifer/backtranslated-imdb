Sony Pictures Classics, I look at you! Sony has rights to write Harry - you need to distribute the film, and you will significantly increase the sales of its back catalog! In any case, this is an excellent study of a charming musician, sadly little-known, full of wonderful stories, excellent music, and it could take 3 hours longer, and I would love him even more. Saw it at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers festival at Aero Theater in Santa Monica, where he played in a crowded house. They turned people away at the door! I went to many Mods & Rockers festival films, and let me assure you that no other film even came close to selling, let alone distracting people. Watch it in the cinema, buy a DVD and make sure that some slow company [* coughs SONY *] picks it up as soon as possible!
