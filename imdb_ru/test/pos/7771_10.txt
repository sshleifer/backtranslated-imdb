I watched Love Jones more than thirty times. This is one of the rare films that tell a love story about people who turned out to be African American. The dialogue was realistically written and delivered honestly. It was so nice to see a movie where the storyline focused on young professional African Americans. This is a virtually unused market. Love Jones was visually charming. Chemistry of Lorentz Tate and Nia Long will bring memories of past and true love. The sensation of the film is jazz and blues, which bring to me the sensuality of warm creamy hot chocolate with bursts of Kahlua and Butterscotch. If you had not guessed, I liked it!
