Hollywood films from the 1930s viewed gays as lepers. Condemning homosexuality, the film industry reflected only what the repressive society of that time adhered to as an ideology. For example, in Otto Preminger's melodrama “Tips and Consent” of 1962, direct actor Don Murray was introduced as a strange congressman who commits suicide and does not recognize his alternative lifestyle. Characters of gay films have already gone through a series of "Tips and consent." In the 1997 film “In & Out” (** 1/2 of ****), heterosexual actor Kevin Kline is introduced as a teacher of homosexuality, who leaves the toilet on his wedding day. While conservative Hollywood of past years envisaged that the wanderer of Congress in Council and Consent had to commit suicide, modern liberal Hollywood dictates that a gay English teacher should be perceived, not disguised. <br /> <br /> In fact, In & Out preaches good citizenship in the clothes of a politically correct comedy. Director Frank Oz and screenwriter Scott Rudnik consider honesty to be the best policy, because honesty always guarantees happiness. High school teacher Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline from The Big Cold) will be happy only after he leaves the closet, just like his once-fat, but already thin, bride Emily (Joan Cusack) will feel happy only when she can give up her diet. Ultimately, the film claims that direct society will accept gays when homosexuals can act with more honesty and frankness towards themselves. Successfully liberated reporter gay tabloids, played by direct actor Tom Selleck, here effectively dramatizes this open-minded comment. <br /> <br /> The light script of the Mine is adorned with a real life incident that happened at the Oscars, when Tom Hanks paid tribute to the high school teacher. In the movie “In & Out” Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a blond actor in the style of Bram Pitt, won the Oscar for being a fruit soldier. Drake honors his mentor Howard Brackett during his opening speech. Do not hesitate to rest on our laurels, outright Cameron tells live television audience that Howard is gay! Suspicion, paranoia, and horror arose when the media descended into the sleepy city of Green Leaf, Indiana. (When would the unnamed English teacher's sexual rejection cause such massive media concern?) Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck from High Road to China) is hiding among these reporters, and he wants to make an exclusive Howard film for the week Howard, however, does not want to have anything to do with the witch hunt, especially the nasty Peter Malloy. Howard denies accusing Dake of being gay to everyone, including his bride and his mother. Malloy lingers, because it smells like a scoop. Revelation turned Green Leaf upside down. High School director Tom Hollwell (Bob Newhart) nervously wriggles from all media coverage. Hollywoodwell warns Howard that if his marriage were not inevitable, he would have to give him a pink receipt. Meanwhile, Peter is betting on Howard that his marriage to Emily will fail at the last moment, and he will be there to record the result on camera. <br /> <br /> Howard resorts to macho audio recordings. He struggles to transform himself. But Howard’s efforts are worthless. Guilt is heating up inside him. And then there is Peter Malloy, who shakes him so that he openly tells about his homosexuality. Finally, at the altar in the eyes of God, Howard bursts. Of course, Emily Montgomery's bride is frightened by Howard’s recognition of being gay. As expected, the school dismisses Howard, but he appears at graduation. Drake also appears and rushes to protect Brackett. Not only did the school deprive Howard of his job, but they also gave his teacher’s award to the year to someone else. Drake turns to the director and wins Howard with the unanimous support of the community. <br /> <br /> The biggest defect in the mine’s far-fetched scenario is Howard himself. The mine has created a character too chaste to be true, by gray or direct standards. Howard Brackett looks more like a saint than a sinner. He helps one student go to college and coaches a track and field team. How often do you hear that the English teacher also doubles as a trainer? Everyone at his school loves Howard. He has no evil bone in his body. In addition, Mine and Oz ask us to believe that no one in Green Leaf is gay. Where are Howard's funny friends? Are they too scared to come to his defense? No, “In & Out” is not aimed solely at the homosexual audience. Oz, whose captions on the screen include cute comedies, such as “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” and “Home Nanny”, as well as the Mine is balancing on a politically correct rope. In & Out is not a gay recruitment film. The filmmakers show no interest in what prompted either Howard or Peter Malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle. Instead, Oz and Mine are only interested in strengthening the subtle premise: is he gay or not? They clarify to involve the public response to the answer. Finally, when Howard admits that he is gay, the filmmakers devote to the rest of the films a show of how conservative, like Norman Rockwell, the city can accept it, despite its difference. <br /> <br /> The most shocking scenes in In & Out are probably when tabloid reporter Malloy makes lipstick on Howard. Straight guys kissing each other in a gay identity crisis movie are as funny as and fake. Klein and Selleck twist their faces together, which looks more like a head-on collision than a kiss with a closed mouth. Nothing resembles the scandalous British film of 1994 Priest, In & Out, which is social propaganda with its idea that action is needed If Ellen were not the television equivalent, In & Out would probably go to television as a new sitcom. Watch "In & Out" is not so much a question of gays or naturals as how to be decent man in the last days of the 20th century. What makes In & Out a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equal chance of joy and mockery of queers and parrots.
