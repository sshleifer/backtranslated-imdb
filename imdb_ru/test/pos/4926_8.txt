I like this movie ... it can make me laugh! = ^ _ ^ = Which is quite difficult to do. This film is one of the best cartoons. This does not distort the characters, as in other films. All in the character and play a role! <br /> <br /> The film tells about how Buster and Babs go down the river after the flood (courtesy of Buster), and Pluki goes on a journey with Hamton (funny things) Elmira runs, torturing animals (as usual), Fifi watches her passion for an autograph, and Shirley and Faulmut go to the movies. <br /> <br /> In my personal opinion, I didnâ€™t like Baster. and Babs so much, although they had some noticeable dialogue and jokes. I must say that the Plucky and Hampton 'Vacation' games were the best! Hamton's family is fun! I especially like Uncle Stinky. Fifi at the hotel was also fun. I love the actors on this scene. : D <br /> <br /> Probably the most famous role in this film, again, IMHO, is when Faulmut and Shirley are in a movie theater ... LOL! You have to see it to rate it! And when Hamton and Pluki walk through the tunnel to make a wish ... :) Although this film was moving slowly during Buster / Babs parties, the rest is pure gold! I rate this movie 8/10. Show it to your children once ... or even by the adults themselves - SEE THIS FILM! You will not regret it.
