I noticed and enjoyed the very rich abilities of the expression of the main actress Julianne Nicholson. I have no words to describe how fascinated I was. All the actors and actresses played well. I especially noticed a solid good character who was consistent in predicting the future - Andy Richter, who played Carl. I think that the idea of ​​showing many friends and relatives with different opinions, as well as a few consulting meetings, is similar to the real world. Jay Mohr, who played Ed, the future husband, also played a very real behavior. But I want to emphasize once again the point of a very rich repertoire of expressions that Julianne Nicholson is capable of and does it naturally, for me it was overwhelming. Indeed, the theme that this film touches seems to me to be very important and touches the highly significant thoughts of many people. I have seen this film several times, and I was not bored. It raises again and again in my thoughts.
