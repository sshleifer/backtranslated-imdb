I can't say this show is perfect. Perhaps, all previous commentators remember the old slot of Tuesday at 10:30, occupied by Buchi Elvira Kurt's children's humor (“There is a space shuttle carrying 747!”). Oh, glory to climb, pressing any button on the remote so that it changes. <br /> <br /> Admit it, comedy cannot pull out a shop window and create the comic genius of the truly Canadian Trailer Park guys. But hey, they try. <br /> <br /> This show is definitely one of the best original shows. However, none of the following will laugh at the obvious "players" who demonstrate their stupidity in the selection of girls: <br /> <br /> a) "Stupid" girls - obviously, they can not understand that they are so same as the girls on the show. Forgetting Jump on the meat of a man, you can call yourself a whore tomorrow and get his name. It looks good, it should be popular and enjoyable. HAHAHAHA !!! Oh, but you would never do that! Nobody would ... if they knew that this is happening <br /> <br /> b) Unbecoming guys who think that women love good guys - it’s obvious that these guys succeed in what you are failing or even not experienced to your primary rage boil. Look carefully, most of the time they are knocked down. They say that this is stupid shit. <br /> <br /> c) Girls respect each other. Obviously, your individual female species has fallen into real situations, this is wrong, wrong, wrong. Nobody plays. Women are not objects, they cannot be played, because they are all very faithful angels who go to clubs to communicate politely with each other without fear of guys trying to raise them. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait ... hmmmmmmmm <br /> <br /> As much as everyone says that this show is not funny, and that it does not teach you anything, I have to take the opposite side. The show talks very well about how relationships work for both men and women. The way they think and how they think each other, and the social hierarchy. It's funny to see and hear guys make absolutely idiotic comments on what women say (“My grandfather died recently,” “Oh ... ok, are we having fun today?”). <br /> <br /> Also his club. A place for people to go out and have fun. It doesn't matter who you are, you go to the club to get or pay attention to someone. Guys go there to check their game and pick up girls. The girls go there to flirt with the guys and find someone who sweeps them away the best. Make it easy! <br /> <br /> If you're a guy, find out one or two things about the different approaches and the different effects they have. If you're a girl, find out what these “curly” men really think, and learn how to distinguish them from real guys. Next time, when one of these jerks will part you, understand that it is not because of him, but because you are stupid and thought that he was the greatest guy ever when he was completely crazy all the time for you
