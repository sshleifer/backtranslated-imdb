I got hooked on GG from the middle of 2001-2002 (season 2), when I tuned in to Smallville 10 minutes earlier. Thanks to “Beginnings”, I now have everything except 2 episodes on the tape, right up to last night (Ep. 4.9). I am a middle-aged man, and I watch ONLY a weekly TV show. <br /> <br /> I love this show because: a) Lauren Graham is a damn pretty woman, fun and smart Download; b) the dialogue is very well written; c) it's just ridiculous, shameful to smash trash, like “Everybody loves Raymond” Many modern television comedies were strongly influenced by a highly successful and very despised pit for mucus, known as “Married with Children”, where viewers are invited to make fun of and feel superior to the characters. In GG, characters have flaws, but we can see our weaknesses in them and laugh at them, not at them. This stimulates television, where authors challenge us to keep up with the rapid exchange of lights and references of pop culture / literature / current events outside the left margin. I enjoy watching these episodes again and again, catching all the lines and links to previous episodes. “Star Hollow” is her own little world, which I will happily continue to visit as the series goes.
