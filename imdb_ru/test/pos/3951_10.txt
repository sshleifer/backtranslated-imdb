He reaches the mind and senses of everyone who drives them deep into the black desert. A cruel but beautiful world that is explored through memories and sharp layers of sound and musical score. The landscape develops its own persona, parallel to the internal geography of all three characters, as their stories unfold. The absolute emptiness of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then the overcoming of emptiness thanks to the very openness of this devastation. Three lost souls struggle to find something absolute and positive in all this negative space. Drama irresistible. James Franco and his colleagues perform cleverly. A naive schoolboy, a blonde suicide, an embittered car thief - everything fits in with unexpected turns. Together they create an explosive portrait of fragmented love - one that unwittingly conspires to correct among the most complex forms of calamity and illusion - the blindness of human emotions.
