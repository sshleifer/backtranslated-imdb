As the French, I was very pleased to laugh at the old stereotype, which is made of French, over some defaults of Westerners, spy films, etc. And many other things along the way. ... I have already seen it 3 times, and every time I discovered new things and laughed to tears ... Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, director Aure Atiq and the whole cast, the whole team did a fantastic job. This film is funny, but, nevertheless, it is much more: there are many levels in it. You laugh because of simple jokes, because of some critics made with wit (the film is brave enough to be critical), because of the physical comedy, because you believe in characters, etc. This is also aesthetically and musically a success . Go see if you can.
