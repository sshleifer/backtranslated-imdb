Perhaps this is one of my favorite movies. It tells about a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs), who lost her mother at a very young age, so she was bought up by her father. She falls in love with a boy named Kai. However, on her birthday, the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) arrives at the hotel owned by her father and kidnaps Kaya. Then Gurda follows Kai and follows him for four seasons, trying to save him. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a great adaptation of the story with great performances by all the actors. He has great special effects, and the story blends very well and is easy to follow. I think this is a great movie for the whole family. I watched it every time it turned on from the moment it appeared, and never got tired of it, so I gave it 10!
