Tiny Tweet and Sly the Sneak are locked in cages for the train ride, who knows where. Swinging Tweety begins to sing an unbearable song as soon as the train leaves the station, so let's hope Puddy Tad will get it this time. Sly is experiencing a couple of funny handheld tricks, but a spoiled sports guide puts the bird in a safer place among the baggage. The next attempt of the cat will be that he was in the coal furnace of a steam engine. And the chase continues. Of course, there is a bulldog, and the stupid Sly simply cannot keep his big mouth shut. <br /> <br /> Then the persistent pussy tries an old pile of suitcases (twice), getting a win. Avery will be proud. Unfortunately for Sylvestre, this bulldog seems to be everywhere. He even demonstrates a talent for reshaping and making huge batons from his back pocket. Even the ability of Sylvester to overtake the high-speed train cannot save him when he is cast aside in the style of the Silver Strip several times in a row. Arriving at the new place of the grandmother (Gower Gulch, population 86), the cat's last attempt includes dressing up. But you know what happens to men in dresses, they always get more attention than they expected. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
