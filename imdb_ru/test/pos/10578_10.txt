Having read the book before viewing this adaptation, you would think that it would lose some of the thrill. However, the story is so clever that I never get tired of it. <br /> <br /> Sally and Elaine really put their hearts in their roles and dragged out so many characters. I fell in love with history and women again and again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful looking, thanks to the direction, settings and costumes. Despite the plot speed of television, I do not feel that something important was lost on the way. It made me stand on the edge of my seat with a lot of great moments quivering in my stomach. Enjoy it completely. This is the kind of television I was waiting for.
