This is one of my favorite horror films of all time, and I used to think that he never got his due. Until I read the glowing reviews here. It seems that many feel the same as me when I first saw him. <br /> <br /> This is a hell of a creepy movie, and I spent most of my life watching creepy movies. I always found dolls, mannequins and such damn creepy! Look at the dolls in “Behind the Door” and, of course, on the great “Trilogy of Horror”. What about the glorious episode of the Twilight Zone Living Doll. Damn, creepy dolls! And the Tourist Trap has some points that make your hair stand on the back of your head. And all thanks to the magnificent soundtrack, which makes Connors' work even more heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> I remember watching the trailer for this film on TV late at night and something like, “Wow, I have to see it!” It was unforgettable. And this is one of the few trailers that I remember when I was a kid who scared me. It took me years to see him, but it was a pleasure. <br /> <br /> Stephen King also mentions this film in his book “Danse Macabre” and gives him a bright recommendation. Pretty good company. <br /> <br /> This film will always be on my must-see list. This is a really solid addition to the genre of that time, and it deserves a place along with the best Schlokers of the 70s.
