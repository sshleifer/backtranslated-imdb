Much time has passed since such an original, rather funny, black comedy appeared. If "Eating Raoul" is on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and immediately find "Undertaking Betty." The theme of death, which was funny, has already been undertaken (see Paul Bartel and Mary Ravens in the Academy of the Dead). While there are some brilliant black comedy moments in this film, Betty's Commitment is much more stable, with better line-up. Who would have thought that this business could become a fertile ground for an original, inspirational and emotional comedy? I was surprised and you will too. I highly recommend watching Betty's Commitment - MERK
