Stephen Hawkins is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. From watching this movie, I feel stupid. But this is a great movie. Not very interesting, but very intriguing. The film tells about Steven Hawkins, sitting in a wheelchair, the man who makes Einstein look average, as well as his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, the galaxy and black holes. Everyone at one time or another, during a really intense peak, comes to the moment when he thinks he understood the universe and found out the cosmos, and they swear that they sober up and write it all down. Well, here is a man who really kept this feeling for more than six hours. Here is a man who, despite the sufferings of Lou Gehrig's disease, has become the greatest mind the world has ever seen. Look at this and listen to how he formulated the theory of black holes. Awesome. You will not be the same after seeing this.
