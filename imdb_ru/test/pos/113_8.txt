It was a bold film that hit Indian cinemas when it was released. The first film, which, perhaps, openly depicts the trends of lesbians among Indian women. The leading actress of Indian cinema Shabana Azmi has added to the film the content with her hot passionate scenes with Nandita Das. <br /> <br /> The film oozed out in sexuality, and the director used sex as best he could. Sex was not for erotic purposes, but in the context of the film. The scene where Nandita Das loses her virginity towards her husband, of course, was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas. <br /> <br /> Good play of all the actors, especially Nandita Das, amid criticism from the Indian public
