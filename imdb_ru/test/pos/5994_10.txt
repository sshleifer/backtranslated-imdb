I slowly wade through as many Hong Kong fighters as I can, and stumbled upon this gem - mainly due to Ching Van Lau, who is one of my favorite actors. <br /> <br /> This is a great fighter, although not the same as OTT, as the name suggests. It moves at a great pace and is really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was the biggest surprise of this movie. It seems that Rob Dugan - the guy who made the song "Clubbed To Death", which was popular in The Matrix, took the soundtrack from Big Bullet and compiled it into one of the tracks on his album "Furious Angels"; The tune in question is called “I'm not driving anymore” and is also the starting melody for the series Law and Order and the opening track on the teaser of the DVD menu “Matrix Reloaded”! It really surprised me because of the sheer coincidence!
