Currently playing at the German Film Festival in Australia in 2007. <br /> <br /> In Australia, these films were subtitled in English, and although French films here are often mainstream, German films still collect such a commercial audience. But like BMW and Mercedes, when the Germans get it right, I really like their movies. As in the case of PQ, time passed so quickly here, a lot of audience laughter, when each of 9 men and 9 women moved along the line of speed acquaintances 5 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> Although many films are too long alone I could watch a lot more. It was a kind of character and character development for the series. Over time, I reread the AriesGemini100 review and referred to the actors I liked, and their other works, to follow them. I agree .... most of these actors will go for bigger and better things. Some very good characters in this beautiful movie. I saw it in the program specified as a sample. A mockery or other sensation was very real. And quite romantic of its kind. <br /> <br /> Viva la Deutcsh!
