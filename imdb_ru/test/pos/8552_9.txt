While living in Romania, I was almost taken aback by a very realistic setting for the scenes and a lot of care that the director gave to the local details. Anthony Quinn's performance is absolutely superb, and the rest of the cast is great at supporting him. The film requires little knowledge of the Eastern European context in order to fully enjoy it, but otherwise it remains an excellent performance with some memorable lines. the finale may be a little too melodramatic, but actually this is the way people in this part of the world, I think the script is great because it represents the horrors of World War II in the most original way - without blood, without battlefields. However, life is shattered, and the smiles you occasionally get throughout the entire film are quickly killed by the realities of war concerning the characters.
