In a romantic love affair, reminiscent of the best features of David Lin, epic proportions sweep across the screen, equal to the vast desert regions in which he is depicted. This is a film that says that a person chooses not love, but love, which makes a choice regardless of who, where or when; and, moreover, it is a question of the heart, often depending on the prevailing conditions and circumstances. And thus, the situation in the “English Patient” by director Anthony Minghella, the stories of two people who reveal passion and true love in the most inappropriate places and times, proving that when it is predetermined, love will find a way out. <br /> <br /> This is World War II; flying over the African desert, the Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almacy (Ralph Fiennes) was shot down, his biplane was mistaken for an enemy plane. And although he survived the accident, he was badly burned. Fortunately, a tribe of nomads saved him, and he ended up in the hospital. But the existing conditions depend on the circumstances of the war, and Almasi soon becomes one of the many patients transported through the convoy to another institution. Upon reaching Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue, and the Canadian nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) voluntarily remains with him in an abandoned monastery. <br /> <br /> Khana soon discovers that her accusation is something of a man of mystery, since Almashi does not remember anything about his past or even his name. Being English, the only clues that indicate who he is are contained in the book he discovered after the accident, but even they are as mysterious as Hana's patient. However, slowly, as prompted by Hana, Almasi begins to recall pieces of his life, and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is further assisted by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Defoe), who suspects that Almasi is the person he was looking for - the person with whom he wants to settle scores. But burned beyond recognition, Almasi may or may not be this person. Meanwhile, Almasi’s memories continue to float; memories of the woman he loved, Catherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas), as well as memories of her husband Katherine, Jeffrey (Colin Firth). And, being disfigured by mind and body as it is, these memories become the only remaining thing to which he can cling to any hope, even if his life seems to go farther with every moment. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the script for this film, which he adapted from the novel by Michael Ondaye. The result is an epic saga, presented in the tradition of Lean "Doctor Zhivago" and "Lawrence of Arabia"; a great movie that fills the screen and feelings with unparalleled grandeur and beauty. Simply put, Minghella’s film is brilliant; created and delivered with poetic perfection, to observe it is similar to the observation of Monet's revival. From the first frames, Minghella imposes a hypnotic spell on his audience, which links and transports, with a story that has emotional beauty equal to the exciting stunning and vivid images brought to life by John Cyl's wonderful cinema; Images that almost fill the screen, as well as the soul of the viewer. In all senses, this is a film of rare eloquence with amazing emotional ability, contributing to a truly transcendent experience. Nominated in twelve categories, he deservedly received a total of nine Oscars, including “Best Picture”, the director “Secondary Actress” and “Cinematography”. <br /> <br /> If you had to choose one word to describe the “essence” of this film, it would be “superiority”. However, even an unusual film does not receive nine Oscars without speeches, which are extraordinary in their own way; and the speeches of Ralph Fiennes and Christine Scott Thomas here go beyond the term Oscar-worthy. Nominated for the title of best actor for the role of Almasi (Geoffrey Rush was awarded gold for "Shining"), Fiennes was never better, reaching emotional depth with his character, which is almost palpable. Private and introspective, Almashi is not an individual by nature, with whom the audience will be able to form an intimate relationship; Fiennes, however, finds a way to open this emotional door enough to let you in, so much so that you feel a sincere passion awakening in it. And it works. Almasi does not seek your friendship; he will, however, receive your compassion. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas also received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the award for “Fargo”) for her image Catherine, a woman whose stoic facial expression masks the emotional conflict raging in her, born a forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet she voluntarily gives herself away, throwing off her chains of repression to accept love so strong that it threatens to devour her. The stock that Catherine must maintain evokes sympathy from the audience, as Scott Thomas successfully digs the emotional depths of his character to the maximum possible effect. This is the work that attracts you and holds you quickly, raising you up, as it happens beyond hypocrisy, which dictates what should be at least for the sake of appearance, and allows you to experience a true feeling of unbridled passion. This is an amazing work by Christine Scott Thomas, her tireless and shadowed subtlety. <br /> <br /> Binoche gives you an amazing, impressive job, like the kind-hearted Nurse Han; in fact, it is her humanity that defines love in its purest sense and offers its balanced perspective in the context of the film. Her relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) gives us an idea of ​​another kind of passion, which effectively contrasts with the intensity of the relationship between Almásy and Catherine. “The English Patient” is a film that excites and fills you emotionally; the one you don't want to see the end. 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
