I watch tons of movies and had no idea that it would be as good as it was. I was looking forward to it after reading the plot (although I find Nirvana overpriced). It sounded like it would be fun, but it was more than that. Jansen brings small touches, such as books (Kubrickâ€™s book among others), movie posters, etc. I like it when I see that the director is in no hurry and puts his heart into the film. And you can really feel it in it. There are a lot of scenes and moments that I like, now I'm trying to remember some other films like these, and I would say that the only thing I can remember is Cameron Crow films. It takes few moments and highlights them and makes them special. The soundtrack is stunning, and each song fits perfectly with the scenes and sensations of the film. This film is amazingly shot, and the editing is great. I could keep on talking about the movie. I can't recommend it enough in fact. If you want a funny story with great melodies from a director who clearly put his heart into his work, then look at that.
