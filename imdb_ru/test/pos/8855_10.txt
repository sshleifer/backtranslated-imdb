In 1982, over the course of several weeks, two alien films were released. ET Steven Spielberg and The Case by John Carpenter. Of these, ET was the one who won the hearts of people all over the world, although The Thing debuted first. Because people were so fascinated by Spielberg's warm, fluffy fable, they stayed away from The Thing in turn. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to understand why. The two are diametrically opposed. One of them is an optimistic tale created to warm the clams of the still beating heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that draws alien life as something completely decisive to destroy us. I suppose the viewers thought that the alien was much more attractive than the tentacles and saliva covered in slime! ". It took some time, but “Things” won a significant cult audience. How it should. Because The Thing is a rare example of an excellent remake. He takes all the best qualities of the classics of 1951 and reinvents them in amazing and creative ways. In fact, Carpenter copes so well with his work that in fact he manages to make a film that every inch equals the show of the Alien genre. And it is even rarer! <br /> <br /> The Carpenter film more closely matches the source material than the film “Things from another world”. It keeps the cold wastelands of Antarctica as a setting, because it is the perfect backdrop when you are trying to create an increased sense of isolation. But although it is a bit subtle in characterization, the remake penetrates right into the thinking of the actors and heightens the insecurity and fear that slowly surround them. <br /> <br /> Frequent employee Carpenter Kurt Russell returns, frustrated with success Escape from New York, played once again as one of Carpenter's eternal antiheroes. He plays MacReady, a helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (you can only guess what they are researching). The problem begins when a Norwegian helicopter from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to shoot the Siberian Husky out of thin air. <br /> <br /> As a result, they die for their troubles, and while the camp is trying to solve the problem. They take the secret of what happened in the Huskies and add them to theirs. Except that this husky is not a husky at all. But a shape-changing alien. The Norwegians found him frozen in ice, and when they defrosted him, he destroyed their team. Able to absorb its victims at will, it can duplicate a living creature down to the smallest detail. Soon, paranoia and suspicion make their way through a team of 12 people, so far no one knows who the person is and who is not. <br /> <br /> The Thing is one of John Carpenter’s best films. In fact, I feel like saying that this is the best film he has ever done. Even surpassing classics such as Halloween and the Dark Star. The reason I put “The Thing” at the top of Carpenter’s list is because it seems to me that his latest film can truly be called a classic. All the others after that felt that Carpenter was swaying it. Films that are not combined with cool grace and ragged intensity, so common in his earlier works. <br /> <br /> But The Thing had John Carpenter at the height of his abilities. He never created tension to such an unbearable degree. Even in a brutal attack on the 13th station. Since the alien announces its presence, Carpenter has steadily increased the level of tension. And when he strikes, they come with a painful thrust. <br /> <br /> The film is a mixture of pure atmosphere and inner horror. An approach that can often contradict each other, but in the hands of Carpenter is perfectly combined. Drawing on Rob Bottin from Howling Glory, he brings some of the most amazing transformation effects you have ever seen in a horror movie. Amorphous forms. Semi-formed human features contrast sharply with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed, the effects of the film are so amazing and elegant that The Thing came under fire for being too realistic! <br /> <br /> This type of thinking is completely inappropriate. It only reduces the value of the film. And there are many. Carpenter sets the effects scene only when he needs it. It is in the quieter moments of the film, where he seems to be especially tuned to the story. The “thing” is often a confusing story about shadows, whispers and consequences. Characteristics has never been one of John Carpenter’s strengths, but it works to his advantage in Things. Since we know almost nothing about the cast, this only makes the current situation much more confusing. We are never sure from one moment to the next who is who. And because of this, The Thing keeps up very well and keeps its riddle on subsequent views. <br /> <br /> Special mention should be made of Ennio Morricone’s excellent score. A throbbing thud every two seconds. This creates an eerie, eerie feeling that is very difficult to shake. The whole movie is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they analyze each other's blood to see who the person is, Carpenter coiled up with such dexterity, you might find yourself biting your nails without even knowing it. <br /> <br /> The Thing is a real classic. Even the ending leaves you with a vague suspicion that all is not solved. An underestimated film worthy of the overestimate he received. And much better than ET!
