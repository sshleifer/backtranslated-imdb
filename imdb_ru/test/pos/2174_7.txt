First, let me confess that I did not read this particular Balzac novel, so perhaps I unfairly direct my jokes to the director and editor. However, my experience with Balzac in other stories is that he writes as a realist and not obscurantist. This is definitely a film that is worth it, but in the end it remains extremely puzzled. Was the colonel a fraud used by a lawyer for his own purposes (or for anyone besides him); or the colonel was not a fraud, but was used, as stated above, by a lawyer; or did the lawyer really try to serve the honest colonel? It seems to me that the director and / or editor deliberately obscured these issues, which is unlike the realistic Balzac. At the same time, the film perfectly shows the characters, if not their motives, but the actors and the production are great. This opening scene of the battle will surely pursue dreams. Nevertheless, one wonders at the widespread inclination of modern cinematographers to prefer ambiguity above all. Were not the problems and motives of all these characters difficult enough for Yves Angelo?
