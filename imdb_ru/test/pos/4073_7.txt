I went to see this film, not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the unification of Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. It was a quick movie, and one and a half hours went by quickly. This one will certainly not receive any Academy awards, but for Mr. De Niro it was a change of pace. He is good at comedy. Overall I liked it.
