Usually I don’t look at a romantic comedy with all my might, and maybe I’ll be in the future after seeing “Return to me”. The plot was simple and not a secret after publicity. You do not need to be Einstein to guess what will happen in the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let the actors take you to a world where chemistry is abundant, and the good guys win, and you can just laugh and have a good time. I love this movie .... and a DVD to order!
