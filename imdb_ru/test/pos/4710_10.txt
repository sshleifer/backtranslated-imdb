Magnificent cinematography, beautifully written and edited, "Outside of Rangoon" by John Boorman is mandatory for anyone interested in world politics and the personal transformation arc. It interweaves a personal and political story that continues to haunt me, emerging in my brain with frequency. The storyline captures, and the internal and external travel carefully and delicately run in parallel, both cinematically and in the storyline. I watched this movie at least six times, and it really stands the test. This is especially true today, given the world events. Check it out, you will not regret it! By the way, NetFlix does not yet carry it, but you can request it.
