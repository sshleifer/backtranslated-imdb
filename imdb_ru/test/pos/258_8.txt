Go to imdb to tell you what is Love Love, an amazing film, and I'm completely confused. It seems to me that someone confused their names. "Plastic demon baby" what? It was not Love Life. For my taste, a little pleasant, but excellent, funny and original film. I especially liked the ending, which did not fall into a normal hole of cliches, when all Hollywood romantic films crash and burn it. Nine out of ten.
