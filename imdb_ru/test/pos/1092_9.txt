I still remember seeing Satia for the first time. I was completely blown up. It was a film that was very different from other gangster films that I saw. So realistic, so Mumbaiya and so believable. Despite the fact that “Company” (which was a very good effort) and “Vaastav” (more focused on the journey of the main character), which were close, not a single film about the underworld could reach Satya. <br /> <br /> When I first saw Ab Tak 56, I said to myself: "The Indian cops now have their own satya." Quote Nietzsche at the very beginning tells you that this is no ordinary film. At the beginning of the film you will be amazed at the “meeting” in the relaxed manner in which it takes place. This is a cold and scary feeling, because you understand that this is part of their routine. <br /> <br /> Ab Tak 56 is not a story of an honest or corrupt police officer, but a police officer who is willing to do what is needed to get rid of criminals when all legal means are exhausted. With the help of simple pictures and perspectives of director Shimit Amin, one can catch the essence of the characters and make the film realistic and rude. Editing seems to be non-existent and therefore effective. The music is also impressive and haunting and remains with you long after you leave the cinema hall. <br /> <br /> But for me the dialogues and excellent actions of each character are really important. , Sandip Srivastava did a brilliant job as a dialogue author. If I start listing my favorite dialogues, I'm afraid that in the end I am rewriting the entire script of the film. <br /> <br /> There are several star performances in the film. Yashpal Sharma is disgusting as a subinspector Imtiaz Siddiqi, as well as Jiva as the Joint Commissioner Suchak. Revati, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar play small roles that they play to perfection. Nakul Wade as a rookie Jatin Shukla was a revelation. The scene where he should hesitantly shoot a wounded gangster ?? Oh my God! He studies under the guidance of Sadhu Agasha and firmly believes in him. <br /> <br /> Prasad Purandhare as Zamir Zafar is impressive. His conversations with Sadhu are real jewels of dialogue. Never before in Indian cinema has there been such a beautiful relationship between a cop and a gangster. <br /> <br /> I was not a fan of Nana Patek before this film, but this film pushed me from a devotee fan. Nana as Inspector Sadhu Agasha gives an idea of ​​life and one of the best I've ever seen in a Hindi movie. From the way he talks to his expression, from the way he knocks a cigarette, to how he drinks tea? it is almost as if Nana could not do wrong. He is at his best in every scene, especially when he teaches Jatin how the police work. His cold-blooded and restrained manner is sometimes scary. His dialogues and body language convinced me that he is one of the best actors in the country. It is a pity that he did not receive any popular awards for this. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, Shimit Amin does a brilliant job of combining all these talents and using them fully to come up with a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema. In an industry that is disgustingly used to putting up stories here and there, Amin takes the original script and brings it to life with beautiful processing. I just hope that he continues to do a great job and does not succumb to Bollywood! If he can do this, I am sure that he will become a force to be reckoned with in the coming years.
