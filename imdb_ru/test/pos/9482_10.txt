From the initial hit hit "We are Gonna Groove" to the latest guitar hit hit "Whole Lotta Love", this two-DVD set can be one of the best music DVDs that have ever appeared on the shelves since Beatles Anthology was finally released. at the beginning of this year. <br /> <br /> One of the best features of this DVD is that on disc 1 you can find a whole concert and many television appearances. For example, the entire Royal Albert Hall concert is on DVD, as well as some of the best performances from the last concert of the group in Knebworth. <br /> <br /> For example, at the Royal Albert Hall concert the band had a lot of room for improvisation. Jimmy Page's guitar solos make “Dazed And Confused” a huge rock ballad, unlike a relaxed blues song that was on Led Zeppelin I. <br /> <br /> Next on DVD 2 - a promo video for the hit song Led Zeppelin III "The Immigrant Song". This is one of the most difficult rock songs of Zeppelin, the video is about the same fragmentary as the video before MTV, but it reflects a lot of Jimmy Page's guitar power as it was taken from a live performance. After the video ends, we have a short photo of the fans taking seats at Madison Square Garden. The following are actions that were supposed to be part of "Song Staying The Same", but did not make the cut. There were excellent riffs, similar to those in the songs "Black Dog" and "Ocean". <br /> <br /> After the performances in Madison we meet with Earl's Court. It sounded most of the material Led Zeppelin IV, like the most popular song ever recorded by Zeppelin, “Stairway to Heaven”. It is, as always, great, even more than version IV. <br /> <br /> Finally, to finish more than 5 hours of live material, this is the last concert of Ice Zeppelin in Knebworth in August 1979. As a viewer watching this, they have to admit that Robert Plant’s voice is becoming more and more hoarse from all the screams he made in the past, and this is obvious here. In such songs as "Kashmir" and "In The Evening", Plant does not have its vocal rise, but in "Whole Lotta Love" he returns to one more song. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the best music DVDs ever released is only next to the gorgeous box set "Beatles Anthology", which was released earlier in 2003. The sound in both 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital, just like the Beatles DVD, gives you a sense of onstage with performers standing right next to them, as you would feel on the Beatles DVD when they play in the studio. Although The Beatles and Led Zeppelin are different groups, they received different DVDs. Despite the fact that this set comes only on two discs compared to the five Beatles Set discs, it still feels very full for the viewer after he has gone through all this content. It is also nice to watch again and again, not only because of the sound quality, but also because of the pure energy on the stage when Robert Plant starts to sing. <br /> <br /> The brilliant effort of the Atlantic.
