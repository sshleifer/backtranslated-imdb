A terrific little movie in which Mary Astor plays a major role, and she works in a paper company, but when the owner is forced to sell due to health problems, she comes up with a scheme by which employees can buy the company with a jerk. salesman (Robert Ames) in the role of the "front", although she has brains. <br /> <br /> Of course, he is making great strides, and she becomes his executive secretary, basically still managing everything and teaching him to the class. She loves drugs, but he never clings when he fools around with a bunch of boobies. She is haunted by a married but separated man, Ricardo Cortes, who is not free. But when society catches up with Ames, everything goes to hell. <br /> <br /> Astor is just as wonderful as an overly intelligent woman who almost makes a huge mistake after losing her man. Ames is good as a jerk (but what does she see in him?), And Cortes is good, but there is nothing special to do. Kitty Kelly is good as an assistant, Dolores. Charles Sellon is the original owner, Cather Dale Owen is a social babe, and Edna Murphy is funny, like Daisy. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
