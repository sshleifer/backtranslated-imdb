This film is an exciting drama about making a film. The actor and actress really can't stand each other, but we create a scene in which they have to have sex - for the first time, according to the script. The actress shows little emotion during the plot or off-camera, except that she freezes in the early scenes on the beach. The actor is immersed in himself and is increasingly not amenable to directing director Jeanne. I could not help but be dragged into the drama about "how can these two work through the sex scene?" Not that Roxana Mesquida wasn't cute, and she should be seen naked! However, there is a rather young stage hand that goes through several scenes additionally. I think that this is she in the far left edge of one of the pictures (2 of 9) here in IMDb. I do not even know if this girl is credited, but when she passes by (fully dressed, of course) in a sure indifference with her short blond hair - she is sexy! WHO IS THAT GIRL???
