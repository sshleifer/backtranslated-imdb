This horror film is definitely one of the best I've ever seen in my life, and there are many reasons for this. The storyline is really good, it has a lot of action and amazing horror episodes. The actors are not very good, but they are not so bad, but Kane is by far the best actor in this, but he has always been a good actor. The cast is very good. like Kane, like Jacob Goodnight, Christina Vidal, like Christina, Michael J. Pagan as Taya, Samantha Noble as Kira, etc. I also just have to warn you that the murder scenes are very disturbing, but they are very creative but it only makes it better, and you can't have a horror movie without blood and gore. They also look very realistic. Therefore, I am sure that you will not be disappointed that you see no evil, because this is a really good film. So make sure that you rent or buy, do not see evil, because it is so cool. <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: ********** of ********* <br /> <br /> ***** of **** *
