I was very impressed with Martha's narration and how it affected the emotional feelings of the audience, as well as how it affected the family. Moving back and forth along the storyline was well done, and usually I don’t enjoy movies with backward / flashback effects. Throughout the evolution of the film, I felt that "no doubt Tommy did it." This leaves you with the feeling of how these people lived their lives, almost completely devoid of each other, and the consequences of not wanting to answer the question: “It's 10 o'clock. Do you know where your children are? ”And besides,“ What the hell are they doing? ”!! Or "I don't care?" Rich, spoiled toddlers literally get away with the murder. Or so they thought .......
