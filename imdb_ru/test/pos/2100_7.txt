A pleasant combination of genres of giant monsters and samurai. The giant monster Magin, the god of the mountain, is an alienated and forbidden figure that is very similar to the Old Testament God, pouring rain on destruction and punishment on those who defile his holy land - but it is interesting to note that what ultimately awakens is not suffering people, but a keen and personal insult. This is beautifully photographed, with great acting, great miniatures and a wonderful score of great Akira Ifukuba. Majin is not like a 400-foot monster like Godzilla â€” he's two and a half times the normal size, so the evil samurai he stomps into the ground looks well into his contemptuous eyes, pressing down on their stronghold and smashing it to pieces. Not so much in terms of additions, but it's nice to see that this forgotten minor classics was saved and restored in digital format.
