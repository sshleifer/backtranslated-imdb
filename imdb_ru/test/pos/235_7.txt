Although I firmly believe that SITR is Gene Kelly's best movie, but it's a pretty good movie. I liked the music, the dancing and the ending of how Jin got the girl. My favorite part, without a doubt, is Gin's dance with his alter ego. I love to watch two Gina Kelly for the price of one. This shows how talented Mr. Kelly was. This is a film that I think everyone should watch at least once in their life. So you have not seen him come out and find him today! I'm sure everyone has a friend, Gene Kelly, who has this film in their collection. So go to their house, popcorn and enjoy!
