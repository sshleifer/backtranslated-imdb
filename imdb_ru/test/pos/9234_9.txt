This is a very funny movie. In the film there is a self-deprecating, iconoclastic tone, which is very attractive. Characters interesting. The film goes very well and interests you for 1 hour, 50 minutes of the film. The quality of the film does not meet the highest Hollywood standards; however, the original film was supposed to be made in the genre of sandy punk rock. The documentary about the attempt to make a film and the subsequent betrayal of the filmmakers is very well detailed and easy to understand. The creators of the original film themselves become the protagonists of the documentary version of the film. Cinematographers and actors were interviewed in a very interesting story that illustrates the struggle to create the original film, the possible failure of the original project and the uprising, similar to Phoenix, from the ashes that turned into this documentary, In my opinion, the documentary Texas story of betrayal ") - a much more interesting and interesting film than the original film (" Vacation on the Hawaiian Islands "). Two thumbs up for a job well done.
