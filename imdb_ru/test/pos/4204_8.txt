I didn’t expect much from this film, so I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it, and found it most remarkable. This is remarkable mainly due to the talent and appeal of his star, John Garfield. <br /> <br /> Garfield plays Jack, the star of boxing who was framed for the murder. He has to run and ends up in sticks with Gloria Dickson and Dead End Kids. There is a chance for ransom here, but will the past catch up with it? Garfield was an actor ahead of his peers. Even before the term “method” was coined, and even before Brando shouted “Stella!” He displays “natural” on the screen. His earthly qualities and amazing acting talent dominate this production. It is also interesting that his role here as a boxer has shades of that role of the “Golden Boy”, which he so desperately wanted to see on the screen. Garfield looks typical and goes his way as a boxer, proving his acting value. <br /> <br /> Ann Sheridan initially plays a small role in the role of the fucking girl Jack Goldie. I never thought about Sheridan, but I liked her here. She plays well with Garfield. Dixon's work is a little tired, and she does not share good chemistry with Garfield. The children of the Dead End are here, and Garfield seems their natural idol (even more than Cagney). Claude Raines was wrong, and he looks awkward in this role in many scenes. Strange, since he was always such a reliable actor. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that director Busby Berkeley, known for his early musicals with dancing girls and kaleidoscope images, leads another genre with remarkable lightness. He maintains a great atmosphere everywhere. <br /> <br /> A very good film that deserves more attention 8/10.
