This is what films should strive for. It's funny, not being completely stupid, a little sexy, without every woman in the cast showing her tits biting without resorting to the f-bombs of every line. Over the past few years, I've seen Justin Long play in and I thought that he should play the right role. (The commercials for the Mac do not stand up.) This film may just speed up his journey to list A. The rest of the actors also did an excellent job, this is a great little movie with a pleasant message. (But you do not need to buy a message to have a good time.) Lewis Black, as usual, is cheerful, and Blake Lively is a beautiful woman with a new face. <br /> <br /> Spend a couple of hours and watch this movie, they will not be in vain.
