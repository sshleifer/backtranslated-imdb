Interestingly, someone compared the Fifth Rocket to the Star Trek episode. It should be noted that the original television episode of Star Trek, in which the Enterprise team is experiencing a space madness in the orbit of Planet 2000, is called “Bare Time” and not “Naked Now”. “Naked Now” refers to the first regular episode of “Star Trek of the Next Generation,” in which Enterprise-D meets a scientific vessel. This episode, however, refers to the original TV series “Bare Time” and is based on it. <br /> <br /> Now about “Rocket Firth”. Although the crew’s response in Star Trek episodes was based on a reaction similar to alcohol intoxication, the crew condition aboard the Montana was caused by a much more serious situation, namely the paint fumes emitted due to a faulty bulkhead trim. There are few places where such a reaction could have more serious consequences than among a team that has the same serious responsibilities as a crew on a ballistic missile submarine, and of course this is what makes the film so intense and so thriller. The plot is very believable. At the same time, this film, along with Red Stream, The Day After Tomorrow, Early Light of Dawn, The Hunt for Red October, Ice Station Zebra and many other similar films, give us a lot of insight into how easily things can go wrong and how easily a nuclear catastrophe can begin. Fortunately, such an event did not happen, and (if God gives) such an event will not occur.
