The subspecies series is always the best vampire movies. there is something in them that makes them special, I think that is the feeling that you feel when you look at them. <br /> <br /> they are installed in our time, and yet they feel as if they were installed in 1700. s or 1800s, I think it is somehow related to the set that is used, if so, it works, keep up the good work :). <br /> <br /> in a brief overview of what happened in the first part - Radu was allegedly banished from his native land many years ago by his father, and he decided to go back and take what he considers to be his birth rite. bloody stone and all that his father has, so he kills his father, played by Angus Scrimm (a tall man from Ghost films). and takes a blood stone, which has tremendous power, to the one who has it, because the one who needs it will never need to kill anyone anymore, because the stone is supposedly designed to drip from the bloody saints, and every time Radu falls from him, he slowly walks insane. (this is all we need, mad vampire, as if a regular vampire is not bad enough). Well, Radu's brother, Stefan, is trying to put an end to his evil ways, all the while trying to stop himself alone with a tourist who lives in a house / fort owned by his friend. <br /> <br /> Well, one thing leads to another, and the two brothers collide, and you will need to watch a movie to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> I will soon tell / comment on other sequels. . <br /> <br /> The difference between this and the buffy is that the buffy is too commercial, and it’s not like that, everyone doesn’t like it, but the atmosphere is far superior to the buffy atmosphere, although Radu doesn't look as good as amazing full-bodied Sarah Michelle Gellar :). <br /> <br /> the score of this film 10/10 is a great example of how a film about vampires should be made :). <br /> <br />
