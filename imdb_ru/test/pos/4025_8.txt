We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film Festival and video, and we liked it. <br /> <br /> This film plunged into the fear that we all experience. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and, most importantly, fear of our own shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The three main actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Bridget Catilion as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo, fit each other perfectly in their roles. It was a joy to watch the dynamics between the three of them, for it seemed real. <br /> <br /> I believe that Barbora Bobulov stands out. I hope that we will see much more in the coming years. <br /> <br /> This film is not an easy one. Thanks to the Italian team that created this film. Highly recommended.
