Edward Dmitrik's Crossward Fire, a tough and organically exciting movie, is a special unknown thriller, an unlikely “message” movie that uses the look and feel of the noir cycle. <br /> <br /> Bivouac in Washington, DC, in which soldiers struggle with their anxiety while hanging out in bars. Three of them end up in a stranger's apartment, where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats his master (Sam Leuven) to death, because he turns out to be a Jew. Police Detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who appointed Ryan's outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who has disappeared. Ryan kills a third friend (Steve Brody) to insure his silence before Young closes. <br /> <br /> With the help of John Paxton's excellent screenplay, Dmitrik draws accurate insights from his three main Beans. Ryan naturally makes his Angry White Male prototype (up to the hilt), while Mitchum plays along with his characteristic vigilance (his role, however, is not central); The young might never have been better. Gloria Graham gives her first full version of an intelligent, vulnerable tramp, and like a sad bag that soaks into her life, Paul Kelly chases us in a small, secondary role that he makes unforgettable. <br /> Dmitry, politically busy, may inevitably yield to preaching, but he is largely limited to Yang’s memories of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of fanatics a century earlier (thus, by the way, extending the chronology to the limit) . At least there are no attempts to explain why Ryan hates the Jews (and the hills and ...). <br /> <br /> It is curious that Crossfire is going through even the most serious changes - the novel is based on (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) dealt with the murder of gays. But homosexuality in 1947 was still beyond the pale. Holocaust news, however, began to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood felt bold to register its protest against anti-Semitism (studios were always shaking from the possibility of offending any potential ticket buyer). <br /> But while the transition from homophobia to anti-Semitism generally works, the specifics do not fit so smoothly. The victim talks to a lonely, drunk young soldier, and then invites him home, looks strange, although (or especially since) there is a girl in tow. The question arises whether this scenario was unintentionally saved or left as a hidden clue to the original engine, causing Ryan's deadly rage.
