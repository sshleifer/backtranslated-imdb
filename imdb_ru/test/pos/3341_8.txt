This film was originally released as a soft "X", apparently with a distinct sex removed. Later, the producers gave up (sniffed the money) and reissued with the restored scenes cut (apparently, only about 3 minutes). I believe that since Christina came of age, this has been done against her, and her promising career has stopped. I believe everyone is on time (Pam Anderson’s career testimony) - but Ronald Reagan was in charge of crushing Christine (we haven’t heard about Nancy Reagan's affairs), Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky were in full swing during Pam's “release”. . <br /> <br /> Sex is just the icing on the cake, both versions suit. This naughty musical far surpasses the similar musicals released at the same time.
