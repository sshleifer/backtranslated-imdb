Forget about the plot of this movie. Forget that Vince Vaughn and Winsend D'Onofrio work beautifully in it. Forget about being one of the few starring Jennifer Lopez films that I can survive. Although the story is impossible to believe, and much of the dialogue seems far-fetched, the only important thing to keep in mind when watching this movie is that it contains the most amazing and disturbing images ever made in the movie. As if Salvador Dali decided to shoot a crime drama. Be sure to look at anyone who is seriously interested in cinematography and the use of film as a canvas on which you can display real works of fine art. I would have to give this movie 9/10, because this is an amazing visual display.
