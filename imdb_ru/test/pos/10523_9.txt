I accidentally caught the last 45 minutes of the film in the late evening, about 8 years ago. What a wild and funny 45 minutes. I was completely bewildered by the persecution at the end, which happens at night, in an old hotel that was destroyed by a destructive ball ... Incredible. I vaguely remember Stacy Keach, a stealing police car, pretending to be a cop, and tightly arming some wine ... Wine to Kitsch will see the light in the form of a DVD along with other lost treasures ... Hickey and Boggs are one of those.
