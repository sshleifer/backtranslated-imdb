This movie can recommend a lot. Pictures, music and David Hewlett's naked ass - everything is great! The plot, the story of redemption, forgiveness and courage in the face of adversity are also very interesting and touching - and this is not predictable, which says a lot about the film in our time. But the action is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the script is just strange. It often seemed that he was trying to be a parody, but I still did not understand that he was trying to be a parody *. And if this is not a parody, this is a film with great potential that it does not match.
