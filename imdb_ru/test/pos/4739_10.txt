If you want to see real evidence that a misguided and uncontrollable government can do for "unpopular" people, this film provides this. Read what some people say about the “Act of the Patriot”, adopted after September 11, and then watch this movie. Is it worth it? Do we really want to give our freedoms to these people? No matter what you see on TV, you will not be fully informed until you watch this movie. I apologize for citing another reviewer, but this needs to be repeated: Roger Ebert of Siskel & Ebert said: “What is interesting, if you are looking for people who are unbalanced fanatics ... you will not find them among the Davidian Branches, you will find them among the FBI and Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; I think that it is in this film that people deserve to be feared. ” I think that every person responsible for 9/11 should be brought to justice, but I think the government has not shown a history of respecting its duty to protect the rights of people, and this film proves this in a dramatic way.
