Anyone who has seen the trailer for this film will be forgiven for thinking that this film is a comedy. In fact, this is a carefree, though not too funny, hype about a pair of robbers. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of mistakes in the film. The script and plot are weak, and the love aspect of the story is strangely boring. Nevertheless, in spite of all this, this is quite pleasant, thanks in large part to the two moderators, Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee to Miller. Itâ€™s always a pleasure to watch these two beautiful actors, in particular Carlisle, and here there is good chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Directed by Jake Scott - the next generation of the family, whose brothers, Ridley and Tony, have given us films such as Alien, Blade Runner, True Romance and most recently GI Jane and the Enemy of the State. His debut is directed with the energy and enthusiasm that keeps the film flashing, although without the strong cast that he put together, the results might not have worked either. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for an easy, pleasant film to spend an hour and a half, then you could have done a lot worse than Plunkett and Macklin. If, on the other hand, you like something elusive, historically accurate and thought-provoking, go somewhere else. 7/10.
