Engagement Rules is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It is well designed, superbly connected together and provides excellent frames to confirm the allegations it takes. The best quality of the film lies in the fact that it is not based on sympathy for the dividends, but on the fact that it illuminates the audience with glaring government mistakes and lies that surrounded the whole situation. I still have anxiety and extreme anger about how the government dealt with this, and then hid a tragedy of this magnitude. Cover is what left me furious. It’s one thing to err in the operation and admit one’s guilt, and another to look the American people straight in the eye and lie to them. I think this should not surprise me with the story of our beloved country, which saw the Kennedy assassination, the Vietnam War, and other important events that smell so bad in cover that you have to hold your nose every time you drive through Washington, DC. Snapshots from an aircraft with a special technology for determining temperature and opening on some bodies clearly show that the FBI is deceiving the public. One of the things I try to know about when watching such a documentary is that I usually get testimony from only one point of view. But again, this is, without a doubt, one of the brilliant successes of the Rules of Interaction. He presents his evidence in such a final way that, even if you were presented with FBI statements, how could you really believe them. I remember well when the confrontation took place, how the media presented dividends as a crazy group of cult insurgents with David Koresh, self-proclaimed by the resurrected Jesus Christ, as his leader. None of this was truly factual, but rather a story based on bits of fact. They simply defended their rights to bear arms and practice their religion as American citizens. If you were an ATF and wanted to search the complex, he attacked the building with a group of people armed with guns and bulletproof, is the way to do this appropriate? If you are from the FBI, why enter into a psychological war and offer little real negotiations to help resolve the situation? Why pour gallons of harmful gas if you want to save children? Why open large holes in the composite structure when you know that you can kindle a fire? Why lie about the fact that the weapon does not shoot when it can be clearly shown on the video? If not. Unless you wanted the situation to end as it was. The scene at the end, when the flag of the Star of David Dividians tore the flagpole into the fire, and shortly thereafter the ATO was raised, there was an emotional climate scene in which my head sickened and my stomach turned uncontrollably. Director William Gazecki deserves one of my highest congratulations. To create such a film, you need a lot of courage, and I am sure that the government had many consequences for it. Because of people like him, the public can be shown the real truth, and not nonsense, which is filtered through the media, which provide information that can hardly be considered genuine. When I recall what I felt at the time with respect to the dividers because of the media presence of David Koresh and what I felt after watching this film, it is truly amazing. It reminds me of a line from the Bible about a man who was healed by Jesus and asked the elders how it happened “before I became blind, but now I can see,” he continued to tell them. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You may have to look for it, but it is really something special.
