I saw this film on TV in the UK about 25 years ago, and since then it has found an echo in me. My interest was recently revived when I visited Hilton Head, the next island after Yamakrou (actually Daufuski) and read Pat Conroyâ€™s beautiful Water Wide. Having gained knowledge, I overestimated Conrack and consider it a masterpiece. John Voight reflects the spirit of Conroy, and the atmosphere of the film enlivens the book with some accuracy - a Hollywood rarity. <br /> <br /> In this story, three things still strike me: 1. The problems of educating the poor and civil rights and participation in them remain unchanged. 2. Education is more than reading and writing. 3 .. These children were my peers, I was 6 years old in 1969, when Pat Conroy spent his year in Dowfuski. <br /> <br /> Why is it not yet on DVD?
