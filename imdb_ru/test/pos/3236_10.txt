VHS - I watched it again and again and loved every minute so much that now I ordered a DVD, which only wanted the film to last longer. I never worry about what other people think, that I prefer to form my own opinion and completely disagree with negative comments, and I will not allow others to spoil my enjoyment of the film. Make up your mind and don't let others push you away! I have all the BBC Jane Austen series, but this is my favorite. I see that there will be a new Northanger Abbey, released in 2007, which I will buy when it is released, but this will not stop me from viewing Northanger Abbey, released in the 80s.
