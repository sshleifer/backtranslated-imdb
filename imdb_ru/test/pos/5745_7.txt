Seeing this film, I did not expect much. I was delightfully surprised. Although the writing was unpolished, as some dialogues seemed drawn out and contrived, the script had bright moments. (My favorite line is: “Life is like rich meringues, and I have diabetes, so I can't enjoy it ...”). The plot was new and refreshing, unlike some newer “horrors that most of us ( unfortunately) are used. I really believe that some scenes could (should) be longer (and maybe some shorter). The overuse of blood was obscene, but it seemed to make sense at the end ... Ah, the end. The end would be a little better if they explained why what happened, happened. (I don’t want to spoil it.) It might also add to the time of the film, which is in the area "it's only an hour, how good can it be?" The answer is pretty good.
