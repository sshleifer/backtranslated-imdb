The murders in the Opera are not real murders, as they are symbols of past events and are parts of Betty's own fragmented personality. In fact, Betty is the same person (man) as Susie Bannion in Suspiria, just ten years later (Susie was a ten-year-old boy who made friends with another ten-year-old boy with a softer version of her past). br /> <br /> It helps to think of Betty’s luxury apartment as a military barrack; She seems to spend most of her time in her bedroom in bed next to her stereo, and other parts of her apartment are somehow alien to her, as if other people live in these other rooms. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento movies are synchronized with a wide range of rock music, as well as with funk (Dario starts synchronization at the very beginning of his films, with a flash of an eye in Opera and the beginning of drumming in Suspiria). There are also standard movies with which Opera (and Suspiria) syncs. For example, Opera syncs with Judas Priest's recorded album Priest ... Live (like Suspiria), and Suspiria syncs very well with Kiss's recording album Kiss Alive II. Films such as Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, The Image, and The Vampire's Origin are synchronized films that Argento uses and are dedicated to the same subjects as Argento’s films. These coincidences, along with many others, show that Betty is a man who has been sexually tortured at the hands of her father since birth (even in the womb, according to a certain Anne Rice novel called Lasher). <br /> <br /> In any case, Big Budget Movies are occult works that transmit spy information collected by occult means, all in a synchronized, symbolic / alchemical way. Usually, the synchronization point in the film is the beginning of the soundtrack, or it is the first image of the film that goes beyond any leadership of the film company. Sometimes it's more creative. Heavy metal music used in Opera and Phenomena is simply musical syncs that were deciphered from other films with which Argento movies are synced, a kind of intellectual game among the industry's elite. <br /> <br /> So Betty did not respond normally to the murders she witnessed, because she had never witnessed the murder of any real person. “She herself” simply suffers from the killing of the soul; she witnesses her own "murder"; the father of this man almost dropped him in an abandoned mine in Arizona at 4 years old, in 1970; he was on the verge of falling from a wooden board on which his father was balancing, before dad changed his mind, grabbed him and pulled him back; the child did not consciously feel anything. Memories of sexual torture are lost for this person due to extreme sexual repression, and the remaining vague memories of a large square deep pit in the desert have no meaning for this memory due to the lack of conscious trauma ("Loss of Injury", also "buried trait ”, Depicted in the 1975 film entitled“ Image. ”These sausages in the attic in Suspiria are separate memories of the first three or so years of life (Toys in the attic). <br /> <br /> The reason Betty (or Suzy) - female Persian click, lies in the fact that the individual mirrors of Christina Marsillah’s characters are a man who was accustomed to being female since birth (all DVDs of the Simpsons cartoon are synchronized with Suspiria), and its very nature was shaped along the lines of the “queen” synchronized with Opera.) It even changed his body to be "beautiful" like a woman. Behavior changes genetics. In a more recent film called "Proof of Death" tells about the same ideas and about the same person. <br /> <br /> Virtually the entire life of this person is reflected in large budget films, albums and books created since 1966, and the father. until 1966 and after. The Scorpions album, titled Virgin Killer, is Suspiria's synchronization album, the original album cover acts as a symbolic mirror image of a fall through the light.
