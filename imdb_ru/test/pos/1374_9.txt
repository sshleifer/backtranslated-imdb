Got it the other day from Creators on DVD. I saw it in a free magazine, while the family stayed at the hotel, never heard anything about it. After reading it was shot on the beach Balmedi, I just needed to buy it. When I lived in Aberdeen, I drove children all the time to the dunes in the film. <br /> <br /> First of all, I'm not a big fan of fiction (except for Star Wars), which I really wanted to see. what they did with this movie location i was currently surprised. It was not a standard science fiction project, rather a mixture of science fiction and the horrors of survival. <br /> <br /> A good storyline, different from others, had excellent budget effects. that it was produced from Â£ 8,000. Acting was better than the average for a low-budget film. The way they edited the entire coastline to create the feeling that the dry desert planet they are on was good. <br /> <br /> The weapon in the film was realistic, and the creatures were cool, like a predator in stealth mode. <br /> <br /> In general, I will buy any future releases from these guys, maybe the next horror (Hint Hint). The additions to the DVD were very informative, giving a presentation to the producers; I would like some of them to be included in the next DVD release as additions. <br /> <br /> Great job, keep up the good work.
