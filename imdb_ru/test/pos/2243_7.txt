Starting from where he left off, Doctor Who, Rose, her alternate dad, Mickey, his alternate colleague Ricky, and a small gang of rebel Mickey are at the mercy of this reality version of Cybermen, this second part of Cyberman's 2-episode arc more like the episode "Doctor Who", unlike the previous part, which, frankly, resembled the episode of the nonexistent show "Sliders", which in itself was a great show. The arc as a whole was pleasant enough, since I am alone to subscribe to the principle of “ANY who is good, who”, but at the same time it is inevitable that this will be compared with the “Far off” episode in the previous series. And said that comparisons will only make it seem less work like this. I just feel that this story could be made in one episode. Remember, in the first part of the review I said that such stories about alternative realities usually do not have lasting consequences, but this is not the point, but what changes are generally felt and do not quite correspond to the character. <Br /> <br /> My rating: C +
