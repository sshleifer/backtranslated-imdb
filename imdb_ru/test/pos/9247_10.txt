All the trials and tribulations of creating an off-budget film directly from the lips of the participants. You feel like all the sweat, courage, determination, and dedication Stey put into this work of love and disappointment that they are left to hang after all his work. Video clips of interviews with all involved provide an excellent flowing story and convey an incredible, hardcore punk, almost anarchic attitude to the film "Waldo", and then a documentary. Stuie and company deserve all the requisites in the world for not giving up when things were going hard and releasing “The Texas Story of Betrayal” so that we can see what it is for a novice director on the street!
