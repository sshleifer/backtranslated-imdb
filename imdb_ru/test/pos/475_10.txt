It is difficult for me to put into words how wonderful it was. From time to time you see a movie that just sticks to you. "You're alone" is a movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. I mentally replay the scenes every day, analyze them and relive emotions again, as if seeing them for the first time. <br /> <br /> There’s nothing in the movie that I don’t like. Amazing soundtrack !!! The ending was perfect. Very emotionally exciting !!! It was exciting and exciting. <br /> <br /> I adored Jessica Bol, and her performance was the best I've ever seen. I admired the power of Brittany (what a strong woman). <br /> <br /> Slogan "When your darkest moments come to life." We never know what we are capable of. Everyone says, “Oh, I would never do that, although in reality we have no idea what we will do in this situation.” We are very capable of anything, and this film goes deep into this subject. Honesty in the film can be my favorite part. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Gorman Beherd, for the perfect work of art !!!!
