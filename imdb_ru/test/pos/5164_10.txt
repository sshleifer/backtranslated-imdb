Swedish film director Roy Andersson’s latest film “You Living” is not so easy to watch. One of the reasons is that, in his own words, he broke with the Anglo-Saxon tradition of story-telling, in essence with the pattern of most western film production. Another reason may be that, although Roy Andersson is a little passionate about characters, his, unlike, say, Andrei Tarkovsky, is more elusive. It took him 3 years to complete this 86-minute film, and not because he was forced to take long breaks between filming because of financial problems or problems with the actors. The film consists of 57 vignettes, shot mostly with a fixed camera, and the elaborate design of each of these scenes took a lot of time. The images of this film, which are closely related to the previous film by the director Songs from the Second Floor, are of paramount importance for the story, so this story is largely told by the environment and the environment in which the characters of Andersson's universe live. and interact. Before each scene was finally filmed, there would be at least 10 different test shots with different actors, colors, dialogues, etc. The result was a fabulous version of the surrounding world, which most of us would recognize, and if the settings are similar to dream, why not dream a little? Just as in Bunuel’s “Unnoticed Charm of the Bourgeoisie,” when someone says, “I had a dream last night,” you can watch it. But again, what is perceived as reality here is not much different from dreams. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that there is no plot in the film in the traditional sense of the word, and there are no protagonists in it. Thus, different characters that appear and appear in different scenes are still encountered, and their stories are inevitably intertwined. What these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness, despite the fact that they are surrounded by other people. A trailer that catches trash, smokes and drunk a woman who dreams of having a motorcycle so that she can get away from "all this shit", her fat and mostly silent guy and his fragile and seemingly gentle but rather scattered mother, members of the brass The orchestra, whose skills to improve skills at home do not receive a favorable reception either from their families or from their neighbors, a depressed hairdresser in the Middle East and his arrogant client on the way to a “very important business meeting,” an elderly person who has nightmares about bombing kah in the sky, about a young girl who dreams of marrying a young rock star, in that it is so madly in love. It's all about dreams and nightmares, not about reality, but it works just like a statement in support of the claims of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein that "all human intercourse is a misunderstanding." People talk to each other, but they seem to speak one after another. They try to reach out to others, but do not let others in when they try to contact them. <br /> <br /> You, the Living is a poetic film that is physically filmed in Stockholm, but at the same time applicable everywhere. The society that it represents is Sweden, its artistic language and people, as a rule, unmistakably Scandinavian. Nevertheless, the subject in which he is engaged, namely, the suffering of mankind in the selfish world, goes far beyond this hemisphere. Despite the seriousness of his theme, the film itself seems much more fun and filled with humor than might have been expected. But, according to the director himself, “life is so complicated for each of us that the only thing that saves us is a sense of humor.” Consequently, this film is a tragic comedy or comic tragedy, depending on your sensitivity, and not a depressing black reality tour of human nature. It is unusual in its language and structure, but if you can think outside the box and enjoy it, you will definitely find this film both interesting and meaningful. This was shown at the Cannes Film Festival this year as part of the Un Certain Regard program, which offers “original and different works” out of competition. After the film was shown at Salle Debussy, 1000 viewers gave him a standing ovation for a few minutes. I need to say more?
