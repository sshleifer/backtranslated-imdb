It was Libby, talking to Desmond in memories, and if someone got confused in her past (for example, as she ended up in the same hospital where Hurley was), then you should know that the despised Libby dies in the second season will be studied more in the third season, and we will get answers to the questions surrounding her. <br /> <br /> By the way, a great episode. He had a really great climber and some interesting questions ... for example, what happened to Eco and Locke and how about a statue with four fingers? <br /> <br /> I can't wait for season 3, Lost, just rules !!! I hope that all unanswered questions will be answered. I liked how they explained why the plane really crashed. Desmond did this when he failed to dial the numbers on time. 4 8 15 16 23 42
