I stumbled upon this movie. I traveled a few years ago, and this film was on one of the TV channels in the hotel late at night. Nothing else, and I thought I was watching this for 20-30 minutes, until I decided to go to bed. Needless to say, I did not sleep and watched the entire movie. The plot was very interesting and makes you wonder if there was an SS, who did it or even thought to do it. I was looking for this whole movie. I even e-mailed a production company, but I wasn't sure that it would ever get on DVD, but I said that there was always hope. If someone finds this film, write here where you found it, since I would definitely like to get a copy someday.
