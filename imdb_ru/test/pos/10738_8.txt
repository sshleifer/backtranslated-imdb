After a decade of turbulence, American films began to shift gears and turn their cameras from war-torn battlefields, political corruption and general social unrest to a more intimate world of family dysfunction. The selfish baby boomers began to take on the American family, when they grew up and had their own children, they felt. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs. Kramer is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that would continue to be so popular during the 1980s, and it is one of the best. Now this is a rather awkward rap, because it is known as the movie that beat Apocalypse Now in 1979 for the Best Picture Academy award, but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana with pickled chicken breast: they are not the same but can't we enjoy them both? Director / screenwriter Robert Benton does not try to do something unusual in his film; his strength lies in his actions, in particular in the speeches of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, playing a divorced couple who are childly and selfishly fighting for their son. The scene in the courtroom, in which they take her into custody, and in which everyone is forced to hurt another in a terrible way, is destructive and seems genuine. In the film, the hero Hoffman is not depicted in the role of the hero, and the mother of the Strip is not in the role of the villain. They are not good and not bad people - just bad in marriage. <br /> <br /> In the final, the film is jerky, but not manipulating. He earns his right to sob. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
