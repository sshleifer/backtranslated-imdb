I don't have a really solid thesis here, so I'm just going to drop some observations. <br /> <br /> First, the movie is absolutely gorgeous. It is shot in a high-contrast black-and-white image, and some scenes are so well-composed that they almost distract. <br /> <br /> At the very beginning there were episodes of intense protests, and some shots were stunning. - three guys are launching tear gas from the protesters, etc. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think that one of the most significant signs that this is a recent 60s film is the idealism of revolution turned into something else. Taking on this shift is really interesting - I think that the political phase of things, the artistic phase, and the more self-deprecating phase have their own strengths and weaknesses. The film does not necessarily take the position that everything fell apart. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, I think the novel works very well. <br /> <br /> Finally, I really, really, really hated the final, It was too melodramatic. You can even say that the ending is unworthy of the previous film.
