The Dakota incident is a curiosity for several reasons. From the very beginning it will be obvious that this was done long before anyone thought about political correctness. Although the character of Ward Bond softens the urgency of the dialogue, "perhaps we can communicate with them, because they are people too." His part stands side by side with the preacher, trying to communicate with the Martians in the war of the worlds. Actually, it is strange. The name is also curious. The use of the word "Incident" contributes to the significance and sophistication of the film, which probably did not damage the boxoffice. The invented range of characters and fashionable dresses and Linda Darnell's hat are wonderful dated strokes that make the Dakota Incident a cool western mid-fifties artifact.
