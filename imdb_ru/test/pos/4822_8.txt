This has nothing to do with Virtual Encounters 1, so in fact this is not a continuation. These two videos simply share a common concept of people imitating sex through a virtual reality machine. So, if you were really amazed by the story and dialogue in VC 1 (yes, that's right) and expect to continue in VC 2, just be careful. All the actors and actresses are new, but they have the same excellent director, Sybil Richards. <br /> <br /> But, as in VC 1, you get a lot of beautiful women and a lot of great sex scenes that go beyond the soft core as far as possible. <br /> <br /> If you have VC 1 and you like it, you will like VC 2. If you donâ€™t have it, but you like really good softcore sex, get both.
