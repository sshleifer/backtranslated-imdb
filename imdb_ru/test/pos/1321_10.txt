Movies are what you see on Saturday night and forgotten by Sunday morning. Movies are works of art that stay with you forever. Mishima falls into the latter category. This is the type of things that Oscar should get, a brilliant, visual piece of the film that simultaneously depresses and raises the spirits. Instead of looking directly at the life of Yukio Mishima, director Paul Schrader intertwines three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his last and last day on Earth, the day when he tried to lead the Japanese armed forces to revolt in the name of the emperor. Otherwise, he commits a ritual suicide in the final, which hits you like a ton of bricks. Three short stories of adaptation allow you to look at what led him to this, and are presented in an experimental form, which makes them seem to be filmed of stage plays. Ken Ogata is great as Misima. Despite his eccentricity, he looks very sympathetic, a man who is quite ready to die for his beliefs and does. This makes the ending much more destructive, and the sense of loss more significant. Of the three adaptations of history, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, the House of Kyoko and the Running Horses, this is the last one that is the strongest and most emotional. This is also the story that most closely matches the mood of Mishima in his last years and illustrates what really led him to the events of November 1970. This review cannot be complete without mentioning Philip Glass's astounding musical score. Since 2001, the film has not become such a great addition to its visual effects. Paul Schrader has created one of the most beautiful films of the 1980s or any other decade for that matter. Keep scarves ready, because the end will leave you in tears. Mishima: Living in four chapters reminds you that sometimes a film can still be an art form, and as art it is brilliant.
