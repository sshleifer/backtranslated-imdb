Contrary to the fact that many may believe that this film is a “against the system” film and its relationship. This is an excellent image of the “system” in question, and how ridiculous it really is. The funny parts in the film are actually funny, because they tell the truth about the world around us. Anyone who finds this film unreal simply denies the obvious truths about life. And this is to find out what you like. This is what college should be. <br /> <br /> I came to the conclusion that the comment must contain at least 10 lines. I think I gave my opinion on this issue. So now I am writing a couple more lines as a filler. I hope you have been entertained during this time. I urge you to go watch a movie. It's worth it if you follow her and dive into the movie.
