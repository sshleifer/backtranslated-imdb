Admittedly, Alex has become a bit podgey, but they are still (for me) the biggest rock trio ever. I sincerely recommend this DVD to any fan. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed that they canceled the planned Munich concert (logistics), and I regret that I did not try to see them elsewhere. DVD - small consolation - the biggest incentive to get the right set-up of DVD playback. <br /> <br /> Perhaps naively, but I still do not understand the meaning of the dryers on the stage; I would appreciate any clarification. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Ian.
