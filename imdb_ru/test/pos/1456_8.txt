“The Man with the Golden Hand” was one of three great films about drug addiction of the time. The other two were "Monkey on the back" and "Hat of the rain." But I think of three of them, this one is the best. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if Otto Preminger were shooting this thing in real Chicago instead of those obvious studio shots, the film could have been even better. Who knows, maybe Preminger could not get enough money to pay for the place. This is the only flaw I discovered in the film. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is a card merchant addicted to heroin who was arrested for covering his boss, Robert Strauss, during a raid. He took the medicine while in prison and wants a new life as a jazz drummer. But many people are conspiring against him. <br /> <br /> First Bob Strauss, who wants him to deal again, especially because there are a couple of heavyweights in the city. He uses several behind-the-scenes methods to return Sinatra services. Secondly, Darren McGavin is a local drug dealer who wants Sinatra to be good and hook on him again. And finally, Eleanor Parker, his tenacious wife, who is working on a fraudulent game to defeat everyone, just to keep him close. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was nominated for the best male role in this film, but lost to Ernest Borgnine in Marty. Sinatra might have won for this if he had not won in “From Here To Eternity” in the “Supporting Actor” category a few years ago, and that Marty was such a famous film this year. His scenes going through the shootout, locked in Kim Novak’s apartment, will leave you shocked. <br /> <br /> Eleonora Parker is not getting enough credit for her role. She is really a crazy schemer who wants Sinatra to be attached to her, regardless of her value. If she had not been nominated for the Interrupted Tune that year, she could have been nominated for that. 1955 was the culmination of her career. <br /> <br /> Darren McGavin received his first real notice as a very snake drug dealer. His performance is guaranteed to make you crawl. <br /> <br /> Elmer Bernstein contributed a great jazz score to highlight the common dirt of the gloomy Chicago area in which the characters live. Not a place that you would like to raise your family.
