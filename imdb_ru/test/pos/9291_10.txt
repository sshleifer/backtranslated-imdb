When you think about the brilliant Australian comedy, you don’t think about skit shows (although I’m rather partial to the full front of the 80s and 90s) or even Sitcoms - you think about SATIRE! What we Australians really do well. (For example: "Frontline", the program "Micallef"). We know how to take pi $$, and “War of the Hunters for All” is a classic example of how to do this, and how to do it really well. <br /> <br /> I have long been a big fan of Chris Taylor and Craig Roykassel. I remember listening to them at Triple J. Day Show. They were and remain the two most funny comedians around. <br /> <br /> Although I was sad when they left Triple J, I was excited to find out what they were investing in so much time, which made them leave. (They did CNNNN and Triple J at the same time, so I thought it was much more) And what an amazingly fun Chaser show. Cool political and social satire at its best. <br /> <br /> I am also pleased to announce that he recently received MUCH better time intervals than Friday nights, and was postponed to Wednesday nights immediately after Peaks and Patches. THANKS ABC! Finally I should not tape it! :)
