The Napoleon film shown this morning for the press at the Rome Film Festival is easy to fall in love with. First of all, he can count on large production figures, as there are currently very few Italian films with excellent settings and costumes. The cast is great too. Director Virzi constantly speaks of the young presenter Elio Germano as “the young De Niro”. Now, of course, he goes too far, but I am sure that the boy can act. I liked his performance, and he did an excellent (Tuscan) accent. Daniel Othey is a great actor and has performed very well in the role of Bonaparte. It's really great to see him play in Italian, I hope to see him work in Italy again very soon. The supporting cast also worked well - people like Valerio Mastrandrea or Sabrina Impactirator may seem unlikely, but they all gave excellent results. Even Massimo Ceccherini, best known for being filmed in his moronic films and dirty television reality shows, was a good fit and was really fun. The low point of the cast is “Diva” Monica Bellucci. Of course, she was a little better than usual, but she managed to look (and sound) completely unnatural, even in the part of Baroness Emilia, in which, with a large amount of self-irony, she used her own umbrella accent. The script, written by veteran Furio Scarpelli and Virzi himself, is very clever, with lots of loud laughter and a few very emotional moments. Of course, the finale left me puzzled. This message is somewhat ambiguous: the whole film suggests that political ideals can lead you to blind hatred, but if you come closer, you will realize that the object of your hatred, after all, is a little man, like everyone else, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes miserable, so suddenly he is hard to hate; then in the last few minutes, he says that in the end it would be better to shoot him in the head. Personally, I really do not like this concept. “Io e Napoleone” is still a pleasant film, the best one presented at the Festival (the second is “Fur” and “Hoax”). My rating is 8/10
