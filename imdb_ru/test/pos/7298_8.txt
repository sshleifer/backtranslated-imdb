Alright ... so I am browsing my mom and dad's extensive DVD collection (mainly because they don’t charge late fees ;-)), and I’m faced with “A Thousand Acres”. I was stunned by the fact that there was a film in which Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer (with a small appearance of Jennifer Jason Lee), which I did not see, were shot. I don't think I've ever heard of this before. Well, this is exactly the find I dream of, because I have to admit that my parents brought up two movie lovers in my brother and in me. With a few exceptions (none of us can make them think about watching the Lord of the Rings films, but my dad loves the Matrix trilogy - GO FIGURE), we have very similar tastes in the movies. <br /> <br /> Today was a particularly awful day, depending on the weather. It rained all day, so I starred in this film and soon after I was hypnotized. <br /> <br /> This should be one of the best "sleeping" in all the time I've seen. Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are great in their roles, especially because they play completely different types. Jessica Lange's character is a pleasant person who, despite the fact that she is the oldest child in the family, rarely plays a leading role. Rather, she bows to her father (Jason Robards) and sister Rose (Pfeiffer) and is obsessed with teaching her younger sister Caroline (Lee) how to follow her example. Michelle Pfeiffer plays a very strong-willed cancer survivor who barely keeps anger from a miserable life. Notice, this film is five years before White Oleander, so it was definitely inspiring to see her play such a strong, evil character. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this film is likely to appeal to women more. However, true film lovers who like the movie for what it is, regardless of the genre or target audience, will find it difficult to deny the charm of this touching drama about family secrets and what people and those who love them do. I don’t know how I missed watching this movie so far, but it was undoubtedly a good distraction on a rainy day. ENJOY!!
