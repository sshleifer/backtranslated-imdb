And it says a lot. Rent it if you want to be overwhelmed by the oddity of one of the strangest scenarios, directing and casting in film history. I'm shocked. I can not believe that I watched it. I am usually a big fan of Bernadette Peters, but that tested my determination. Do not read more reviews here, it is better if you do not know anything about the plot. Just rent it. You will not believe what you see .......
