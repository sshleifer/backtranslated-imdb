This two-character drama is very well played, it has a real message and several shocking moments TRULY (shocking not because they are graphic, but because you are not ready for them when they come) But in the end it becomes depressing, as in somewhat similar to Pure Formality. However, Alan Rickman should have received an Oscar nomination for his multidimensional performance, no doubt about it. (** 1/2)
