Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to conceal a crime, despite the betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is not cruel Othello, in the setting of modern England. So, gradually the network of deception begins to intertwine. And we observe cycles of jealousy and drunkenness, guilt and fornication. And so the network of "separate lies" begins to break down, and then stick together again. And life (and death) continues, despite the bright flame of her husbandâ€™s love and deep despair and guilt, woven into many lives. How many hoaxes should be shown in this growing tapestry? The impulse is to maintain reputation, career and relationships in this most civilized corner of the world. Wilkinson gives an emotional presentation, full of grace, prudence and decency, and at the same time the humanity of those who have something to hide. Those who want clarity and openness on the path to justice will be disappointed by the malice of such deception. And yet, which of us cannot hide something like this in our loved ones? However, the viewer may wonder if the network will ever fall apart.
