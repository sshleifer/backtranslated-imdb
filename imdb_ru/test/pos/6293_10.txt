One of our favorites for the whole family. When we need a laugh ... we just insert it and laugh, as if this is the first time we saw it. This movie has a good, clean family humor. Paulie Shore is great! With no plans for Thanksgiving, Crow (Shore) is invited to spend a vacation with a conservative student Becca. Kroll, being the guy from the big city, must adapt to life on the farm if he wants to fall in love with Becca. But Kroll is not the only one who learns new things. Kroll teaches Becca and her parents how to be more open in their feelings and accept others. It is fun for viewers of all ages.
