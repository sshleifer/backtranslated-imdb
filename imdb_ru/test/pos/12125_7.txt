Of all the mafia films I've ever seen, this is one of the best for many reasons. Operating from Sands, Cortese and Vincent. The story is one of the best (in the mafia genre), because it is realistic. Characters are people with whom many other people can communicate. This film is also good, as it is a good dialogue. There are also very realistic fights and battle scenes. This film also marked the beginning of the career of Sands and Vincent. If not for the success of this film, the Casino and Goodfellas might not be as good as they are. <br /> <br /> History 10/10 Acts 9/10 Realism 10/10 <br /> <br /> GENERAL 10/10 <br /> My favorite movies about the mafia - <br /> 1: Goodfellas 2: Casino 3: The Godfather Trilogy 4: Family Enforcer (Death Assembler) 5: Soprano (I know this is not a movie)
