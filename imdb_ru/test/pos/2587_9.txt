Working in a cinema as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch almost every movie that comes out. When I first saw the Black Snake Motion trailer, I laughed and thought, â€œGreat. Another "Snake on the Plane," Samuel L Jackson film. But, of course, I wanted to see this as a laughter factor. Many people judged this film too quickly, based on an understatement in the title, images in advertisements, and the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the movie. Personally, I loved every second of this film. He tells the story of an elderly man and a young woman who are experiencing hard times and can communicate with each other. The story is really touching and gives a great message about life and how we live. Of course, I do not recommend this for a young audience because of some graphic material, but if you are looking for a great story and a genuine game from Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and, yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to see Black Snake Stone.
