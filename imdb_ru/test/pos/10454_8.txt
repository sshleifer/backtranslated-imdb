When I was in the 10th grade, my friend and I were late at his house, turned the cable over and started watching this movie. We watched it because it looked pretty funny and because he had boobs. But then came the end, and we just lost the power of speech. I think that after a minute of watching videos, he just whined something: "Oh, man ...". It turns from a silly 80s sex comedy to nihilistic realism so quickly that it takes you by surprise. I tried to rent this film for many years and could not find it - and no one has ever seen it, except for me and my friend - it seems so. But now it is available! I highly recommend renting it and getting ready.
