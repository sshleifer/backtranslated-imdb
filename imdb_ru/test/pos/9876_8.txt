It was a really interesting Halloween movie. I was not thrilled with Thorn's whole theory, but she still makes for a good movie. I liked going back to Tommy Doyle, but unfortunately, Donald Pleasant died immediately after the shooting. The film was really REALLY a bad director who didnâ€™t give a sensation about the show, from what I heard was a bad attitude towards Donald and did not allow Daniel Harris to return as Jamie. As if he was just trying to make a movie, but I still liked it. There were a lot of cuts and changes in music, and if you're lucky, you can get Producers Cut, which will last more than 40 minutes. never before the scene. With these scenes, it turns into a completely new film. Check it out if you have a chance.
