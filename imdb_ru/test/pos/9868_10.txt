Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is probably the best sequel of all Halloween movies. Jamie, the niece of Michael Myers, a serial killer, gave birth to a child who was then taken away by the Man in Black at the end of Halloween 5. A good nurse helps Jamie escape, but Myers quickly hunts her down and kills her. Baby Jamie was found and rescued by Tommy Doyle, one of the guys in Jamie Lee in the original film, and Myers arrives at Haddonfield and starts killing the Strod clan living in his old house. The film ends with scenes that reveal the keys to Michael’s evil, the personality of “The Man in Black” and the storyline of Dr. Loomis / Michael Myers. I highly recommend this brilliant masterpiece of horror. <br /> <br /> Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is the R rating for strong graphic violence, strong blood, short sexuality, language and short nudity.
