An amazingly thoughtful and fascinating film that leaves an imprint far beyond its original launch. Based on a true story, one of the many “small” stories before World War II that give insight into the thinking of most ordinary human cultures that are influenced by others, which are considered to be former enemies and, possibly, future enemies, with blackout military clouds on the horizon. Shown at the Stony Brook Film Festival, the film was enthusiastically accepted. Well written and expertly presented. The characters were the most believable and attracted to themselves in order to experience their trials and tribulations.
