I want to start my review by thanking the creators of this documentary, this is obviously a labor of love, and I think they did a pretty good job of creating a nice documentary about a person who had so little information about him. This definitely causes the worshipers to have a sense of worship, which is good. <br /> <br /> I heard about Bruce Haack, but I didn't know much about him, and the beginning of this documentary was disappointing because I heard other musicians talking about him, but Bruce Haack himself was too far away. I wanted to see this guy Bruce Haack !! I felt that the creators suggested that I already knew him and those musicians on the screen, which I did not know, so I felt a little left in the dark. <br /> <br /> When Bruce was finally shown in action, it was great and gave me a taste of who Bruce Haack was, but it was just a taste. We got around with a lot of musicians, and it seemed to me that they told me: “Listen, he likes all these great musicians, so he should be cool!” I wasn’t particularly worried about the musician’s comments on Bruce. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see Bruce as a person. You know, the important thing is more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. More about his life, and yes, his drug use and other issues. I would like to know a lot more about his project "Hackula". I wanted to penetrate his mind. Even if they did this with the help of some “Voice of God” commentary and photographs, everything would be fine. <br /> <br /> The animations were good, but again I felt that they were used as a filler, but in fact it’s not so anything other than what allows me to hear his music and see some images based on Dimension 5 entries. I thought it was clever and creative, but again ... I wanted to know more about Bruce! <br /> <br /> Maybe Bruce Haack was so elusive in real life? <br /> <br /> In any case - in the end, I liked this documentary, and I felt some sort of sadness that such amazing pioneers and geniuses like Mr. Haack are forgotten as a march of time marks. I'm glad this movie is going to tell people about Bruce Haack, even with his flaws.
