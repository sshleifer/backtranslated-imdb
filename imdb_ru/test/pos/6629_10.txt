Being a big fan of Bergman, I literally had to search for years to find this film (I mean, for less than $ 60), and finally bought it a few weeks ago. The main premise of the films of Bergman is the relationship between the characters and how they cope with difficult situations. So the film is the same, but different, because the setting is very different from most of the Bergman films that I have seen. <br /> <br /> It is installed in wartime, and the characters hit the middle. <br /> This is exciting from start to finish, and this proves once again that Liv Ullman is one of the best actresses of the 20th century. Must see.
