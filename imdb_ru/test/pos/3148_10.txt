I saw Reader at the Manhattan Film Festival this week. It touched my heart like a few short films have done. About ten minutes later, he tells a sharp two-character story that deeply struck me. Duncan Rogers did a great job capturing very real, tender moments on the film. What really fascinates me in this film is that the director chose the plot corresponding to the short format. These are really interesting characters, and their story is told at the perfect time. This is not a small feat. Have we not seen shorts, which are simply long stories, compressed in accordance with the format, or stage stories that were not properly adapted to the screen? I applaud Reader for doing the right thing, and I urge anyone interested in movies and story telling to look at it seriously. Worth every moment!
