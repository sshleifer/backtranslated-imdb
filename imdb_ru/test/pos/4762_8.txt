I love the other reviews of this film. They reflect my attitude. I'm a 70s guy, except for the disco and childhood Star Wars. There was nothing good about this movie except the chase scene. That is why it was good, because it was tough, thorough and economical. Roy Shader filmed a film based on the 7 Ups film crew, in which Gene Hackman played the role of French Communication. People in it were believable and average, who burned themselves, pouring coffee, showed fear on the scene of persecution and almost lost it after a close collision. <br /> <br /> Maybe it would be easier to tell you what he missed. There were no fancy weapons, only basic revolvers and rough sawn-off guns. There was no tough guy who philosophized, ala Tarantino. There was no kung fu, no samurai nonsense, no fancy shooting. There was not a smart guy who would perform some complex scheme based on hundreds of things going the way he planned, including the reaction of everyone else. The criminals were bad guys, but damn, they didn't shoot at people. In fact, there were only three people. something that the average movie these days would pass in the opening credits. This could be movie G today! Not a single orphans bus was loaded, and the terrorists did not threaten to kill half of the city. There were no high-tech jokes, and the crimes themselves were not very touching or brilliant. The highest technology I've ever seen was an ATT touch-tone wall-mounted telephone. He had no plots or funny characters. In addition, neither sex nor women, except for the wife of a gangster who screamed when Buddy, our hero, threatened her. <br /> <br /> It was some little undertaker who used his connections with the local mob and the police to kidnap the local thugs for some easy payouts. Undertakers. Vito was played by Tony Lo Bianco, who did an excellent job, as well as Roy Schneider, Buddy, Chief of Police 7 Ups, whom he informed and exploited. What happened to Tony Lo Bianco, he looked like a shoe Pacino, beautiful and talented? What he had was a great backdrop of New York for a simple criminal story. Places that were gloomy and inhuman, not being a case study. He had a simple conspiracy that included this abduction scheme, when one of the police officers, Buddy, was accidentally involved, literally accidentally involved, and then accidentally shot. Since Buddy and his 7 ups are a division of hot dogs, and the New York City police leadership, and the thugs thought he was implicated, as the kidnappers disguised themselves as police in plain clothes to lure the thugs into compliance. Obviously, the gangsters believed that they had lawyers and the rights to protect them from ordinary police. Even the gangsters were simple, old and ugly, there was no godfather or soprano here. <br /> <br /> This is a good base film with an outstanding chase scene between two Pontiacs of the 70s. Even the cars were simple and economical, not even the GTO or Trans Am, like acting and story. In times of doomsday scenarios, “Batman” or “24” intensity levels, this film reminds us that the lower the better. Script writers and filmmakers should show this as a warning so as not to blind, not entertain, and ultimately insult us with tricks, gadgets and an abundance of clown's psychotic behavior.
