In the modern world of advertising and teenage horror and sensations, it is very rare to see a movie, and there’s nothing about it. Films such as Psycho and Blair Witch, being magnificent in a tense state (both with excellent buildings), are tainted by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them. With Mute Witness, a rare treat, I stumbled upon this film and watched it, scared to madness, in the middle of the night. I was frightened by the threatening Russian atmosphere, the theme of “snuff” and the difficult position of the dumb and claustrophobic, and the fact that (funny, which always lead to pleasant) characters can meet the end at any second. Since this is a low-budget and rare film, we watch it without any expectations. In addition, Fay Ripley will play a rare role in the film: watch and get ready to be agitated, frightened and agitated in completely unexpected ways.
