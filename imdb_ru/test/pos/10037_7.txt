This film is good for entertainment purposes, but historically unreliable. If you are looking for a movie and think about yourself: “Oh, I want to know more about Custer’s life and his last position”, do not rent “They died in boots”. But if you want to watch a movie to enjoy an older western movie, with a bit of romance and just for a good story, this is a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The story begins on the first day of Custer (Errol Flynn) at West Point. Everyone loves his charming personality, which allows him to get away with almost everything. The film tells about his career at West Point and his many battles, including the battle in the civil war. The film ends with his latest stand at Little Big Horn. Between the scenes of battles, he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland). <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn portrays the arrogant but well-forgiving George Armstrong Custer. Olivia De Havilland is very good at playing sweet, sweet Libby, especially in the flirting scene where Custer and Libby meet for the first time. Their chemistry on the screen made you believe in their romance. The game as a whole was impressive, especially the comedy role (albeit stereotypical) of Callie performed by Hattie McDaniel. Her character will definitely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Heroic war music caused the excitement of battle scenes. Beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. The script, at times, was commonplace, although it was even more pleasant to watch the movie. The directing of Caster was like a hero and the story shows that this is debatable. Some will watch this movie and see Caster as a hero. Others will watch this movie and learn to hate it. <br /> <br /> I approve of this western 1942 film.
