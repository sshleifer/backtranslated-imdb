If you plunge into the effect of the twins in search of a pure Hong Kong film, you will be disappointed. This does not mean that it is bad, but it is NOT a traditional Hong Kong action movie, similar to Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. This is decidedly stupid and youthful, so if you want a serious Hong Kong action, watch a John Woo or Euen Wu Ping movie. There is a lot of noise in this film because of his stupidity, and I thought that the first thing I had to do was explain what you were getting involved in, since he disappointed many purists. <br /> <br /> For not Purists and people with more generous taste, Twins Effect is a delightfully stupid Kung Fu comedy. I really liked it for various reasons, not least of all the beautiful female roles that foment each other in a completely entertaining comedic double act. I believe that this is the first film of this type in which they were filmed, but they jump, kick and fly like experienced professionals. <br /> <br /> A ridiculously funny plot is handled with great care and attention. and the film was written quite deliberately, making you laugh out loud at the film. Comedy is actually the most outstanding thing here, and it is a subtle, tender comedy that depends on words like inanimate objects flying in the style of Stephen Chow. I must say that farce is also very fun. The sequence with disco-dancing vampires is a complete classic. <br /> <br /> Action is a mixture of two genres. It is between the “fight of the period” and the fight with swords (which comes closer to the end) and the style of comedy fights of Jackie Chan, which is a mixture that, although sometimes a little interesting to watch, and occasionally throws up some really innovative meetings. <br /> <br /> Everything is wonderful and the film is incredibly exciting. Despite this, he has several sticking points. For example, the Twins effect is in many ways much more Westernized than you might be used to Kung Fu fans. An example is the inevitable comparison with the Blade series, although Twins Effect is, frankly, much better than Blade ever managed, especially for combat. Personally, I would be a little ashamed to see how excellent Anthony Wong (the effervescent villain from John Woo's classic cooked boil) is so underestimated, but the younger audience he is targeting is unlikely to notice it or really find out that he is boiled or his others movies, so this is really a personal fight. <br /> <br /> If you watch it with an open heart, you will probably like it as much as I do, but you must be firmly aware that this is a COMEDY, and not balls to the wall of a kung-fu movie. Keep this in mind and you'll be fine.
