As mentioned in one of my great reviews, Universal Pictures' FLASH GORDON trilogy should not be categorized with other TV shows. Indeed, three of them created a kind of celluloid-electronic mythology for the acute, military phobic world of the mid-twentieth century. They remain in the minds of many people as an example of who the rock hanger was. <br /> <br /> We can remember how Buster Krabbh was a guest on the NBC TOMORROW evening talk show, hosted by Tom Snyder. It was about 1979-80. During the interview, Mr. Crabbe was asked about his personal fitness habits. He attributed strength training and swimming, combined with some healthy dietary habits, including vitamins and protein supplements (and you believe he smoked a few cigarettes!) <br /> <br /> When asked about his career, Mr. Snyder, of course, got to the subject of his image (and strong identification) with the character Flash. Buster stated that he read and used this function on the original medium, that is, the comic, which is the property of the Syndicate of the King of Hell Hearst. He stated that he thought it would not work after the transfer to the screen! Fortunately, he was wrong. <br /> <br /> As for the 1st series, it was a very good adaptation of the original continuity from the Sunday Color Comics. The world is nearing its end due to the impending collision with Planet Mongo. An independent working doctor Zarkov must fly to a wild planet to change his course. He enlists the help of Flash and Miss Dale Arden, recently familiar parachutists from an airliner landing at Zarkov’s property. <br /> <br /> The serial series is excited and makes you feel that there is always some other danger. right beyond the movie. The costumes and decor are varied, from Romanesque to Oriental and to Art Deco. It would be easy to assume that this was due to frugality on the part of Universal, but once again it was loyalty to the creator, the visual concepts of cartoonist Alex Raymond (just look at the old bands reprinted in many collections). Rockets were formerly used simply in IMAGINE! (Fox 1930), a sci-fi musical comedy. Other scientific laboratory equipment was provided by Universal, a leading Hollywood and SciFi company. <br /> <br /> Starring Gene Rogers (Dale Arden)) and Priscilla Lawson (Princess Aura), who engages in the battle between a good girl and a bad girl because of Flash. Charles Middleton portrays Emperor Ming as a kind of over-melodramatic villain, but makes him work. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) is softened by the sheer insanity that he experienced when he appeared in newsprint. (By the way, have you ever thought about how Zar-KOV has an accent?) Richard Alexander makes a beautiful, powerfully built Prince Barin, always useful and noble. <br /> <br /> Jack “Tiny” Lipson Surprised by the cast, stealing behind the scenes like a lecher, Henry VIII, as a villain who became an ally, King Vultan, ruler of the Hawks. Among others, the most notable is Jim Pierce in the role of Prince Thun of the Lion People. Pierce, like Crabbe, also portrayed Tarzan in the film, but he later married the creator of Tarzan, daughter of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Joan. <br /> <br /> FLASH GORDON and two sequels, FLASH GORDON TRIP TO MARS (1938) and FLASH GORDON conquers the Universe (1940), were the main price for minors for generations, first in cinemas, and then in a television edition. Like good wine, they saw how they get better with age. <br /> <br /> We are all so glad that Mr. Crabb was wrong.
