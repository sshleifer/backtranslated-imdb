At one time, Buddy Cop films ran a box office. It seemed that every summer a flock of police bandits from Beverly Hills went down to the theaters of our country. No longer. Recently, Gusher has dried almost to a trickle. Recently, the drought has eased a bit with the release of Showtime, a film that is a really fun and always interesting example of the genre. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He is by no means the dirty type of Harry. He is simply an incredibly focused professional who is absolutely intolerant of everything that interferes with the performance of his duties, such as the operator T.V. Mitch communicates with the operator in a socially irresponsible way and therefore falls into the clutches of Chase Renzi, a producer looking for a killer hook for her "reality show." police show. She thinks Mitch will give her a “sharp” impulse, which should be a hit, but she feels that he may be too unpleasant to carry the whole show by himself. Enter Trey Sellars, the police actor who watched too many repetitions of the Police Story. Of course, Mitch and Trey mix with each other, like oil and water, and there are a lot of funny turmoil. <br /> <br /> We know that Mitch and Trey will definitely become best friends by the end of the film. This is how films with buddies should work. In fact, it must be said that Showtime rarely deviates from the time-tested cliches written by Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash. There is a high-tech McGuffin to make the ball roll (in this case, an automatic rifle that shoots large enough to stop tanks). There is a clever foreign villain with an accent of uncertain origin. There are chases, shootouts and explosions. We all know what is happening, and we have a fairly honest idea of ​​how this all will turn out. You know? There is nothing wrong. Yes, we know that the battered bases will be touched, but the most interesting thing here is a journey, not a destination. Showtime does not strain to be original. Instead, his energies are directed to characters and humorous situations. As a result, Showtime does a competent job with action sequences, but really shines in its comedy. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is rather dry as Mitch. I used to think that De Niro is a cold and inexpressive actor who is terribly attracted to robbery when he is called to play in a comedy. Recently, however, he grew up on me. It seems he is introducing more humanity into his roles. Eddie Murphy is cheerful as Trey. The best way to describe his performance is that Trey would be what Murphy would be if Murphy were not so talented and would not have achieved much success. René Rousseau has a very fun time in a show show with a focus on the motorized car Chase Renzi. She follows the film in pursuit of Nielson's high ratings with awe-inspiring determination. In her zeal, she renews Mitch's life to make her more comfortable for the camera. She even calls upon T.J. Hooker himself, William Shatner, to show Mitch how to be a more “authentic” policeman. Shatner is funny, plays exactly as we expect, it will be loud, forgetful and a little unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I was really looking forward to Showtime, and I was not disappointed. Ten years ago, this film would have been a guaranteed hit. Today it is at best a moderate business. This is a pity because Showtime is a lot of fun.
