Seeing other Bollywood films with Salman Khan in them, I can say that this is my favorite of the last. All the songs are pretty funny, especially “O Priya O Priya”, which seems to have a mix of Beatles, Indian music and (I dare say) a little Prince. Love stories are a bit more believable than, say, Chal Mere Bhai. Occasionally, the prime minister’s emphasis on alcohol is worrying, because it seems to me that it doesn’t make sense, but it’s Khan’s playing well - although his voice is creaky when he plays drunk
