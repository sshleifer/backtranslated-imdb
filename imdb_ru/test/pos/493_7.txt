Without being in the least familiar with the characters from the comic book series, I expected this film to simply reach the main point: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics, present the story and end with the destruction of the main opponent and, possibly, a hint at the possibility of continuation. And this is exactly what happens with this movie. <br /> <br /> However, unlike most other comic strip films, I felt that this film seemed a bit cool. At the risk of a more limited audience with strong language and graphic wrestling scenes, Blade represents a very modern, believable and gloomy world, whose little nuances have effectively managed to evoke a sense of horror in the viewer — however slight, no matter how becomes involved in the story, if it does not affect the emotional (that is, juicy) aspect. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are innumerable holes in the film and absurdly unrealistic situations, such as an ordinary female doctor, quite insightful to come up with something no one else could do in a few thousand years. But when you have the same cool enemy as in this movie, and you fight scenes with exciting and exciting camera cuts and special effects like this, what else matters? It may take a little while, but due to what he intends to do, “The Blade” stands out with dramatic relief from most other films in this genre.
