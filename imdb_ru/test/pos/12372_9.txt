Viktor Köström's Körkarlen immerses the viewer into the depths of life for most of its duration, with grim scenes of alcohol degradation, family violence and suicidal despair, but the most memorable passages include the mythical image of death itself. Here Death is embodied in a ghostly horse-drawn cart driven by an unhappy sinner who was the last person to die on the eve of the previous New Year. Within one year, the scoundrel must collect the souls of those who have just left, and after twelve months of this terrible slavery the soul of the driver is finally released when the last driver who dies on December 31 becomes the new driver. <br /> <br /> The scenes associated with this carriage (the film was known as “Phantom Carriage” or “Phantom Chariot” in English-speaking countries) are creepy and fascinating, using cinematography with double exposure, which was quite difficult for its time and still effective when seen today. The most striking thing is that the carriage goes to the bottom of the ocean to collect the soul of the drowned person. However, no matter how exciting these scenes may be, the main part of the film is devoted to the downward spiral of David Holm, played by the director himself in an understated image of a man who refused to live a decent life. In the memoirs, we see Hill enjoying a pleasant day on the beach with his wife, children, and brother, and he looks like an ordinary guy. Suddenly, without explanation or explanation, we see Hill as an alcoholic who is in trouble with the law and alienated from his family. Usually this jump from Before to After may seem to be a shortage of story-telling, but in this case the filmmakers trust us to fill in familiar, dirty parts on our own. It is assumed that Hill was bewildered by his friendly friend George, a drinking companion who first tells the story of the Phantom Carriage, but whatever the reason for his fall, Hill seems to be lost, sneaky drunk, who takes a vicious pleasure to hurt his family and give up on reform. <br /> <br /> Although David Holm is our central figure, the true catalyst of this story is the young nurse of the Salvation Army, who takes a sympathetic interest in his work and stubbornly believes in his despite his hateful behavior. When the nurse herself dies — indirectly because of her ministry on behalf of Hill — she demands to see him and, thus, inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will lead to his recovery. <br /> <br /> At times, this film resembles Dickens' story about Scrooge, which uses visionary visitors that inspire a deeply vicious person to take stock of their lives, suffer from bad behavior and reform. I was also reminded of the Terrier Vigen drama of Shstrom 1917, in which a man returns from prison to find his house empty and his family has disappeared (the sequence is repeated here). The director also repeats the standard theme of Scandinavian folklore, found earlier in his “Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru” (a.k.a. “Outlaw and His Wife”, 1918), that no one person can outstrip his fate. This time, however, it can be argued that David Holm does manage to avoid his seemingly inevitable fate, since he is given an unexpected second chance to correct the situation. <br /> <br /> Spectators awaiting immersion in the supernatural will appreciate the sequences featuring the Ghostly Moving titles, but cannot be prepared for the painful exploration of this alcoholic movie of a troubled man. But those who love intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate “Körkarlen”. It stands in one of the best serious cinemas of its era and, of course, is one of the most advanced works of Shesthrom.
