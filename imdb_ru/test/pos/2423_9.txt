*** SPOILERS *** Feeling lonely and in need of companionship, as well as in love, Francis Austin, Sandy Dennis, keeps all these emotions inside as she passes through life as a popular young single woman who has many high-class friends. But for reasons of her own deep security, she keeps them at arm's length. As for male friends, Francis, they are not so close to her age that she will have no reason for romantic communication with them. <br /> <br /> One day in the early evening, when Frances was entertaining her friends, she notices a young man, Michael Burns, sitting alone in a cold, pouring rain outside her apartment’s window. Feeling that he is homeless and alone after her friends leave her, Francis goes outside to the park and invites the young man to take shelter of her until the rain subsides, and even stays overnight in the guest bedroom she has. You can immediately see that Francis is more interested in simply protecting the young man from the cold and the rain than when she wants him to be his friend and even play toys for himself, and during the movie you see that you were are right. <br /> <br /> Sandy Dennis’s truly amazing performance, which in many ways resembles Katie Bates in an Oscar nomination in the film Misfortune, which was made in 1990, twenty-one years later. Francis thinks that the young man was lonely and homeless, and later, when she meets him, the dumb sees the ideal person for her to be a true friend. He is by no means equal to her or better than hers, like her friends, the medical doctors of Indian leaders, and, thus, depends entirely on her. It later turns out that the young man is not the lonely and homeless man, as Francis thought. This is when she slowly learns that he really does not need her the same way he manipulates her, but on the contrary, this causes Frances to have something that turns out to be coercive, suicidal. <br /> <br /> A truly strange film directed by Robert Altman, which is deeply immersed in the depths of solitude and depression of the human mind. Actress Sandy Dennis is beautiful as the personality of Dr. Jekyll and Miss Hyde in her lonely, yet at the same time dangerous Francis Austin, and it’s a pity that she not only won the Oscar for her role in the film but was not even nominated for it. <br /> <br /> Like most Robert Altman films, there are many improvisations among the actors in the film and in the dialogue between actors and improvisers, especially between the young man's sister Nina Susan Benton and her boyfriend Nick David Garfield. The only thing in the film that embarrassed me is when we see Frances going to the city clinic to undergo a complete gynecological examination, and tell the doctor that she is going to get married very soon. Was her husband supposed to remain a young man in her apartment? But apart from the fact that the film adheres very well to the story, and the final causes a real shock to both the audience and the young man. When he finally, in the end, realizes that Francis is not only slightly behind, but also insanely insane.
