Whether he is considered a gallant knight of the plains or an egoist hunter of fame, disputes about the life and military career of George Armstrong Custer continue to this day. "They died in boots", which presents some facts from the history of Custer, and he found freedom with others. <br /> <br /> He really finished his studies at the bottom of his class at West Point and got this night promotion on the battlefield. brigadier general. His record in the conduct of the Michigan regiment under his command was one of the brightest. <br /> <br /> It was also true that his marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the greatest love fights of the 19th century. Libby and George were married 12 years before Little Big Horn. Today’s public does not know that Libby lived to 1933. During this time she was the keeper of the legend of Custer. Thanks to her own iron will and strong personality, her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way. <br /> <br /> I think that Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers missed a good opportunity for Custer’s career to be told in memoirs. Olivia De Havilland was supposed to be invented as Janette MacDonald was in May, and tell the story of her husband and marriage in terms of nostalgia and memories. Even then, cracks appeared in the legend of Custer, but if it was done from Libby's point of view, they could be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> Sydney Greenstreet acted perfectly as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing to do with Custer; he was fired and replaced by George B. McClellan at the end of 1861, when Caster was still at West Point. I'm not sure they ever met. But Greenstreet well characterizes heavy and powerful Winfield Scott. The good story about the Mexican War was that they gave Greenstreet instead of its very accurate depiction of old fuss and feathers. <br /> <br /> Although the film was shot by one of the great romantic movie teams, Errol Flynn Olivia De Havilland. It was the last of eight films that they shot together. The last scene they ever made for the cameras was Libby's farewell to George, when he leaves to join his regiment for what would be his last campaign. Both of their performances, especially Olivia, were the culmination of their career at Warner Brothers. From the story we know that Custer is approaching his doom, and the fact that this was their last collaboration on the screen gives this scene a special urgency. If your eyes are not moistened, you are made of marble. <br /> <br /> Like a story, they died in their boots, leaving much to be desired. As a western adventure, which successfully combines romance and action, you can not beat this movie at all.
