It is rather surprising that this wonderful film was shot in 1949, since Hollywood at that time had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues. The film deserves strong appreciation for taking this stance, for the exceptional acting game of its mostly lesser-known cast, and for the super-intellectual script that does not offend the audience and choose the easy way when it comes to white racism. Plus, with a fairly modest film budget and quick work time, he does an amazing job! <br /> <br /> Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played minor roles in many films of that era) is a proud black man who is accused of killing a white man in the south. The crowd can really care less about the details - they are simply obsessed with hanging. And, despite his commitment to the law, one lawyer in the city, who agreed to defend him, also suggests that he is guilty and does not want to know the truth - just put off the hanging until they try to convict him, and then there is a LEGAL hanging! Fortunately, a young white man (Claude Jarmin) begins to think about Juano’s innocence and begins to search for the truth. At this moment, the best character of this wonderful drama is presented - performed by Elizabeth Patterson (the old woman who later played Mrs. Trumble in the movie I Love Lucy). She alone steals the show as a white man with not only conscience, but also the will and determination to stand up for the black man. At one point in the film, the mob tries to push past her to get to the prisoner to kill him, but she stands very firmly and forces them to retreat. There is something else in this rather complicated but reasonably written story, but I will leave it to your discretion. Look at this with your children, if you have a chance, this will open an amazing dialogue about how far racial relations have gone in the past 50 years. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, 1949 was a wonderful year in Hollywood, finally solving the problem of racial prejudice, since the film “The Twentieth Century” also produced Pinky, an equally effective and powerful film about racism , interracial marriage and even rape! Watch both films if you can.
