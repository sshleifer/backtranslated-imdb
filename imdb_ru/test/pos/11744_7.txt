Based on the 1952 autobiography “Multicolor Thing”, “Love is a Multicolor Thing” (1955) tells the story of Han Suyin, focusing on the novel that Han, the widowed Eurasian doctor in 1949 in Hong Kong, had with Married American correspondent Mark Elliott . “I don’t want to feel again again,” says Khan shortly after the meeting, but they soon develop mutual irresistibility for each other, and who can blame them? Mark plays William Holden at the peak of his reckless dude period (“next year's peak” will be the peak) in this, the first of three films in the next seven years, which Holden will find in China (1960s). The world of Suzy Wong "and" Satan never sleeps "1962 - the rest). And Dr. Khan is played here by Jennifer Jones, who, although not a Eurasian (unlike the appetizing Nancy Kwan and pretty France Nuyen from those other exotic films of Holden), does a solid job of passing as a unit. Whether wearing a cheongsam, a European dress, a surgical gown or a bathing suit (Hubb Hubb!), Jones looks ridiculously gorgeous here. No wonder that the East meets with the West so dramatically in this film! With his two attractive leading stars, breathtaking Hong Kong landscapes, beautiful CinemaScope and color, Oscar-winning costumes and this classic Oscar-winning title song, which sweeps through the film like lovely incense, Love Is a Multi-Spleded Thing turns into a pretty winning and romantic with a mixture. Han herself seemed not to care about the picture, so I can only assume that her source material took on a lot of freedoms. However, I liked it. And if the end of the film causes tears, just remember the words of Mark's wisdom: "The greatest tragedy of life is not to love."
