This film is actually one of my favorites of all time. I'm not a fan of Renny Harlin, because most of his films suck, but TLKG from time to time hits the target. TLKG talks about a woman named Samantha Cain (Davis) who suffers from amnesia. She is married to a child and, as she says, "I am a damn PTA member." and then her world collapses when the pieces break about her former identity. Samuel Jackson plays a cop cheater who gives PI concerts, he drags her along to reveal her identity and get paid for his work. along the way, we learn that Samantha is indeed Charlie Baltimore, the secret spy who was left dead many years ago. the plot is great, which makes this story real, and Jackson copes well with the role of Davis (who always does an excellent job with acting). the explosions are endless, the action intertwines with a memorable scene after a memorable scene. visually quite impressive, although the child eventually gets on my nerves (see from the cars!) I'm tired of the little children who spoil the film to save it, but, nevertheless, this film is worth how the child adds to the film, Again, this film is really good, I never understood why he didn’t earn more at the box office, but if it was a man filming a movie, I’m sure he would have collected one hundred million. What is good is that over the years, more and more people are discovering this film and give it good marks, since the average of this film on this site has grown over the years. I hope this will continue as this is one great action movie. and i love action movies
