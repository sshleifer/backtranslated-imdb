The dreadful demons "Gentlemen" capture the voice of the population of Sunnydale to steal human hearts without crying. Giles discovered that according to legend, if a lady cries, the creatures will be destroyed, but Buffy and her friends, including Riley, must fight the monsters silently. <br /> <br /> “Hush” is by far the best episode of Buffy’s fourth season to this point. Having a lot of humor and funny situations, I really liked it. Spike is cheerful, the romance between Xander and Anya is cool, but in the end I liked the "intense" dialogue between Buffy and Riley. The gothic scenario of the final battle with "Gentlemen" resembles the surroundings of the "Dark City". My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Silêncio" ("Silence")
