I remember the events of this film, the ill-fated Donald Crowhurst cruise in 1968, in the race on the yacht Golden Globe. I was 13 years old, I live in England. Last year, Francis Chichester (later Sir Francis; he was knighted for his exploits) completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe. I remember this mainly because we were given free time to watch his return (on a grainy black and white TV!), And then his knighthood was with the queen. This caused a huge outpouring of patriotic zeal in the UK. Now everything seems so strange. Chichester became a national hero, but he stopped halfway in Australia to retool his yacht, so the next logical step for yachtsmen was an attempt to travel without stopping. <br /> <br /> It is important to remember that it was a world before GPS, when land communications were still rather unstable, not to mention the middle of the ocean. Now with GPS receivers that fit into a key chain and calculate a position within a meter anywhere on the ground, it’s hard to remember a time when you could go to sea and literally disappear. How did Donald Crowhurst. <br /> <br /> Several yachtsmen (all men at the time) are registered, including the mysterious man Crowhurst. In essence, the weekend sailor, Crowhurst had no impressive success in any previous venture, including a career in the British army, air force, and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigational aids. He wanted to do something big in his life, and he saw the first prize of five thousand pounds sterling (more than 100,000 dollars in today's money) and the subsequent publicity as a means to start his business. He signed a contract with a sponsor who was more waterproof than his boat, and that meant that failure would bankrupt him, and he soon became popular among journalists when he was preparing for the race. Now, the British always like the idea that a fearless lover takes on advantages. (Think of Eddie Eagle, the loser of the endless Olympic ski jumping competition, and the amateur riders who regularly start the Grand Prix of the jumps.) The audience lined up to see how he headed, but his boat was not ready and even when he started (the last participant who left the UK), Crohurst must have known that he had no serious chance. But too much rode him to quit smoking. <br /> <br /> In the excellent archival material we see doubts written on the face of his poor wife. Left with their four children, she excitedly gives interviews throughout the film along with one of Crowhurst’s sons. She was in a hopeless situation. If she tried to stop him, she would have been considered a spoiler, but then she was angry with the doubt that she could save his life by stopping him. Faced with a certain truth, that his boat was leaking and would never pass through the southern oceans, and unable to turn around and face ridicule, bankruptcy and shame, Crohurst developed a plan of deception. Being on the shelf of Argentina and Brazil, he waited for radio communications until the leaders passed Cape Horn and returned to the Atlantic, thinking that he could penetrate the end of the line and pretend to sail across the globe. He carefully falsified his magazines and made 16mm films and audio recordings to confirm his plan. But since one by one the other competitors were leaving, he realized that in fact he would come second, and his journals would be carefully studied. Unable to meet a certain discovery, his journal suggests that he lost control of reality and eventually committed suicide. His boat was found. He never was. <br /> <br /> This beautifully edited film also tells about the journey of Bernard Mauzier, an experienced and mysterious French sailor who was in second place and was sure that he received the fastest prize for the journey when he suddenly left the race unable to cope with the noise and publicity, he knew that he would collide, and swam to the wide blue side, eventually stopping for about 10 months in Tahiti. Having spent about seven years working at sea myself (albeit on completely different ships than these), I understand the ocean craving well. Standing on the deck, seeing water in all directions to the horizon, knowing that there are a couple of miles of water under you, nothing between you and oblivion, only a thin metal case, without easy access to a TV or radio (even at present, on most working ships you feel rather isolated), you can briefly escape from the duties of everyday life. There is some thoughtful analysis of what makes people try to make such a long lonely journey and what effect it has on the human mind. Most people think that trying to raise 4 children is quite an adventure, but much depends on the need for self-disclosure in the difficulties of the sea, the search for oneself. <br /> <br /> I strongly suspect that Robin Knox Johnston, a former naval guy who won the race (and many since then), probably knew very well who he was before he set off, therefore, he excelled not only in winning the race, but also keeping his sanity on the way. Those who were looking for something deep inside themselves might not quite like what they found. <br /> <br /> Amazing archival footage of Britain from the late 60s is almost enough reason to watch it, (did it really look so bad? I don’t remember it looked so stupid, but maybe we got wet from the worst aspects of the past?) but overall, this is a superbly made and exciting movie. Highly recommended.
