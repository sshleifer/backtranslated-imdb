The plot of this film is not complicated. A very attractive young girl goes to Europe in search of the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier. There she meets with her sister's ex-boyfriend, and together they travel to all the places her sister went to, and gradually the reasons become clear. <br /> <br /> But what makes this film so special and hovers over a limited plot is a wonderful character image. Although the older sister is a hippie cast, he has noble ideals, moral standards, and incredible powers. And while the older sister, who we see in the memoirs, shares these ideals, she does not have a sense of limitation or balance in how much it is too much. And although the younger girl is very much devoted to the memory of her sister, she gradually finds the strength to recognize the fact that her sister was just a normal girl. <br /> <br /> The most special moment in the film is when a young girl and boyfriend's sisters finally stop fighting with their attraction to each other. I can't remember ever seeing a more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in making love in a movie! <br /> <br /> In all these respects, this is a really beautiful film, a film that needs to be appreciated and which can be seen again and again. 9 out of 10
