I am sad that because Edward Norton did not want to participate in the film or have anything to do with it, people automatically think that the film sucks even without watching it or not giving it a chance. I really hope Norton didn't do that. He is a good actor, and all, except that he scared people away from a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting. It wasn't stunning or anything else with crazy special effects, but it was not bad. It was fun to watch. But yes, definitely a good / horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
