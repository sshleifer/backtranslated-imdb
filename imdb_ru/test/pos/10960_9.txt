"Shadows" is often called a film that was a breakthrough for American independent cinema. Regardless of whether this is true or not, this is undoubtedly an important film, the influence of which can be traced back to the current Sundance fodder. Here is a film that touches the controversial topics of the day (namely, racism), and refuses to give simple answers and show them in a manipulative manner. In addition, he frankly talks about sex, which Hollywood did not even discuss before the “Graduate”. <br /> <br /> However, the question remains: how strong is it today, as when it was first released? The answer is yes. While many important films are difficult to watch and they are outdated in our day, Shadows retain every ounce of emotional resonance when viewed now. He views racism as a personal, not a political issue, so it’s still relevant. In addition, it works as an excellent time capsule, capturing the beat-generation of the 1950s and the New York art scene like no other film. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, it is admittedly uneven. Cassavetis has not yet received full confidence as a director, and intermittent editing reflects the low budget of the film. However, the story of the film remains powerful. Plus, acting, given the inexperience of acting and improvisational nature, is phenomenal. All around, the actors create realistic characters that remain sympathetic, despite their often not admiring actions. "Shadows" - absolutely required viewing for movie lovers. (9/10)
