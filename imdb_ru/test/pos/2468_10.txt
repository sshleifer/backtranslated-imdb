I was just lucky I found this movie. I use Walmart DVDs for $ 5.50 because I watch a lot of movies (and very rarely watch TV). I graduated from high school in 1968, so I have a family and many friends who served in Vietnam. This film really illustrates the pain that I saw in my friends when confronted with what happened to them there. I would like more people to see this film - I think that perhaps more people could understand what happened to our Vietnamese veterinarians, watching these wonderful actors portray one of the families affected by this war. The story seemed realistic - it was not soft, but it made me feel what they went through. I think it helped that Martin Sheen and Emilio Esteves played father and son - it made their relationship more believable,
