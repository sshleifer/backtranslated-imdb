"What Alice found" was a pleasant discovery. As written and directed by A. Dean Bell, this is a combination of a road film with a warning history, as well as a journey of discovery. <br /> <br /> If you haven’t seen the movie yet, perhaps you should stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Alice is an example of a young woman who wants to end the unhappy life that she leads in the city of New England. Her excuse for leaving is about to join her best friend, who is studying at the University of Miami. Alice is a product of a single mother’s home that struggles to make ends meet, which contrasts sharply with the life in which her friend lives. In the memoirs, we will see the life of Alice before heading out. <br /> <br /> Alice, like her namesake in “Alice in Wonderland,” sets off on a journey to the unknown, for which her life has not prepared. America's roads are full of predators in search of the weak and the innocent. Alice faces a disaster when her car breaks down the road, and a friendly southern couple comes to her aid when a strange person approaches in the dark with an excuse that she wants to help her. Sandra and Bill convince her to come in their posh RV. on the way south. <br /> <br /> Nothing prepared Alice for what this pair turned out to be. In the end, in her protected life, she did not deal with what Sandra and Bill, her new benefactors, do during the overnight stays at rest stops on American highways. It is shocking for her that the fact that Sandra is nothing more than a prostitute who enjoys trading among people who drive trucks that can be found in these places. <br /> <br /> Alice, brilliantly played by Emily Grace, examines how a young woman awakens to a new reality from which she cannot escape. In fact, Sandra makes Alice try her luck in the oldest profession on earth to earn much-needed money. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey in the role of Sandra shows amazing results. Miss Ivy is perfect as a seemingly normal woman, and no one would suspect that she is in trouble with the customers that she and Bill find along the route they travel. Miss Ivey is amazing when she tells the truth about Alice to the accusing Alice. As a husband, Bill Raymond is good at depicting him as a husband, who is actually a purchaser. <br /> <br /> Under the excellent guidance of Mr. Dean Bell, the film is not afraid to get into the mainstream of places. movies dare not go. Congratulations to this director, who wrote a believable story and put together the perfect cast to play it in our favor.
