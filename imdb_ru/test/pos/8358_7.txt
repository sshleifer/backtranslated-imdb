Aslan Adam, or Lyonman, as it is more widely known among English-speaking viewers, begins an epic battle when King Solomon and his army defeat many guys, although I'm not sure who they were, and the film itself is not very helpful in establishing the fact. In any case, after King Solomon killed all these guys, Princess Maria, Bishop Osorio, and the commander Antoine are forced to sign an agreement allowing King Solomon to rule almost everything that can be seen. Shortly after Princess Maria seduces Solomon and they have sex, while at the shortest wedding ceremony (just two sentences), Antoine marries Princess Mary and plans to rebel against Solomon and get some sweet revenge in this process. Antoine and his guards attack Solomon and kill him, although his pregnant wife, Princess Almunia, runs with her protector Rostin with Antoine's guards in hot pursuit after the shortest work (less than 5 minutes or the time needed to run around the bush), Princess Almunia gives birth to a little boy who hides in the bushes from the guards of Antoine. Unfortunately, when Rostin tries to find a little guy, he discovers that the child was adopted by Leo’s pride as one of their own! A year has passed, and evil Antoine now rules a ruthless attitude towards her subjects, Princess Mary gave birth, and he has a son, but Rostin is also still trying to crush the rebel gang to overthrow Antoine, the task seems hopeless if only they can enlist the support of the legendary Leo , which is more of a beast than a human ... <br /> <br /> This joint Turkish-Greek joint production was filmed by Natuk Baytan in the role of Natukh Baytan and is a type of film, I was laughing badly, but at the same time very interesting. The script seems to never take itself seriously, sometimes it’s quite a funny movie, it moves like a rocket and is never boring and boring, and some English duplicated dialogues are ridiculous in the context of what is happening on the screen. None of this makes any sense, we bring up the boy Leo, the evil king, betrayal, dark family secrets, birthmarks, which form Leo's form in the element of the story that was present before the child was raised by Leo, crazy fighting scenes, torture scenes Where are posts that should be tied to pedestals, ancient castle interiors that accidentally contain zipper wires and gymnastic rings, idiotic bad guys who all seem to have extensive facial hair and a central character whose l The jaw line resembles a brick line of the jaw, you can strike two times with a knife, your hands are covered with acid (this acid can pass through steel hatches, but is stored in a ceramic jug!) and fall 20 feet onto the concrete floor, but without serious injury! “Aslan Adam” is a terribly interesting film, I don’t think that I saw another similar film, and I can also compare it, if you are looking for something serious, then forget about it, but if you like “so badly - they are good type movies and want to have fun, laugh and have fun, then Aslan Adam should be at the VERY top of your list. Only 100% gold for fans of bad movies and those who love different and weird things. On the disappointing side, Lionman gets his steel claws only 10 minutes before the end, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Directed by Baiten, of course, continues to move forward at a fast pace, although this is not well done, during the first fight at one moment the guys fight on the sand dune, and the next - on the grassy hill with trees in the back plan! There is one moment when Layonman uses a “branch” for a pole vault, but this is obviously just a long tube with a vine wrapped around it! Then there is the scene when a bloodthirsty pack of bloody hounds are supposed to be chased by Lionman, but the dogs used are obviously different breeds, including some of the most innocent looking dogs! In Aslan Adam there are so many separate scenes that are just funny, stupid, bizarre or all three that I could go on forever. Just check the ending when Lyonman jumps and flies wherever he can fly. There is a lot of blood in Aslan Adam, although there is some graphic blood or violence, several knife wounds and someone's hands are cut off as clearly as possible. <br /> <br /> Technically, Aslan Adam is a rather strange, period. The costumes are bright and vibrant with purple, yellow, red and other bright colors. The fight scenes are cheap, but at least the filmmakers tried to do as much as possible. The music seemed more suitable for classical ballet than for an action movie, and is another strange aspect for Aslan Adam. The acting was bad, even if it were nicknamed, one could say that the acting was bad. <br /> <br /> Aslan Adam is pure gold from beginning to end, there are so many things in this film that I like, that I laugh at, and that I like. just ended up really loving it. Aslan Adam is by no means a good movie in any sense of the word, but it's a damn interesting movie. Maybe I will have to watch it again soon to prove to myself that I did not dream of all this! The best Turkish action movie about the man Lion's raised you have ever seen. Turned out to be popular enough to spawn a sequel, Lionman II: The Witchqueen (1979).
