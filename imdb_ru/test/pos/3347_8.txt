I remember seeing this movie with a friend for the first time while on vacation in Anaheim, California, in October 1976. When we drove through the touristy city streets, we saw a commercial for the film “ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX”. Therefore, before even checking out the Disneyland version of the classic Lewis Carroll half a mile from us, our curiosity won out, and we ventured on this cinematic threshold. I remember, even before the film began, I was surprised to see that this film appeared in the tranquil, ultra-conservative Orange district. <br /> <br /> Thirty-two years later, I stumbled upon a local video of Alice in Wonderland. keep. I wondered if it was the same movie, until I looked at the back of the jacket and saw the picture of the beautiful Christine DeBell in the lead role and decided to kindle some fond memories. The disruptive video, to their credit, released two versions, X and XXX, in one package. It turns out that the version that my friend and I saw in Anaheim was rated as X, despite the original XXX advertising on the site. Seeing this for the second time, I understand that the amazing director Bad Townsend brought to the screen. As an example of the sight of this man behind the camera, in the days of his salad, he shot two episodes of the TV Days of DEATH. VALLEY. <br /> <br /> Miss Debell, appearing on Playboy in April 1976, is perfect for Alice. She brings a new American innocence to the role of a librarian in her early twenties, hungry for a better life. When her boyfriend gets a rebuff from moving their relationship to the next level, Alice reaches her turning point. This is a “musical comedy”, but the melodies are rather catchy, with the corresponding strings and copper sound, to compensate for mostly inspiring words. Miss DeBell has a pleasant singing voice when she is worried about wanting to be free. That's when the magic begins. The pace of this film is surprisingly smooth, given that the genre and auxiliary cast of Wonderland allow Alice when she flourishes in femininity. Special mention should be made of television veteran Larry Gelman as the White Rabbit, who seems to be the only character not obsessed with sex, because he is always late for a meeting ??. Or something like that. <br /> <br /> Special features include comments from well-known feminist defender Lena Ramone, who tells how watching this film during college has influenced her career as an adult film actress after graduation. <br /> <br /> What makes ALICE IN WONDERLAND such a delightful walk is its garden setting. Partially filmed in the magnificent, magnificence of nature by Stanley Park Vancouver BC, the cinema disproves its pornographic roots. You do not leave, feeling that you have watched the dirty movement of the skin. At the time of this writing, I did not watch the triple version XXX. Additional videos taken later may, in all likelihood, disrupt the general flow and remove the light, fresh atmosphere that is evident everywhere. <br /> <br /> Naturally, the version of Lewis Carroll is the best way to curl up and explore Alice in Wonderland. However, for a time capsule representing the 1970s adult film archives, ALICE IN WONDERLAND is well worth tracing this white rabbit and taking a cruel walk full of cheerful chaos.
