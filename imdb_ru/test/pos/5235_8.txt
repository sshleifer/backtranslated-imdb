One of the myths of the early sound era is that they could not make westerns because they had problems recording sound on the spot. In fact, it was the financial limitations of the depression that temporarily killed the genre, at least in the budget bracket “A.” However, in the period 1929-1931, before the economic downturn really began, a Western "A" flourished, for example, Virginia, Billy Kid and Cimarron. Was a large footprint perhaps the biggest of them all ?? a giant western pioneer in the early widescreen process with the appropriately named greatness. Thanks to the recent DVD release, we can now see the widescreen version along with the full screen version, which was filmed simultaneously. <br /> <br /> The director was Raoul Walsh, a man for whom the spirit of adventure lay in broad perspectives outdoors, and thus, in many respects, the perfect choice. He makes extensive use of a wider frame to show the western landscape in its most breathtaking. Very typical for Walsh is a few shots at the beginning, for example, one where a woman chops wood. Most of the screen is tightly filled with wagons and other riots, but in one corner we see the desert calling to us. As the car travels, we are gradually opening up an open plain with carts breaking like stage curtains. These pictures are not as effective in the full-screen version, but on a wider canvas, Walsh’s open-air expression has never been better. <br /> <br /> But there is a downside. When it comes to dialogue scenes, Walsh seeks to position actors in the middle of the frame, as if they were in an imaginary full-screen frame. The extra width becomes just like that ?? additionally. At first, this may seem logical, because it means that we see as many actors in height as there are in the full-screen image. However, this makes the players look small and insignificant in the frame, while the entire background business dominates the frame ?? and the Great Trail has a lot of background business. When widescreen formats reappeared in the 1950s, many directors would make the same mistake before they finally realized that in scenes with movies it was better to pick up actors from across the chest, losing some of their height, but allowing them to fill the screen. <br /> <br /> It’s a pity, because The Big Trail is a particularly well-balanced and carefully thought-out scenario. The stories about the novel and revenge are simple, but clearly defined and do not threaten to outweigh each other or the story of the pioneer. It could be a great intimate epic, but it loses dramatic weight, because every time the characters start talking to each other, we are distracted by herds of cattle, drifting carts or something else that fills every extra inch of frame. Nevertheless, Walsh’s sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display, and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable. There are also some nice comedic touches, mostly courtesy of the “comic Swede” El Brendel. <br /> <br /> “Big Footprint” is also known as the first lead role of John Wayne. While Wayne is another victim of distant cadres in the dialogue scenes, we at least see his strong physical presence and hear his warm but energetic vocals. He gives his lack of experience, but the potential is clearly there. Unfortunately, this potential was not widely realized at that time, and he spent the rest of the decade taking pictures of him in B-pictures before he finally achieved fame. Also in this picture appears Wayne's buddy (and later the prolific character) Ward Bond. He is not credited, but you may notice him in several scenes, most noticeably near the 80-minute mark, where he stands to the left of Tayron Power. <br /> <br /> Big Path is a magnificent epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama. And it is precisely because of this colossal scale that the western (and widescreen) fit into bed for some time. And although the 40s and 50s are now considered the golden age of the West, was it a modified genre with stories about individual adventures and heroism in the established West ?? no better and no worse, but of a different form. The period of early talk was the end of an era when westerns could be truly gigantic.
