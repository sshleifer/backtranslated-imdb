What a pleasure. This is really a parody. Only French people can do such things without being rude. And as a result, you are really having a good time, watching Jean Dujardin play the fool. Most of the film stands on his shoulders, and he is wide enough to make this film a good one. He has the perfect way to go too far with such a guy from James Bond that he can't compare with Mike Meyers in Austin Powers, for example. Dialogues are also good enough to hold the viewer's attention, with a lot of silly jokes, this is really perfect. Both women, who played the main roles in the film, compare themselves with the main character, and it was not easy. There is no plot in this film, but this is not what is expected in this film. You just want to laugh one hour and 40 minutes, and this is exactly what the film manages to do. It deserves success in France
