Having received a copy of the Bostocks Cup, I must admit that it is not as funny as I originally thought !! THIS IS BETTER!!!!! Charlie Williams ... eat your heart. Match fixing Never! Inclined pitch by 45%? Ronnie and Reggie Kay? George Best? A coach who thinks that Pontefract is in South Wales (this is all Ponty and Ponty) Bertie Masson (Tim Healy) Hat Hat! (not that he is in tricks) Sugar Plum Fairy ????? Embarrassed???? Look again. The innovative use of real shots with Bostock players was brilliant, and the producer should be proud to give us a masterpiece. Come on ITV do the audience and yourself a favor - show it again !!!
