FBI agents Mulder and Scully are tasked with unraveling the mystery of what happened to the Arctic drilling team, in this early episode of The X-Files, which David Duchovny himself considers to be one of his first “Rokino” episodes. He pays homage to 1982’s highly acclaimed The Thing theatrical function of 1982, and one can see the similarities. Visually, color and lighting schemes combine to give the story hellish quality. Production design / art direction is particularly impressive; Images of the exterior of the Arctic camp are so reminiscent of the previous film that they automatically cause some viewers to feel like a deja vu. Naturally, our heroes are threatened by the weather, so the sound effects, including the wind, evoke memories of “Things”. <br /> <br /> The culprit is an ancient worm that was exposed by a team; Once inside the host, it stimulates aggressive behavior. This allows the paranoia aspect to fully control itself, and when setting up the script, we cannot be too sure who is infected and who is not. This leads to an inevitable test scene. This episode is certainly working on an image of how tensions can cause disruptions in groups. This even allows Mulder and Scully to have moments when they are not sure whether they can trust each other. <br /> <br /> A guest in the lead role is a good small group of actors: Xander Berkeley, Felicity Huffman and Steve Hitner as scientists are required to accompany Mulder and Scully on a mission, and Jeff Kober as a pilot who takes them to the camp. You can also see Jason Voorhees once portrayed Ken Kirzinger as one of the ill-fated original team members. <br /> <br /> By the way, there is a direct link between Led and Thing: art director Graham Murray, who worked on both projects. <br /> <br /> 8/10
