In my work with Security On Campus, Inc., the only national non-profit organization dedicated solely to crime prevention on college campuses and student awareness, I too often see a type of campus violence and “hiding” in a secret campus. The courts are depicted in the movie "Silence Mary." In fact, we receive numerous monthly calls and requests for information from campus reporters, such as Mary, who are faced with similar situations. <br /> <br /> It describes campus rape and the subsequent Mary Crusade. The victim's roommate and journalist student, whom Melissa Joan Hart played very well, because justice was very well done and thoroughly researched. <br /> <br /> This was the first television film I ever saw, which I felt truly reflected and embraced all the various complex issues related to how rape and other violent crimes are dealt with in colleges and universities towns of our country. Although in 2 hours it would be impossible to examine in detail all these problems, this film comes closer than all the others I have seen.
