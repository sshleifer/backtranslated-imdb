I saw this movie yesterday. I have to admit - I love it! It's like early Tarantino, but better. This is really necessary, but ... do not show this film to someone under the age of 18. He is full of blood and sex (the rape scene is gorgeous :)). Now I'm just waiting for the other films of this director and the release of the DVD.
