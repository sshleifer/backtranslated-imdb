This is one of the best early episodes of Star Trek, in which Kirk and his team are sent into the unknown to fight an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they learn that the terrible Romulans are racially related branches of the Vulcans! Young Mr. Stiles, played well by Paul Komi, is one of the few truly unsightly characters in the Star Trek universe. His barely concealed hatred of Mr. Spock is very similar to the hatred after 9/11 and the suspicions of many Americans about people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin. The atmosphere of wartime paranoia is too real. Then there are the Romulans: they are the sworn enemy of the Federation. Klingons are repugnant, but mostly harmless; rather a nuisance than a serious threat. The Romulans, however, mean business: they are ancient Romans, revived in the space age; despite their volcanic features, they clearly should remind us of imperial Rome with names such as Decius, and names such as “centurion” and “praetor”. Mail is really cool. Familiar guest star Mark Lenard, who played the role of Spock Sorek's father, as well as the Klingon commander in Star Trek: the film, is respectively a grizzly, war-weary commander, a character strikingly similar to Crassus Lawrence Olivier in Spartak. In addition, his doubt in the unquenchable thirst for the conquests of the Empire reminds me of the similar fears of Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), expressed at the beginning of "Gladiator". A must for trekkistov, and for fans of epic swords and sandals.
