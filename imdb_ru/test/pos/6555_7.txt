The girl begins to notice that people in her small town are addicted to something that has a spiral shape. Soon the craze turns into obsession, and everything becomes fatal. Although I will not say that Uzumaki was a great film, I will say that it does not look like everything I've seen before. Throughout my viewing I felt like I was watching a cartoon. There are funny transitions between scenes and characters with digital eyes. Later, I learned that the film is a manga-comic book version, so it makes sense. However, only when you think that you are watching something that can be a children's film, are you bombarded with terrible and bloody visual effects! History often lags behind, and the final is somewhat harsh and at the time seemed anti-climatic, but in retrospect I value it more for originality. My rating: 7/10.
