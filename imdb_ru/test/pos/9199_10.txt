This show is just entertainment and is not trying to be a Greek drama. This, of course, contains elements of the same thing, with all the plot twists, but it is very interesting and fun. Las Vegas is the perfect place for a show, and they will never have a shortage of materials to work with! Anything that happens there! The actors on this show are extremely personable, and you really want to see what they do every week. The show is also very fun. Humor arises from characters and situations. Not just abandoned. This is a well thought out show in this regard. It certainly makes me look forward to Friday nights, and I'm glad that now I have my first two seasons on DVD!
