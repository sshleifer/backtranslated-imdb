First I saw “Night of Demons 2”, before I saw “Night of Demons”. Unfortunately, my old blockbuster thought that it would be nice to have a sequel, but not the first one. Looney, huh? Now, I think all horror fans need this movie. It's like McDonald's, you know that this is bad for you, and you would prefer The Cheesecake Facotory (or any more expensive restaurant you prefer), but you can't but want to just want cheap things. <br /> <br /> The night of the demons has it all: your innocent, sexy, goes according to the rules of chica-di, your symbolic black guy who is surprisingly not killed. You are a slutty girl, you are a slutty girl, you are a dark girl or a boy, a balabol, a crappy haunted house atmosphere, a bad game and a lot of unnecessary nudity. Is not that great? I mean, deep down inside, I know it was pretty bad, but bad for horror films. Horror fans should enjoy and dig! <br /> <br /> 8/10
