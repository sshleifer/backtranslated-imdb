I first saw this film in the early 80s by cable. It was unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race, and a variety of things that I’m sure I missed. However, about a year ago it returned to my life when I began to enjoy it with my son. He is a little young (9) for many topics in him, but he understands that it is fun to watch hippies, and he understands that the end is ironic. Although I can not think of other films in this genre, he has a separate genius, whom I love. It also makes the unique justice of the Central Park. Most musicals are lost to me, anyway. “Tommy” was excessive and hard in the direction, “Oliver” looked like crowd control on a silver screen, “Wall” was so distracted, self-confident and condescending, but listened to the “Failing Flesh” from Hair today sounds right as it should have been in the sixties ... really timeless.
