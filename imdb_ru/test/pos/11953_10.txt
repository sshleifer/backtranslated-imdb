I really love everything that was done by Savvyge Steve Holland, the author / director of this wonderful movie. See also “Better Off Dead” and “How I Entered College.” Wonderful! In any case, this film is really funny and delivers unexpected things. Where else besides this film can you see Demi Moore as a talented singer and Bobcat Golthwaite as a twin? I recommend this to anyone looking for some old-fashioned farce comedy (George with a turtle raft), not to mention really well-written sarcasm (a Christmas tree on the roof of the car). This film constantly throws you unexpected things, even after you've seen it 100 times, like me! Enjoy!
