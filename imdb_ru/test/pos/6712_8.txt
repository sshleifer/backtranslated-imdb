To the guy who bore the idea of ​​Lifeforce, I want to say one thing: thank you, sir! Lifeforce combines the Star Trek: The Motion Picture high-end sci-fi pump with cheap Phantasm horror sensations and finishes it all with t-ts - and some real meaty hangers. And most importantly, this is actually a good movie! It amazes me that someone actually justifies a popular film, which is the means by which a hot chick can appear naked on the screen for an hour and a half for producers. God bless you, all of you who have been involved. <br /> <br /> Steve Railsback (Helter Schelter) plays Colonel Carlson, the American commander of the international space mission, to investigate comet Halley. The crew of Carlson finds an alien ship inside the comet and inside the ship, in which they find three naked people in limbo - two guys and a hot woman (Matilda May). In short, they are "space vampires" ... naked "space vampires." They destroy the crew, with the exception of Colonel Blueballs, who decided that he needed to release a hot chick from her lucite showcase, because the part of his brain that controls his nut liquids told him that it was right. The colonel brought him back to our big blue ball in the rescue capsule. Meanwhile, another crew of the space shuttle found that its ship was dead in space, and delivered the three living coffins of the Living Dead Martians back to London. And then people start turning into pigskins, and actually, damn, they start to spin out of control too quickly. <br /> <br /> Carlson is teaming up with the imperturbable Colonel Kane (Peter Firth) of the British SAS to hunt down our naked cutie - who damn long sucks the guys on the left and the right. hunt her down, with the ultimate goal of blowing her ass and smashing her big space umbrella and her buddies, which absorbs the energy of the people being attacked by vampires, will they succeed in time? LITTLE SPOILER: Yes. <br /> <br /> Wow. What can I say besides "wow"? This damn movie really works. I can’t believe that there are real British actors in this film, such as Aubrey Morris (A Clockwork Orange) and Patrick Stewart (“The Sexiest Man in Life” or something like that). All the actors are good. The direction is good and really shines in the second half, where we see the fantastic devastation of London. Special effects are also not fools. In 1985, this film must have been the most popular. All the effects are quite impressive, and here a wide range of talents in animatronics, makeup effects, light shows and very good space scenes with good old-fashioned modeling and matte painting are demonstrated - very well done. For all horror fans, there are even bloody and bloody squibs. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a great movie for those who feel nostalgia for when popular cinema films were shot with 100% love from the very beginning to the beginning. The end. The filmmakers really made sure that all the basics were covered, and the end result is a phenomenally funny thing that does not allow you to turn away, because the hearings are too cute. Real solid entertainment here: 8 1/2 out of 10.
