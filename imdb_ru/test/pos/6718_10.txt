Danny Boyle was not the first to realize that zombies can run like firecrackers. This honor belongs to Lifeforce, who, of course, is the greatest nude vampire zombie vampire from comet Halley, who went out of control in the London movie about the end of the world. Tobe Hooper may have done a lot of shit, but for this insanely crazy epic sci-fi horror he deserves a place among the immortals. In addition, he offers the cosmic vampire Matilda May, the best thing from France, since Simon Simon has spent the entire movie naked. What she does is very, very good. Just keep in mind that, although it is the most feminine presence among all who has ever met on Earth, it is also "completely alien to this planet and our life form and absolutely dangerous." This would be a grand meeting that I would like to attend: astronauts from the British space program find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a giant artichoke-shaped spacecraft 150 miles long as an umbrella hidden in the tail of Halley’s comet filled with giant dried bats and bring them back to Earth with almost apocalyptic results, as they continue to deplete the London population with their vitality against the backdrop of great nudity, thunder whirlpools and spitting coffee through the wild room ("I was in space for six months," and it looks perfect for me. "" Suppose we know nothing that underestimates the cause. "Do not worry, a naked woman is not going to leave this complex." ) Oh, and we will force the authors of “Alien” and “Blue Thunder” to write it with correspondence without accreditation of the author “Mark of the Devil”, “Thief of Sex” and Eskimo Nell and Director of the “Jonestown Monster”. Looks like a winner, that's $ 22 million? have fun And they do, they do. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are enough promises in the raw materials to make something really creepy and thought-provoking (when AIDS hysteria was approaching its size, it was sexually transmitted. ”“ Plague ”provides ample opportunities for allegory ), but in the hands of the go-go boys in Cannon, that which could become another quarter of the mass, and Yama quickly turns into Plan 10 from space. It's full of explosive madness, be it the fun scene of Frank Finlay's death (“Here I am!”), Peter Firth's main entrance (“I'm Colonel Kane.” “From CAC?”, Michael Gothard cautiously shouts through a room full of reporters: "Gentlemen, this last remark was not for publication. This is the situation with D-Notice," he responds surprisingly to helpful journalists, the guards offer nude space vampire Matilda May pleasant cookies to stop her escape. reanimated bodies exploding into dust all over the people, sweaty prime minister sucks life out of her secretary, and London is filled with zombie nuns, stockbrokers and runners as the city becomes increasingly comprehensive on screen as Mrs. Gorgo lost her junior at Battersea Fair and went into a rage. And this is not to say that “This woman is a masochist! Extreme masochist! ”Scene or a large stereo echo effect on the male vampire line“ It will be much less scary if you just come to me ”, while Peter Firth, who owns the stake, uses his best voice in“ Action Man ”, to answer "I'll do just that!" In one scene only, you have an obsessive Patrick Stewart, embodying the woman in the minds of our deeply confused astronaut hero, Steves. “I never replay Charlie-Manson” Railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in full “Helta-”. Skelta! ”Fashion is trying to resist the temptation to kiss him, the inimitable Aubrey Morris (the only person who makes Freddie Jones look reserved), playing Interior Minister Sir Percy Hezeltin as a kind of crazy Brian Ricks, Peter Firth (one of those actors who always look as if he was Doctor Who at a time when no one else was looking at him, pushing at a macho at a public school, in the hope that no one would see it, and John Hallam's incomparable reactions in the role of a male nurse. continues to open the door in the middle of a mental tornado to bring more drugs. As if they need more in this movie. It's just a shame that the crazy scientist Frank Finlay, who cannot certify death on alien life forms (the role originally intended for Klaus Kinski), missed the action in this. <br /> <br /> No matter how crazy you think the movie is, it still manages to get angry, be it a zombie pathologist (“He also needs to be fed”), exploding all over the Interior Minister’s costume, blood and Patrick Stewart's entrails, forming the naked Matilda May or cosmic vampires, turn St. Paul’s Cathedral into the world's largest laser show for transporting human souls from the London Underground to their geostationary ship. I loved every great mad moment. In its own unique way, it can be the greatest film ever made. <br /> <br /> The DVD offers the original 116-minute version, which was opened in the UK, and not a heavily edited 101-minute US version, which not only offers much more fun for your dollar, but also completely restores the score of Henry Mancini before its original glory (the American version has closed many spaces with additional tips from Michael Kamen and James Guthrie). Although at first glance this is a somewhat surprising choice, Mancini cut his teeth on many of the classic universal fantastic horrors of the 50s, and his score is quite excellent, and the terrific driving title gives a rare reminder of how interesting it could be. be away from Blake Edwards. Unfortunately, there is nothing but a trailer as add-ons, although it would be nice to sometime hope for a special edition with some deleted scenes from the 128-minute segment originally intended for Hooper: from what is shown here, they can simply offer more comedic gold!
