This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. This is true love and friendship. About changing your life and doing something good for someone else. Thomas Bo Larsen can play the same role that he has played in many other films, but recently we have seen him in other roles that he also plays excellently. But what if he plays the same role as in other films? he is perfect for this role. Ulrich Thomsen does a great job too. These two criminal "lower men" are the best friends of all time. They share everything and do everything for each other, regardless of cost. When they find out that Peter’s daughter is being mistreated, they suspend everything (things you can’t stop if you don’t need to do more criminal acts) and bring her to a better place. Do they do their best ?? these two people are not inspirers, but their heart is in the right place. All I can say is that Peter and Karsten are also my biggest heroes ??
