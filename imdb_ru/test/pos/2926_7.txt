Although this episode was offensive to the Association of Tourette Syndrome, others thought it was funny, while others thought it was a bad way to start a new season. <br /> <br /> This episode was funny and shocking. South Park went down in history as their first episode with the most abusive words, unless you consider the film an episode. <br /> <br /> I liked how they laughed at Chris Hansen and his TV show to catch Predator. I didn’t like the idea of ​​how they thought Chris Hansen would give a show on tours and allow the boy to speak out and beat the Jews. <br /> <br /> I didn’t like the way South Park thought that People with Tourette Syndrome would just have blurted out a bad language. I saw people on TV with Tourette syndrome, and they didn’t just say bad words. If I'm not mistaken.
