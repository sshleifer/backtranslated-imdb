The square has really landed this one. They did not try to please everyone, but focused solely on the fans of Final Fantasy 7. And, God, those who are happy fans will see this movie! The story may not be so interesting or trustworthy, but it is closely related to the history of the game and has some funny moments that can be said honestly! This is a complete surprise and a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> The game has a lot of cameos and funny links. And most importantly: the fighting scenes swing so hard that they can break through the diamond! They are really complete awesomeness and would make the film worthwhile, even if everything else sucked. I mean, they are some of the best PERIODs ever created. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Until. <br /> <br /> PS: I know that my review sounds like a nonsense teenage girl. It was like what I wanted.
