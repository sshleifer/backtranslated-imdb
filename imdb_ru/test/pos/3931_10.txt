I do not think that I am alone when I say that 2005 was not particularly kind to the horror genre. Although Damned, Hide and Seek, Ring Two, and Amityville Horror showed a glimpse of interest and potential, there were more blunders than hits. As evidence, see “White Noise,” “Boogeyman,” “Jacket,” “Mind Hunters,” and “Alone in the Dark.” Imagine my surprise when the House of Wax, written in hard-coded brothers and sisters Chad and Cary Hayes, turned out to be ... well, a surprise. <br /> <br /> Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) is a young woman traveling with her troubled brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki). They, along with Page (Paris Hilton), Blake (Robert Richard), and Dalton (John Abrahams) are hoping to score tickets for the final football game of the season. Along the way, they encounter some kind of car problem and are forced to enter a desert city, where nothing is what it seems. <br /> <br /> Hearing this, a remake of the classic Vincent Price B-movie, I rolled my eyes. I didn’t even want to think about what the freshman director Jaume Serra had prepared for his audience. At a time when most of the high-profile horror films are disappointments hidden by bad writing, static directing and amateur acting, I think I was lucky that Serra and the Hayes brothers took it upon themselves to make a good, old-fashioned, frightened holiday, unlike from the disappointments I mentioned earlier, this click doesn’t hit and uses every cinematic trick in the book to give everyone exactly what they came for. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Hayes "really took the time and effort to create pleasant and believable characters, which makes the events much more relevant. It also gives the young actors portraying them something exciting. As in “The girl next door”, Elisha Cuthbert, proves to the audience what kind of skillful actress she is. In the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, Jessica Biel silenced the skeptics by presenting the rude and emotional performance that made the viewer be with her. the same. Che Michael Murray (The Cinderella Story) in one of his first more mature roles is no more a slacker than Nick Murray exudes charisma and sharpness, as well as impressive athleticism on top. Murray and Cuthbert are perfectly combined with each other and have tangible family chemistry. <br /> <br /> The press and the American public held a field day dedicated to the main acting debut of Paris Hilton, and, as I expected, Hilton does not embarrass herself. In fact, she is as good as everyone else in the film (do what you want with it). Like Cuthbert and Murray, Hilton is present on the screen. She is sexy and playful. I can’t think about one of the reasons why she got the worst of the film’s sharp reception, except that they are just picking on it. Jared Padalecki (television "Gilmore Görz") unforgettably copes with his role. Robert Richard (“Cousin Skeeter”) and John Abrahams (“Meet the Parents”) don't have to work hard, but he does his job. With only one scene, Damon Herriman (Soaring) makes an unforgettable impression, and his presence looms over the rest of the film. Finally, Brian Van Holt ("Basic") is magnificent and threatens in a double role. <br /> <br /> Once again, fame should go to the writers to avoid cliches when possible. Despite popular belief, the House of Wax is quite unpredictable for most of its work. Take, for example, such an example: it seems that the killer does not count, and Carly leans in to get something from his pockets. What do you expect to happen? Watch the movie and you will understand what I mean. It is also nice to see a horror film in which the characters demonstrate a little common sense. <br /> <br /> Unlike most horror films, the exciting work of John Ottman never distracts. However, as in other editions of Dark Castle, the visual aspects of "Wax" are worthy of awards and raise the film above its genre attributes. The talents of cinematographer Stephen F. Windon, designer Graham Walker, art director Nicholas McCallum and editor Joel Negron emphasize terrible images. Speaking of images, I believe that the hounds of the breed will be delighted with the many effects of makeup and tricks that can be found here. Each death scene beats up the belly more than the previous one. Taking into account his past in music videos and commercials, it is obvious that Jaume Serra is well versed in style. His in-your-face approach is a big contribution to the success of this film. Just when you think the camera will turn away, it is not. He is also particularly good at building thick layers of fear and atmosphere. One outstanding shot is our familiarity with the killer as he slowly emerges from the hatch. <br /> <br /> In that case, I usually confess when I'm in the minority (Shut up, okay? I liked the "House of 1000 Dead People"!). In this case, I firmly believe that detractors are wrong. I'm not sure why people work so hard on this film, considering that it is much better than recent genre recordings. Maybe they are afraid to admit that the horror film with Paris Hilton in the title role might be worth seeing ... Who knows? This is a horror movie, and at the same time, commendably stylish and effective. As a lifelong horror fan, all I can say is that I fully enjoyed the “House of Wax” in all its gloomy and sadistic glory. I boldly consider this a great achievement in the modern horror, and also (along with the "City of Sins") the first fully satisfying release of 2005.
