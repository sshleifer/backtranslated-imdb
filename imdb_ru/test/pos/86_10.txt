This film was not boring at all. This concerns reality. For people who consider this film boring, open your eyes to the real problems of our society. Our children are dying. The effects of alcohol and drug abuse cannot be ignored. I work in a correctional institution as a chemical dependency counselor, and I deal with these problems every day. People of all ages and all sectors of society suffer from the effects of alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families, hurts people, and causes serious brain damage, various health problems, and death. This is all preventable. This film should be shown in every school in the world. If someone owns this film and wants to sell it or sell me a copy, please email me at: Ottenbreit2@netzero.net thanks
