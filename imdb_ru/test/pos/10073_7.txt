So Madonna is not Meryl Streep. However, this is one of her first films and comedies. Give her a break! Of course, the film is mediocre at best and pales in comparison with its earlier counterpart with Katherine Hepburn, raising a child. Whatever it is (at least a piece of fluff), it is quite fun to watch. I have not yet heard anyone criticize Madonna’s acting skills, supporting him with evidence or even adjectives that are different from “terrible”, “bad” or other similar fuzzy descriptive words. If you want to see a bad game or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing, what about Whitney Houston? She had the most undeserved commercial success among all the actresses in history, and she could not get out of the hat box. The American public obviously cannot see the difference between a credible game of cinema and stellar power. I think Madonna has always been at least trustworthy in her films. Get real people. Madonna is the 90s.
