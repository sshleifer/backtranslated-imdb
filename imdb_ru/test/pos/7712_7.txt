This is one of the peripheral stories told by the Animatrix, which has no direct relation to stopping the war. One famous plot of films, but Trinity appears in it, voiced by Carrie. it has a private detective hired for a lot of money to look for a hacker named Trinity. we see his search, in which other PIs are involved, the only one with whom he meets, who seems to have gone mad from his own experience, trying to track Trinity down. in the end, he comes into contact with Trinity, which he regards as a person, of course, narrated in the narrative, and something that firmly puts us in his own point of view, despite what we already know, in the chat room hacker, and solves the riddle that makes him in a hurry to get on the train. he forgets his hat, but his faithful cat throws it to him at the moment of absurdity, so ridiculous that it is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> he meets her on the train, but the trick is revealed when agents attack; agents used him to get to Trinity, and Trinity tried to release the PI sent after her, which he certainly doesn’t know, and which are not clearly indicated in the animation itself, something common to noir films, often hints at a lot of interesting background stories stories, events, etc., but do not show you more than the main story and a limited point of view, to create an extra atmosphere of mystery and intrigue. <br /> <br /> almost everything in this short film is black and white, the music is reminiscent of a film noir, and the original, but at the same time passionate, detective story is the perfect hero for the title of a film noir. in the “Trivia” section of this article about IMDb there are also some interesting references that this heading does to hard-boiled literature, which it also borrows heavily, a genre of mysteries for detectives, gangsters, etc., which often and willingly participate in conflicts. Accurately animated Studio 4 ° C under the direction of Shinichiro Watanabe, is a nice variation of the usual matrix history.
