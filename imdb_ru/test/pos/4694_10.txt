By mistake, I ordered the BBC series, their new version of Robin Hood. Very disappointing compared to RoS. Horrible costumes and backgrounds. While I was enjoying the Sheriff, who took clues from Nick Grace's character, the rest of the cast left much to be desired. Like “for example,” Marion's costume looked suspicious, as if it came from Walmart. And Sir Guy, well, he looked a bit like a character from a space film! RoS stole the spotlight, probably forever, in the story. Cast, costumes, storylines, scenery, filming and the Clannad soundtrack are all excellent, as evidenced by all the constant feedback that came about 26 years later RoS is a timeless classic. Thanks to everyone who made the show.
