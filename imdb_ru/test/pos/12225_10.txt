I love this show. It is truly unique. I got the impression that there will be more seasons. Waiting for series 2, I recently bought series 1 to revise it so that it was updated when part 2 began. Now after watching, I was excited and longed for more, so I came to the site to see the continuation schedule. I am really disappointed to see that there are no more plans for the second series, since I was looking forward to seeing more of this story. I think they really dropped the ball on this. There was a lot of storyline left for development, and many unanswered questions. Now I am very unhappy, and I hope that they will reconsider their decision and continue the story in which it has stayed.
