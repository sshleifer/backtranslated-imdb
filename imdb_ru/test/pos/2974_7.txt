My wife and I saw this when we were 17 years old. The only good thing my father ever did (they put us). This is "our film", and the music - "our songs." Song Michelle "our" song. Yes, it is a crime now to show naked children on the screen, but we were 16 years old, and why not these children? The film - a rich boy soaks a poor girl, then rich dad eventually steals him from her after she gives birth in poor conditions. She was left alone with the child. This is a love story and a story of growing up. The music is fantastic, and this is a story that anyone can relate to. Maybe someday it will be released on DVD.
