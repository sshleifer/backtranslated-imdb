I watched this movie for lack of something else at the time. Quickly the film captured me with the depth of characters and subtle plot. I was very surprised to see that the rating provided by my satellite provider did not show any stars. <br /> <br /> I will not give any spoilers to the storyline or outcome, but most of the characters had at least some redemptive value. Until the very last minute I did not know how it would turn out. Often you can pick up a formula and predict the direction of the story. I could not do that with this movie. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this as one of the best films of this genre.
