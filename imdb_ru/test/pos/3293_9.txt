This story has held a special place in my heart for the past thirty-one years. As a child I enjoyed the stories of mountain people and wildlife. Books like Call of the Wild, White Fang, Pogranichnik, and My Side of the Mountain have had a huge impact on me. I wanted to live like a mountain man so much, but nothing inspired me so much as when I watched this movie on TV in 1975. I wanted to be like “The Catcher”. However, when I got older, I found myself too domesticated to live like this. Nevertheless, I still romanticize such a way of life. I agree with some of the other reviews of this film that the storyline has simplicity, which is quite common in films like Disney, but if you can look through the mechanics in which it was made and see the essence of the story, the true themes Then I think that you turned out to be pleasantly touched. I consider it necessary to watch this film once a year. Thirty-one years later, I still feel the cold penetrating me when I see a stream of snow coming down from the mountain and hear an echo, an obsessive laugh of the Catcher. <br /> <br /> Good luck, old man and stay free - <br /> <br /> PS If you want to know more about the true story, I found this link to the Mad Rat Catcher: <br /> <br /> http: //www.mysteriesofcanada .com / NWT / madtrapper.htm
