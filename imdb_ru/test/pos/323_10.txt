Worth watching Reader's Digest. Or Time, if it was the original source of the article that inspired Mani Ratnam to create this masterpiece. Based on the real story of a foster girl who goes in search of her biological parents, Mr. Ratnam draws classics that chain as much as he reproaches, cherishes as much as he punishes and preaches as much as he practices. <br /> <br /> How to start? Premonition of darkness, which precedes the new struggle in northern Sri Lanka? Chaotic household of a family headed by an incendiary brand engineer and three charming, naughty children? Or this dark region, where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of incredible and sinister events and ideologies? Anyway, this movie is worth it to get into your collection if you like the exciting dramas of Mani Ratnam. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ratnam is a past master at mixing fictional stories and real incidents, and in this film he is composing a lesson on the adaptation of two real stories to one. I will not go into the story, as it is better to see than to read. But what I’m going to dwell on is the influence it had on me, and why, despite all the hostilities taking place in this world, it cannot destroy this simple but inexhaustible force called hope. <br /> <br /> Innocence, in its purity, cannot comprehend the complex desires of an adult for decadence and greed. Nor does it recognize danger when it is accompanied by tough determination to search for what he wants. Such innocence prompts Amudha to seek out his biological parents, despite warnings that they may be lost in the cauldron of civil war. Having lived through the terrifying experience of talking to a person with disabilities, only to realize that he is a more deadly disguised entity, Amudha sticks to her reason in such a way that it undermines the resistance of her well-wishers. And finally, when they meet with the mother and daughter, the reunion is so stressful that even the adopted adoptive father turns into tears. With the support of the background score from the novel by A. R. Rahman, the following scene is acute to melt even the most stone hearts: a list of questions that Amudha must ask her biological mother. At a climax as dramatic as the sequence of incidents leading to this, the child discovers his mother, living in the body, but lost in the spirit. With the overwhelming realization that she has no hope of remaining with the one who weary of her, Amudha does with her adoptive mother what the name of this film means: pecks on the cheek. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, The Track is clearly paved with a brilliant PS Keerthana. Mr. Ratnam has the gift of extracting spectacular performances from obscure children artistes, but this should not take anything away from Kirthana for an award-winning spectacle. Having a capable auxiliary cast of Madhavan (Thira), Simran (Indira) and the grandiose Nandita Das (Syama), she decorates scenes in almost every frame in which she is. The music may not be as memorable as Rahman's other proposals, but it still did not prevent him from receiving another national award for the best musical direction. “Vellai Pookal” is the same ode as the need to take care of human life, and of nature. The dialogue at the highest level (an example of a touching exchange between Amudha and Indira is in full swing, shortly after the discovery that she is not the biological daughter of Indira) and the cinema is excellent. <br /> <br /> This film is a clear statement to drop weapons as much as you need to respect human life and expression. Don't judge it as a filmmaking lesson; You only lose by experiencing one of the best at the stable, Mani Ratnam-A Rahman.
