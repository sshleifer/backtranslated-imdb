Being the second last of Chaplin's “Essanye” films, CARMEN is a parody of Cecil B. DeMille's drama of the same name. It is obvious that the recognized film of DeMille was not very impressed with the king of comedies, which he later recognized in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> Parodies were not a new experiment for Chaplin. He has already done several of them, namely, his pre-historical past and his new job, and will continue to do so until the very end of his career in films (for example, in the film “King in New York”). <br /> <br /> Chaplin portrays Don Jose very well, and Edna Purvans is as good as Carmen. None acts like we used to; Charlie is not an attractive Tramp, and Edna is far from an innocent little woman, but this was not Chaplin's intentions. BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is Chaplin's somewhat strange film, completely different, but, nevertheless, incorporating good material. <br /> <br /> The main story, although quite different, as in the original drama. Don Jose loves Carmen very much, but he is not alone in this field; “Carmen, Carmen, beautiful Carmen, (loved) by all men under 96 years old,” but he has a great advantage that he is an officer, and here we are; This is a famous story about rivalry, love, greed and honor, viewed from a humorous point of view. Thanks to the performances of Chaplin and Purvans, as well as the wonderful, wonderful music of George Bizet, which I admire very much, it could become a masterpiece of almost comedy, this time is taken into account. It could have been. But, unfortunately, although this is a good and rather good comedy, I do not consider it fair to blame people who claim that BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is far from a masterpiece. But it is important to remember that this has nothing to do with the lack of talent, but rather is the result of conflicts relating to the business. When Chaplin refused to re-sign a contract with Essany after completing his latest film for the company, POLICE, they got their revenge by editing all the scenes that Chaplin originally edited from CARMEN. Because of this, the film is somewhat confusing and has several meaningless scenes that are more annoying than amusing, and the film turned out to be more like Ben Turpin’s play — Terpen played Remedados — than Chaplin’s short film. Naturally, Chaplin was in despair when he learned what Essanai had done, and had to stay in bed for several days. <br /> <br /> Despite obvious flaws, CHERLIN fans and fans of beautiful music.
