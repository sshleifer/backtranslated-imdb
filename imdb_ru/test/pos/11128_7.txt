In New York, a group of freshmen enters the Higher School of Performing Arts after an audition is successful. For four years, their dreams, deceptions, success, love, and personal dramas are revealed through the insecure Doris Finsecker (Maureen Tiefi), the homosexual Montgomery (Pale McCrane), the aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray), the reassuring Koko (Irene Cara), the ambitious queen Garcy (Barry Miller) and their friends before graduation. <br /> <br /> Twenty eight years ago, “Glory” was a great success when teenagers were looking for a place in show business, and I really liked this film and the soundtrack on a CD. I just watched "Glory" on DVD, and now I would say that this is a good film only with great potential, but with too many erroneous stories. The story repeats too many characters and leaves many situations unanswered. I don’t know if Alan Parker had problems with publishing to shorten the time it was shown, but what happened, for example, with a ballerina who goes to an abortion clinic? What happened to LeRoy and his teacher, did he fail because of his grammatical problem? What happened to Koko after undressing her blouse in this rogue's apartment? A synthesizer playing musician and his proud dad stayed in this story. In any case, “Glory” for me is still amazing entertainment and a cult film. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Fama" ("Fame")
