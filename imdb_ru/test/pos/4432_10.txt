Before this documentary, I had never heard of architect Louis Canet. In this nearly two-hour documentary, which is going very fast, his son Nathaniel Kahn explores his father’s life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in Western Philadelphia, where he studied and taught. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton and La Jolla, California, as well as to New York to explore his father’s creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families, including his wife Esther, who refused to give him a divorce, and their daughter Sue Ann. Nathaniel includes members of his family. Louis also has another half-sister, Alexander Tayndzh from his father's previous relationship with Anna Tyne, a fellow architect. Louis's passion was his art.
