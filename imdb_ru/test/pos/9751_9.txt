I really enjoyed watching this movie! Only a few parts were slow, but it only set the mood and prepared for action. I thought this film was very informative, he taught me more about my Croatian heritage. I also learned more about Louise Arbor, and I can say that she influenced me very much. Time magazine named Louise Arbor one of the 100 most influential people in the world in April 2004. I recommend this movie to people who like historical films (obviously). This film was very dramatic, but still told the truth about the events in the former Yugoslavia. Louise Arbor is a brave hero, and I'm glad they shot a film in her honor. If you watch the movie, I hope you enjoy it.
