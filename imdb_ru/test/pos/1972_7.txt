The eXistenZ film is about a futuristic video game in the “pod” system, which is almost like virtual reality. The only copy of the video game is damaged when an attempt is made on the designer (Jennifer Jason Lee). If it is not repaired, many years and $ 38 million spent on development will be wasted. However, the only way to fix the game is to enter the game with the only person she believes she can trust (Jude Law). This film was pretty good, but in fact it’s not filmed until the very end of the film. The best thing about this movie was a twist to the end. Definitely worth a look. 7/10
