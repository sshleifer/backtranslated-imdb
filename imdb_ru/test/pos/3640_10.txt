This film, based on the real story of Gerrit Wolffard, is one of the best films I've ever seen about race relations in South Africa; A very good lesson from the history of the 1980s riots in South Africa. I included this on the scale of American history X, because it depicts how a young man can be seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how “certain” segments of the Christian church taught the false doctrine of race to justify injustice. <br /> <br /> This is a strong message of forgiveness and atonement, one of the few in today's films. The violence is well done to show the seriousness of Gerrit’s crimes and the greatness of his transformation. <br /> <br /> One word about Jan Ellis, who played Gerrit Wolfart. He carries you through the darkness of Gerrit's beginnings to his enlightened transformation. He went to some dark places as an actor and deserves praise for his performance. <br /> <br /> Another outstanding performance is Mfo Loving, who plays Moses Moremi, one of the victims of the crime of Gerrit. He was able to break out of certain places of pain that really touched you when you watched his performance. <br /> <br /> Very good movie for teens.
