My wife is a psychotherapist, and we watched it from beginning to end. I am a typical man and I can not stand chicks, but this film is incredible. If you want to see what it looks like for those experiencing this type of struggle, this film is for you. When I watched him, I felt sorry for him and others like him. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** Plus the fact that all people in the film, including people in a mental hospital, were real people in real life, made it more real. <br /> You need to see someone in the mental health profession!
