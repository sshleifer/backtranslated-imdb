Yes, I know that this film is intended as a comedy! And the humor is full! But the topic that people will become less intelligent in the future cannot be so contrived! I can not say that it will happen, but if we do not take care of our education system, it can be! I noticed that some schools no longer teach the facts! (Like history, geography, basic things). The focus is on learning practical skills! The theory behind most subjects may be boring, but it is necessary to understand how everything works! The film shows this ridiculous example when people grow crops with Gatorade instead of water! Well, we can laugh at that! But if you were never taught that water contains the minerals necessary for plant growth, how would you know! For me, this is a terrible concept! So now you understand why this topic is no longer funny! Perhaps Mike Judge is laughing, but at the same time he is warning people about a real disaster if education does not improve quickly! I take this movie too seriously! Yes of course! To each his own fun! I liked the work of Mike Judge (Beavis, Butt-head and Office)! In this, he knew how to be critical and funny at the same time! In “Idiocracy” I missed it! Most of the events are too absurd and, as I said earlier, very scary! I think that if you are in the mood, you will like this movie!
