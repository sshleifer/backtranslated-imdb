In the late sixties, director Sergio Corbucci made four Western spaghetti westerns - the classics “Mercenary”, “Great Silence”, “Specialists” and “Kompaniero”. Three of them, besides SPECIALISTS, constantly get into the top ten rated spaghetti westerns. Until recently, everything I saw was a compilation of very poor quality with some English, a bit of Italian, a fuzzy picture, and it was almost incomprehensible. Now, having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles (albeit in two languages), I can safely include SPECIALISTS in this group of four classics. Johnny Halliday is very good as a charismatic Hud, the infamous hand with a gun returning to Blackstone to investigate the death of his brother, whom the townspeople lynch for losing their savings. It includes a voluptuous beauty who owns a bank, the leader of the Mexican gangster El Diablo, who once was friends with Hud, an honest sheriff who dreams of better days, and a small group of hippies. western countries. This is not a desert west, shot somewhere in the Alps, and it is nice to look at it. Western style has a bit more nudity than I expect, but that's not bad. Sylvie Fennec is as beautiful as Sheba, who may be Hada's niece or dead brother's girlfriend ... it was never clear. This film deserves to be seen, and once again, we ask for a good DVD with all the trimmings - I think that the SPECIALISTS will be as famous as any other Western Corbucci, and this is really high praise.
