This is a good movie, no doubt, but with some strange aspects. Without spoiling anything, this happens only in 3 places: on a Sicilian farm, on a boat and on Ellis Island in New York. All shots are close, so we see nothing in a wide range. Interesting to save money? There are no street scenes anywhere, and we donâ€™t even see the boat, except on large plans. And the music ... what really happened with the play of Nina Simon's songs decades before they were released? I could do without the Milk River ... But, hey, before you think of me as a misanthrope, let me repeat, this is a very good movie, with heartbreaking moments, wonderful photos, wonderful characters and more accuracy than conventional (american) immigration experience efforts.
