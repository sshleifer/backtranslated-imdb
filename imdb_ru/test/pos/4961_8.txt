Being d.B. Fan Sweeney, I have been looking for this film for a long time. I recently rented a video and found it very enjoyable. There were some really funny scenes. The dysfunctional life of some characters was disturbing, but I think the film also showed that you can save your life on the right track or return it to its previous level if it is ruined.
