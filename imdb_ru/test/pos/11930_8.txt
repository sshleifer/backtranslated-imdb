Submit it. Someone makes a film about a technological slaughter in Colombia or Virginia, only the film was made by a guy who stayed alone at home (I know it isn’t, but was exposed to me) and the stars of Sean Astin from the Goonies !! Imagine that terrorists overwhelm buckets of water on ajar doors and marble, which is why you need to watch a movie. unfortunately, he doesn’t go all the way when there is a skateboard on the floor, on which evil Mexicans can stumble, but halfway you have to give him above 7, but not 9, because he has not lost his mind. Pity it seemed like it would be ridiculous, well worth cult status
