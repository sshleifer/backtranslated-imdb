Let me start by saying that I generally enjoyed The Long Kiss Goodnight. I would give 7/10. The Good: 1. Acting: Samuel L Jackson entertains almost any role. In this film, he does not play his usual character, the type that controls, instead, Gene Davis controls, and Sam is ready for the trip. His time in his lines is great and he is the star of the film. Gina Davis also plays Samantha Kane / Charlie Baltimore perfectly. She is a believable fighter, and I don’t think that many other actresses could play with Gina. 2. Action: this is a very intense film. Things almost always crash or explode, or someone is chasing someone else. The special effects are very good, especially for the age of 8 years. I see something on the green screen, but it doesn’t distract from the game very much. <br /> <br /> Bad: 1. Why did it take half of the film to create the plot? This film had to be edited at the script stage so that it did not work as long as before. Maybe a drama or something can last for so long, but people really have to be in the cinema all the time to sustain it. I think that if you can hold out in the first half, you will be pleasantly surprised by the second half. 2. Gina Davis has cold weather and a shirt, but she never seems cold. 3. Some things are unreal. Sam Jackson flies through a giant sign after he is thrown out of the room, and then he lands on a tree and just gets up. When you see this part, you will think it is a gag. total funny movie 7/10
