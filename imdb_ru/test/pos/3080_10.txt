I thought this movie was awesome, and I laughed so hard that I had to watch it twice to catch the missing pieces when I leaned over and held my stomach! The critic who viewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an IQ exceeding the size of their shoes, finding this film amusing, well, my IQ is about 135 ... I challenge this person to ask me questions and then have his own words! This film is great, and if the critic above was not such a boring idiot, he could smile at least once in his life and take things as easily as they were intended !!! <br /> <br /> The musical numbers were so figurative! EVERYONE while watching any movie about this period of time will notice men in tights and understand how much they differ from today's outfits and how funny we can find today's male population if they wore tights day after day! The idea to devote a song to a man dancing in tights was so fresh that no one could laugh !!! (Besides, seeing how hip-hop rappers do ballet is always hysterical - like a dancer, I did ballet and hip-hop and danced with men who had to do both ... !!!) <br /> <br /> I like this movie, if someone else has not seen it, do not listen to the criticism above ... watch it, and then decide for yourself !!!
