Worldwide, the unmistakable imprint of the American C.I.A. can be found in the many confusions that they left behind. At the beginning, their goals were simple: to spy, remove the enemyâ€™s agents, steal secret information, and destabilize unfavorable governments. Years pass, and although their mission remains similar, their covert operations now include spying on the house, discrediting US citizens and infiltrating American organizations that criticize the US government. This film, however, talks about the world hunt for C.I.A. on the infamous "Carlos, Jackel." The film is called "Task" and tells the story of Lieutenant Commander. Annibal Ramirez, (Aidan Quinn) is an officer of the US Navy, who strikingly resembles the leader of so many terrorist bombings. Recruited by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) from C.I.A. and Amos (Ben Kingsley), a special agent from the Israeli Mossad, Ramirez is secretly trained to look, set, penetrate an elusive organization and subsequently discredit the real Jekal who works for the Russians. This film is explosive and filled with wild chases, murders and chaos between countries. Quinn superbly and surprisingly artistically plays both sides of the war. Easily one of his best efforts. ****
