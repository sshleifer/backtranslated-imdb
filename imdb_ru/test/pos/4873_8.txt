Remember that college friend who always insisted that you shoot the weirdest movie? This is a film that he would make if he had the opportunity. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell you exactly what the “Sea of ​​Dust” is. This is pretending to be the story of a doctor who is being dragged into strange actions in the Black Forest. He goes there to help, but eventually he is caught between two young women, to whom he seems to have something. But it only scratches the surface. This is a movie in which random things happen ... and not so much. People are constantly beaten and stabbed. There are a couple of creepy little girls who seem to come out of Shining. Tom Savini is an imaginary religious figure who decides that she no longer wants to be imaginary. He has a plan to conquer the world by sharing the sufferings of Jesus. <br /> <br /> At some level this is a film about sex. This one without nudity, which was a disappointment, but it makes no sense to make mistakes. On the other hand, it is a paradise for masons. Unexpected things happen so often that they cease to be unexpected. By the time the doctor passes through his girlfriend's birth canal to be reborn, you will simply accept this on the faith of the crazy nature of the film. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film is quite verbose. Some of the items are driven home again and again. If you watch it with a bunch of stoned friends, this may be useful.
