This may not be 10 out of 10, but for me the jokes did not fail. I saw it many times when I was younger, and again on a DVD, I believe, and I laughed every time. Humor is simple and fun, this film was just one of many small films that Disney was throwing out at the time. I found places where people from the invisible loop saw people invisible. Expressions were priceless. Great movie. If ever there is an opportunity to see this, I recommend to look it up for a good fashion laugh. My favorite character in all the Dexter series was probably to be Dean Higgins, I like his voice, and I hear how upset he is, especially because his expression at the end was just hysterical for me.
