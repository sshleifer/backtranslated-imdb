When I first found out about this film, it was simply called “The Shepherd” and was supposed to be the film that would bring JCVD ​​back to the odds of a theatrical production. I was very excited about all this. <br /> <br /> By the time it was titled “Shepherd: Border Patrol,” I was delighted with this movie. With Isaac Fluorentin at the helm of the director, and J.J. Perry pulled the trick coordination, I almost choked on my pants while waiting. JCVD photos were released, kicking 8 different asses, as well as Scott Adkins, who seemed to be playing a villain, and I was stunned by the excitement. I thought it would be another epic martial arts situation, such as Lone Wolf McQuade. <br /> <br /> Then it all happened. I ordered it on an online blockbuster for $ 20 and was ready for anything. In the vandammefan.net reviews, my ideas have changed a bit, but I got ready. Mail arrived on the fourth day, and I tore up the parcel. My initial plan was to rush upstairs, tear off my face from the cardboard packaging, and then break up the case in the desired dynamics so that the disc would fall into my DVD player. However, I looked at the case for 10 minutes and then inserted the disc into the player and watched the movie. <br /> <br /> By the time it was over, I was a fool in the pool. “The Shepherd” is definitely one of my favorite live movies ever made for video, and it makes “Derailed” even more like a toilet mess. Of course, some fights were short, but they were VERY cool. The shootings were great, like Scott Adkins, who MUST be a villain, unlike the forgotten Stephen Lord. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Seriously.
