I always had the idea that Korean films are all about comedy and drama, but “Christmas in the Fall” changed my point of view. This movie is very simple. It should not have any melodramatic scenes or over the top comedy scenes. Not a single scene where the actors scream loudly. Not even the scene where the actor and actress kiss, not even a simple kiss. And, nevertheless, this film is able to reach the audience in ways that I know exist. The ending of the film left me speechless. I don't even cry, but my eyes were red. This film left me feeling that I can hardly describe in words. <br /> <br /> I don’t think I can recommend this film to anyone, but I recommend this film to people who want to watch a real movie. 9.4 / 10
