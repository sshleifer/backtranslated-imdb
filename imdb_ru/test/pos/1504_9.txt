This is an interesting movie. I think this is very funny, although the humor is very black. Fulci is good and fun to play yourself, it’s really funny and really crazy “self-portrait” of the artist (“I make horror films. If I were in love movies, no one would buy tickets ...”). And this is really a SEXUAL film: almost all the time there is some kind of “action” or tension; and a lot of sexy girls / women ... Maybe this is the essence of why someone starts doing movies / art ... This is a real psychedelic trip, which is best seen a little drunk or something like that. Of course, there are really horrible scenes, because this is Lucio Fulci. In fact, some of these scenes are pretty disgusting. In any case, this is one of the three best and most complete films of Fulci, which I have seen (the rest are “The House at the Cemetery” and “Zombies. In fact, the script, in my opinion, is rather resourceful. You could see this film as a portrait of an extreme neurotic or a person who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (buzz words): the character has an obsessive need to confess to "crimes" or evil thoughts; Especially crimes he did not even commit. And all the time he asks himself: would i do that? what if i am How did I do it? I did it? Do I want to do it? He exaggerates and exaggerates his thoughts. I am sure that Fulci was interested in psychology, and perhaps even read something from the region; in his film “The House at the Graveyard”, for example, there is a character named Freudstein. This is perhaps the most concentrated and frankly personal film that Fulci made. I also like the simplicity of the pictures / pictures in this film. The only thing that bothers me a bit is sadism, especially with respect to women; I do not quite understand why? Is it entertainment? This is art? That's horrible? In any case, by and large, this really interesting and well-made film is definitely a recommended classic film, at least for fans or anyone interested in this genre. For others, this may be too much.
