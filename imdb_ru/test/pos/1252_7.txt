As an explanation, Disney's The Kid has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Charlie Chaplin of 1921 of the same name. What we have is a pleasant enough, though incredible, pleasant family comedy that only Disney guys can provide. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis, at a change of pace, plays the image consultant egocentric padded shirt. He humiliates not only his clients, but also people close to him. You know that he will have to change before the final credits appear. <br /> <br /> In his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of the character of Willis, like that of an 8-year-old nerd, playing with sweet conviction in a pie. Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these children somewhere). This forces Willis to come to grips with his past and well ... you know the rest. <br /> <br /> It seems that Willie's love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as his executive assistant. Both have little, since most of the film involves the interaction between the characters of Willis and Breslin. <br /> <br /> “Kid,” although not the best of Disney movies, is nevertheless one of those that you can sit down and watch with your family and leave with a warm feeling.
