I caught it at the Chicago IndieFest and I must say that YOU ARE ONE, much funnier than other reviews, and even a website will make you think. Not funny, but sick, perverted HA HA Wedding Crashers, I can't believe she just said that, but it's damn funny. <br /> <br /> Jessica Bol, who deservedly won the best female role, is amazing to watch. There is never a moment when you think about, I watch a movie, and she is an actress. She is too damn real for words. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are two scenes that I still giggle about, and I will not give them up, but in one she talks in the bathroom about how much she gets. paid for the performance of a certain service and how “cool” it is. (I almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking about the same thing !!!) <br /> <br /> In another, she talks about how adolescents define “sex” compared to adults, and if it’s not so the most true dialogue that I have heard in the movie for a long time, I do not know what it is.
