Based on Stephen Hawking's Short History of Time, this amazing film by Eroll Morris documents the life and work of one of the greatest minds in the history of astronomy. Despite his debilitating disease, ALS, he made a great contribution to science, as a talented scientist could only dream of. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a story about Hawking’s childhood and how he was a bad student. recognizably bright. He made his way through college and university, where he was diagnosed - a disease that takes away his normal functions of his body, but will allow him to continue to live and think perfectly. <br /> <br /> Morris discusses how brilliantly Stephen's Mind developed from childhood to the present, once his mother tells how, when she was pregnant, she prophetically bought an astronomical atlas to read while in hospital. Hawking himself talks about the timing of his discoveries, and Morris interviews close friends and colleagues who are fortunate enough to make friends with a great man. <br /> <br /> He tells how he was first intrigued by the discovery that the Universe is expanding just as the star will expand. We also know that the stars eventually die and become so-called “black holes”, if so, does the universe not begin to shrink, reversing until we reach the “big crisis”? as Hawking says. And when the universe begins to recede, will time change? When I asked this question, I began to think that death could not be the end, perhaps one day the day would come back, and our death will become our rebirth, and our birth will be our death. The universe is one big cycle, like everything else in life. <br /> <br /> This is what Hawking tells us, everything in the universe repeats itself. This is completely logical and can make your mind think about a million ways to think about it. That's why I love this movie and why he should see !!! 11 out of 10 ... Morris never stops beating!
