I thought that anywhere, but here was a good movie. It featured two great actresses, Susan Sarandon and Natley Portman, and when I heard that they were being filmed in the same film, I did not watch it. Overall, it was a pretty nice movie. He had moments where I felt that they were trying their best, and there was some really overworked and worn stuff, but there was nothing in the film that I would just hate. I even liked the way they used the pop-up view Uncredited Thora Birch, and all the little happy / sad moments are touching and effective. If you want to watch this movie, go ahead, because, although I do not recommend it, this is not something you should avoid, and a rating of 5.9 seems unfair in my opinion.
