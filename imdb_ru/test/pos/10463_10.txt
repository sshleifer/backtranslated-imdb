Sometimes itâ€™s hard to watch movies with subtitles (in this case Danish), but watching is worth it. As the story progresses, the rationale for choosing two sisters to take care of their father is doubtful, but their society is different. Their choice leaves them alone until the French come. It may be asked why the Frenchwoman came to them to stay, and this never fully develops. The holiday, which occurs later because of unexpected money from France, is a source of unusual pleasure for everyone who visits, and something that they have not experienced before. This provides worthy thanks for the kindness shown to the guest. Filmed with a dark aura and a manifestation of poverty, this is a wonderful experience for the viewer.
