All the characters in this cartoon were funny. Norman, the keeper of the Vikings, had some catchy phrases, and the master of the skull, the bad guy, would always swear to kill Max with insane rattling. Writing is the best. <br /> <br /> I was stuck to the set, when it happens, when I'm younger. If they release a DVD with all the episodes they made, I would be forced to buy it. This is the cartoon of Conan the Barbarian, whom I miss most of all since childhood. I think these cartoons are the most underrated of all the great cartoons. I used to watch these cartoons on channel 13 in the Los Angeles area. <br /> <br /> I remember that the owl was always afraid, warning Max that he had problems, and that he was elected. Max did not believe that he was elected and always brought trouble to the owl. Norman was less talkative, but his simplicity was funny. He said things like “I eat monsters for breakfast” when he fought with them. And then, when he fought with a zombie, he said: "I eat zombies for ... it doesn't matter." Classic comedy and action movie. <br /> <br /> I vote to give Mighty Max.
