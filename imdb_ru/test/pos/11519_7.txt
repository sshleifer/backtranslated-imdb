Exciting and funny bad, “Lights of New York” is the first of all radio stations that almost never came to light. <br /> <br /> Two naive barbers (Eddie and Jean) from another city associated with bootleggers and ultimately resist talking. When one of the bootleggers shot a policeman, the police began to approach, and Hawk (who shot the officer) decides to testify to Eddie's murder, ordering his henchman to "take him for a walk." But Hawk himself takes a bullet in the turn, which will surprise a few. <br /> <br /> Filmed in one week at a cost of $ 23,000, Ogni was originally conceived as a two-year-old, but Foy took advantage of it. Absence of Jack Warner to extend it to six. When Warner discovered this, he ordered Foy to cut it to its original short. Only when an independent exhibitor offered $ 25,000 for the film, Warners actually watched the film, which earned a staggering $ 1.3 million. <br /> <br /> It can be seen that now this is an extremely ridiculous play, which varies from bearable (Eugene Pallett) to a trance (Eddie Gran in a particularly risky scene), and most of the game is on the vaudeville level. Since this is an early walkie-talkie (it was preceded by 4 partial walkie-talkies), this is all that the characters are doing, and very slowly. The script seems improvised, the visual style is absent (except for the scene taken in the silhouette), and the scenes spread continuously. Title cards are intertwined, which excessively announces characters and locales. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, “Lights” is an exciting experience, as we watch the actors and the team struggling with alien technology and constantly changing movies. <Br /> <br /> Catch if you can
