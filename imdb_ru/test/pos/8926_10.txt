I read the maliciously hidden remarks in previous comments, which said that this movie shows a bunch of gay guys fussing around their gaiety. <br /> <br /> This could not be more deceptive. "Eighteen" is not a gay movie. There are only three funny characters in it, and one of them is a victim of the prejudice of people like the one who wrote the comments, despite the recognition of justice. <br /> <br /> Pip's grandfather was not gay. The tender scene of a soldier and his sergeant is a male bond at a crucial moment of death. But some people are horrified by the kiss and the cherished scene in which the courage flies from a man killed by a bomb. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is Pip's direct relationship with this sweet little girl, and their views are social commitment and parenthood. <br /> <br /> Ralph Ryus www.r1313.info
