Well, I would say that this is a very pleasant and somewhat touching film, despite its flaws. I did not believe for a moment that Mattau knew what a dentist was. In addition, Houn's character seemed to recover rather quickly from suicidal depression at the beginning of the film. Not to mention the fact that all this seemed pretty ridiculous. Nevertheless, the film was a success thanks to a good rhythm, humor and its stars. Matthau may not have been a dentist, but he was as funny as he usually is. Bergman brought more sensitivity to the film (especially during the scene where she and Mattau go out for a drink after work), as well as a lot of humor. I believe that it was her performance that made my brother pay attention to this film after he heard a couple of scenes. Houn's play deserves attention, although Oscar may have done a bit already. In fact, do not take this film too seriously, and you will like it.
