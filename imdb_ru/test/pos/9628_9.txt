Five Fingers of Death marked the beginning of a passion for American kung-fu film, but I remember seeing him for the first time as the King of Boxer in New Yorkâ€™s Chinatown, without bad duplication and a few Americans. I was also fortunate enough to see the American premiere of "Five Fingers of Death" in Times Square, New York. What a contrast it turned out ... the same film, but a different audience. <br /> <br /> In Chinatown this film acquired a more serious shade from the audience. It is because the real voices of the actors (in Chinese) were heard that this film became more believable. For many years, films about violent kung fu were shown in the Chinese theater (The 1972 Boxer from Shandong beat them all in the blood), so choreography and plot action were the main attraction. Competing scenes have not yet been used, so the storyline seemed fresh. Every great kung-fu movie had wonderful, vile villains that you wanted to see to get their title, and FFoD also had them. Star Lee Law was a famous actor in Chinese theaters. Most Chinese viewers really liked this film. The audience leaving this film gives me final satisfaction. <br /> <br /> In Times Square, this film was a fighter ... perhaps unintentionally. I also liked it here, but for different reasons. The crowd was ethnic and rather energetic. From the very beginning the movie made you laugh. As soon as the audience heard these strange British accents from those Chinese actors, the film turned into a cruel and bloody cartoon. Most American viewers saw this type of blood in a horror film, not in an action movie. The sequence of actions blew up the audience. Unfortunately, the film studios saw that they liked it so much that bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became the formula of kung fu. <br /> <br /> I had fun watching this movie with an American audience, but I liked it a lot more. Chinatown. Some films may pass the test of time, but a duplicate version of FFoD cannot. The original "King Boxer" is still enjoyable ... CLASSIC!
