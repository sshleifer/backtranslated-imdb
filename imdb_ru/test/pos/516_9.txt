I did not see this film until it appeared on television because I doubted comic films. Since the days of the TV series Batman, Spawn, Judge Dredd, and many other pathetic bombs, page 13, I dodged anything. I would like to ask myself: “Why can't someone shoot a film with an“ R ”rating and stay true to the story, how difficult is it?” And finally, my prayers were heard with a blade. This film appears directly on the screen with obvious violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, good against evil, etc. Yes, of course, many militants contain all these goodies, and most of them are bombed. But not Blade, the film was shot just right, without going overboard, providing a good duration and never a boring moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Blade is truly one of the best true comic films I've seen in a long time.
