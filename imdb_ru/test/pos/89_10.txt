This is a piece of cinematic beauty, and it shows more of Québec’s culture to others than probably any other work from the province of La Belle. This leads everyone to the perception of culture from the first person, to the extent that you want your hair to stick on the spot and live, breathe and eat everything, Maurice Richard. The book does the same as the short one, and I am glad that for all the time I spent learning French in high school, this required reading in both languages. <br /> <br /> I thought it was brilliant for Roch Carrier to tell this story. His molasses accent has brought great realism to the story. The animation was also good, very surreal, which suggests that this is a bizarre dream, imagined by the best of the past days. <br /> <br /> Again, as a symbol of the culture of Quebec, it is unsurpassed. It is felt that the tourist is slowly cooking on a wood stove. This entire film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be a Canadian and calling on all of us to appreciate the wonderful things of the family and our roots. I'm from Ontario, and this film made me fall in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard Va Tohurs Vivr Dans Nos Konurs.
