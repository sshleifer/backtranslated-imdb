<br /> <br /> When I first heard about this in 1997 over a cup of coffee with friends, I decided to check it out. The only problem was that he was on a small screen in one of my local cinemas. <br /> <br /> It didn’t hurt to enjoy watching a great movie with a first-class actor in Aidan Quinn’s film, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. The whole movie kept me glued to my place. <br /> <br /> I just did not find flaws in this wonderful film, I give him my highest recommendations to those who love thrillers. I am very proud that it is in my collection. <br /> <br /> 10/10 (I do not distribute it lightly).
