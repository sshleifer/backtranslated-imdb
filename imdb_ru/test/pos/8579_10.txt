This is a great movie. When two people with different backgrounds and social status think that they have nothing to offer each other, and in the end they get what they need each other, this is evidence that they know the heart. Sometimes we ask ourselves why one man with a woman or vice versa, and external manifestations tell us one thing, but what they offer to each other from the inside, which we cannot see, is surprising and inexplicable. When Nimi thought that Matthew had nothing to offer her, and when Matthew was looking only for escape (because he had an open marriage with his wife Jenny), in the end they realized that they could not and did not want to exist without the Other. They were worth it to resist what family and friends think, and what society says it is right to be with each other. This film restores my faith in love.
