For me, this wonderful slide of the film carries multiple joyful views. It's about the tangled lives of three completely different people. Holly Hunter is an obsessive producer of workaholics. Albert Brooks plays an unassuming but brilliant journalist. William Hurt - a friendly, but stupid new child in the block, leading the news. <br /> <br /> The classic love triangle appears with a stunningly witty and self-deprecating Brooks in love with the Hunter, but Hart is certainly attracted to her. <br /> <br /> This movie works on many levels. At the very least, this is a brilliant comedy in which one airliner flies so thickly and quickly that each viewing brings a new crop, which you may have missed last time. This is also a film about attractiveness and unrealized romance. <br /> <br /> But perhaps most importantly, the film views modern obsession with appearance and its ultimate triumph over intelligence as a valuable human attribute. This is personified by the rapid success of the character Hurt's career, in contrast to the relative decline of Brooks. <br /> <br /> Although the film is fifteen years old, there are some very important messages about current news and the continuing decline in journalistic standards. . <br /> <br /> This film is classic in every sense, and itâ€™s hard to understand why it is so neglected.
