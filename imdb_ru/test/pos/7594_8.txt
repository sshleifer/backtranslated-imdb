There are worse ways to spend the evening than watch this movie, although it is a bit predictable. Drew Barrymore does an excellent job with the role of an outcast in this film - an excellent choice of actors. It was a bit hard for me to believe that popular girls finally accept her - in my experience, this crowd has more memory than hers, and knowing what the terrible nature of Drew (ostrich feathers?) they are far away, regardless of the rumors that her brother is drumming. (And does Kole Slaw Food really make HIM so popular? I doubt it). As for the support of the character Drew, to win as a reporter - well, I would hope that she could come up with a story long before the prom. A little far-fetched. Having said all this, it was a simple piece of fluff that would be interesting until you expect too much.
