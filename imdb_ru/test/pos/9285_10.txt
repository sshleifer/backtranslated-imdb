This program is definitely my favorite non-comedy TV comedy. Australia produces very few good programs - most of the TV that I watch (and I live in Australia) is from the USA and England. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this show is how contradictory it is. For example, when they passed through numerous security barriers at the APEC summit, pretending to be Canadian diplomats. <br /> <br /> The show consists of previously taken tricks, a general satirical discussion of current world events, and sometimes on the stage of a scene. They all get together to make an incredible, extremely funny TV show. Segments, such as “Ad Road-test” and “Message from Osama bin Laden,” are fun. For those who are interested in watching a fun satirical television comedy - then this is definitely the show that you should watch. <br /> <br /> All the guys are great and work great, entertaining you for half an hour. <br /> <br /> I would rate it as 10/10.
