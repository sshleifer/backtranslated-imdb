I liked “Den brysomme mannen” http://ow.ly/PTTp (my wife didn’t do this, so I watched it several times for several days.) <br /> <br /> Reviewers were mostly confused - most agreed that it is allegorical but not about anything; "Heaven", "Hell", "Socialism", "Capitalism"? <br /> <br /> Most people do not want to run away, and, in fact, it is forbidden if you use most of these options. <br /> <br /> So, presumably, you should project your favorite concern / prejudice / fear onto it. <br /> <br /> So I would say that we are talking about the Epicurean life. Lively desaturated color, literally in the film, figuratively interpreted.
