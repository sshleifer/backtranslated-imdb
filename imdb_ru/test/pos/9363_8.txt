RKO Radio Pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even managed to nominate it for the Best Picture Academy Award. The game, the script, the continuity and so on, everything is almost perfect; and this story is worth 82 minutes of the viewer. Despite the fact that the picture gently depicts the real life story, making the murder victim a Jew, not a homosexual, most viewers will see the victim a homosexual-Jew — such disguises will never work, and they may not have. <br /> <br /> I could have figured out a few details, but just for fun. In 1947, there was no night theater in Washington, DC, and if there was a desire, Robert Mitchum and his friend would not talk in the series . There was not a single bar where KI could pick up a pretty blonde. NO ONE! If Robert Ryan wanted to read the latest article about the murder, he should have bought the Daily News; not The Times-Herald, Evening Star, and, of course, not “knowing nothing”, The Washington Post. But these little things do not take away from this classic. <br /> <br /> The film greatly benefits from the absolute absence of a musical score, except during the credits. I have only seen this in a few films. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, since 1995, we represent TMC, where some liberal chatter about what the public was ready for in 1947. . blah blah blah! As if this fool has some business to judge him better. I would say that the former American soldiers in 1947 - “The Greatest Generation” - were much smarter - and had better values ​​- than some commentator, film historian or other sage in 1995. Put a sock in it!
