A few years ago I first saw this remake of the classic of the sixties with Mini Coopers, and I remember that I really liked it. Now, two years later, he was shown on television, and I just wanted to know if I would still like it as much as when I saw it in the movies. Well, the answer is yes. <br /> <br /> A film about a team of robbers who will perform one last job in Venice, Italy. The plan is flawless and the execution is perfect. They run away and they don’t have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is one problem that they did not take into account: someone in their own ranks does not like to divide the prey, but wants to keep it all for himself, even if it means that he will have to kill the rest of the team members. But all but one survive, and they crave revenge. A year later, this time in Los Angeles, the surviving team members create a clever and cunning plan to steal gold and take revenge on the traitor ... <br /> <br /> The story itself, of course, is not very original, as this a remake of the original 1969 film, but it has a lot of goodies to help you forget about it. This is a typical film about robberies and action movies, but certainly one of the best of its kind. The action is very good, the landscapes and Venice are real candy, the story is fine, and the special effects are amazing. Even acting is very good, which you don’t often see in action movies. I have to admit that I really liked what I saw, and I give this film deservedly 7.5 / 10.
