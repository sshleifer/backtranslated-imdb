Nurse Betty is a really interesting movie. I think we all know someone who is so convinced that the characters in the soap opera are real, that you cannot explain them by any means, that they are just actors, not real people. <br /> <br /> 'Nurse Betty is not a nurse at all. In real life, she is an ordinary housewife who works in a diner. In order to escape from her terrible husband and problems in her unhappy life, she became a very devoted fan of the soap opera. After she witnesses her husband's murder, she is shocked and loses control of reality. She thinks she is in love with one of the heroes of the soap opera, the doctor, and decides that she will visit him and create a family with him. The bounty hunters, though, think she knows too much, and follow her to kill her. <br /> <br /> As I said, the topic is quite recognizable (if you leave professional assassins and the murder out of it) and the film was funny. The story was well set, and the actors did a great job. It was all that I always want to see when watching a comedy. I give it 7.5 / 10.
