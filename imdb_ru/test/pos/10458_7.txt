The film begins almost painfully slowly, "romance" (yawn), which seems to be off the course (the whole part of the plan ...) Then, after about an hour in this solemn film "Holiday" You should pay attention to this first hour. The holiday is still solemn, but humorous. Suddenly detached and slightly small characters come to life, and all (you AND characters) leave a sense of enrichment with this experience. <br /> <br /> Women will love this. Christians of all kinds will enjoy the deep faith that the characters demonstrate. Not my favorite movie of all time - no dinosaurs OR laser beams, after all - but definitely a movie I'm happy to see. Do not miss. <br /> <br /> Jim
