I'm a solid fan of the Dads Army, and nothing will ever change that. I have all the tapes, DVDs and audiobooks, and every time I watch / listen to them, they are completely new. <br /> <br /> Movie. The film is a repetition of certain episodes, “Man and Hour”, “Enemy at the Gates”, “School of Battle” and many others with a different advantage. The introduction of a new general instead of Captain Square was a brilliant step, especially when he did not cash the check (which is rarely done now). <br /> <br /> This follows from the first years of receiving equipment and uniforms, start-up and training. In general, a great movie for a boring Sunday. <br /> <br /> Two draws. One of them - fake sophisticated accents of the Germans (well, and the Germans can not pronounce the letter "W", like us) and "Two" - casting Liz Fraser instead of the familiar Janet Davis. I like Liz in other films, such as hand luggage, but she doesn't carry it properly, and Janet Davies would be the best choice.
