Tiny Toons is the first cartoon that I remember when I watched as a child, and I liked every minute of it. When I was four or five years old, my parents bought the video “How I spent my vacation.” I watched it again and again until I uttered every new word. Well, a few days ago, my three-year-old cousin came, and I had to entertain him. I decided to show him this old relic of my childhood. <br /> <br /> I'm new, he will laugh, but I was surprised how much I laughed. As in any movie and episode of Tiny Toons, humor is more based on wacky and humorous mood and is a huge success. Beetles, Baba, Brave Duck, Mathon Pig and Fifi - everyone experiences amazing adventures from rafting Bugs and Babs with a little help from Superman, Brave Duck and Pig Maton go to the biggest amusement park to ride only monorail, and Elmira goes to a strange quest to find cute kittens in safari-country. <br /> <br /> Some of the classic humor stand in this Tiny Toon Adventure and are one of the best wacky comedies I've ever seen. My favorite joke was to be a monorail when Hamton and Pluki arrive, ride the monorail and drive away (to the horror of Plaka). No matter how old you are, you will laugh to tears without encountering tongue and nude. <br /> <br /> Tiny Toons Adventures: how I spent my vacation. Starring Voices: Charles Adler, Tress McNeill, Joe Alaska and Don Messick. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 stars.
