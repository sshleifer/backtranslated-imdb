I usually find it difficult to watch television films, too long commercial breaks break my concentration, and I give up and find a good book. This, however, made me put up with add-ons and stay with him until the end. I understand that the film is based on real events, but it was never disclosed, why did it take so long to find Danny? They had his name, and I would guess his social security number. Although he moved a lot, it would seem that he would be found as soon as his number was entered for work, etc. The actors seemed a bit old for this part and buried with a metal object when the excavated ones had no rust. These were only technical glitches and did not take from the file. For LifeTime, it was better than most.
