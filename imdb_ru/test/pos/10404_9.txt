Being a big fan of horror, especially Asian horror, I saw tons of films, but this film is outstanding. What for? He has a plot (which, unfortunately, is quite rare in horror films). The actors did a good job. It looks like a real documentary (even if it’s not). It does not get boring for a moment. The director skillfully combines the plot with the actions of a certain Japanese magic cult (perhaps this cult never existed, but still, this is plausible). It reminded me of the same gorgeous movie Forbidden Siren. <br /> <br /> The only thing that annoyed me in the film is Hori’s character, a psychic, but this is subjective. <br /> I recommend this movie to all lovers of horror quality. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
