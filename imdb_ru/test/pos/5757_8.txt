Bottom is my favorite comedy series since I watched it on television, and the film is even better if you are a lower level fan, I say that you definitely need to buy it !!! the plot is that Eddie and Richie run a hotel called Paradise Guest House, but not everything is good for them, because customers leave until the famous actress comes, they try their best to impress her, but not everyone is doing well, this is upbringing for the British Cinema, so buy this and you laugh with laughter. also starring Simon Peji (Shaun of the Dead), as well as Bill Sue (love really), it may not be very good at the box office or, apparently, on this site, but do not listen to them, buy it, and I I swear you will love it
