Together with the even more underrated film The Sun Shines Brightly, Wagon Master was one of Ford’s favorite films. It is a Western of exceptional beauty and narrative purity, well-played by Ford’s “stock company” members, including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond, and Harry Carey, Jr. Like almost all Ford films, this is meditation, freedom and community. This is also noteworthy for a much more positive image of the Indians than in most Ford films. Ford, despite all its flaws, remains the supreme poet of American democracy.
