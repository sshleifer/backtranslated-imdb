My rating of 10/10, of course, applies only if you are ready to completely and completely reject *. Because you know that only John Waters can do it. In Pink Flamingos (his directorial debut), he portrays two families fighting in battle to see who can be the dirtiest man alive. What God ultimately does largely answers the question. But even beyond that, the film is basically an excuse for the shock of people going beyond what they usually imagine. You better have a very strong stomach to watch this movie. Even some of these lines are simply amazing. <br /> <br /> * Otherwise, avoid this movie as if you were an Ebola virus!
