The film tells about the horror of "extradition", which is present here and now, and includes a transnational broadcast of all participants. Nobody goes crazy frivolously, because we see the blindness of players when they cut out their own piece of the world game, piling up hatred and suffering on their “enemies” and themselves in equal measure. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the sympathetic assistant of the senator (played by Peter Sarsgaard in a flashing style) and the real overlords of Washington electrifies. Meanwhile, in the field of view, a new CIA officer (Jake Gyllenhaal) is undergoing tremendous changes in his attitude toward the newly discovered US coziness through torture. Suddenly, despite the fact that he rejected what he initially silently justified, you need to ask why on earth anyone who calls him civilized is standing and watching how someone is humiliated and insulted in this way? There are few heroes in the film - perhaps the flawed and hesitant CIA man Gyllenhaal is the exception and indulgence necessary to make the film give hope. <br /> <br /> The sad fact, of course, is that this film is not an invention at all, but a wake-up call for those who have a bit of propriety left in them. The awful truth is that we in the UK and the USA have lost the moral conspiracy, and this film shows how low we are ready to go. All this in the name of freedom! There is a wonderful line in the script that says torture is a sure way to increase the number of our enemies. This is already happening in real life, and we need to hear the message that this film delivers, and begin to use our power and money much smarter! It seems the idea is that any of us who claim that extradition, torture and violation of basic human rights are necessary to protect our way of life are as stupid and stupid as jihadists and suicide bombers. <br /> Everyone praises the feelings of a talented South African director, who is following the gross injustice of how power is exercised, and a group of main actors from the United States and other countries. Oh, and by the way, the film has a sting in the tail with the end of a clever and thought-provoking surprise (which I won't give away). <br /> <br /> I saw the film in early London Preview, so that it was not yet widely written, but I am glad to say that the flow of less than luminous reviews seems to be turning. The BBC review was very strongly supported, and they (and I) suspect that most of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple specifications of Hollywood - where the good guys and the bad guys are cardboard cutouts. Hence the reason that many of the truly great films of the year are increasingly becoming indie and / or non-American.
