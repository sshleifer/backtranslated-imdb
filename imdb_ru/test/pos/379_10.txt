This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and one of his most underrated ones. I believe that it definitely exceeds “Psycho” or “Birds” for technical mastery and brilliance. This is a terrible, intense, darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for a while. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcock’s most memorable villains as a hating father who is fixated on his mother (but this isn’t true, isn’t most of Hitchcock’s villain boys?) Bruno. This is an awesome, awesome show that covers the entire movie. His character is obsessed, obviously homosexual (look at these intentionally feminine connections and hear what he is called "European"), strangely charming and dangerous to crossbreeding. Farley Granger surely knows about this, as he got entangled in Bruno’s dirty web after the pair met on the train. Bruno, knowing some inside information about the affairs of Guy, offers two "exchange" murders for the benefit of each other. Walker will kill Granger's slutty, treacherous wife, who interferes with his marriage with beautiful Anna, while Granger will kill Bruno's father, whom he hates so much. Everyone is happy, right? Win-win, as Bruno claims? Wrong. Granger forgets about the indecent proposal, but the obsessed Walker does not. He commits his murder and is determined to pursue Granger until he completes his part of the deal. "Strangers" turn into an exciting and intense game of cat and mouse in the capable hands of Hitch. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock was absolutely amazing in creating intriguing minor characters and plotting scenes. We have a whore Miriam, the alienated wife of Granger, pregnant with another man. She lustfully eats a phallic horn with ice cream, while at the same time openly eating Bruno with her eyes. Barbara Morton, Anna's sister, is a deceptively cute, but clever and cunning girl who makes the roughest comments you will hear from a girl wearing glasses in photos from the 50s. Senator Morton is authoritative and engrossed in himself. It is one of the wildest films ever made by Hitchcock, and, typical of the movie Hitch, is a bit sexually detailed. <br /> <br /> This fits into the noir category with a focus on murder, a lie. and deception and dark cinema. Walker Walnut is one for all times, and Granger is a compelling problem hero. Roman is probably weaker than the other two, and I never believed her relationship with Granger. Nevertheless, overwhelming positives nullify small negatives, and it's safe to say that this is one of the BEST American films ever made. <br /> <br /> Just see what Hitch is doing here - originality, technical skill, We see the murder of Miriam, reflected in her broken glasses. Playing tennis turns into one of the most exciting and intense scenes you've ever seen. Innocent fairground turns into a place of murders and dirty accidents. Walker mercilessly burst the balloon of the little boy (Hitch obviously liked what he saw in the Third Man). Children's pleasure from riding on the carousel turns into screaming, rapid horror. Hitch undermines the usual everyday events that are not similar to others. <br /> <br /> The filming work here is one of the best ever seen in the Hitchcock movie, and the premise is dying. It runs smoothly, exudes refinement and devilish charm. The walk-through relationship between the characters Walker and Granger is great - the Granger "do it or die" tennis match is just as important as saving the villain Walker with incriminating evidence lost to the sewer. Hitch turned his villain into a vile, disgusting, but sympathetic and strangely charming (did anyone else find him oddly attractive, more than Granger?) get easier out of the drain. In any case, we need it. He holds the key to the story. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, you can never see a stranger approach in the same way. <br /> <br /> Amazing. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
