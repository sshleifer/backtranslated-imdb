"Seduced" - a strange work in the works of Clint Eastwood. By 1971, he became widely known as a militant star, not only Westerns (the genre in which he first made his name), but also war films (for example, Where the Eagles Dare) and thrillers about police officers (such as Kugan Bluff) . "). However, although “Seduced” takes place in wartime (American Civil War), and was made by Don Siegel, who previously shot Eastwood in Clef's Bluff, and later that year in “Dirty Harry”, not a militant in the traditional sense. In most of his previous films, Eastwood played an active role, but here his role is largely passive - his character, Sergeant John McBurney, is a wounded fugitive who is forced to rely on the charity of women to survive. Even while serving in his unit, Macburnie did not take an active part in the conflict; he is a Quaker, whose religious principles prohibit him from carrying arms, and he served in the Union forces as a medical orderly. <br /> <br /> The film unfolds in Louisiana near the end of the war and begins with the fact that the wounded McBurney was discovered by a young girl named Amy and returned to her boarding school. The school is small, with two teachers and several girls. Although some of the girls are ardent supporters of the Confederation's cause and want to pass it on to the authorities, Headmaster Martha Farnsworth decides to shelter him and care for him, fearing that his injuries can be fatal if sent to one of the knowingly harsh Confederation camps. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that McBurney strictly follows the teachings of his religion regarding pacifism, he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following his teachings on the sin of fornication, and when he begins to recover, he fully uses he had the opportunity to use his charms both on a staff and on older girls, and he won the sympathy of many of them, including Miss Farnsworth, her assistant Edwin and Carol, one of the older girls. It seems that even twelve-year-old Amy is somehow childishly in love with him. In the sexually depressed atmosphere of the women's school, his presence causes jealousy and hatred, and Miss Farnsworth, rejected in favor of the depraved Carol, is preparing a terrible revenge. (Interestingly, the only woman confronting McBurney's persuasion is Holly, the black slave Miss Farnsworth, although he is trying to win her, indicating that he is fighting for the release of people like her). <br /> <br /> “Seduced” was described as an anti-war film, but it seems to me that this is a misconception. The film is not about the rights and grievances of a civil war or war in general. The only acts of violence that we see are committed by non-combatants, and they are motivated by the desire for personal revenge, rather than zeal for the cause of the Confederation. It would be more accurate to view the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that may be caused by the special circumstances of the war. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the school, located in the beautiful old mansion Antebellum, seems like a war island of peace. The building is made in the classical style associated with order, harmony and restraint, but the story that unfolds within its walls is confusion, passion and violence, qualities associated with the Gothic school of writing, which in the 19th century was often regarded as the antithesis of classicism. The film can be considered as falling under the so-called "southern gothic" tradition in American cinema and literature. <br /> <br /> The film did not have much success at the box office, possibly because Eastwood was cast against the type. Perhaps this is not his best film, but he showed that he can expand his range and play something other than action heroes. (In Play Misty for Me, his first film as a director, made next year, he again had to play a “passive” character in danger from a vengeful woman). There are some very good performances of female actors, in particular, Geraldine Page as Martha Farnsworth, a respectable middle-aged virgin, but internally a woman with strong passions. (There are hints that she may have had an affair with a man whom she used to be her brother). There is also a good contribution from Elizabeth Hartman as a shy repressed Edvina who falls in love with McBurnie and rejects the idea of ​​revenge, and from young Pamelin Ferdin - Amy. (Amy is an animal lover. The key moment in the film comes when McBurnie kills his beloved turtle. Therefore, it is interesting that at a later age Ferdin became an animal rights activist). The only character I was less passionate about was Carol Jo Ann Ann Harris, who seemed too modern, like a rocking seventies chick, carried over to the past in the 1860s. The film is different emotionally rich "hothouse" atmosphere, which creates in it Siegel. It will not be a film for every taste; some will find him too overwhelmed and melodramatic, and some will find him misogynist. (Judith Krist called this film for "women haters and sadists"). Others, however, may find this an irresistible psychological drama. 7/10
