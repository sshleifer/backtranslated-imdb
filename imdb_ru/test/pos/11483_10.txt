I watched Linda, and this is a top rated movie! The life of Paul and his wife Linda, whom he adored in his youth and finally got married. They meet another married couple, Jeff and Stella, and the four become very good friends. But their friendship takes a sharp turn after a joint holiday on the beach of Varona .... A twist that never returns married couples to their former status of friends <br /> <br /> Linda is required !!! ! Virginia Madsen's play is acceptable; however, Richard Thomas stole the film with its incredible play ... and the emotions that it demonstrates. <br /> <br /> Wonderful movie! "Lotta Honey"
