Honestly, I didn’t expect much from entering “9 souls”, even after reading a bunch of praises leaning on him, but to say that I was surprised would be a serious understatement, in short, I was just shocked. <Br /> <br /> The main plot is simple: nine prisoners, ranging from a drug dealer and ending with the escape of a murderer from prison and searching for a secret cache, allegedly forged by a ten percent prisoner who hacked and was dragged off by the guards shortly before their escape, but precisely in In this direction, the director Toshiaki Toyoda takes this simple story, so brilliant and original, ideally combining drama, comedy and violence, creating really one of the good films that deserve to be seen not only by fans ziatskogo movie, but the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> Superb acting, emotional, funny, brutal and sometimes very surreal, this film has everything.
