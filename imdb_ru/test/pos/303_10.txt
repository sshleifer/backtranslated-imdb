I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was fortunate to meet Martin Sheen near the Civic Auditorium of Santa Monica one night in 1981, when he was waiting for Charlie and Emilio to leave the concert. He was very humble in that I praised him for this work of art, especially his depiction of a young captain. This is, without doubt, a must see, complete 10 and an important part of the history of American cinema. "Charlie, don't surf." The famous line of Robert Duvall (the other) does not need to be repeated, since it has become an often recurring anthem, and his character Pattoneski will be long remembered as a classic American military hawk in the tradition of John Wayne. It's amazing to see what young Lawrence Fishburne looks like.
