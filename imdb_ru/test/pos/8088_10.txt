This movie is the perfect way to explain what a good movie is. This is a film for children and parents, and it is “out of time”. I saw this film before Ocean Eleven and I have to admit that the actors in OU have a class in advance, but the game of Klatretosen is much more mundane and touching. Why do I say “Ocean Eleven,” the fact that these two films have a lot in common, and CLATETESEN IS good! that it can carry a comparison with OE. 3 young people play their role completely disbelieving, compared to what we are used to in Denmark. Various cases of impossible actions are handled so that you don’t believe many young actors (and sometimes not even the “old boys”). Story ? again, he has something in common with Ocean-eleven, with the exception of the reason for stealing money, and in Klatretesen they need to go up to a strong room. Participation, in which young people should take care of Ida's younger brother, gives a wonderful element in the film. Try to imagine how to rob a bank with a two-year-old child with a diaper on his hand :-). <br /> <br /> This film can be compared to most adult films, such as MI2 and Ocean's Eleven. Yes, I believe it is good. It is best to watch it in the theater, since all the children in the room comment on the film, and these comments will forever remain in your hearts :-). <br /> <br /> Regards, Claws.
