I saw this movie when it first came out, and never forgot it. My uncle Antoine is much, much larger than the sum of his parts. The film tells about a teenager who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in Canada. There are adventures that seem more or less typical, but under them is the current building. MUA has a leisurely pace, but have patience, the reward is not far off. I think the film got a subtitle, and, like in all non-English-speaking films that I've seen, itâ€™s worth avoiding duplicate versions. Inevitably dubbed films reflect the attitude of the new director and actors, with the added need for lip sync lines that aren't quite appropriate. For example, Amarcord speaking in English is a parody, and sings a subtitle. My uncle Antoine is worth it to find and watch it in French.
