"Robin Hood: People in Pantyhose" did not receive any respect at all. It was fun! Carey Elvis was great in the role of "Prince of Thieves", and David Chappel, Amy Yasbeck, Patrick Stewart, Richard Lewis and Mark Blankfield, since Blinkin did a great job. I will never understand the hostility towards “Robin Hood: men in tights”, but I know a wonderful comedy when I see her. <br /> <br /> “Robin Hood: Men in Pantyhose” gets *** from ****.
