I have never read any of Sarah Waters novels or have watched velvet tips. I only heard about Fingersmith when I was browsing the "The L word" websites. The plot of Fingersmith interested me, but I passed away, thinking: “A lesbian in the Victorian period, which never ends well, I have enough of those TV shows and lesbian films that go nowhere” However, at Christmas Time My local DVD store gave Fingersmith a discount, I brought a DVD, and my life was never so vibrant. <br /> <br /> This mini-series deserves to be appreciated and praised. The game is so great that I call it a rarity. Sally Hawkins, Elaine Cassidy, Rupert Evans, Imelda Staunton and many others that I cannot call everyone, brought light and darkness to their characters. Just by a small gesture, by a small glance, by a light touch, they made their characters real, and, as a spectator, I could do nothing, but took them home, kept them close. <br /> <br /> Fingersmith, who lives in the Victorian region, is the story of Sue, the thief who loves and lives with his “family” pickpockets. Little did she know that her fate was tied to Modh Lily — a somewhat shy, timid girl growing up in a mansion for miles and miles. Maud's mother left her a fortune, but Maud herself cannot touch her unless she marries. Worst of all, Uncle Maud ensures that she will never be holding her in jail in the house. <br /> <br /> Enter Mr. Gentlement, a charming, handsome thief with an equally bad heart. He wants Maud happiness for himself, and for this he sets Sue as Maud Lily's maid, asking Sue to convince Maud to run away with him. Over time, everything will be easy if Sue does not fall in love with Maud. <br /> <br /> And everything would be simple if the story were exactly what I just told. I do not want to spoil, so I would like to dwell on this. But I can assure you that everything is distorted and turned even before you can realize what happened. Once this has happened, you are wondering what will happen next. In addition, the story is filled with passion, unlike others. There are no self-searching, sexual questions “Oh, God, I like girls,” because the girls in Fingersmith are buried so deep in their own darkness that they can hardly take care of them. the story with such a twisted plot moves smoothly, like water, passionately, but strangely calm. <br /> <br /> A few weeks have passed since I watched Fingersmith, but Modh’s eyes still haunt me, and Sue’s words still warm my heart: “You are a pearl, you are a pearl, you are a pearl” - she said. And such a pearl.
