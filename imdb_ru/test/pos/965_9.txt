CAUTION, SPOILERS !!!! This was my son's review of the film, which he wanted me to publish. He wrote it, I swear. <br /> <br /> With Malcolm in the film “The Middle” by Frankie Muniz and “Nickelodeon” by Amanda Bynes, they go to the show. business. They team up for actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepard's essay on the Big Fat Liar and got into a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) must go to Los Angeles to return it. Jason's dad does not believe that he wrote this essay. So every time they see each other, Jason asks Wolf (Paul Jamaatti) to call Jason's father, because he wants his essay BACK !!!! The wolf does not make the film, but the president of the company does it. At the end, the family and Kaylee see a film made by Wolf Pictures and based on a true story written by Jason Shepard.
