The fact that the film is based on a real story contributes to a better and, of course, more realistic perception and keeps the viewer in focus on the main theme of the film. The story is full of unexpected turns that do not allow the viewer to always come up with an ending. At one point, you think something is happening to Coach Jones or the radio. Well, this is true, but, of course, not what you expect. <br /> <br /> The film does not in any way become boring or too sentimental, and Ed Harris and Cuba's acting performances Gooding Jr. are among the best in my opinion. The ending causes a long smile on your face and makes you wonder if what you are doing is right. Well, I think that was exactly what Michael Tollyn and Mike Rich tried to do. First-class film. <br /> <br /> Esbj√∏rn Nordby Birch. Denmark.
