I think it was the most outstanding thriller I've ever seen. The study for the film was thorough, the writer Kelly Sane did not leave without end. The cast was sustained (fantastic performances from all sides). Omar Metvalli was outstanding. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is poetic, captivating with music, and the overall effect is very pleasing. <br /> <br /> The show enters a territory that even the media fear. This is really a wake-up call for those engaged in espionage and a legal network called the “War on Terror”. <br /> <br /> A woman left the theater and asked me: "Is this really happening?" That in itself speaks of Gavin Hood’s masterly achievement.
