There were at least half a dozen versions of the silent film “The Merchant of Venice” by Shakespeare, and there were several television productions. But no one ever bothered to make from this performance a theatrical production with a large budget. , , still. Given the nature of the play's most memorable character, Shylock, a nasty Jew, it can be assumed that a small unpleasant incident that occurred in Europe in the late 1930s and 1940s could have weakened the directors' enthusiasm. Of course, the main motivation for the new Michael Redford film is to give Al Pacino the opportunity to shout, roar, meditate, mumble and suffer - in all that he is pretty good at. Like Richard III, the role of Shylock is the dream of the scenery lover. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an anti-Semite, since he never met a Jew. The Jews were expelled from England 300 years before his time and a few decades after his death; and it is unlikely that he ever traveled abroad. At some level, the Jews could be for him a mythological race. But, although Shakespeare may not have been an anti-Semite, his game is definitely like that. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent, which is likely to give the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th century usurer with unmistakable diction and Fozzy Bear rhythms. The Redford version begins with a crawl about the miserable treatment of Jews, and then notices that Antonio (Jeremy Irons) spits gratuitously at Shylock (Pacino), who actually just stands and does his own thing. Will buy when it comes out on DVD, for sure! Sarge booker
