This film was an original non-original way. Although many films dealt with suicides and psychiatric institutions, it was about treating patients and improving them with the help of a doctor, but in this film we follow a depressed guy who falls in love with a suicidal girl and will stop at nothing to make her happy Even if she doesn't care about happiness at all, she just wants to die. It was a very interesting, sweet, romantic comedy that was as good as anything. It's fun to check if you ever get a chance, you just need to be open-minded about the material. In general, I give him 6.4, I just voted 9 to get a higher rating :)
