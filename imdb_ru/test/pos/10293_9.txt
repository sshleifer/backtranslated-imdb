When I watched “Apartment” with my girlfriend, she sighed: “How difficult!” And she is right, of course. When you are used to simple one-line plots, especially cruel heroes against scammers, L'Appartement is hard to follow. Several negative reviewers here also missed one or more important points. Others whine about tangled flashbacks. Come on! This is not the film from which you can go to the toilet, come back and catch on again in a few seconds. This requires full concentration and close attention to detail. Then it is actually not so difficult to understand what is happening and when. The director left more than enough clues in all the scenes. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 films concern the question: why are Max and Lisa separated? The film, as my friend noted, begins as a romantic love story, suggesting that the two lost lovers will find each other again. Having experience working with French films, I predicted that the story would turn around pretty soon, and I was right. At the end of the first part it becomes clear, after many turns, that Alice manipulated Max and Lisa. Max did not know that Lisa was gone and why. Lisa did not know why Max did not contact her in Rome and left her without a trace when she returned to Paris. The only one who did this was Alice, and she had her own reasons for keeping her mouth shut. <br /> <br /> After Max and Lisa learned the truth, the question arises: is it possible to cancel Alice’s manipulations? Well, of course not, time has passed and everything has changed. <br /> <br /> Many European films use story-telling techniques, which I like very much. Initially, there is no description of the main conflict, after which two (or more) interested parties are trying to decide in their own interests. Instead, the viewer is gradually filled with pieces of the plot and hardly knows more than the main characters. L'Appartement is a beautiful and subtle example of this technique. In the first half, Alice seems to be a side character; Gradually it becomes clear that she is a key figure. <br /> <br /> Acting is just great. Vincent Cassel is beautiful as a somewhat naive and impulsive character who risks safe life in order to hunt a dream from the past. Monica Bellucci, of course, very beautiful, but also competent. Jean-Paul Ekoffi provides the necessary comic touch. Roman Beringer is very convincing as a neurotic woman suffering from feelings of guilt and regret. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn’t give her 10 is a somewhat unsatisfactory ending. Of course, this was necessary because of the desired symmetry. After all the events, Max is exactly where the film began, only wiser and sadder. Alice paid for her sins. But still small turns at the airport are a bit artificial. Max is too easy to change Lisa to Alice; Alice too easily decides to abandon Max, who has been her dream for so long; Max returns to his bride too easily. But then again, I do not know how this can be achieved without sacrificing elegant symmetry. I think sometimes artists have to give up realism for the sake of beauty.
