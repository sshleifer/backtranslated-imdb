This is one of the best episodes of Doctor Who EVER. We have cybermen, cyber conversion units (can scare young children) and, of course, a doctor who does one of his best actions. Bravo David Tennant. Good scenes are like a movie, with spectacular scenes on some streets, an invasion of the Cyberman base and the abandonment of a world different from ours, mostly a 45-minute film. <br /> <br /> Being the second part of Rise Cybermen will never disappoint. With its excellent build to the final. <br /> <br /> Doctor plus an evil enemy (Dalex, Cyberman, Master, Sontaran, Davros, Avton or even Macra) is a battle to the death, just be careful with the little children watching this.
