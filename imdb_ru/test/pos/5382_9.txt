The man! I remember this show with nostalgia ... I really dug Bravestarr, because he was not an ordinary hero. He was more than a futuristic Texas cowboy. This man had the strength of a bear, the vision of a walk and agility ... I can't remember that. <br /> <br /> The sequence of actions was great! I remember that Bravestarr always used his bazooka called SARAJUANA (translation into Spanish) every time he had big problems. <br /> <br /> It was a high-quality animated action movie. I liked the characters, the dialogues, the music and, of course, the sequence of initial credits! Star of courage! long live him. Cult classic in my opinion and definitely need to see.
