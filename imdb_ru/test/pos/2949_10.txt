Watching this movie caused a rather emotional reaction. This is what all documentaries are talking about today. Nice to watch something personal, honest and genuine. The thoughts, opinions and disclosures of Mr. Blok are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well represented here. It is a fine line to go between personal truth and exploitation. This film is going very carefully and quite successfully. <br /> <br /> You might think that studying how a seemingly normal couple does not meet the expectations of society creates pessimism ... but it is not. Quite the contrary: I felt good. I feel that now I know more about marriage ... about women. <br /> <br /> Definitely check it out, it will make you think - exactly what a good documentary should be made for.
