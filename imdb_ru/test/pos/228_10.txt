To say that this is a good show, not to say anything at all. In the end, this show was made by the same team responsible for the Plane and other funny and brilliant films. The writing is superb. Although the show is built on one-line players, they do not become overbearing or annoying. Leslie Nielsen fully stretches the comedian muscles, as if to say: you haven't seen anything yet. The format was definitely polished to represent Naked Gun. When watching these movies, note how many chips are taken from the TV show. The great thing is that they do not need to be changed too much. The show was really a testing ground for bigger and better versions that will come later.
