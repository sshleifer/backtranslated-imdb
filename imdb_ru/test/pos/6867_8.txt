I was very interested to learn about Anatomy (aka Anatomie), and if I was going to see him, I needed to buy it, since no video store in my area wore a film. Since this was not a cheap DVD, I took a chance and decided to look at the other comments on IMDb. Many of the comments did not give me enough hope to get a lot of money for the film, which I had never seen and had no clues. I basically realized that this is a sexy youth game, which is compared with many teenage thrillers. Something deep down told me to ignore these types of comments and buy it! I did, and was pleasantly surprised! <br /> <br /> Compared to other films, I would say that this is a kind of coma and extreme measures. I have not seen any comparison with such films as Scream, Urban Legends, etc. Yes, the cast is young (this is because they are medical students! At least they are not all the more boring school-type characters), and yes, some are lustful (mostly the character played by Anna Loos and coped with him). quite tasteful in the German version), but “Anatomy” is well built, it has a tense mood, stunning scenery, the effect of make-up is simply amazing, and Frank Potente is very authoritative in its role. I enjoyed it all, despite a few gaping holes in the plot! The story of how a student discovered some kind of secret society that does an autopsy on patients still living is a rather creepy scenario, and what happens to these patients later is pretty clever. Of course, you could ask why she did not leave this city? Good, but then the movie will end in half an hour. <br /> <br /> This was the first attempt of the German part of Columbia Pictures, and it is quite impressive. There was a little care in the production, and in fact to offer some genuine thrills — an achievement. He is a bit mature because he does not resort to constant opportunities for sexual contacts (a chest holiday) or jokes about drugs for minors. The character of Anna Loos, although he often made sexual remarks and was looking for a bit of fun, was in fact a pleasant touch - to have a character who was a smarter woman than any of the men in school. She found that sex really just distracts her, but men do not have enough of it. <br /> <br /> IMPORTANT: Watching this movie in German with subtitles in English or French is the best way to enjoy it. I saw theatrical trailers, dubbed in English, and I was disgusted with the change he made to the tone of the film. I have never seen a properly dubbed film in my life - they can never find a voice suitable for the actors or characters in the film. Of course, I tried to look at the anatomy duplicated in English, and its level of intelligence dropped dramatically, due to which it became more like a comedy. A good example is when one guy was excited to be opened and shouted to be stitched again - when he heard it in German, he sounded crazy, but sounded like a comedian in English. Honestly, I’m sick of people saying that they don’t know how to read subtitles or watch a movie with mailboxes. Anatomy looks stupid with duplicate voices that seem octaves too high for any of the people you see in the film, and Anna Loos's sexy comments then just sound like horrible remarks directly from Fast Times At Ridgemont High. I wonder if negative comments about Anatomy were from people who watched it duplicated, then this is not at all like the same movie! This is not a cheap horror film and deserves to be watched as it was created. It is interesting to note that some of the English subtitles differ in plots in the function and addition of the “creation”. <br /> <br /> As it turned out, I played and won with anatomy. This is a competent thriller with cute characters and does not try to go for cheap thrills.
