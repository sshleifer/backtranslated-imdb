This film was awesome how good it was! The plot is not an ordinary, and acting show. At first I thought it would not be so great because of the summary, but after about the first five or ten minutes of the film it struck me that I was completely wrong. I literally cried four or five times in this film, and despite this, I must have watched the same scenes over and over again, about thirty times in a week! No, the scenes with the songs were not as stunning as they could be, but the plot is what really turns you on. American or Asain, I would recommend it to everyone - and now. I guarantee that when you see this film, you will get the best of it and its plot. I hope you feel the same way, and write an enthusiastic review too!
