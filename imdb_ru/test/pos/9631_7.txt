It seems that everyone did not like Steven Seagal: just take a look at his list of nominations, for him there are only nominations for Razzi awards (with one victory), but I think he earned nothing. I saw good movies with Steven Seagal, I saw bad movies with Steven Seagal. And “PATRIOT” (1998) is one of his best films, almost as good as “Under Siga” (1992) or “Hard to kill” (1990). Patriot shows its activities to protect nature. Of course, this film is not the most successful, and I must say that violence is more than I like, and why should Seagal's best friend L. V. Jones have to die the death of the victim? The role of Dr. McLaren is one of Seagal's best performances. He has, as always, a very good charisma. And finally, “PATRIOT” is good fun. An average rating of only 4 points is the most underrated film of all time. <br /> <br /> Regards, Hans Dieter
