This film is similar to the film “Happiness Meets“ Lost Translation ”with the ending of“ The Sixth Sense ”(or maybe a surprise in“ Crying Game ”) and the best soundtrack I've ever heard ... if that's all has the meaning. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds pretty much say that you are on a twisted ride. (I was surprised that no one came out immediately during the premiere in Brooklyn.) But from there the film turns into a conversation between two really damaged people, Daphne and Buddy. <br /> <br /> They are lonely, spoiled, and boy, they talk about sex. Daphne brings her most interesting accompaniment stories to life, some are pretty funny (Mr. Chang), some worry (Harlan's scenes with music that tell us what we see now, maybe what is happening, or what Daphne really feels), and I can add that I have a friend who accompanied me, but most of them look quite real. <br /> <br /> You Are Alone - multi-layered and mostly brilliant. Well, maybe a few minutes less talk, and I don't know that we would not have missed anything. <br /> <br /> Again, I need to see him again, knowing the ending. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. <br /> <br /> (The director asked an audience of people in Brooklyn to write a review on IMDb, because many people read them. The request is satisfied.)
