Wounded Tonto stands alone to protect three innocent people. A quirky woman controls a deadly conspiracy. Racial tension. Smart Indians. <br /> <br /> These are things that we have rarely ever seen on the show, but this film adds them all to the mix. Although this is definitely the film The Lone Ranger, it mixes the formula so much that those who are tired of the show will surely like it anyway. Definitely recommended for any fan.
