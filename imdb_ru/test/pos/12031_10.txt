I was a schoolboy when I first watched this movie. The next day I knew that all the students of our uniform watched it, and everyone was fascinated by this film, just like me. I think that the same situation was in all classes of our school and throughout the Soviet Union. Later, I watched him every time he was shown on TV, and I want to watch more. I think that a comparison with “Back to the Future” or other sci-fi movies does not fit. “Guest from the Future” is unique in many ways; once you look at it, you will never forget it. <br /> <br /> This film is full of faith in the peaceful achievements of science, full of faith in the beautiful future of our world. This is not only a film, but also a forecast of many scientific inventions and achievements. The time shown in the film is 1984 (the year of its creation) and 2084 (when schoolchildren Kolya Gerasimov traveled for a while and where his friend Alice Selezneva came from). Now 2005, many inventions and achievements predicted in the film have not yet been realized. Such as “Mielophone” (a device that can read the minds of any animal and person), expeditions to Venus and Mars (as easy as a weekend picnic), creating and launching satellites as homework for students, easily managed aircraft vehicles (which completely replaced cars), biorobots, “historical identification” of any material or substance, made in a couple of minutes, and many others. Meanwhile, some of them today have become much more realistic than it seemed in 1984! Just wait 2084 :-) <br /> <br /> The film also shows typical Russian schoolchildren and schoolgirls (and this is natural!). With their ingenuity, curiosity, humor, dreaminess. Look, for example, at Fima Korolev, you can find such a character in almost all classes of every school in the Soviet Union, a similar character was in my form! Alisa Selezneva ... I myself, like many of my classmates, fell in love with her at first sight! By the way, later the actress who played Alice became a scientist - I think the film had the same influence on her as the people who watched it on TV. <br /> <br /> Great idea, great realization, great actors, great music, beautiful song "The Beautiful is Far Away" ("The Wonderful Far-Away") ... Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ... <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is that different remakes and "new versions of the film's song and even the film itself were made later and distributed on television and on the Internet. All of them are not even comparable to the original. I should not even comment on them, my comment is only about the original. So, request the original and enjoy it!
