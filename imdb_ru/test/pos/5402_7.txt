So. I was completely in love with this movie. Gaga for him, even with all his plot twists ... but the one thing I found really worried was the connection between the two best friends in Tim and Kyle. While the filmmaker gave us such an agonizing moment between the two, and their sexual experimentation / confusion, he then gives us a turn of the plot that makes them half brothers?!?! (Although the topic is not covered in the film ... and left unexplained and unrecorded) I just thought it was a bad taste, and the fact that it was not even discussed was even worse. (Unfortunately, we created a taboo ... now let's not pay attention to the situation, because it really would not be PS) Otherwise, an exciting movie
