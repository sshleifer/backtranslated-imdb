I saw this movie more than 5 years ago, and the topic is still furious, as it should be. Her anger and initiative were inspiring. Not that I captured the army and killed people, but the scene at the well and in the rebel fortress never leaves me. This is a great movie, but be prepared for a strong storyline.
