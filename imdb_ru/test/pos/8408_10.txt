I liked the movie. I loved Timothy Dalton and Joan Wailey. There were many different places in the film. I really liked it when Ann Hampton realized that she could not make Rett love her. And when Scarlett and Ann, where they are together, and Ann apologize for taking Rett, Scarlett simply told her not to worry that she would return it. He had a great story he told. You just can not compare it with GWTW. He just has so many great scenes. I love both Scarlett and GWTW! Of course, do not forget to have a handkerchief on hand.
