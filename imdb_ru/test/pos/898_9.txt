I have so much hope for the continuation of Gen-X. Fortunately, my hopes came true. You have a whole bunch of action, comedy ... stupid comedy and surprises. I think newbie Edison is really a hit in the film, but I do find Sam "Alien" stupid with English. Although the film had some drawbacks with robot graphics and silly dialogue, the action always keeps it strong. The action of the film is much stronger than the first. <br /> <br /> This film is becoming increasingly American, as 60% of the film is written in Cantonese English. This movie will not disappoint you. I recommended this to young people who care about pure, action-packed fun. <br /> <br />
