I originally watched it, because I thought it would be a continuation of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and this film is a completely different thing, happening here is a comedy! However, I loved it anyway! <br /> <br /> “League of gentlemen” is, apparently, a British TV series with rather strange characters and sharp humor. This is a British comedy, so it revolves around being very stupid, dressing in costumes and making fun of Germans and French, homosexual references - in short, this is very very funny! <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the writers from the TV show decided to cancel some of the characters and characters that come out of their dimension into the dimension of the writer to stop it. This is a funny twist, and this idiotic adventure is full of great scenes. I laughed out loud many times and applauded the brazen style of humor. This makes Mr. Bean look like a weak weakling. (Rowan is much better in the Black Adder series, by the way) <br /> <br /> This is not Monty Python, but you can never avoid comparing when you speak English. humor, and there are several similarities, but not so much to prevent it from being his own and being fresh. He is more inclined to the young and the guest house Paradiso in his "comedy style". <br /> <br /> If you like it, watch the TV series “Young” and the movie “Guest House Paradiso”, and, of course, I suppose, the TV series The League of Gentlemen should also be pretty funny.
