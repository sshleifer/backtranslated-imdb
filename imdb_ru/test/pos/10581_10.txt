Haggard: The “film” is the real story of Ryan Dunn and his girlfriend, who cheated on him, also with the help of his two friends: 1. A skateboarder who lives for free, and 2. Trying to be a funny scientist (who doesn't really work) in performed by Bam Margera and Brandam Dikamillo. <br /> <br /> In the film “Haggard in the film” there are also many characters from “Jackass”, etc., but, by the way, it was written by Bam Margera and Co. This is a very weak attempt, it seems to me that it was written when it was boring, or as a project to which they did not pay much attention. <br /> <br /> Films are also Bam's girlfriend Jennifer Rivell, who plays Gloren, Ryan's girlfriend, who basically deceived him, again the very bad role Jennifer, another actor who might interest some people, is Steve aka Hellboy, who plays Rake Yon, whom his character doesn’t like to be with the story, again a bad acting game, and this character doesn’t really have so many lines in this film that basically makes him very boring. but worst of all, it's Raab's character, his voice sounds like a smoker, who has mostly throat cancer, and I think he could be better! In general, I think that the characters of this film are not related to the story, as in one scene, it will be one particular character, a minute later, another scene, another character. <br /> <br /> Say it This should be a film, a kind of documentary, his characters do not play as a documentary, an acting game makes you think that this is a cheap attempt to make a film in your free time. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, we begin to lose focus on the main character, Ryan Dunn, although much attention is paid to Bem and Brandon. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is fine, if you laugh at things this is not very funny, stupid stunts, terrible acting and random nude scene! In addition, I think that there are too many scenes just without talking and just music! 7/10
