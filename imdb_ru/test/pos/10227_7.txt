This horrible story is good. But perhaps not the way you know it. The real monsters in this movie are people. While monsters, these are people and victims. Strange as it may sound, I see it as Monsters Inc for horror movie fans. <br /> <br /> Of course, the effect of the horror movie std, the monsters are there, like in any monster-based movie, there is also blood here, even a slasher in the form of Dr. Decker (played by David Cronenberg; I see a flash of Killian Murphy in the role of Dr. Jonathan Crane in “Batman” here - or is it the other way around?). And it is Decker & C that are the bad guys. Monsters mainly want to go about their business, driving away obsessive people, more or less misled, wanting to join society. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, you really like very little monsters (and a dog) - maybe not what you expected from the first few scenes ....
