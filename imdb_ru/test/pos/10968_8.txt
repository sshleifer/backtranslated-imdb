I never saw the John Cassavetes film until two years ago I saw the film “CHINA OF CHINESE KILL” in a Berlin cinema, which seemed interesting to me, speaking diplomatically, but not so special, I immediately wanted to see more of his work. Since then, I have tried - with an emphasis on trying - to observe his other works, in particular, SHADOWS. I have to admit that it took me some time before I really enjoyed the movie. At first, the incomplete, crude and improvised way in which Cassavetes was shot, pushed me away somewhat, and I thought of it as an original one - absolutely - but an incorrect and outdated experiment. But now, after a review, these small flaws make it so fresh even today. <br /> <br /> Shot with a minimum budget of $ 40,000 with a skeletal team of six, SHADOWS offers three siblings in an African American family, in which two of their three siblings, Ben (Ben Carruthers ) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), have light-skinned skin and are able to pass for white. Cassavetis demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect actual conflicts within the group, but viewed the film as having to do with human issues, and not as racial. Cassavethis made the film in ten minutes and took an uneven installation, which was a reaction to the "solid" Hollywood production values. The main source of inspiration for Cassavetes - at least in the cinematic style in which the film was shot - was the Italian neo-realists, who also admired Wells' innovative spirit. The use of lovers and improvisations may resemble some Italian neorealist directors, but with his bop-score of Charles Mingus and Shafi Hadi, the film looks very different, very American, unlike what was done before. <br /> <br /> The song with feathered girls “I feel like a lollipop” (or something like that) reminds me of bright years ago, ancient history. But no matter how stale it may look, it still makes a delicious time capsule of the end of the fifties in New York today. I think that this is one of the first films created by beginning filmmakers who understand that they can make an independent film without Hollywood, without improvised means and without a real budget. Seymour Cassel, who acted and participated in The Shadows, claims that Jules Dassin's “Naked City” (1948) was the first to inspire them all, but I think that it was he who really opened his eyes to the beginning independent American cinematographers. br /> <br /> Obscura camera --- 8/10
