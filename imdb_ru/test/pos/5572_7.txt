After seeing the show for about four weeks, that's enough to get a feel for the show, I think it shows potential. Although much is borrowed from other shows (which fiction does not do nowadays), and the characters are stereotypical, I like what they do with the stories. There is some continuity with plot development and character interaction / building relationships, despite the essentially modular nature of each episode. Were investigated some topics related to science, as well as the disclosure of the secret / weakness of the character. It also added some comedy to the show, which I would love to see in “serious” science fiction. In general, this creates a good balance that may appeal to large groups of people, in contrast to the Star Trek and Babylon 5 debates, in which I participated and witnessed. The visual aspects of the show are more than adequate and well foreseen for the first season. Acting is acceptable, and I'm curious to see how well actors manage to grow their characters from their stereotype scenarios. I see enough positive and potential to still be interested in where the show will go ...
