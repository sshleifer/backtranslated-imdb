I have never heard of this Australian horror before Michael Elliott’s enthusiastic review; in fact, after reading it, I decided to check if there was a DVD at my local rental point, and it was (albeit in German, i.e. without R1 add-ons), so I decided to check out the movie immediately. <br /> <br /> Although I would not go so far as to give him a full assessment ?? only some select titles get them from me, not to mention an obscure modern film ?? I must say that I was impressed with BLACK WATER. Instead of looking back at previous crocodile films such as ALLIGATOR (1980) and LAKE PLACID (1999), he brings back memories of two who have seen a small group of people who go on a journey, are lost and are dominated by elements and creatures LONG WEEKEND (1978), a little-known but impressive Australian production itself, and OPEN WATER (2005). <br /> <br /> In a compact film with a simple plot, a couple and a younger sister of a woman participate, who decide to go fishing in the remote and forbidden part of the Australian desert, known as the territory of a crocodile; very soon (in fact, even before 15 minutes had passed!), their boat overturned and the guide was killed by an alligator ?? so our unfortunate adventure seekers found refuge in a tree. The DVD Talk Browser thinks the movie suffers from spending too much time in this place ?? three are arguing about what they should do, trying to find a boat, looking for a way out of the jungle through the trees (only to meet only with water) and from time to time attack the monster. Nevertheless, I think that the creators take the situation as far as possible, not rolling into boredom: this is due to a tangible expectation and, as Michael said, the credibility of the characters (especially two women), but also the fact that the crocodile here makes him one of the most terrible and memorable lately (I wonder how they made him “perform”)! <br /> <br /> I also agree with Mike that the film has some really effective shock moments ?? an alligator jumped out of the water to bite off the petrified heroes; his head suddenly appears in front of the women as they head towards the boat; even if one of them gets to the car, the monster manages to lift its enormous weight and get into the boat with it! near the end, when the same girl manages to find a pistol (on their guide's mutilated body), charges it and waits for an alligator to appear, the latter sneaks up behind (by the way, the creature is given with the cunning shark in its jaws [1975]). With this in mind, the finale is as good as the public (albeit on a clearly smaller scale) as the finale of the classic Spielberg blockbuster ?? even if it has a bad follow-up. Another specific asset is a rare movie score ?? which is usually pretty cute, but frustrating at the right time. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, BLACK WATER appears as a breath of fresh air in the face of the demoralizing recession that the horror film hits. fell lately; For this reason alone, does he deserve greater disclosure to remind us that there is still hope for our favorite genre (without the real need to resort to the CLOVERFIELD [2008] trick to get attention) ??
