I watched this movie, never reading a book, and took the characters at face value, but, being already familiar with them, I recently watched it again. I had a completely different point of view on the film. <br /> <br /> Without the burden of focusing on each character, studying his quirks and flaws, allowed me to focus on the cultural issues outlined in the film. Iowa farm families are so closely related to each other, just like in the Indiana area, where I grew up in the 40s and 50s, and immediately recognized the stories and motives of the characters. Perhaps Jane Smiley really wanted us to see outside the surface world in which these people were supposed to live, but the audience is so immersed in the "Hollywood" aura of individual actors that they lack a rich lifestyle that exists less and less with each a decade. Another film with these characteristics - "Bridges County Madison." Try watching both of these films again, looking at the whole picture.
