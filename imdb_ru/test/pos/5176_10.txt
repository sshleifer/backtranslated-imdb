GREAT NEWS - this film is now available on DVD from http://treasureflix.com for all those who want to have it, as well as on video. This is great news, as it is one of my favorite movies! <Br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the first time in the 80s, and this is a must-see on holidays. Living in the small town of Tewkesbury, picturesque and with its own traditions, renovations and traditions, we are also a cozy and close community. Now we are also faced with large housing projects that threaten to destroy the Community, and you can understand why I love this movie. First of all, and most importantly, these are LAYERS of snow !!!! Then there is a wonderful legend about the Christmas tree, as well as a Christian denouement, as the whole community buys money to help the disadvantaged farmer save his farm and stay in the community. Evil developers - only after the money is sent to pack, as the whole city promises its money to help protect what they have, which is very special. I love how the whole community sends its messages to Santa through the post office, which the hero misunderstood. He and his daughter have a long way to go after the death of his wife and mother of the family. (There is a likely candidate for this) - even the sleigh ride, and the most touching of all, is that the taxi driver, whose engine was broken, was mysteriously given a new car on Christmas morning, and no one designed it! There is a wonderful moment when Denver sings a lullaby and exciting search. Great delicate movie for everything Christmas really is about.
