This film, also known as “do not look in the basement,” is actually not bad. This is a little-known film, even for those who are dying of horror, but this film seemed quite interesting to me. Don't get me wrong, this is certainly not without problems, but I think that more people should take a look at this. The story of a hot nurse who is going to work in a sanatorium, of course, I like. I thought that acting, which at first seemed compelled, somehow improved as the film progressed. It seems that the actors really came into their roles. There are some good, colorful characters, including a guy who thinks he is still a soldier, someone who thinks he is a judge, an adult with a childish mind, and an attractive girl who is so eager for attention that he throws his clothes when a man approaches her. The title “do not look to the basement” has the same relation to history as the “last house on the left” in this film. If you like movies with creepy characters in a mental hospital like me, check it out.
