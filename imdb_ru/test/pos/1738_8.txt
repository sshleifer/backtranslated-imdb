I have never seen Doctor Who before (at least not in a focused form), so I was new to this concept. I have to say that the new show works very well. It's funny (in the description of the genre you should also say “comedy”; many plot twists are acceptable only because of their comedic value), it is well written and makes a meager budget far-reaching. The human dimension is very strong and attractive, which is very rare in modern TV shows. <br /> <br /> I saw the first eight episodes, and so far No. 6-8 have been my favorites. Even types of stories that are too easy to mess up (with time travel, saving their dead parents and things like that) work amazingly well here. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is a joy to see a witty and carefree, though sometimes sullen doctor - if they find a good replacement for him, I will be very surprised. But I want to give the new guy a chance. However, there is no doubt that Eccleston episodes will go down in history as a classic. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the Doctor and Rose is especially refreshing. The dock for her is more of a father figure than a romantic interest, but there are hints of romantic insinuation between them, which, however, is much more emotional and human than sexy. <br /> <br /> Good show. The biggest drawback - low budget - a show like this should have the best special effects. And why they just do not use cheaper effects, I do not know. Nowadays, SFX doesn't have to pay for a bundle - just look at the Star Wars: Revelations fan movie. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
