I also have to apologize for a somewhat biased opinion about this endeavor, since I contributed to the soundtrack. Nevertheless, I got my own copy, sat back and enjoyed the rolling stock of characters, which may have been more colorful than the characters they created in this story about the sequel to the film “Shanghai”. For those who consider George W. Bush a “trustworthy Texan,” there is no need to look beyond this film to destroy the idea that Texas is full of trucks, one-dimensional cattle. There are some of the smartest, peculiar and humorous people in the cast that you find anywhere, when they tell their tales of torment, bliss and frustration, preparing for a magnificent sequel to the film, without a budget, partisan style (i.e. “punk style”). rock ", as each person helps to determine). <br /> <br /> This is a great documentary made with passion and courage and all the poison you need to break through to the other side of any industry. and a double conversation with which you are dealing (pay attention to the authors, artists, musicians and other directors). He listens to the credibility of the first wave of American hardcore music, when the term “D.I.Y.” was the standard, the period when courage, passion and dedication is more important than technique, style or precious calculations. Not that there was a lot of technique or style ... the tone of the documentary is quite refreshing. Editing shortcuts give as much drama as dialogs in it. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​creating a documentary about the sad end of the cast, the crew and the director's idea is brilliant, completely Texan and absolutely punk rock. In the literal sense of the word.
