Why should people follow the opinion of the herds and the masses of critics? RANDOM HEARTS, directed by the brilliant Sidney Pollack (who also has a small role in the film), is another Harrison Ford car. So it is pretty good and interesting. Of course, anyone who goes to look at it, means it or reads a book that is no better. Even Kristin Scott Thomas fans, including myself, knew that this would be a change in her playing the love interests of her older uncle again. Even as such, the film satisfies. What's so bad about this movie, which is much better in other (much higher rated) Harrison Ford cars? This film is not a masterpiece, but it is not as bad as potential viewers would believe.
