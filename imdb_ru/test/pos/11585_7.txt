Facts (I): "Mar Adentro" tells about the well-known (at least in Spain) history of Ramón Sampedro, a four-legged Galician, who committed suicide (some friends helped him) after 28 years of age, exhausted by his condition. The judges several times rejected his petitions for active euthanasia. <br /> <br /> - Facts (II): “Mar adentro” becomes the film of the year in Spain. Everybody talks about this: politicians, singers, simple people ... Everyone likes it, even the opinions of critics are unanimous. The film wins many awards (Golden Globe, Oscar, Goya) and annoys the Catholic community and quadriplegic fans. The star is born. <br /> <br /> Facts (III): The intensity and quality of the actors in "Mar Adentro" are just awesome, and it makes me wonder why we should watch the same bad young actors in most Spanish recent films. I do not know whether Javier Bardem is a great actor or a great imitator (there is a difference between this or that); in any case, his work is simply impressive, as is the work of Lola Dueñas, Belen Rueda, or all the guest stars. This (the choice of actors) is a strong point in the film Amenabar. <br /> <br /> - Facts (IV): Alejandro Amenabar got his lesson there, at the School of Cinema, there is no doubt about it: he has a privileged brain, He controls every technical aspect well, he knows what the audience wants , he knows how to touch the right chord, even if it turns him into such a demagogue (just like Spielberg is one of Amenabar's idols)). <br /> <br /> Facts (and V): If you criticize a film like Mar Adentro, it may seem that you have some problems with the moral problem that the story tells about. In such pictures there is a trap: the film itself must be distinguished from moral concepts. If you do not like the Schindler's List, this does not mean that you agree with Hitler’s philosophy (or not?). So for me, this is a good film and an unusual story (since this is a true story that makes it so much more unusual). Generous, benevolent, and all but neutral (whatever Amenabar or Bardem may say about this: those characters who do not support euthanasia do no good at all !!). 50% hard / 50% too sentimental. <br /> <br /> Epilogue: “Mar Adentro” will by no means be in my ranking of the best Spanish films of the 50s of all time. Nobody has any special merits in this story, except Ramon Sampedro himself. He is a movie. Now Alejandro Amenabar will become an even more international Spanish director, perhaps he will go live in Hollywood; but some of us would like to see how he makes a simple story, without final turns, without the living dead and not dying alive ... "Others" is still his best film. <br /> <br /> * My rating: 7/10
