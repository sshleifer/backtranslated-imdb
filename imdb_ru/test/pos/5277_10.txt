I absolutely positively liked the movie. I just saw it and can't wait for it to appear on the DVD. This is a beautiful, well-traced masterpiece. I am always amazed at the intricate work of Ghibli Studios. <br /> <br /> Others commented on what Sosuke calls Ris by name. He never calls his Father by name unless he speaks of him to someone else. I did not get the impression that Rice was his mother. It was never even mentioned or implied by anyone. It is clear that she is his stepmother. That is why he gives her a promise to return home and is so upset when he finds her empty car. His mother must have died when he was a baby, because he mentions that he was being fed by the Reese. This is due to the fact that his father often went to sea, so he has problems with abandonment. Everyone also talks about how adult he is. This usually happens when a child loses a parent.
