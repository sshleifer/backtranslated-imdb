A copy of this film that I saw is not very good. It is grainy and has almost no color in some parts. It switches between English and French, often in the middle of a sentence, and sometimes even in the middle of a word! Worse still, French parts of the language do not have English subtitles, which, in my opinion, make up at least a quarter of the film. But, surprisingly, the film is still very clear and enjoyable, even in this state, and I think it says a lot about how well this film is made. <br /> <br /> This is a top quality spaghetti spaghetti with a great acting game, an interesting storyline and great music. He also has a cool main character, a beautiful dark-haired girl, some strange characters and events, and a general sense of longing. This film is written "Euro". <br /> <br /> I hope that there is a negative or imprint of this film somewhere, because it deserves a high-quality DVD release, and when it comes out, I will be one of the first in line to get it!
