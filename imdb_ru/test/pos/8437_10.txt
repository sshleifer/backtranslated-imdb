"China's Syndrome" by James Bridges is a first-class thriller; model for those who want to make a truly terrifying thriller, but do not know how. <br /> <br /> Most thrillers end with standard shootouts and chase, which ends with the villain getting what he / she deserves. But Bridges understands that such a standard final is not suitable for some scenarios. "China Syndrome" worries as no one expected. He has such an unexpected, but still logical ending. <br /> <br /> In the film, three (then) current Oscar winners were shot: Jack Lemmon (Best Actor in 1973 in the film “Save the Tiger”), Jane Fonda (Best Actress of 1971 and 1978 for Klute and Coming Home "respectively) and Michael Douglas (Best picture of 1975 for the production of" One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ". This is not your standard film Find the Star, which became so popular in the 70s. The game is so strong and strong that we forget who plays the roles, and we believe that the heroes are real people. This indicates the collective abilities of all three actors. They can be stars, but they are actors in the first place. <br /> <br /> There is no musical score in the film. Apart from a few background songs from jukeboxes or TV shows, there is nothing. Bridges do not allow any directing style on the screen. With such a strong dramatic story, we don’t need an account to distract us. It looks like the predecessor of the Dogma-95 film series, launched by Lars von Trier in 1997. It focuses on the characters and plot, not on style. <br /> <br /> The story of a nuclear power plant located in Southern California. ** SPOILER ** It looks like an accident happened, and basically a film about Lemmon, the Foundation and Douglas is trying to uncover the truth. In a sense, this is not a spoiler, as the trailer, commercials, video boxes and reviews all give out. But from this seemingly simple premise a surprisingly complex moral game arises, and the expectation comes from human nature and the actions of people, and not the villain who substitutes the other guy (although this is an element in the film). This is what makes China Syndrome so good. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
