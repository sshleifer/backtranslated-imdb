The first full-length film “Dolls”, with the possible exception of “Dolls for Christmas”, is still being sought by puppeteers of the film around the world as a guide. Disney did Muppets dis-service, and this film proves it again and again. Featuring classic comedians and guest star camels, sticks to a simple but original plot, Muppet’s classic pranks, Paul Williams songwriting genius and insanity Electric Mayhem, and is filmed with an amazing movie, especially when you realize that the main actors are puppets, only Croft approached to genius Hansen with dolls. Half the fun today is that the actor / actress on the cameo is still alive. I can only hope that Frank Oz, Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeters can somehow save and revive Kermit and the Company from the deadly takeover of Disney.
