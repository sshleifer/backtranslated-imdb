Easily one of my three or four favorite movies. Definitely one for a desert island. There is nothing “brilliant” in this film. Rather, it glows warm and welcoming. The audience is invited to the party, and, like at any good party, the joy comes from the communication of guests and what you learn as you move from one to another. Apologies to Joyce, the title of the film conjures up a number of ideas that keep the audience away. The film is not terrifying. This is not depressing. This is a wonderful view of the past tense, during which people grow, while others collapse. Some are frustrated, while others are serene. And all around, ever present during the evening - these are people and parts of people who were buried. The words spoken by these elegant actors are perfection and, to the music of the Irish brogue, an aural feast, especially for us flat Americans. With regard to the lack of brilliance of which I spoke above, I take it back. There is no other word to describe the final scene between Angelica Houston and Donal McCann. Does it say quiet volumes about ?? well all Lovely snowy evening, rent this movie and let it happen in front of you. Without shootouts, without a chase, without dinosaurs? just a movie at its best.
