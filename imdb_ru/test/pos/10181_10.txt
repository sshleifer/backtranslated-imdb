While all Superman Fleischer / Famous Studios cartoons are superb, Billion Dollar Limited, the third in the series, is probably the best of all in terms of overall animation, plot and tempo. Why he was not even nominated for an Oscar as the Best Animated Short Film for 1942 (which is incredible, only the first was) in the unexplainable. <br /> <br /> Here Lois Lane is appointed to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the US Mint. Gangsters in masks on their super-powerful (1942) car take off after the train, who decided to get this gold. Without giving away too much, it turns out to be an exciting trip for both the characters and the audience, with truth, justice and Superman's victory at the end. <br /> <br /> As was the case in all Fleischers / Famous Supermen Cartoons, Clayton "Bud" Collyer and Joan Alexander, who played on Clark Kent / Superman radio and Lois Lane, have a great job here in the field of sound, and many Fleisher Jack Mercer can also be one of the bad guys.
