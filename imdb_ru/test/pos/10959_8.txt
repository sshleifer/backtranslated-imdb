Shadows breathe the smell of the streets of New York, like no film before. This launch of Cassavetes directorial work is just as atmospheric as the political one, and the original spark for an update in American cinema. <br /> <br /> Maybe he encourages seeing Cassavetes’s first work in a double role with another debut, Godard. And about the soufflé Both films have formed cinematic production in their countries over the decades, and both breathe a kind of lightness and cheerfulness, which are rarely achieved by those directors in their careers. <br /> <br /> Shadows are from three African American brothers, Ben (Ben Carruthers), Lelia (Leliya Goldoni) and Hugh (Hugh Heard). The plot unfolds in the New York jazz environment, and the rhythms of driving on the soundtrack play a major role in the hectic, sometimes almost fabulous atmosphere that permeates the entire movie. There's not much going on in the plot. The daily life of three brothers and sisters is determined by problems in a love relationship or at work, but at both levels normality deceives. Without a moralizing gesture, Cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial isolation, both in public and in private life. As for the cinematic image of racism, it was a breakthrough film in the USA. <br /> <br /> This film is also largely due to the performances of the three leading actors, who were previously almost completely unknown. Especially Ben Carruthers with his energetic image created the image of a new self-assessment of young urban blacks in America, an image that characterizes the films of Spike Lee of the 80s and 90s. It is significant that none of these undoubtedly extremely talented actors could begin a great career afterwards. Hollywood was not and is not ready to ethnically expand its star system, and so Goldoni, Hurd and Carruthers later found small art niches in TV and independent films. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the Shadows are one of them. of the less “beautiful” films ever made, and one of the most beautiful at the same time; film of shadows and spaces, with a camera that just watches the flow of life in crowded corners of streets, bars, hotel halls, apartments, causing intriguing walks through the busy streets of New York.
