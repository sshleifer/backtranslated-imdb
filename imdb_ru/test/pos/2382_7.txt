Good job. This is how I would describe this animated adventure of Scooby-Doo. This is still the best of Scoobyâ€™s animated movies I've seen. I liked the story. I thought there was some depth in it. paced.it doesn't get boring for a minute. He also has an interesting group of characters (except for Scooby, Shaggy and the gang, of course), plus the film was a blast. I am very interested to watch it. I also liked great Scottish music. She was very memorable and contagious. Naturally, we know that Scooby and Gamg will solve the mystery, but it is still interesting to get to this point. I like it if they did the Scooby Adventures 3D animation, but we just need to wait and see. For me, Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness monster 7/10
