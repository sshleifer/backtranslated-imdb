If anyone ever collects a collection of contemporary American horror, which is really worth it to be salted, then there will be an * obligatory entry for the omnipresent exercise SF Brownriggga in Refuge Shelter. Every time I watch this film, I’m impressed by the complete savings of the film: from a compact, completely autonomous storyline with a mysterious beginning and a too terrible end, exciting performances of the group, essentially unprofessional actors, and the prevailing sense of fear and claustrophobia that the narrava effectively absorbs with a certain inevitability, which is all the more terrible, because the audience knows what happens long before the hero, only with a question, when are they going to wake up and smell the coffee? <br /> <br /> Shot to the cost of dental floss in his native Texas Brownrigg in an old palace manor, which perfectly serves as a place for a private sanatorium. Do not look at the basement of another intriguing turn in Edgar Poe’s good old volume that prisoners take refuge shortly before the otherwise “normal” stranger involuntarily joins the ranks, not realizing it’s too late that not all as it seems, they are completely cut off from any foreign aid and inevitably discover that their own sanity is being questioned as insanity gets out of control - the original series “STREK TREK” is linked to the episode “Destruction of the Gods of 1968” , who gave Juan Moktezuma. Talking about peyote triggered a Mexican psychedelic trip to the DR. DUNGEON TARR'S TURURE in 1972, and tangentially connected with the hotel ASYLUM EROTICA / SLAUGHTER by Fernando Di Leo, which introduces elements of an unknown killer and a final that can only be defined as “Splatter Cinema” - Brownrigg could not have seen or thought of SLAUGHTER HOTEL, but he probably came up with several similar ideas. <br /> <br /> Former Playboy Playmate partner Rosie Holothik plays Charlotte Beale, RN in the field of clinical psychology, who just left her excellent job as a leader in a large Hospital to get to the middle of some forgotten god directly from the film about Pekingpe to work with Dr. Stevens in his private sanatorium. Dr. Stevens is a pioneer of a new form of therapy based on encouraging emotionally and psychologically traumatized people to confront their intrusive ideas, bring them to the surface and hopefully save patients from everything that has sparked their sense of reasoning. Good idea, but equip a 6-foot 250-pound completely insane man with an ax and tell him to drive out his aggression. AND, THEN TURNING YOUR BACK, is probably not the smartest idea, and Dr. Stevens is sent before Miss Holothick appears on the screen with a good blow to the bottom of his skull. <br /> <br /> This event actually leaves the sanatorium in the hands of one Geraldine Masters [actress Annabelle Vinic, who also worked as a script supervisor and production manager] A woman of amazingly professional behavior who quickly defuses the situation with the help of Sam, an amazingly unlikely hero of the film, African-American bogomuta with a lobotomy, played by an actor named Bill McGee, who, unfortunately, was bypassed in the nomination to support Oscar for his turn as a muscle mass with an 8-year-old boy's brain. Sam’s only wish is for someone to help him plant his favorite toy boat “in the water” and his constant requests from various actors / actors to do this [and his continuous consumption of chocolate popsicles] as * SOME * kind of core theme though here we will avoid this, because children can still be on their feet. There is also a little story about an employee who decided to leave after one of the patients threatens him, but I will leave the details of this to your discovery. <br /> <br /> Ms. Holotik arrives just at the moment when Dr. Stevens was actually put to rest, and he quickly won the deft professionalism of Mrs. Masters, who reluctantly allowed the leggy young nurse to stay despite the tragedy that had just happened oh TWENTY MINUTES BACK, what you have to admit was quite sporty on her part. However, Nurse Holotik shows signs that she is not the sharpest meat grinder in the drawer, however, when she is informed that she shares living quarters with a bunch of maniacs and there are no locks on the doors and doesn’t plod to the nearest ace. Household appliances store to pick up constipation and the castle to protect ourselves, and we find ourselves on a couple of truly eerie scenes where some prisoners wade into her room and do things like sniff her hair, try to kill her with butcher’s knives and caress her neck with an ax head. But this is all part of working in such a radical psychiatric healthcare environment, Ms. Master informs her, and she talks about her strangely defined “rounds”, which consist of wearing as a leg, defining a nurse's outfit, as you can find on the 42nd street fetish boutique and meeting with inmates. <br /> <br /> Allisson is an obsessive compulsive killing nymphomaniac who likes to take off his shirt and provide the film with some T & A between bouts of histrionic; Harriet is a young former mother who allowed her child to die in a stupid accident, and now she adores a battered old doll, which she also protects against murder; Sirgant is an actual seargeant [and an implied Vietnamese veterinarian] who, through negligence, led to the death of his platoon, and now looks out of the window with binoculars at the approach of an invisible enemy; Jennifer is a fish fan who couldn’t win a ticket for the New Year’s show, and went crazy, loves to beat Nembutola and other barbiturates when no one is watching, and she also has a hidden propensity to kill, related to her inability to find a bra; Judge Cameron seems to be a killer pervert who has become obsessed with his own sense of power and now loves to chop axes; Ms. Callingham is an elderly poet who serves as a beggar of sorts from MACBETH before the cat gets its tongue; and Danny is a crazy idiot who was included in the cast as a random element that the plot cannot control, and whose pranks serve as a real catalyst for a series of tragedies and murders that ultimately occur in this dark, old, creepy house in the Middle of Nowhere . <br /> <br /> The house itself is a wonderful set, with a worn out decor from the early 1970s, which is remarkable for its unremarkable, with a fantastic use of color achieved in low ambient lighting. The house is a series of hallways and rooms with shiny brown wooden floors, winding, closed staircases, secret cabinets and walkways leading to various large squares, and, of course, the basement mentioned in the title was visited only once, but the boy is sure turns out to be crazy! I like the old freezer in which Sam keeps his popsicles, perfectly simple exteriors that remind me of the summer house our family visited every year and make us gasp from the heat: everyone is covered in beads of sweat and looks. exhausted, and even ever cheerful, Sam once begins to suspect that bad things are happening, although he cannot understand what it all means, and Rosie H. believes too firmly in her profession to even suspect what actually happened, and while Miss Holotik’s limitations with regard to the actress may have reduced the effectiveness of her Big Revelation scene, she’s a great screamer when all hell breaks loose, and Brownrigg indulges in some good shots from her camera in various striking poses or stripping stages, who brag about how beautiful she is, without revealing anything other than what is provided for by her contract. Very sorry! <br /> <br /> Sam is the real thief of the show, but fans of what I was taught to call Splatter Cinema will not be disappointed at the rather shocking finale, and then something moves as Sam runs to protect his friend and brutally kills everyone, who is within reach, in a matter of seconds, that either says that he was a mean motive before his lobotomy, or about the movie "Cut Off." In any case, you will not be ready for the finale the first time you see it, even if you, as a spectator, know that such an assessment long before anyone else in the film has put it all together. <br /> <br /> With the exception of one person: the outrageously stereotypically tuned old girl Ray McAdams, Mrs. Calling [who seems to be inspired by the character of Donald Sutherland from the movie “Old Woman” from the movie Michael Reeves “CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD "1964, in addition to the rather unpleasant Death from a spell in the eye], which not only predicts the future, but also makes the film laugh out loud, funny and fun, walking around the garden with Miss Holotik, who is leading something like this - <br /> <br /> "It's really beautiful here. Mrs. Cullin gem, do you come out a lot? " Holotik asks what the old woman answers <br /> <br /> “You need to get out.” <br /> <br /> Jolly, and one of those things you should see is “receive.” DON'T LOOK IN THE CELLAR, which is available for at least half a dozen non-chefted code list DVDs, from companies like Brentwood Home Video, Diamond Entertainment, VCI and Platinum Disc Corp. HORROR CLASSICS series; I kind of like the sexually beautifully decorated Alpha Video for $ 6 from 2003: <br /> <br /> Delve into these baskets! But make sure you get one with the 89/90 minute imprint contained in it; the older 83-minute version is completely confusing due to some balances, and you really need to see the end credits, as intended, to bring this sick, crooked and surprisingly interesting yarn to the end. <br /> <br /> Masterpiece? Maybe not in comparison with EXORCIST or ROSEMARY'S BABY, but this is a very unique American horror film, and a true classic of the driving era, which deserves to be opened for everyone who is looking for something that is made with great juice and not pennies more than they are absolutely necessary. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
