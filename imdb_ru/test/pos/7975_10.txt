This is a great movie and I recommend it to everyone. Mr. Druryâ€™s acting is top-level, as always, and he blends well with the other actors in the film. I can not give any expectations or dramas found in the film. Hell to pay, this is a must see movie! The plot was very tense. I would watch this movie again and again, because it contains all the elements of a great western film. This was very credible in the way they showed the components associated with this film, which includes weapons, horses and clothing. The soundtrack is pleasant and adds zest to the movie. James Drury has the right attitude, choosing a film to be associated with. This is another winner for the western genre. !!!!!
