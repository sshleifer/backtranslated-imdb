10/10 <br /> STORY DISCUSSION <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films ever made, and I don’t say this because I’m fooled by the seemingly meaningless presentation. Those who do not like the film, because they do not understand the story, often criticize those who praise the film, saying that they accept his genius, because they do not understand it. I do not think this film is very allegorical. For me, this is a story with a beginning, middle and end. People get entangled in the film because they expect it to have a deep philosophical meaning, which they must interpret from supposedly meaningless scenes. I feel that they do not understand that mystery proceeds from a split and rebuilt plot, combined with a very long and rather explanatory fantastic sequence, and not from the chaos of visual allegory. Due to the limitation of length, I will try to keep this short and specific and touch on the basic concepts. <br /> <br /> General storyline: Diana goes to Los Angeles after a jitterbug match to get into acting. At the audition, she meets Camille, who falls in love. Diana is furious with jealousy because Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diana discovers another man (director) on the set of the film and discovers another woman (casual blonde) at the engagement party for Camilla and the director. Diane hires a hitman to kill Camille. After this is done, she is obsessed with loneliness and plunges into the unconscious world of fantasy, where she lives the life she wants. Diana woke up then. In her conscious state, she is haunted by what she did. <br /> <br /> Meaning of fantasy: the film begins after the credits from the first person. a picture in which someone falls on the bed and loses consciousness. Here begins the fantasy of Diana. Accident is a reason for her to “return” her dead girlfriend and justify a fantasy life. She portrays her friend meek and innocent because this is what she wanted her to be. At the same time, she behaves as if everything is “like a movie,” because she has an escapist personality. She also, in a sense, kills herself and takes on the identity of a waitress named Betty at a diner. The story revolving around the director is a direct result of her feeling that he somehow became a victim in fact, like herself, and “convinces” himself that he was forced to choose Camille. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control that she felt during the party. Camilla Rhodes in fantasy is actually a casual blonde with an engagement. She hated her so much that she turned her into Camille and became an absolute antagonist. She then took the real Camille and turned her into the perfect, submissive girl from the film and used Rita Hayworth as inspiration. She also portrays the bounty hunter as a very clumsy and incapable person to further justify Camille's survival. Her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for Diana, who eventually turned out to be herself and made the world of dreams die, guiding her through a series of reminders of reality. The first reminder was Club Silencio, who chanted that “there are no groups”, and there are in fact no “tools” that you hear; It is a metaphor for fantasy. She begins to shake violently, because it shocks her perception of her surroundings. Another reminder is the blue box ... In fact, the blue box is not a reminder itself (in fact, it is more than Pandora’s box), but the blue key that opens the box. The blue key reminds her of Camilla's actual death, because that's exactly what the assassin said when he did. Along with love, all this creation is an escape from reality, living in idealized Hollywood, of which she expected to become a part when she arrived. <br /> <br /> This story shows the psychology of a very worried woman who has lost sleep. This is not a series of random things specifically designed to disturb, and this is not a mysterious philosophical message. This is an unfortunate piece of the human condition that is presented beautifully. <br /> <br /> However, ultimately, this is all my opinion. I can be far away. Or it may not mean one thing. Many do not agree with me. Big! In the end, why does this have to mean something? Why can't this just be a statement in itself? What if consistent, sensible narrations are chains for artistic expression? For example, Peter Greenaway spent many words, eloquently supporting this idea with such statements: “I would say that if you want to write stories, be a writer, a writer, and not a director. creating much more exciting in areas that are not related to narration. "And where is the rule written that everything should be immediately understood with only one possible interpretation? There is no such rule, because the clarity of the film is not related to the art of it." “So ...?“ Dr. Mulholland, ”the story or not, affects the audience, chases them, drags them, inspires fear, lulls them. The way it is interpretable is amazing. It never gets old. It never loses its brilliance. Its visual effects are always effective and beautiful. It's cinematic perfection, no matter what. Enjoy.
