This amazingly witty comedy drama struck the crowd at the Philadelphia Film Festival, bringing them into wild applause upon completion. Backed by skillful performances of a nuanced cast member, a sturdy performance by director Jeff Hare, a fast pace and one of Peter Falk’s best performances in recent years, the film becomes a love for the heights and ills of family life. <br /> <br /> Falk stands out for something Jewish Morris Applebaum, a wildly eccentric Shakespearean chatterbox who decides to commit suicide, but not before gathering three adult children and throwing a “big fat Jewish suicide party”. The film is full of indelible charms. There is a "soft room" of Morris; The passionate transmission of Laura San Giacomo to the cynical daughter of Morris; a quick comedic dialogue reminiscent of the work of Neil Simon and Woody Allen; the wrong timing of David Pamer, who plays the seriously wounded son of the psychotherapist Morris; and Morris's patented Morris creams (but be careful, using them too quickly will cause an unpleasant brain freeze). All this is shrouded in a pleasant, intimate atmosphere established in New York. <br /> <br /> Directed by Jeff Hare proved to be a master, pulling unforgettable performances from his line-up and giving the film a cheerful humanity. I was lucky to see Hare's earlier film: The Dark and Strong Ideal Man, starring Neil McDonough (Minority Report) as the man in Los Angeles, turning into madness. The perfect visceral crumb and Checking Out nostalgic breeze are evidence of Hara’s eclecticism and his wide talent. I look forward to checking out his future work. <br /> <br /> I heard that "Checking Out" has no distributor. Some wise company would have succeeded in raising this gem, because it is a potential box office titan in the spirit of "My big Greek wedding." Most importantly, it would give people around the world the opportunity to experience the joys of this film.
