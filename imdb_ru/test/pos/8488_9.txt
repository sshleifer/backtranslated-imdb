A couple of days ago, I saw a stunning "House of Sand and Fog" and was impressed by the stunning performance of Ben Kingsley in the lead role. I decided to watch “Ray,” trying to figure out how and why Ben Kingsley didn’t receive an Oscar for Best Actor. Having seen Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles, I agree with the Academy: he really deserves an award. I like Ray Charles, I wasn't his fan, but Jamie Foxx is surprisingly similar to him. The film is fully supported by Jamie Foxx, who is involved in most of the filming, and his movements on the stage look as if he were a reincarnation of Ray Charles. As for the story, I saw an extended version on DVD, too long, but also very pleasant, with many wonderful songs and scenes featuring mostly addict Ray Charles. My biggest surprise was that Ray Charles was addicted to the heroine and how he felt about his family. Representing his childhood through fragmented memories was a boring part of the film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Ray”
