In short, the story is thin on paper, and you can see the end coming from a mile, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth and incredibly young Phil Silvers keep the film afloat and occasionally lift it straight into the air. Some of the songs are terrible cracks (“Poor John” is a train wreck), but most of them are great fun, and the Hayworth scene performing in an absurdly huge setting for rival Kelly must believe. Another pleasure - the perfect scenery of artificial New York in the best Hollywood traditions. <br /> <br /> Another attraction, considering such things, is the terribly masculine “chivalry” towards women. The oily and transparent obscenity, which was then considered masculine charm (at least in the movies), is presented here in its most sinister form. Some of them look like a cartoon wolf. <br /> <br /> One slight disappointment is Eva Arden, who has fallen into such a small role that she hardly has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interaction between her and Silvers - a missed opportunity.
