The 221 episode of The Lone Ranger was originally broadcast on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years they played in local syndications. For most of the original broadcasts, the series was the most popular piece of ABC. <br /> <br /> The new DVD set from Pop Flix contains the first 16 episodes (September 15 - December 29, 1949) and for some episodes unknown to me 22 of the fifth season, a total of 17 episodes (the same 17 are available in last year’s release Mill Creek Entertainment, so they are likely to be freely available). These sets largely make the film “The Legend of the Lone Ranger” superfluous, since all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the film are included in these episodes. <br /> <br /> Early episodes return to the radio, since the voice-over narration is used as an introduction and for introducing key plot points. <br /> <br /> The series itself was a pure child western with clear distinctions between good and evil and without romance. The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started the Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide the background for his conversion to Lone Ranger status, his partnership with Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels) and the taming of his horse Silver. <br /> <br /> In each episode there is an unambiguous code of positive morality. The Lone Ranger is absolutely good, but he takes on the appearance of evil. While good citizens were afraid of a masked man in the west, and the Indian was not trusted, those who commit evil are afraid of the Lone Ranger. One of the persistent themes is that when the Lone Ranger and Tonto first encounter the average citizen, they are met with suspicion, and by the end of the episode, the citizen will be convinced of their value. The end of the trademark was a minor character who asked the question: “Who is this masked person?”. <br /> <br /> In order to truly enjoy the show, you have to take it as a simplified narrative about the moral by which it was intended. If you do not take it seriously and continue to desire some self-reflective parody elements, you only get upset. <br /> <br /> Again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
