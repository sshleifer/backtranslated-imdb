When this show first appeared on the air, I saw him once or twice and thought that it was another show, “fat guy, skinny wife,” which seemed to fill the net at the time. It was just “good” on the initial views, and I did not watch it again; however, as soon as it went into syndication, I caught a few episodes (simply because it was twice a night), and I tell you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. As soon as you see how all the great minor characters are connected, this show will make you laugh out loud. Every new episode that I watch is more creative than the previous one - people who watch it just a couple of times won't notice it. Writing and plot lines are much more complicated than it seems at first glance (this is far from “According to Jim”). First of all, Kevin James is a hysterical, incredibly charming and talented comedian, as is the cast. Leah Remini has an excellent timing, and Spence Patton Oswalt is one of the funniest characters in the series. And, of course, Jerry Stiller is great as Arthur. I was shocked when I read the comments that he was the worst part of the show - he is a giant part of why this show is so great - his delivery of these ridiculous schemes (completing the dad's crazy nature) is incredible. And screams are the best episode when they show it in childhood, shouting "Lemon Ice!" In that episode, during which Carrie takes him to a psychotherapist in the hope of getting medicine from him (so that Doug does not experience stress), guest star William Hurt decides that Arthur is screaming because he was never tested. The last part of the episode, where Doug beats himself up as a child in a therapy session, goes beyond what’s funny, this is one of the most creative scenes I've ever seen in a comedy series. I feel a strange need to defend this show, because it is greatly underestimated - although Friends was sometimes funny, and Raymond has some great episodes and characters, they both lacked the creative approach that King Queens has. In an era when most comedy comedies are often joking and are generally mediocre, "The King of Queens" continues to push the comedy series and demonstrate this comic genius. The critics of this show obviously don’t understand him - or didn’t watch the show enough to give it a chance, because anyone who has real comic and creative sensibility should laugh out loud while watching. This is definitely on par with my other two favorites, “Seinfeld” and “The Office” in its ridiculous tone. These are Arthurs, Kramers and Michael Scotts from television, who make us watch and laugh out loud.
