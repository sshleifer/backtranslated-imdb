An article published in the New York Times in March 1947 described CrossFire as one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s, "faced with questions of racial and religious prejudice with more open courage than viewers used to expect." While RKO was producing Crossfire, Twentieth Century-Fox was making the Gentlemen Agreement, another story about anti-Semitism. RKO ran to win such an "adorable" picture of Fox in cinemas, releasing Crossfire a few months before the gentlemen's agreement. In July 1947, RKO conducted a Crossfire show for representatives of various religious groups in Los Angeles. In addition, before and after the film, several polls were conducted to assess the prejudices of the audience. Crossfire received both praise and criticism for its depiction of anti-Semitism in America and has been the subject of many editorials. Crossfire received an Oscar nomination for the best picture, but lost to the Gentleman Agreement. He was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan), Best Supporting Actor (Gloria Graham), Best Director and Best Adventure. In September 1947, Crossfire was recognized as the best social film in Cannes. In December 1947, the African American edition of Ebony Magazine awarded the film an annual award for "Improving Interracial Understanding." Loved this movie. If you have the opportunity to look, look.
