To be honest, I thought this movie would be a Japanese drama. I was completely wrong. This film is based on the popular Japanese anime novel of the same name. It tells the story of the city, which is cursed by Uzumaki or Spiral in English. Gradually, city dwellers gradually begin to become dangerous and violently obsessed with something that is associated with spirals, and some residents are actually beginning to turn into living beings in which there is actually some kind of spiral, such as a snail. <br /> <br /> The film was one gigantic, random, acidic journey, intertwined with romance and drama. It seems like a drama. What makes this film disturbing is that some people are obsessed with The Spiral. For example: one of the dads has a garage full of items for the house with spirals embedded in them, one girl took her extremely long hair and teased to insanely huge spiral style, one child slowly turned into a human snail, one man could twist his body in shape spirals, one woman tried to cut her ear to get a snail inside, and one teenager ran on her own so that it could be twisted around a car tire, and one child put herself in a puck so that he could become a spiral. <br /> <br /> Another very disturbing aspect of this very well syndicated one is the atmospheric tone and style in which this film was made. Camera angles add to the psychotic and distorted history, in other words, very good cinematography. The overall coloring of this picture makes the story a little crazy. The color is a mixture of lemon green, yellow and a little orange, and special effects with some of the spirals are outstanding. <br /> <br /> However, as in many Japanese films, there is a tint of forbidden love and a romance between a girl and a boy. However, despite all the spirals occurring in the city and strange events, it is difficult to keep up with the relations of two teenagers. But, in a sense, itâ€™s very irrelevant, more like a second-hand story that has nothing to do with the real story of a spiral-obsessed city. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this film to anyone who loves completely different and bizarre foreign films. He just lacks tomfoolery and insanity, it hurt me.
