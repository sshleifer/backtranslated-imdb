If you like Paddy Chayevsky's “Network”, you will surely enjoy this black comedy, as this is another brilliant scenario of Chayevsky, a wonderful satire in the hospitals of the big city and the perfect car for Geo. K. Scott He plays the burnt-out chief of medicine on the most chaotic day he or his hospital has ever seen. His personal crisis is escalating, and his hospital is crumbling around him as locals protest against the hospital, and patients and doctors die at an alarming rate thanks to a biblically inspired and deadly saboteur. The latter, who theatrically declares himself “Fool for Christ,” “Paraclete of Kaborki”, “Wrath of the Lamb” and “Angel of Bottomless,” snatches doctors on the head, injects lethal injections and changes the patient's personality. such fatal mistakes happen (hopefully not so much, not so often and not in one place) and at the same time make you laugh at the priceless portraits of the characters. One of them is Richard Dysart (“The Law of Laws”), in the role of Dr. Welbeck, a kind of celebrity surgeon who spends much more time worrying about his investments and public actions than his patients, who are fatally suffering from his huge indifference and neglect. Diana Rigg - freedom-loving, hippie-ish Barbara Drummond, who seduces the besieged chief of medicine (Scott) and tries to force him to escape with her. Then there is a misguided assassin who, as it turned out, is Barbara's father and who “functions quite well” on an Indian reservation, where he lives with his daughter and even runs a clinic, but who is pushing for insanity simply by returning to civilization. The most powerful portrait to date is Dr. Scott, Dr. Bock, who exposes his soul as a boy's former genius, a failed father and husband, a brilliant doctor and a responsible administrator, who constantly dreams of suicide, but must withstand the demands of his work. Scott is exceptional in this demanding role. <br /> <br /> Until the final scenes, no one knows whether Bock will leave the hospital for Barbara's Indian reservation and a calmer and simpler life, whether her murderous father will be caught. or whether the protesting, indiscriminate local people will resent and bring the hospital to its knees. Watching a crazy killer at work, we can assume that Chayevsky tells us that our crazy society forces him to do these things, because we are told that he is different from cities and people. <br /> <br /> Like my own father, the chief administrator of several large hospitals over the years, I had some idea of ​​the requirements of his work and the enormous responsibility he assumed. This story makes this responsibility the core of the Scott crisis. This is a funny and scary film in which the actors meet the significant requirements of the Chaevsky script. This is also a movie that I get more every time I watch it.
