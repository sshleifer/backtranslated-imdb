I have been a fan of Rick Mayall and Ed Ededsonson since I remember the weather of his young or the bottom. and I just have to say that I never laughed so much in my life! Guest House Paradiso is damn brilliant! I know that it will not be any cup of tea (with vomiting, farce comedy, violence and obscene language), but then just don’t watch it if it is not yours. it’s not that no one knows what sick and perverted things come up with Rick and Ede when they work with each other !! I think it is unfair that this film received such criticism from critics, because, and I do not think that I am the only one who thinks so, this film is 10 out of 10! :)
