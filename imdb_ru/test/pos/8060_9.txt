This is a film that every child must see before he grows up and is distorted, often passing ideas from generation to generation of the family. I grew up in two different places, although only 20 miles away. I went to school and I had friends of any color and religion for the first 8 years of my life. Then I moved to a village country (although this was no longer the case), where it was very unusual to even have one African-American child in your class. In my senior year in high school, there were 2 or 3 African-Americans (God, why can't I just say black? You can call me honest or white or whatever! Let's go back to the movie and try to see what happens when people get a distorted view or just what ignorance or misunderstanding does to a culture or country! This is a great movie that everyone should watch, especially children.
