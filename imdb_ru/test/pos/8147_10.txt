Honestly, at first I watched this film because of the unreasonable sex scenes, which, as I heard, it does exist, but actually watching the movie allowed me to realize that there are still good and sensible films. Truth be told, this is one of the most well thought out and touching films I've ever watched. I am a teenage bisexual, and the film told me about my difficulties — sex, religion, love, acceptance, etc. He gave me an idea of ​​how to deal with these problems with the help of myself and the people around me who I love for who I am. Cox really did a good job with the film, sprinkling a dozen heartbreaking lines and a bit of sexuality in it. This made the film more interesting. Some compare it with Brokeback Mountain, but I disagree. In Brokeback Mountain there is more drama, while “Last Days” is well balanced.
