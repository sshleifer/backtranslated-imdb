It was one of those films that I had always come across (either on TV or on a cheap DVD), but I never managed to take a picture, as I thought I didn’t miss a lot. It was for one night, and I thought, okay ?? why not. Good decision, as I would kick myself for spending so much time getting around this. For me, it impressed me, as he is there with the best features of Bert Reynold (“Liberation”, “White Lightning” and “Boogie Nights”) and returns to those tough, cool barbarian thrillers of the 70s / 80s who were not afraid to anticipate vagueness and try their best to tune the characters, pack them with really brutal force and effectively combine local locations (in this case, Atlanta) into a warehouse with a mundane photo. In some shades, it reminded me of "Dirty Harry", but it is not. Nevertheless, this neatly honed blues score with its boiling beats, sharp shifts and frustrated sounds made me think very much about the pulsating Lalo Schifrin score that he organized for Dirty Harry. On the other hand, the music soundtrack is hit or missed. <br /> <br /> Sergeant. Tom Sharkey was an anti-narcotics agent in the Atlantic before he was demoted to vicious work because of a breakdown during the bust. Together with his new squad, they encounter a prostitution ring, which attracts their attention by the fact that it belongs to one difficultly monitored and convicted criminal lord. What they dig out includes a prominent government figure and a call girl who can give them some important names, but they have to get to her before she makes a goal. <br /> <br /> Bert Reynold acts, but also directs him into an unwaveringly tough and muscular style that would suit his succinctly sharp performance and thematically tough and tough script of Gerald D Pego (which was adapted from the novel by William Dil). Well, he shows some kind of hearty / insightful thoughts among this armor in scenes in which exciting British actress Rachel Ward is involved, whether scenes when he watches her from another building (and gradually gets carried away by it), when they finally , come together, but these latter interactions halfway slow down momentum, but give it nuuristic strokes. The performances are quite consistent with the production of Reynold with the participation of outstanding actors Charles Durning, Earl Holliman, Brian Keith, Richard Libertini and Bernie Casey. The harsh profanity and witty dialogue between these guys was a blast. As for the corrupt villains, Vittorio Gassman is building impressive strength and power, but it is Henry Silva (who seems to have been born for these roles) the icy cunning and unstoppable turn that makes the show. Where his appearance seems to outline things to come and help them get in place. Plus his adrenaline rush and brutal climax for cat and mouse with Sharkey and his team is brilliantly completed. <br /> <br /> Thrilling passages can be quick and dry, but remain deadly cruel, like an extremely delicate interrogation sequence. Some convenient, old-fashioned shooting techniques add to the wait. The intriguing material makes it quite tactful, being characteristic of the character, but when we think of its smooth swimming, it offers a blunt surprise or two, along with some very violent clashes.
