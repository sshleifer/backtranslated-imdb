This film does an excellent job of guiding us through a dark tunnel of espionage, from inception to final settlement. The influence of the film becomes even deeper with the knowledge that it is based on a true story. Timothy Hutton provides us with a quality, understated performance, and Sean Penn demonstrates why he is one of Americaâ€™s best live actors. As in the case of Midnight Express, this film should make us all think about what we should not do in a foreign country.
