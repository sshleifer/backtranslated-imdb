This is a television film based on the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich in the mid-1970s. Based on how much truth is hard to tell. There is a lot of confidence in this. It is based on a book written by Mark Furman. a crime of memory and its consequences, including the arrest of a suspect, about 25 years later, which at that time was never considered a suspect. In the film, Fuhram, of course, is largely responsible for the arrest and closure of Martha’s case. a surviving family, in particular her mother. The narrative of the film comes from the ghost of Martha Moksley, speaking from the first person. This is a very effective device in this film. For me, this adds more influence to the film and puts on the human face of the murder victim (if only the actress playing the role), Maggie Grace plays Martha, and I was really impressed with her. There is no way to know for sure Mark Furman’s motive in investigating a crime. feelings of justice and maybe he really cared. or maybe it's just O, dollar signs from a future best-selling book. In any case, it makes an interesting film. It is well played and develops fairly quickly. I do not think that the film had a lot of unnecessary, unnecessary things, just what was needed to tell the story. Some might argue that they missed something that could shed some light on the process, and one would be right. You can also argue that the ending was unexpected, and again you can be right. But, as I said, for me, I think they told the story, at least with most of the essentials. Something else would probably require a miniseries. In addition, there is a miniseries called "Season in Purgatory", which was released 6 years earlier. (1996) with which this film has some parallels, even if they are weak. However, if you like this movie, “then you might be interested in“ Season in Purgatory. ” I believe that "Season in Purgatory" is actually a fictional story about the same crime. In any case, for me, “Greenwich Murder” is 8/10
