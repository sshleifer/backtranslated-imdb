In this early work of Fulci, the director shows his main focus, as well as the talent for convincing storytelling and a more than reasonable explanation of the genre. Personally, I think he was unjustly offended throughout his career as an esthetician of blood. This is a rather capable procedural process, and he surprised me with his rich subtext of the narrative, which demonstrates his distrust of the small thinking small town and the inefficiency of the police, as well as the perverted ideals of the Catholic Church, the last of which seemed to cut off this film on his knees when he It was first released, and could possibly give the director a different direction at such an early stage. The comparative lack of blood in the film shows the more pressing and psychological imperative of this film in its prevailing “mystery”, but the blood and puppet art that he actually uses finds good use here, especially in the scene where the falsely accused killer senselessly lynched crowds at the cemetery and left for the dead in a demonstration of vile and outdated vigilance, skillfully choreographed to the modern tunes of diegetic radio. <br /> <br /> Another example was the final scene (which was really amazing), in which a strikingly beautiful priest falls off a cliff, and the puppet used is prominently shown in the middle close-up, which emphasizes his demonic appearance and obvious deformity. It is curious that, given his later work, Fulci also refers to the idea of ​​modernity, captured by the village, holding on to its anachronistic superstitions and ignorance, when the idea of ​​black magic is just a bizarre idea of ​​supernatural evil, which in fact never ends from a doll voodoo, making her witch no more than a worried woman. I also liked the fact that he adds to these layers of the character, transforming a girl from a bourgeois city into an ambiguous figure - is she a slag whom the priest fears for his charges and, perhaps more expressively, for himself? This giallo is transformed into one of the more personal and informative Fulchi films, in which we really get a fair flow of ideas from it.
