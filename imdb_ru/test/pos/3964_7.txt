When the Accepted trailer first appeared, many began to worry when they saw it ... really excited. Who could blame them, it was fun. But this is exactly what you need. People went to Accepted in search of a good movie, but if you think Accepted is not the movie that should be a good movie. This is a film that pleases the audience effortlessly. In this case, those of you who expected a good movie, you need to think about what can be done from a comedy like this one. Think about it, and you will really like the film (because you will get rid of your thought that the film will be fantastic.) DOWN: Watch the film and have fun, but don't look for anything revolutionary.
