This is a film about a man everyone considers to be a Jew. This is a film about Lawrence Newman, who lives in Brooklyn in the 1940s, during World War II. Once, when he gets points, people start thinking that he is Jewish. And this is only because it looks like one. And he lives in a very anti-Semitic area. So some people start to treat it like dirt. They do this as a Jew, and because of Larryâ€™s new wife, Gertrude Hart. lives unbearably. The focus of Neil Slavin (2001) is a rather good look at anti-Semitism. This is a problem that will not disappear. The film is based on the novel by Atur Miller, which, I admit, I have not read. The film is really good, so I'm sure the book will work too. Actors cope well. William H. Macy is always good, and his work as Larry Neuman is great. Laura Dern - Gert Hart, and she is gorgeous. almost as scary as a neighbor who wants to keep Jews out by any means. The character of David Pamer as the owner of a Jewish store Finkelstein is the most sympathetic in the film. Peymer - the perfect choice for the role. One of the greatest scenes at the end, when Mr. Finkelstein and Newman fight against those Nazi people with baseball bats. They unite to fight evil. Christian and Jew.
