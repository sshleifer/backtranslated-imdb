The tumbling doll of flesh (also known as Niku daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) It has been on my wish list for quite some time, and then I finally typed a copy on Ebay some time ago. It was never on a DVD, and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVD-R, which Iâ€™m quite happy with. Film I think the most extreme example of torture is porn, with an emphasis on porn. The woman responds to an ad for a porn film and goes with the producer to the place where he was filmed. Porn is definitely real, with annoying Japanese pixelation to try to hide horrible pictures, without much success most of the time. After the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave, she gets a baton on the head with a baseball bat, and is brought back to the room and brutally dismembered in slow shots, and in one of the most disgusting scenes, the male porn guy screws her into an open wound in the chest. This is after both legs, her hand and a few other amenities were cut off. This film is far superior to the Guinea Pig series, in fact, they are not even close to realism, although this film shows the cheap effects of blood. This is truly one of the best fake snuff films I've ever seen, if not the best. Now I must warn you that if you do not like these things, you should stay away. This film is very strong, and with real sex it is very painful, somewhat erotic. And I mean, in a very sick way. But wherever you talk about this material, this film brings the goods home, and I definitely recommend that you find it. After reading about the film, I was expecting something very strong, but it surpassed it by a bunch.
