I bought a DVD a long time ago and finally found the time to watch it. I really enjoyed watching this movie, since you donâ€™t have the opportunity to watch many more serious Bollywood films of better quality, like this one. Very well done, but I would say that you need to pay attention to what is happening, as it is easy to get lost. When you start watching a movie, don't do anything else! In fact, I would advise people to read all the reviews here ... including spoilers, before watching the movie. Rayma Sen gave her the first great show I saw. Aishwarya was easy at its best. All the performances were strong, directorial and cinematic ... go and see!
