The animation is still a bit rougher from the first episode, The Simpsons Roasting over an open fire, but already, with this first regular episode, by Bart Genius, humor begins to become more layered, faster, and deeper characterization appears. <br /> <br /> This episode firmly establishes Bart's “idle” personality and, more subtly, Lisa's intellectual superiority over the whole family. Although this is the main theme of the entire episode (there is also a good secondary theme of the relationship between father and son Bart and Homer), it is first given in two words when the episode begins with the Simpsons playing Scrabble. Lisa suggests an “id” for her word - a short one, but something you need to be well educated to know. She should read the definition for the rest of the family from the dictionary, which serves as a way to support the sofa. Marge can only come up with "he." Homer is already "oxidized", already sitting on a tray, but does not understand what the word is, so instead he suggests "to do". Bart came up with "kwyjibo" that he insists on the word. Similarly, in the main storyline of the episode, Bart deceives his IQ test, which leads him to be placed in a special school full of gifted children. We know that this is unlikely to last long. <br /> <br /> The Simpsons always played a lot of fun with different intellectual abilities among people through their characters, and, more importantly, they, like people with different degrees of intellectual ability, fit in (or not), are accepted (or no) and are perceived in society. In addition to beginning to present the place of Bart, Lisa, Homer and Marge in this context, this episode is already beginning to respectfully mock nerds and fans outside the Simpson family. Through some dialogues of students of a special school, as well as some other references, including purely visual ones, this episode also shows that The Simpsons are not going to strike by writing or talking. to your audience. It may be just a cartoon, but this is a cartoon that intellectuals, geeks and nerds will understand more than anyone else. And this fact, besides the fact that this is just a very funny show, is the key to the longevity of the show.
