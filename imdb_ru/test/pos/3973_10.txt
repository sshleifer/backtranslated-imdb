I entered into this reflection another rough film with a rude humor. From my first sentence I didn’t like this humor, and there were moments in this film, but I liked it. Justin Long has never really made such comedies where he is sarcastic and smart, and I liked it. Lewis Black .... stop talking. The end that I really loved, because he had to take himself seriously. I mean, how else would you end it? Yes, this is another story about losers, but not in your typical format, and the film was not their ups and downs, they were people who got together for one common goal - to go to college, where they were accepted. The cast was awesome, and yes, I laughed out loud when I didn’t think I would, and the laughter lasted longer than I thought. Parents and sister played their roles well, but their characters are inserted if necessary. The film was not focused around them, but at the same time they appeared when you expect, but not expect them. They played this story very well and I liked the familiar faces of Anthony Hilda (Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (I) (“The Galactic Quest with Justin Long”), Ross Patterson (“The New Guy”) and Sam Horrigan (Brink). Blake Lively added something specific to the film that made it even more enjoyable, as well as Friends of B. I recommend this movie to those who have hated these rough comedies for the last 4 years and really want something with humor and plot!
