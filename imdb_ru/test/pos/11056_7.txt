A short film captured by Gaspar Noah on the film’s map introduces us to his terrible, but quite interesting, character “Butcher”, brilliantly played by Philip Nahon. Direction But here there are all the signs of his later films, showing that he cut out his own voice and style from the very beginning. His sudden cuts, along with harsh, loud noises, skipping memories, and many other methods — all are used to confuse the viewer. And it certainly works. In addition, he is not afraid to show violence, as the audience learns "irreversible." Here the violence is equally powerful, and in the sequel to Seul Contre Tous it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the killing of a horse. He shot in the head, and we observe how he writhes on the floor, a pool of blood flows out of him. Then we see the human birth in all its bloody glory, the daughter of the Butcher. He became orphaned in World War II and grew up hating the world, everyone and everything in it. He serves his clients, but his inner monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts - he wants them all to die. His daughter Blandin Lenoir, who will also fulfill her role six years later, is the only thing that worries him, and we see how they grow old together. She, however, is mute, and the subject of bullying and play. The Butcher’s relationship with her is almost incestuous; she bathes her when she is old enough to do it herself, and so on. D. But this will be discussed in more detail in the next film. When a man attacks her, the Butcher explodes with rage, striking the innocent man in the mouth. He goes to jail, he is taken from the only thing he wants - from his shop and daughter. In a short 40 minutes we will see all this and more, his time in prison and returning to his world. I think that because of his daughter's condition, autism, she is soft, does little except a close look, and is under the full control of her father. The film continues in an exceptionally gloomy Seul Contre Tous. If you can, watch these two films, this one. He has a really excellent game, but it is very difficult to watch because of his tireless tone. <br /> <br /> 7 of 10
