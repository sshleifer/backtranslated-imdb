More fascinating than all the fun orgies in "300" combined. More heartbreaking than the Shakespearean tragedy. More poetic than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. And on top of that, the biggest trash ever created. <br /> <br /> Black comedy that tests the limits of human feelings, the cult film of John Waters Pink Flamingos is a story about a conflict between two families, ends with humiliation, death and, of course, eating dog excrement this is not really a demeaning part). No, no, this is not about impossible love, in those 90 or so minutes there is no Romeo or Juliet. This film is about the battle for prestige, if you can call it that. Battle for the title - A dirty man of all living. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, we have the Divine (played dressing Waters ... mmm ... Divine) caring daughter, good mother, cannibal, murderer, pervert, and the current owner of the title. She loves her son Cracker too much. Crackers themselves show sexual attraction to both chickens and young women, sometimes mixing them in threes. Family friend and loyal partner Cotton gets her satisfaction from observing the Crackers during some of his ... actions involving the previously mentioned objects of attraction. And last but not least: Divine mother and grandmother Cracker, Edie. A 400-pound woman who sleeps, eats, and mostly lives in a baby cradle. She is addicted to eggs and loves the egg cell (the person who brings the eggs ... laughs). <br /> <br /> Four of them live peacefully in a trailer outside the city until they become a target for marble. Exhibitionists, manipulators, scammers, are actually very angry people. Their main source of income is the abduction and feeding of young women. For impregnation, they use their trustworthy and faithful butler in disguise to provide sperm. After that, they sell the newborn baby to the highest price. <br /> <br /> Marble's envy of the Divine and its title will lead to the inevitable confrontation between the two families. The epic battle of filth, perversion and violence. <br /> <br /> Pink Flamingos is an unsurpassed masterpiece in the trash film genre. The film by John Waters, filled with weirdness and strange actions, is hated and hated by traditionalists, critics and ordinary viewers. But for those few who remain unaffected by these generalizations, the flamingo is an unforgettable experience. Cheerful and sick, cruel and poetic. This is really a tasteless exercise.
