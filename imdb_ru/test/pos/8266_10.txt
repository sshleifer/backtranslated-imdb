I copied this video to DVD so that I could enjoy it at any time, and it also makes a very successful (and rare) wedding gift! It's just a great adaptation of your favorite novel. Everything in it is just perfect, and it has aged surprisingly well. With something so old, there is always a chance that it may seem a bit creaky along with more modern dramas, but “Precious Bane” is more than its own. <br /> <br /> Janet MacTier plays with amazing quality Superb Prudence and young Clive Owen are marking the silent Gideon Sarn. <br /> <br /> I urge everyone to see the final sequence, at least a little sniffing the romance. This is the perfect movie to watch when it's cold outside, and you leaned against the couch. <br /> <br /> I really can't recommend it highly enough.
