A group of young people found themselves on the outskirts of the beyond, where the only place nearby was a museum full of wax dummies, and the only form of assistance was the affable local Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors). When night falls, children are taken in record time. <br /> <br /> A strange, whimsical film “B”, which combines the terrible settings of the undergrowth and the plot device from too realistic dummies (which makes it a good update of the “Body in the Wax Museum” genre), is an intense shock festival in the spirit of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. (Then it’s no wonder that TCSM art director Robert A. Burns repeats this duty here, and his view of the magnificent scenery is always useful.) Pinot Donaggios' assessment is absolutely frightening; accompanied by a dark photograph of Nicholas von Sternberg, he permeates the film in an oppressive atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Turns of a plot differ on degree of success; there was one that I saw beyond a mile, and one that really took me by surprise, and I was all the more happy about it. One of the best moments is told to us almost immediately, as the first boob victim finds himself in a room with objects flying at him of his own accord. A capper is a great cork with a tube from which blood is dripping. <br /> <br /> Star Connors offers an exciting game as our good old antagonist, while junior partners, as expected, cannot perform at the same level, although Jocelyn Johns is pretty pretty and certainly attractive. a woman who has enough attractiveness to regard her as a sympathetic maiden in distress. Film colleague Tanya Roberts (brunette in this film) is fine. (If I had one problem with this film, the victims are just too stupid. On the other hand, it doesn’t distinguish it from many horror films of the 80s.) Among well-known authors, future names are future directors Ted Nicolaou, who was here , Ron Underwood (who debuted almost ten years later with Tremor) as an assistant director, and veteran makeup artist Wei Neill, who starred in many films and has since won three Oscars. br /> <br /> Although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements, otherwise this is a pleasant little surprise that debut director David Schmeller presents with confidence and pleasure. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
