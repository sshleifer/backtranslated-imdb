I watch Lackawanna Blues every time this happens. This brings me back happy times. I grew up in a big city in the Midwest. It reminds me of when I was a child, although my situation was a bit different, I feel the same. It makes me wonder if everything we ever know about families is lost. The days of the big mom is not 55 years old. Will they see what it takes to be an inspiration to others. I hope that I was not the only one who loved this film enough to link it to my past. The music was great in this movie. I really felt that it had to go to theaters, for which I would pay to see it. When I watched the movie a second time, I realized who the movie was about. He did an excellent job of writing and producing this film. I think, who better to produce a film based on your life, besides you. As soon as I can, I will receive a copy for home use. I always like the black producer or directors who make such a film feel like you really lived at the time than now. Thank you for such a wonderful movie.
