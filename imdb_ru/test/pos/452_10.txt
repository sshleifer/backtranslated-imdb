“Journey” is a very good movie. This film, shot in the spring of 1958 in Vienna and released in 1959, was quite popular in the early years of its life. Despite the political problems that influenced the success of the film (because the story takes place during the Hungarian revolution, the Cold War), Journey is a very good film, but not very famous. I think it should be immediately released on DVD, because most people who have seen it so far want to have it at home. One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner, their tensions. All their scenes together are very important, but they also reveal strong feelings, great passion and love between the characters (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another quality is a script that is very well written. It was even published as a novel, by screen player George Tabori. The film retains stress from start to finish. At first, we did not know whether Diana and other travelers would be able to leave Hungary because the communist major discovers that Diana’s friend Paul Kedes is Hungarian and he is not allowed to leave the country. The major is deeply in love with Diana, and this is, in fact, the true reason why he does not want to let her go. But after he hugs her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on the screen, and she kisses him too, he lets her go. And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever made — Major and Diana say “Goodbye!” She arrives at the border with all travelers, including Paul, while Surov shot Hungarians several times, he dies. Yul Brynner is very, very beautiful, and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful, charming, sophisticated, just like an English lady. Eul and Deborah are perfect together. They are one of the greatest couples of Golden Hollywood. This moviegoer should watch this movie. In “Journey” there is everything that should be in a good film - a magnificent, fascinating story, interesting characters, a remarkable direction (Anatol Litvak, in my opinion, at its best). Finally, I want to send a message to Warner Bros studio. or to those who restore and release classic films: please, release “The Journey” on DVD as soon as possible.
