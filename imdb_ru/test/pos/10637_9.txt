I saw this film at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. La Pianiste reinforces the thesis “Austrians = dark”, which I formulate. Isabel Huppert received a well-deserved award for the best female role in Cannes for her image of a woman who, in her attempts to achieve an artistic ideal, loses her humanity. Trapped by her talent, she suppresses her emotions and her sexuality until they can be expressed only in perverted and horrific ways. When the younger student falls in love with her, our hopes grow, but soon they are broken that she cannot experience love like others. It's too late for her, and the last 30 tormenting minutes of the film, oddly enough, are devoid of beautiful music, which carried the first 90 minutes. The bottom line is that music itself is not enough without the described life and beauty.
