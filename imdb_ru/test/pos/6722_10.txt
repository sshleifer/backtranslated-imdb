A review of the films about Daisies by James Maj from site onhollywood.com <br /> <br /> On paper “Daisy” sounds like a dream of an Asian movie fan, directed by “Hellish Affairs” Andrew Lau and starring everyone's favorite actor. girl, popular Korean actress Jong Ji Hyun. Unfortunately, despite the talent involved and the fact that the film crew flew to Amsterdam halfway around the world, the film turned out to be a little disappointing, being a romantic cliche drama that is buried in suffering and self-importance. <br /> <br /> The plot is followed by Hye Young (Jong Ji Hyun), a rather naive Korean girl who lives in Amsterdam, working all her life in her grandfather’s antique shop and making portraits for tourists. One day, she begins to receive flowers at the same time from a secret admirer, whom she considers to be a secret person from her past, who once built her a pretty little bridge. One day, she meets Jong Woo (Lee Son Jae, also in “Vacation” and “Public Enemy”), who, unaware of her, is in fact an Interpol agent who watches Asian criminals in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> With Hye Young, suggesting that Jung Wu is responsible for flowers, they very slowly fall into a chaste romantic relationship. However, it turns out that the person sending the flowers is actually Pak Yi (Jung Wu Sang from Sad Movie and Musa), a murderer working for a Chinese criminal syndicate. It is inevitable that the love triangle becomes tragic, and both men face the face, while poor He Young tries to find out who among them is the love of her life. <br /> <br /> Although Daisy is supposedly a love story, it’s like a funeral, with a slow, dismal pace and plot that piles up suffering. Half the time of the film is occupied by scenes in which the characters look out of the window with anguish at the rain, and silence is broken only by bouts of self-pity. Directed by Lau, it seems, is under the impression that this film is a weighty Shakespearean tragedy, and not another grim love story of an assassin. Thus, the court proceedings are rather ambitious, despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based mainly on a bright cliché borrowed from such characters as the Fulltime Killer and John Woo’s classic The Killer. <br /> <br /> Almost every aspect of the film is filled with longing, with the three main characters suffer, as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders, and stubbornly refuse to do anything to continue their romantic inclinations. In particular, Pak Yi, as a kind of overly emotional, socially backward killer, so beloved by modern cinema, is a little ridiculous: from his glaring incompetence in his work to his cheerful attempts to discuss impressionistic painting with He Young or his tendency to grow flowers. Because of this languid passivity, the central novel of the film is somewhat more difficult to swallow, and Lau's attempts to evoke the feeling that it is fate that unites the characters are more likely to be a foolish coincidence. <br /> <br /> Fans of Jong Ji Hyun should be noted that her character is much closer to her role in the grim supernatural drama “The Uninvited” than “My cheeky girl” or “Terrible wind”, and although she tries her best to make some idiotic faces here and there, her performance is definitely more subdued. <br /> <br /> The film benefits from its glossy production value, and Lau makes good use of Amsterdam landscapes, playing on the contrast between the gray, almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue sky and flowering fields of the countryside. Unfortunately, he has a tendency to abuse the slow motion for some emotional scenes, which, in combination with some of the visual cards, gives the film a sense of perfume advertising. There are several scenes of surprisingly violent acts, although there are few of them, and they are far from each other, and although they are well thought out, they seem to have been added as an afterthought and do a little more than a brief increase in pulse. <br /> <br /> Despite its flaws, “Daisy” makes viewing attractive, and the story captures almost in spite of itself, mainly because of the painful charm, not to see which of the men of He Young comes to an end, but to see who dies, dying in her hands. The self-satisfied melodrama works well enough to mark all the appropriate frames for the genre, and the film functions perfectly as a nice glossy, deplorable novel. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that the DVD has a directorial cut of the film, which this time indicates that it differs significantly from the theatrical version, which not only adds 25 minutes, but also reorders some scenes, making the narration less linear . Although this new version may be too long, it will certainly be better, since without these changes the film would undoubtedly be even more traditional and would suffer from even more gloomy character development. <br /> <br /> Wai Keung Lau (director) / Jae-young Kwak (script) CAST: Woo-Sung Jung ??.
