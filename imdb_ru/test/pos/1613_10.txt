The greatest period of cinema began in post-war Europe with the movement of the Italian neorealist. Over the next two or three decades that followed France, France’s New Oscillations attracted everyone’s attention, and there was always Bergman somewhere on his desert Scandinavian island, making bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti brought the art form to full circle, geographically speaking, with his wonderful work “Death in Venice”, which can also be called “Death of European Cinema”. After the end of the sixties, the great European filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, were generally tired and handed the torch to a new generation of American filmmakers (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This film is absolutely reminiscent of a grand summing up, not only because of certain obsessive ideas of Visconti, but also because of the common attempt of European filmmakers to achieve an aesthetic ideal in the cinema. And rest assured, you will not find a more rigorous task master than Visconti, shown here. Guys, he does not play with the crowd: either you are behind him and go forward, or you are left behind. Pace is a difficult task: slowly, but never without emotional weight. "Incidents" are rare and far from each other, but each of them seems symbolic in outer space. <br /> <br /> Most likely, we will never again find ourselves in such a rarefied company from the point of view of films: one of the greatest writers of the century who inspired this story (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest directors (Visconti) one of the greatest actors in the lead role (Dirk Bogard) and almost continuously swelling in the background, Gustav Mahler the 5th symphony. Taking full advantage of Mahler’s ability to inspire romanticism even in the most cynical bosom, Visconti turns Ashenbach’s protagonist into a decrepit composer from his original personality as a writer, even turning Bogard into LUKA, like Mahler (disgusting mustache, specifications, shaggy hair, duck walk). By the way, Bogard demonstrates what is perhaps the best role of an actor in cinema history: this is largely a silent presentation, and the actor must convey the crowd of meaning with a gesture or a look - a complicated trick without robbery, like Chaplin or simply acting like a revived corpse. <br /> <br /> Cinema just doesn’t get any better than this. I will ignore complaints from Ritalin addictions, which say that it is too slow, but even a more legitimate complaint about some Ashenbach memories with his opponent-friend is inappropriate. Memories fit perfectly into the thematic problems of the film (that is, which way is better for aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), And the suddenness and insight of these interruptions serve to prevent viewers from becoming sleepy. (Of course, some viewers will still sleep in this film.) The continuous stream of Mahler and the beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this film is actually about something. And basically it is suffering: romantic (capital letters), in particular. Being a suffering romantic, Visconti knew what he was talking about. <br /> <br /> [SPOILER. .. I think] If for anything else, see “Death in Venice” for its significant opening credits. , and for his unforgettable ending, with the dark black paint for Bogard's hair flowing from his sweaty, dying head onto his chalky white face. Meanwhile, in the distance, young Tadzio, the object of Bogard's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points to the horizon, like a sculpture by Michelangelo. The climatic sequence summarizes with painful economy everything that the film is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the end of life against the background of the beginning of another life and the cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. * Death in Venice * is a wonderful work of art. <br /> <br /> [DVD hint: As with the simultaneously released masterpiece Visconti * The Damned *, I recommend that you turn on English subtitles while watching this movie. Allegedly in English, but the sound of the DVD seems dirty, and there’s a lot of Italian in the movie anyway.] <br /> <br />
