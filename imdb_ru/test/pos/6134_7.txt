Yes, I watched this mini-series with mom and dad as a kid. It was one of the few mini-series that my 9-year-old mind could follow. I remember that it was very well done, and did not necessarily feel the typical miniseries of crap. It was more or less an original concept that really caught your attention. I would recommend this mini-series to anyone who loves history and plot twists. Although most of the turns in this film are either spelled out or predictable, it is still worth the time. However, I have not yet verified whether you can get it through netflix. I would imagine no. They should play it on a historical channel or something like that.
