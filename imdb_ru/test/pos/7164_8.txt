I originally saw this film as a blockbuster rolling VHS. It was a long time ago, but still remembered it. The blockbuster is no longer there. Netflix didn't have one, and there weren't so many copies on the Internet — just a few copies of VHS. He recently finally found it in DVD format on eBay at a reasonable price (in PAL format, but our DVD player will play PAL discs on our NTSC TV). <br /> <br /> My wife and I liked it. The style of the film is a bit strong, and many, if not most parts, are pretty replayed, as if the fans did it (especially the children), but this does not interfere. The contradictions of societies are intensified in an overpriced game. <br /> <br /> There is some political preaching in the sense that young people in Russia should not try to escape from their not so great life, but should at least try to make things better. But it does not dominate. In most cases, this is quite ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some Western underestimates, commented on by others, are not at all in the fact that IMO, I take it as a comment on the expectations of Russian characters. At least from my western point of view. Perhaps this is an underestimation of the West from the Russian point of view (which is literally said about him by the characters). <br /> <br /> I can't say how literally the English subtitles are literally true to the film, but I can say that the subtitles were done very well, full of English idioms, as if made by a native English speaker - complete with “colorful” language.
