Even for science fiction this film is a bit like a movie. Well, more than a little ... My first thought after watching was that I had just lost my mind. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, waiting for another Darko. Darko fans will never like Richard Kelly's other film because of their bizarre cult standards. Donnie Darko is the past, accept this. <br /> <br /> Richard Kelly loves making films that make you feel stupid because you don’t understand “deep meaning” the first time you watch them. Honestly, I had to look at the “Box” twice before I liked it. <br /> <br /> Deeper meaning - (to save you from a handful of sociological psychoblock) People are selfish, we make decisions that can ruin our lives, and do not open mail without return address. <br /> <br /> Summary: A creepy old man tells Cammer Diaz: if you press a button, I will kill someone you don't know and give you a million dollars. Of course, she pushes him and, as the creepy old man promises, she gets the money. Then the film is immersed in the unusual. To save my fingers from typing ... For pushing a button, Diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien creatures in a complex experiment to measure the morality of the human race. <br /> <br /> I liked: the willingness of the film to ignore the general guidelines of the film. This is different. It is intense. This has a deeper meaning (although his philosophy is 101 material). That leaves you to guess. NOT a Hollywood ending! <br /> <br /> I didn’t like it: why would any creature with the technology of suppressing another life form develop such a ridiculous scheme? What god as an alien has the patience for this? Diaz was good, but did you need a country accent? They live in Virginia. <br /> <br /> I give him 7 because Kelly did not pay as much attention to details as in his other films. Overall a good movie.
