Anthony Quinn is a master at capturing our hearts and sympathy. He portrays a Romanian peasant with an IQ below average pursued by his wife to do more. This is World War II, and the Nazis captured his country. Soon, he discovers that he is digging trenches, hoping to profit in the eyes of his wife. The Nazis have different ideas. In subsequent years, we observe how events unfold in his naive eyes, but all he wants is to go home. His manipulations and bad luck just take him into hot water. Finally, through no fault of our own, we see his image on the cover of "Der Spiegel" as a perfect Aryan. The war ends, and the Allies are bringing him to trial for war crimes. But all that our peasant wants is to return home to his wife.
