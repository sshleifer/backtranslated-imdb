This is a great James Bond movie. Although it is not part of the original and more famous series, and it is a separate film, it is very well done. The seduction of Sean Connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius, as he called the film in such a way that it speaks of his past not to play Bond again. Connery was as great as in his previous speeches in the year 007. The script is outstanding, as are the photos and performances. This is the earliest film I remember with Kim Basinger, which became much more famous after this film; Barbara Carrera was excellent; and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the main villain. The frequent references to aging Bond and the changing times and attitudes of the British secret service were the most ridiculous. Gadgets 007 were equal to gadgets of other Bond films. What was missing was the famous musical theme 007, which, of course, could not be used by this rival piece. It was quite amazing for me to see two excellent James Bond films released that same year, this one and the Octopus with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the film is the emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The beginning of the 80s was the first flowering of such things, and using them in this film made it a very modern film. The film is actually a different version of Thunderball, updated by a new technology. Regardless of the recurring theme, there are enough differences to make it the most interesting. I will watch it often.
