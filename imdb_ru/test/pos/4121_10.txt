This is at least very close to the perfect publication of the video. The messianic metal band, the rock and roll dinosaurs, the biggest and most influential heavy band in the world, perform their hits and remind the band's past - what else do we need? <br /> <br /> The video begins with "War pigs" and ends with "Paranoid", and in the middle all the greatest and most significant classics of the original composition include: "Electric Funeral", "Sweet Leaf", "After Forever", “Iron Man”, “Children of the Grave” ... and, of course, my personal favorite “Into the Void”, I am glad that they did not leave him. Well, how could they? <br /> <br /> Nevertheless , this video is more than just music. Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward talk about the vibrant history of the band. The only thing that bothers me a bit is when a live song interrupted by interview pieces. For example, is it worth telling how the song “NIB” got his name, right in the middle - one on top of the other? I doubt. This is still a small flaw, so it's not that difficult. <br /> <br /> The band members are also lounging on the chairs and talking to each other: pleasant stuff for the Saturday fan! I admit that it’s hard for me to understand what Ozzy Osborne is mumbling about, but it's just fun. I had the honor to participate when the “Last Dinner” entered Finland, and for me personally this video is the perfect way to remember this great show.
