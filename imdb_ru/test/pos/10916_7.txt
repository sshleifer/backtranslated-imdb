*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** I loved the installation and laughed constantly throughout the film. The acting was great, my favorite role was Howard (Kevin Kline) trying to be a "courageous man." The groom and parents did an excellent job as an auxiliary staff. Spoiler Warning: the actions of his conservative family and attempts to be polite were spiritual and believable. My only problem with the end was that Howard was actually gay. The film is set up as “be who you want to be,” but the film actually does the opposite. Howard’s logic in his “discovery” is that he loves Barbra Streisand’s films and loves to dance to music. His manners and tastes seem cheerful, and only when he is pointed out does he realize this. Instead of releasing Howard, the pigeon is full of holes in him. Oh, he likes to dance to the music, than he should be gay. His recognition of marriage was like inclination to the desires of society. In the end, the film becomes a gay rights film that was not an original course. It almost becomes soft with the rest. I think the film would be better if Howard were honest. That would be truer for the message.
