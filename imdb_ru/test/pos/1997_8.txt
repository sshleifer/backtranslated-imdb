I watched the movie actually several times. And what I want to say about this is the only thing that made this film a high title, this is an incredible performance of Burak Altai, absolutely nothing but this one. Even those stupid models named Denise Akkaya and some of these popular names are at times in the film ... Burak is definitely very talented, I saw several works that he did and which he went through. Despite the fact that this is a kind of horror film, he does an excellent job with comedy films, as well as in dramas. I can argue that most of you have seen Asmali Konak in films and TV shows, these two would go for an example ... All I want to say is that you should follow the new works coming from Burak, then you will see. Keep up the good work, bro, lots of love ..
