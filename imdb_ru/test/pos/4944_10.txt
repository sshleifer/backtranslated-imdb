Soul Calibur has always been my favorite series of fighting games of all time. And SCIII is my favorite of the series. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very well done. Much greater improvement compared to changeable polygons in Soul Edge / Soul Blade. Characters have facial expressions, hair in the wind, and they even blink. <br /> <br /> Soul Calibur has always been known for its interesting plots and characters, and SCIII is no exception. Each character has its own story, which is detailed and well done. My favorite character is Tea Xianghua. She is cute, she is a funny and strong female character. Yes, I know that she is wearing pink and she has a boyfriend (from whom she ultimately saves the BTW), but it looks like she has something more. Xianghua, like all other characters, has flaws and minuses in their personalities, so not a single character is perfect, not even good guys. <br /> <br /> Music is beautifully written for a series of fighting games. This does not sound kitchy (vampire series) and does not sound like an old school porn movie soundtrack (Mortal Kombat). The characters have their own themes, and many of them are made in accordance with the culture of one or another part of the world. I don't think there is a song in this soundtrack that I donâ€™t like. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing in this game is to create your own anime-like character (Create a Soul). You can make him or her look cute, sexy, or even ugly if you want. However, if you find a character setting that you like, do not forget to take notes, otherwise you will not remember how you created this character. I felt very addicted to CaS. <br /> <br /> In general, I think Soul Calibur is my number one combat game series of all time. There is everything I asked for. What more could I want?
