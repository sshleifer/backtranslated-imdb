Mr. Carlin left our general forum in June 2008, shortly after going to the hospital with chest pains (he had a history of heart problems). The media and comics everywhere covered the loss more than I or he ever expected ... but he was the grandfather of an observational comedy. <br /> <br /> This recording was his last production and contains a large section on the topic of death and the prospects for life after it. The shooting of the project took place shortly after his seventieth birthday, which he was happy to receive (noticed?). I followed Karlin's career since the days of fuzzy black and white television and enjoyed his thematic albums. <br /> <br /> For ANY Karlin fan, it is an honor to at least see (if you donâ€™t have a copy) this particular show. He was still moving fast, and with a great time, even at 70! As he would say, he does NOT "smile to you from heaven." If he does anything at all, he doesn't take harp lessons; maybe he is looking up !!!
