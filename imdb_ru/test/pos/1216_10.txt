“HAND OF DEATH” definitely assesses the top ten on a scale of one, to a large extent thanks to the masterful leadership of John Wu, combined with Kat’s excellent cinematography: unhurried tracking cadres are worth rental prices; there are moments when this borders on becoming an art house film. Both James Tien and Sammo Hung are made of those villains you cannot but love to hate. Tien is especially good as the worst of the bad. This is a reversal of roles, the like of which I had never seen before (Tian usually played a hero and, in fact, with his mustache, I did not even recognize him at the beginning). Sammo's stupid "spontaneous teeth" only make an already dubious character even more flawed; the fact that he is also an experienced martial arts master makes him even less attractive - a villain you love to hate. His choreography of battle scenes is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears briefly (at the beginning and at the end of the path) as a blacksmith, and I think I actually caught a glimpse of Yuen Biao somewhere along the way. Tang as leading is nothing short of gorgeous.
