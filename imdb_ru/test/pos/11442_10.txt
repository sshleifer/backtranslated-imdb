This film gave me the most pleasant surprise I've ever seen. It was not a big-budget production, and its premise, middle-aged amateur jazz musicians get unexpected professional participation at the Catskills-like resort seems rather modest. What is not modest is the success of the film. This is a small piece of life film that is most interesting in everything. Director Frank D. Gilroy also wrote the script, and it is full of interesting stories and unexpected twists. <br /> <br /> Actors are apprentices who do a good job. The biggest revelation for me was Cliveon Little. He plays a professional musician who is hired to replace a sick band member. His attitude immediately conflicts with the others. Although they see this as an opportunity for great pleasure and a unique thing, he considers this to be his work, and not particularly interesting. This leads to conflict, but when the group gets into trouble, it sends them. The little one who died too young really showed me that he was a good actor in this film. <br /> <br /> This film is a real sleeper, a kind that a movie fan always hopes to discover. I recommend it with all my heart.
