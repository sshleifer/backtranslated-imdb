This is by far the best cinematic version of William Faulkner's fiction I have ever seen, and I have seen some of the most outstanding ones. Filmed in Faulkner’s hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, it truly reflects the feelings of Jefferson and Yoknapatawa County. “The Intruder in the Dust” is not one of Faulkner’s best novels, but even if it’s a cliche, it will be a jewel in any other person’s career. It's better than Harper Lee, but simply “Kill a Mockingbird” fifty feet into the ground (I read him in ninth grade, and that’s exactly what he needs). The main roles in the film are played by two of the most prominent Faulkner characters: Gavin Stevens and Lucas Bosch. Stevens is perhaps the most common character in all Faulkner literature. He is a lawyer, and he easily works as a narrator, because, unlike many of his other characters, Stevens is a man of logic, not of emotions (at least when he is older). Lucas Beauchain, perhaps the most prominent of all the black characters of Faulkner (he plays a major role in one of Faulkner's outstanding masterpieces, Down, Moses); unlike all other blacks in Yoknapatauf, he refuses to bow to any white man. He has pride, and many in the white population believe that a black man is a great quality. One day, Lucas finds himself standing over a dead white man with a newly released pistol. Most of Jefferson and the surrounding areas see no need for a trial, and everyone is almost certain that Boshan will be lynched by the end of the evening, or at least the next day, since the murder and arrest took place on Sunday. Beauchamp, on the other hand, proclaims his innocence and tries to get Stevens to help him. Stevens refuses; the case seems open and closed. But his young nephew, Chick Mullison, because Lucas helped him in the past, is ready to help him now. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, no Hollywood film of this period treats racism as openly as this one. Hollywood films rarely pursue the black population, but instead prefer to cast them on the role of servants. If you are an African American actor, you can also give up and accept this role as a mother, maid or servant, because this is the only way you will work. In the film "The Malefactor in the Dust" you can find one of the most memorable roles, not wearing curtains, in a black actor, Lucas Beauchamp. And Beauchain, as I described above, is not a stereotypical character, and the audience may have found it difficult to accept. Even today, black characters are usually simple, magical and kind. The recent art hit "Far from Heaven" is a great example. Boshan is some kind of moron, and he is very stubborn. Although he may be a little less here than in the novel, he is not a stereotype of any kind. He is a difficult person. Juano Hernandez plays Beauchana extraordinarily well. I have not seen this movie for a long time, but it also appears in the Robert Aldrich film “Kiss Me Deadly” of 1955, as well as in the cinematographic version of Faulkner's latest novel Rivers. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great in the film. I also have to quickly praise Claude Yarman Jr., who plays the great role of Chick Mullison. The novel unfolds from his point of view, and he is a recognized hero of the picture. Jarman is a real actor; he captures the character (which also appears elsewhere in Faulkner’s fiction, for example, describing events that happened a decade or more before his birth in the 1957 novel The City) perfectly. Next year, he will appear in another remarkable role in the underrated John Ford film Rio Grande. The only other Clarence Brown film I've ever seen is National Velvet, a completely different picture than Dustplayer. His work here is exceptional; I really have to give him credit for capturing Faulkner perfectly. Other well-known adaptations of Faulkner are too melodramatic (Long Hot Summer, filmed in 1958, which I really like despite it) or too cold (Tomorrow, filmed in 1972, what I do not like; this coldness is a complete misunderstanding of Faulkner "). The only other one that really succeeds according to its source material is the magnificent filming of Dillas Sirk in 1958 of Pilon (a completely different kind of Faulkner’s novel), “Spotted Angels”. 10/10
