I have no words to describe the beauty of “The Cranes Are Flying,” but I will still try to write about it. This is a powerful and delicate love story that took its place in World War II. This is a classic story of lovers (Boris and Veronika), separated by war and what is happening between them. The shots of the film are so great that you will get carried away - the technique of the film perfectly matches emotions. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that directly depict war: bombardment — wind, lightning explosions — this will have important consequences in the life of the main character, Veronica, who is waiting for Boris to return; and there is another scene on the front where we will encounter an emotional / visual hurricane showing images played in Boris’s mind. Another scene works as a leitmotif of the film and gives its name - flying cranes in the sky. This image is a symbol of Nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film: do not lose hope and fight for a better future. <br /> <br /> Kalatozov is a great director, this film is visually stunning, and it also deeply touched me. This is not just a clean technique. <br /> <br /> Tatiana Samoilova is as beautiful as Veronika. What else can I say? The film goes beyond the time in which it was made - the action takes place during World War II. But it could happen anytime, anywhere. While there are wars (large or small), the film and its message will remain relevant.
