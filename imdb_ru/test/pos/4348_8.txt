<br /> <br /> Oh my word! I have never seen a film that lacked moral judgment or the consideration of anything other than the death of filth! Michael Winner here makes a credible observation of human desires, demonstrating the insane world of deep and shattered executions. Not only does he spoon us with a spoon full of hell on earth, visible through the face of mustached Bronson, he also shows us the spoon that he feeds us and says: â€œLook at what you are looking at, look at yourself and ask the question Do you like it? "And even if you tell yourself that IT CAN'T BE IT !!!! You will know that deep down you will know ... this is a masterpiece
