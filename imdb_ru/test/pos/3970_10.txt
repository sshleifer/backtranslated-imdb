One of the best teen comedies I've seen in a long time is accepted. It has an original script, a talented cast, and it provides one and a half hours of pure real fun. <br /> <br /> He tells the story of high school graduate Bartleby "B" Gains (Justin Long), who is not accepted in any of the collages he addressed, so to avoid disappointment of his parents he creates a fictional collage . In an attempt to fool his parents completely, he creates a fake website and turns an old mental hospital into a school. Everything goes smoothly until many other "accepted" students appear on his doorstep. Now he and his friend should come up with this collage, not only for themselves, but also for others. <br /> <br /> Justin Long, as the lead man, is absolutely brilliant, his character is as natural as possible, and outstanding acts of support - John Hill as Sherman Schraider, Columbus Short in the hands, Maria Thayer as Rory, Adam Hershman as Glen and Lewis Black as Uncle Ben. <br /> <br /> Humor is fresh and simple, and most importantly Funny, from the very beginning and after the credits. The plot develops so easily that by the time you stop laughing at the last joke, you start giggling at the next one. Along with all the funny movie draws our attention to a very common topic - the formation of collages. If film students usually unite against the school government, in this case they are united by a mutual desire to go to school and study. <br /> <br /> And yet the film does not designate all other schools as wrong, it simply shows that there is another way. You, what they say: â€œIf there is a will, then there is a way. And sometimes children may know better what they need than their parents. <br /> <br /> This film is a small story about incredible possibilities in life wrapped in the best possible format.
