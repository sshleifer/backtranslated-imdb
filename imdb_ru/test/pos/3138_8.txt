It takes time to get used to the sound of Sons of The Pioneers, but then you completely enjoy it. If the soundtrack is performed by such an orchestra as Max Steiner or Dmitry Temkin, it will lose its folklore character. Music leads the film, it seems that everything follows its rhythm. The whole cast is superb. Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. are young people leading a caravan. Ward Bond is the leader of the Mormons, and Joan Drew is the actress of flirting. Ford was able to make from what would be an ordinary western, something completely different and original, showing us music, dancing and, most importantly, people.
