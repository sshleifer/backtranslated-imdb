A couple of years before SCREAM faked a slasher / horror genre with savvy, shy young things that know every trick in the book about what to do and what not to do in a difficult situation, a small film produced in Russia struck theaters without or grand claims. <br /> <br /> This film was a serene witness. The starring unknowns (with the exception of the extremely short cameo of Sir Alec Guinness, whose scenes were supposedly filmed eight years before the actual shooting of this film), she told the story of a silent make-up artist Billy who is working on a film about Russian film production, filmed and filmed by her sister Andy. She does not know that the set was closed when she goes to get her things and accidentally stumbles upon a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody. Overcoming horror, she warns the killers of her presence, followed by the persecution, and finally Andy, who takes her home when they warn the police, saves her. The trouble is that ... there is no body, there is no evidence that something similar happened. Despite this, the mysterious inspector seems to be on the side of Billy in history ... <br /> <br /> And to say more would be criminal. MUTE WITNESS is a film that requires careful study, similar to the most intricate, clever thriller, because it is not only an intricate thriller, but also pays contributions to films like WAIT UNTIL DARK and Hitchcockâ€™s best film. the choice of camera shots, imperturbable humor, Americans react in foreign countries where they are powerless, and gnaws at the nail, while it seems that something has to break. Even if the story becomes too implausible due to the fact that the storyline suddenly becomes the center of an even greater conspiracy, the film does not succeed in deceiving the audience with cheap shots (for example, the sudden appearance of a man on camera, accompanied by the crash of violins), but with fear of the unknown and this death just a shadow. Very clever.
