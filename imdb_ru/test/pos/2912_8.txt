When this film gets it right, it really gets it right. And when things go wrong, I would say that 3/4 of a movie is great. I can even point out the bad. This is all about romance. Everything you need to know about this is said in the first five minutes, but will drag on by about 30. I would recommend skipping this section if you can. It does nothing but explain its exile. It was supposed to be a minor plot, which was quickly cast aside. Fortunately, the period from 0 to 30 and 1: 00-2: 19 (“End”) is excellent. <br /> <br /> In this film there are a number of great performances and as many terrible ones. Like everything else in this film, acting is either flawless or terrible. Pyotr Ustinov, like the slimy, one-eyed slave of Kapt, is beautiful. This is one of his best performances in the role of Spartacus. Victor Mature, as ambitious Horemheb, is also perfect. Again one of his best roles. Gene Simmons is Merit, the ideal girl in love with our hero John Carradine, who plays an excellent supporting role as a philosophical grave robber; and Michael Wilding is superb as Ahnaton, the idealistic pharaoh who tries to bring peace and monotheism to Egypt just to see him fall apart due to his reluctance to fight. Now bad. Unfortunately, Edmund Purd in the role of sinuhe. This is doubly unfortunate, as he is the main character. The whole film revolves around it. In fact, he is very good as a disappointed exile and a wise old man. This is due to its extremely limited range. He seems incapable of expressing passion in his words. This is especially evident during love scenes that are not awkward. He spends the second half of the film as an old man, in whose play he is quite decent. He has the perfect voice for the character. The less Bella Darvi is said to be about Nefer, the treacherous Babylonian woman, the better. <br /> <br /> The costume and the scenery are great. This is the only film I know about trying to portray life in Egypt, which is not clouded by Jews or Romans. The film takes place in the 14th century BC. as before Exodus. The only monotheists are Pharaoh Akhenaten and his followers. In most epics, the same strong element of religious zeal is present, but it is done differently and is revealed only at the very end. An interesting note: after Ehnaton followed Horemheb as pharaoh, the film completely missed the most famous pharaoh of all: Tutankhamun. It seems odd that using this name can raise awareness of the film. <br /> <br /> Be careful: this is an epic film of the 1950s. If you don’t like these things, don’t expect them to be different. It is different, but it is still an epic. I appreciate this film, and I appreciate what he did and what he tried to do. This is a film that needs to be remembered better than it is.
