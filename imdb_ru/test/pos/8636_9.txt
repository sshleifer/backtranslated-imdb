There are a lot of films that, as we say, need to be watched twice. In most cases, this is mainly a recommendation: you understand the film anyway after the first viewing, and watching it a second time helps you catch plot twists and turns that you simply did not notice. However, for Dr. Mulholland, this is not the case. The sequence that worked for me was the following: to see it for the first time — spend the day on the Internet, trying to figure out what was going on — and then see it the second time. Otherwise, most likely, you will not be able to fully enjoy this movie. Then you begin to realize that this piece is brilliant, camera work is great, and the aftertaste accompanies you for several weeks. <br /> <br /> 9/10
