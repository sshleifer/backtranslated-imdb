I watched Love Life on vacation when she starred at the Florida Film Festival. It was a wonderful surprise - to find a British film that was not derivative or exploitative. A wonderful romantic comedy for a change that will fascinate viewers, ready to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film. The transitions between the scenes seemed to me a little distracting, but in general I think that Love Life is a winner, ruby ​​in dust. One for the whole family. A pleasant change to see a British film for a teenage audience that is not littered with four letters. Try and see.
