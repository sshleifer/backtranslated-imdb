I like this film. I can be biased because I love dolphins. However, my 3 and 4 years. the old one will sit and watch the whole movie .... This is not Oscar material, but definitely interesting. Dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of ocean scenery and sunsets. My favorite scene is when Flipper throws water from the bottle that hits Sandy in the head. This is a cute funny moment that makes me laugh every time. On the other hand, the vile meanness of a hooligan boatman (forget his name) is a bit difficult to accept. And the shark scene is far from reality. Question: Do dolphins really make such noise? Or is there a serious dubbing? Bottom line: my children like it, and it continues to be processed through our VCR.
