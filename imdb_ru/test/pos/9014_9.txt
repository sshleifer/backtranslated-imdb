Although I realized that this show is too strange to please everyone, I do not understand where all these bad reviews come from, and I am most surprised by the bad reviews that were received from movie fans. I liked it, and it hooked me from the first episode, which I watched. Although a bit confused that Cusco was sent to school. And that seems to be high school, not college. But I believe that he is only eighteen, right, so he is not too old to get an education? And didn't the royals always have to get the best education available to them? So "Cusco must finish, otherwise he will not become an emperor," for me it does not sound too strange. And I believe that his education was previously neglected, so he should get an education now.
