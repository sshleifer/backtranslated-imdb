I usually don't review online, but it's Saturday, and I was trapped in my room, on a rainy day, when I had nothing to do except to watch sci-fi movies and "Xena: Warrior Princess" (I can't get damned " Joxer The mighty song of my head, she’s been there for the last ten years or so, just appears by chance when someone (I) does something idiotic). If you have any complaints about this film, and you actually publish them on the Internet, do you have ANY idea of ​​how you look like an idiot? If you expect more from Bruce Campbell than what he expounds (in the most literal sense), then why, in the holy name of the Most High, do you watch his films? No one is watching a Bruce Campbell movie, when they want to see something brilliant and understandable, we look at them in order to better treat ourselves (as people who watch Jerry Springer and eat a stocky monkey) and to be easily entertained by meaningless chatter I personally love Bruce Campbell films. I'm not a complete idiot, in fact, I see myself an intellectual and a scientist (haha, shut up, Ellie). His films reflect crazy, random, bizarre, ridiculous ideals that anyone can enjoy wisely, screaming or not. This, and he was kind of sexy with Xena: A warrior, even with facial hair. I rate this movie by 10 points, simply because I can. If you can't take simplified plot schemes (if any), hot beauties in fantastic splendor (leather, spandex) and familiar, if not exhausted, views of madness, then shout out loud, don't watch the movie (or anyone who mentions the name of Bruce Campbell ). Oh yes, Ted Raimi was great in this movie! Way Ted! You did the best with what you had. ; |
