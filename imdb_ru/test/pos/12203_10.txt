A new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Lake Bell is wonderful ... Too bad her other show, Miss Match, was canceled. I'm just glad she returned to the "Surface". I can't wait to get the Surface back. This show is truly unique to watch. With a terrible underwater world, similar to the Jurassic Park, this show makes you wonder what will happen next. He is adorable, even if he is going to turn into something bigger and much more sinister. There are so many common shows that seem to paraphrase the very same old subjects. When something like “Surface” appears, you just have to say “THANK YOU!”.
