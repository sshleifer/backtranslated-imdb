Stunning view of the ocean and life in it. <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> Working with the camera was absolutely phenomenal. Every picture is made beautifully. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see all the animals that I could not even imagine. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough has a wonderful narrator voice. No one could do better. <br /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> There was one or two different times when it was mentioned that the Earth was 1 million years old (I believe another belief). <br /> <br /> In general, the series may like anyone. I highly recommend buying it. 10/10 stars
