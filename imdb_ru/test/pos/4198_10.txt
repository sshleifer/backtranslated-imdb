This is one of those movies where it's easy to see that some people won't like it. My wife never saw this, and when I just reviewed it last night, I waited until she went to bed. She might have been amused by a couple of small snippets, but I know that she has had enough of it for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> The head has nothing to do with ordinary history. The film is firmly stuck in the psychedelic era. In a nutshell, this can be seen as cinematic surrealism or something like a postmodern acid journey through film genres. If you're not a big fan of these things - psychedelia, surrealism, postmodernism, and “acid travel aesthetics” (assuming that there is a difference between them), you should probably stay away from this movie. On the other hand, if you are a fan of this material, you need to run out and buy Head right now if you have not done so already. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, the film has never been much respected. This probably has a lot to do with preconceived opinions. After all, this is the star of The Monkees - Mickey Dolenc, Davy Jones, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork - and The Monkees were a musical group of actors that were produced by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider to be friendly, bubbling. sticky Beatles for the television series. In their era, they enjoyed the same respect as, say, Menudo, New Kids on the Block, The Spice Girls, and so on. As one of the IMDb observers rightly points out: “Perhaps people in 1968, considering monkeys to be a stupid factory pop group set up to bribe the Beatles, refused to see (Head).” <br /> <br /> Monkeys and Head could never completely get rid of this negative public perception. It's a shame because there were a lot of talents in The Monkees, both musical and otherwise. It is probably weird that Rafelson, who runs and co-produces with Schneider, and Jack Nicholson (yes, this is Jack Nicholson), who wrote the script and also co-produced, decided to take "Monkeys" in this unusual direction. It’s as if New Kids on the Block unexpectedly released an album equivalent to Ummagumma Pink Floyd (1969) or Atom Heart Mother (1970). In fact, the head songs written by The Monkees and frequent collaborators, such as Carole King and Harry Nilsson, have a quality similar to Floyd, somewhere between the Syd Barrett era and the post-Barrett era. This is much more noticeable than any similarity to the Beatles. Some people complained about the music in the film, but for me all the songs are gems. However, some people do not like the Floyd era of Barrett (or another), with whom I also find it difficult to empathize. <br /> <br /> But what about _is_ Head? The main point is that the Monkeys travel through various film genres - military scenes, adventure scenes, horror scenes, comedy scenes, dramatic scenes, western scenes, science fiction scenes, romantic scenes, and so on and on. Except that in the reality of the film this happens primarily (if not exclusively) at the studio site. In fact, we are watching Monkeys making a film. Of course, in all scenes of different genres there is something surreal and self-referential, and they, and the individual shots inside the scene, tend to bring each other, using the sleep logic, which is not similar to the Monty Python television show. As a dream, Head tends to fluctuate between a good sleep and a nightmare, often being what makes you laugh in your sleep (by the way, I often do this). <br /> <br /> Technically, Rafelson uses a wide range of methods to implement the above. There are scenes with extensive negative images, there are many very fast episodes (including a magnificent sequence in which Davy Jones and Toni Basil dance alternately in a white and black room, each of which combines a combination of white and black, which sometimes switches back and forth as well quickly, like two frames at a time), there are a lot of fancy segments, there is an animated cows mouth, there are strange editing devices and so on. For my money, I would like this material not to be just a relic of the psychedelic era. This is the kind of artistic approach that I like. Then it seemed like a good idea, and I still think it is a good idea. I would like to watch films such as The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissow (2004) using these types of advanced techniques. Now it would make this film surreal. <br /> <br /> Interpretatively, some people who are not so familiar with the aesthetics of acid travel have complained that it is mostly bs. suggest values ​​for something intended to have no. I disagree with such a pessimistic / nihilistic view; The head had to make a lot of sense, and these are not just films without ordinary plots, which have many interpretations. Nicholson, Rafelson and Schneider have a lot to say about Monkeys: the film postmodernist comments on their production status; pop glory - the path to Pink Floyd, Head combines pop glory and violence, from images of war to images of fans who destroy their idols; and naive US-oriented ideas of international perception and respect - well-armed foreigners in the desert surrender to Miki Dolenza just because he is American, then they blow up coca-cola for him (again in the desert) because he is thirsty and cannot access . The film comments on many other topics - from big industry to the police, polls, audience sympathies (especially in connection with the tragedies) and so on. The head is full of ideas, appropriately enough, with clever, multifaceted things to say about them. <br /> <br /> Head deserves to be considered a classic - this is basically shooting for the same vibration as the Beatles Yellow Submarine. Both premieres took place in November 1968, which is quite interesting, and both were conceived as a summation of psychedelic aesthetics. The yellow submarine was not successful enough. The head is all that the Yellow Submarine was supposed to be.
