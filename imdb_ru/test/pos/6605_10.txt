Dogtown and Z-Boys <br /> <br /> Short Description: Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers who changed the world of surfing and skateboarding in Venice (Dogtown), California, as we know it today. With their low basic style, they set off on a journey under the influence of Larry Bertlemen, which would lead to countless successes and failures of the couple. After the articles on Dogtown were featured in the restored Skateboarder Magazine, the sport was updated and Zephyr skateboard team members forgot about Jeff Ho and decided to stay on summer vacation for the rest of their lives, joining other skateboard teams who could afford to pay im like movie stars. The original Zephyr Skateboard Team, which included Jeff Ho (owner of Zephyr Surfshop) and Craig Stekik (photographer), included Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, Bob Biniac, Chris Cayhill, Shogo Kubo, Paul Constantino, Jim Muir, Peggy Okey (only woman), Nathan Pratt, Wenzl Ruml IV, Allen Sarlo and David Ray Perry. All of the original members, except Jay Adams and Chris Cahill, are still healthy and surfing / skating. Jay Adams, during a documentary, was serving a term on drug related charges. Chris Cahill, during a documentary, was last seen in Mexico. <br /> <br /> Themes: The themes of this documentary are a kind of reading between the lines, but if it were a clear topic it would be that even children can ignite revolutions. Other topics may include extensive parties in the past that may lead to an unsatisfactory future, and there may be a very rewarding future when planning and being careful with your assets. <br /> <br /> Other works: Stacy Peralta (Writer and Director) has a fairly wide range of documentaries, which he either wrote, produced or shot. Most have a common theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as Riding Giants, Sk8 TV, The Brigrades Bones and Lords of Dogtown. He also made films on adulthood in America as a teenager, such films as: “Influence: from yesterday and today”, “Bloody and bloody: made in America” and “70s: the decade that changed television”. <br /> <br /> Subjects: Dogtown and Z-boys are the original members of the Zephyr Skateboard Team, with the exception of Chris Cahill. Peralta included Jeff Ho and Craig Stacic in an interview. Other subjects were people who grew up in the 70s, reading the Dogtown Articles, as well as skateboarding fans. Skaters from Dogtown, but not in the team, were interviewed. <br /> <br /> Editing. In my opinion, the editing of this film was phenomenal. There were scenes of conversations of the subjects, so that the audience could see who was speaking and get an idea of ​​the character, but immediately chose archival footage that would explain what the speaker was saying. When the song could better explain the subjects' emotions, for example, when the unhappy life of Jay Adams was the subject of conversation, Neil Young's Old Man song was played, which evokes a lot of emotions. Sean Penn was the film's narrator, and he explained the transitions throughout the film. The film was presented in chronological order since the creation of the Zephyr surf team, to create a skateboard team, for all Z-guys leaving the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: the film was shot in an interesting way. The film of the storyline was completely black and white, and all archived materials about surfing or skating on Z-Boys were colored. Of course, shots from the 70s were grainy, but this only strengthened the film. The interviewees were shot mostly in the same place where they are, but all were outside. All shots were controlled very well, even archive shots, which I found very amazing. <br /> <br /> Music: "Seasons of Wither" - Aerosmith Performer "Toys in the Attic" - Aerosmith Performer "Landslide Generation" - Alice Cooper "One Out" - Performance by the Allman Brothers "Lollipops and" Roses "and" Whipped Cream "performed by Herb Alpert" Into the Void "and" Paranoid ", performed by Black Saturday" Godzilla "- The cult of the blue oyster" Aladdin Sane "and" Rebel Rebel "- David Bowie" Fastcars "Buzzcocks" Gut Feeling "- Devo" I will give you money "- Peter Frampton" Funk 49 "- James Ganges" Ezy Rider "and" Foxy Lady "and" Freedom "and" Bold as Love "- Jimi Hendrix" Surfing on the Sidewalk "- Yang and Dean "Achilles Last Bi Twa and Hot on Nowhere - Led Zeppelin "Six Underground" - Pimps "Surfrider" - Live "Cat Fever" and "Crazy Mobile Home" and "Van Dang" Sweet Pontang - Ted Nugent "We and They" - Pink Floyd "Bad Boys" - Challengers "Maggie May" - Rod Stewart "I want to be your dog" and "Give me the danger" - Mr. "Children of the Revolution" - T-Rex "Bad Reputation" hetion "- Thin Lizzie" Disco Inferno "- Hannah Tramps - Rob Trower" Rocky Mountain Way "- Joe Walsh" The Old Man "- Neil Young" La Grange "- ZZ Top <br /> <br /> The music in the movie make a movie. Each of these songs contributes to what the subjects say and evokes emotions that would not otherwise evoke minds.
