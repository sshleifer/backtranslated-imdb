Both Disney and Bill Paxton did a great job telling a story based on reality. You don’t have to like the game of golf to appreciate the story of one person’s struggle to overcome chances. It could be based on any sport or simply on any other situation in which the competition is involved, although this is a golf event. The only problem I encountered in this story is that I would like to take a deeper look at each of the main characters, especially. Mr. Uymet. Mr. Francis Uymet is a typical young man of his time, America at the turn of the century, where “class features” are clearly delineated, and woe to those who deserve to try to rise above their “class” position. I did a little historical research, and, to my satisfaction, my biggest question was really answered. Although the circumstances are slightly different from those described in the film, I left with a sense of satisfaction. I really liked this movie, I believe you too.
