Only recently I got into the viewer - a two-hour “abduction” program. Do not know why I do not before ?? James Caan is outstanding and quite plausible as the main honorary spouse in the popular complex of 5 * Vegas. <br /> <br /> Very often in such programs there are one or several groups that either annoy or appear to be chosen because they must be associated with the producer or director. <br /> <br /> This is of course not the case with this program. Along with Kaan, all the main and auxiliary actors are attractive and believable. Guest actors are well matched. <br /> <br /> The stories I saw are interesting, and the show also gives a good view of the city. <br /> <br /> This is an entertainment program, and I hope that it will remain. I do not know how I managed to miss it for so long, but now I am planning a TIVO.
