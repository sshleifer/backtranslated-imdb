Walking Water is a very beautiful film. I would say right under the wonderful short film: “Goat Bell” by Fiona MacKenzie. It is not only about withdrawal, but also about tolerance and acceptance in general. I look forward to seeing more works by Laurel Himmel in the future. Actors Angie Redman and Nina Landy are pretty good. The relationship of the main characters could be slightly strengthened, since we understand that there is a very strong connection between them, but perhaps this could be explained a little. I'm surprised that Angie Redman doesn't often appear in other films. A great first step as a director for Laurel Himmel, I’m sure that much more can be seen from her skills.
