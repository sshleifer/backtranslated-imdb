Naturally, like everyone else, I was anticipating many of the Hollywood fantasy revisionism in “THEY DIED ON ITS OWN SHOES” over the legend of Custer. Just playing Caster as someone like Errol Flynn is enough to understand that legend takes precedence over the truth in this performance. And for the most part, my expectations were met (admittedly, inspiring and entertaining). <br /> <br /> But even in this clearly biased (and very criticizing) retelling of the story about Custer, I was struck by some of the comments made in this film, which sometimes subtly, but nevertheless, firmly seemed to contradict the typical a clear fate and unpunished heroism, usually found in westerns of the early 20th century. <br /> <br /> For example, even when it was in the film an attempt was made to whitewash his character, in some scenes the more flawed and stupid character of the real Custer was still assumed: <br /> <br /> 1) His initial entry into The main gates of West Point, in which his arrogance and pomposity is a clear aspect of his character. <br /> <br /> 2) His pitiful story at West Point, which seems to be due to Custer's lack of information about the requirements of military service, like any other factor; There are times when Flynn plays Custer at West Point, where he looks completely stupid. <br /> <br /> 3) Caster's promotion to the general is not only a ridiculous mistake, but also unfolds as a comedy. I hardly expected to see the Marx or Abbott and Costello brothers roaming the stage. <br /> <br /> 4) Caster's position against Jeb Stewart in Gettysburg is not whitewashed as a brilliant military tactical guide, but it seems reckless and wildly lucky. <br /> <br /> 5) Caster's problem with alcohol, of course, is not ignored. <br /> <br /> And although the music and some ways of showing the Indians in this film certainly reinforce the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the film actually went into some detail as to why the Indians were justified in the attack on the whites, who moved into their country, and quite clearly laid the blame for the battles in the Black Hills right at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the play's clear villain is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy and Co., like the white devils who make false claims for gold in the Black Hills. Of course, this part of the story is true, but I did not expect to see it in such a film completely unequivocally. <br /> <br /> And one more thing: usually in these films it’s Indians who are portrayed in droves as drunk animals seemingly incapable of common sense to avoid intoxication whenever they approach alcohol. In this film, it is the troops of the 7th cavalry, not the Indians, that are depicted in at least two scenes in this way. <br /> <br /> In general, this film slips into some amazing moments in the middle of a Hollywood bunk.
