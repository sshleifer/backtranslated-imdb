You can't help wondering at the early work of Hitchcock. For example, Diversant is so clever and fast that it is hard to believe that he made this film more than 60 years ago. There are some propaganda elements, but they are so well woven into the mystery that this thing plays beautifully years later. You will also get a preview of things that Hitchcock will do later - for example, using a national landmark as a background. This time it is the Statue of Liberty. In North Northwest, of course, this is Mt. Rushmore You will also find out things that pop up later in “Back Window” and “Dizziness” in “Diversant”, but let's not give the show. Robert Cummings is superb, as is such a charming Otto Kruger. Look for Hitchcock's mini-western in this. This happens quickly, so do not blink.
