When I first saw the announcement of this, I said, “Oh, here we are. He finished a high school musical, but he can't handle it, so now he appears on other Disney shows. ” I personally love The Suite Life, and I'm a big fan of Ashley Tisdale. But for some reason, I'm not too keen on Zac Efron, although all my friends think he is the best since Jesse McCartney. But he really annoys me. In any case, I watched the show (with a break for an English course) and was pleasantly surprised. The performances were good from all sides, especially from the ordinary characters of The Suite Life, and Zac Efron was not as bad as I expected. In general, a pretty good show.
