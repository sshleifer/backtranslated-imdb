I, being a fan of Rupert Grint, made this film a few months ago. I thought it was a very well-written film with a group of great actors. It was interesting and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his most famous character, Ron Weasley. His delicate image of Ben and all the other great actors made this film very likable. <br /> <br /> Ben, a very shy boy with an extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for work. He finds it and becomes, I think, you could call the "assistant" Evie, retired actress. First, it's just a way to make some money. But after a while, he and Evie seem to make friends. Evie helps Ben escape a little from his shell and makes him have fun and enjoy himself, and in the end they both seem to need each other. <br /> <br /> Whether you are a fan of Rupert Grint or not, this film is really interesting with some very pretty moments. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors.
