2001: A Space Odyssey <br /> <br /> Is this a sermon? The story of the history of mankind? Exploring the futile attempts of a person to promote technology only so that technology can destroy it? Is it a fragile balance of time and space? Evolution lesson? Or is it just a spectacular show; the film that Kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the movie and present us the truth that the images are extremely powerful than words? <br /> <br /> 2001: A Space Odyssey - all that. One of the most interpretable films ever created is that it is almost more fun to sort and discuss the ambiguous design of the plot and events of the film than it actually is. But he is left open for deliberate discussion; if Kubrick explained the meaning of his amazing classic of 1968 (he took 22nd place in the list of 100 best AFI films, my personal 21st favorite film at the moment) and was nominated for 4 Oscars: director, original script, art Direction and the visual effects for which he won), he would lose half of his charm, all of his complexity and much of his cinematic value. We would only stay with technical ingenuity; which in itself is worth praise. <br /> <br /> Because every shot is worth the time to watch. And a lot of time. 2001 is a very elegant and cold-blooded year; disconnected. Emotional remoteness and slow pace give excellent tribute to a unique visual experience; The year 2001 begins with the ancestors of the monkeys of humanity, who move from the scavengers of the planet to the hunters and creators of tools after discovering a giant monolith in the middle of their home in the desert, and then (in one of the most inspiring movie editing plots) as a bone takes off into the air and becomes a companion, jumping forward a couple of thousand years into space, where astronauts discovered a similar object on the moon, and then a movie after a space traveler's command, following the signal of a monolith in space, accompanied by their unreliable HAL, who is trying to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew, before the lone survivor is finally launched in space and time (in a stream of drug-induced flowers that probably caused hippie epileptic shock in those days) to grow old, die and be reborn "star kid". Like this. <br /> <br /> This rhythmic and emotional emptiness also contrasts sharply with the film’s most ironic scene; destruction of HAL. When the team’s last researcher turns off the car filled with the holy aura of red light, Kubrick always used it as a repetitive motive, HAL sings a beautiful melody, this is a strangely emotional experience. And all this is brilliant. <br /> <br /> Other noteworthy aspects of Kubrick's masterpiece are the memorable voice of HAL (calm, somehow sinister Douglas Rein), minimal use of dialogue (Kubrick wisely trusted his images to promote the film, giving only banal, useless lines to its actors. The most famous of them is “Open the airlock doors under”, the satellites dance in orbit to unorthodox music, and this is the first fearful shot of the earth, slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it, to the sound of exploding triumphant horns. <br /> <br /> 2001 all Let it remain a mystery and forever become a testament to the strongest moment in the movie: visual effects are stronger than the writing, all from one of the most legendary and best filmmakers in the history of the movie, whose unique vision has always been his own. 10/10 <10 > <br /> “Open the door to the capsule compartment HAL” -2001: Space Odyssey
