I liked Erkan & Stefan ?? cool and fast story that is not bogged down in details. These two guys are great looking and able to push new ideas all the time. High image quality and cropping support film. <br /> <br /> Erkan & Stefan show that the German film industry is capable of transmitting successful Hollywood concepts with local “satire” in our theaters.
