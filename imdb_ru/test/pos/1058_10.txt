I've always loved old movies, but this is one of my top ten favorites ... it has all the charm, the 1940's quirkiness and the good old-fashioned romance, and it's fun loading! Barbara Stenvik plays an independent unmarried woman who writes articles about preparing \ family life for a famous magazine ... provided she is a married housewife. Even the president of the magazine is under this delusion. Enter the beautiful GI, (played by the talented Dennis Morgan), just saved from a raft along with his friend. His simple desire is to stay in a home hotel, which she so eloquently writes about, and relax with her famous homemade dishes. Now she needs to desperately find a way to save her job and reputation ... add to this that her fiance is in a hurry to tie the knot, it does not help. Humor is great, and the chemistry between the leading characters is very funny. Throwing a character actor nicknamed "Hugging" (which fits under this name completely) becomes even more charming. It has become my must-see film, in which I cling to a cup of cocoa every Christmas season. A lovely, enjoyable movie to enjoy for Christmas or anytime!
