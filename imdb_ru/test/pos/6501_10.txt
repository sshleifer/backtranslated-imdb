Just watched this movie at resfest and was confused. I have never been a big fan of scratching, but this movie got me hooked by getgo. it is listed as a documentary, but never really felt like that. (I don’t remember when I last had so much fun watching a documentary). it has a style and energy that is refreshing, perceptive, and never too preaching. production values ​​were there too. (filmed with cool cutters and amazing soundtrack). generally smart, interesting and instructive piece.
