This is not a smart, witty and often touching movie. This is a retrospective of the unfortunate relationship between Michael Connor (Michael Laydon Campbell) and his estranged Irish girlfriend Grace McKenna. Michael, lucky, decided to make a documentary about his relationship and what went wrong. He uses his friendship with the actor he met at the gym Nadia (Dajani), whom he plays in Grace. The concept of this film is very original. Michaels relationships are shown from every point, be it high or low. Michael Laydon Campbell shoots a fantastic performance, because of which you want to help him find Grace. In fact, most characters shoot great performances, besides the puzzle. The riddle is needed to advance the plot, but it seems too surreal to exist in a cafe. His monologues are often redundant and meaningless. This is proved when he says: “Out of this chaos, we are all trying to create order. And out of order is the value. But in reality there is no such thing as meaning. Something matters only if we attach importance to it. “<br /> <br /> The commentary saves this film. The commentary was made in vain because of“ This is Spinal Tap, ”and Michael and his brother explain the problems they faced when making the film. Michael offers a very funny shy commentary, which is a very good animal laugh. <br /> <br /> In general, I would give this movie 7/10.
