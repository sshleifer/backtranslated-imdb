“Chest” is one of those films that are so perfect that you really struggle to find something that you don’t like about them. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a dresser of the legendary Donald Wolfit), he sparkles with energy and true love for life behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> Like “sir”, the overbearing actor and the main focus of playing, Albert Finney is a joy to watch - be it a complaint about the absence of a storm during the “blow, wind ...” a bit of “King Lear” or a conversation with by his devoted director Madge (Eileen Atkins, is better than ever) about old times. Like Norman, his dresser, Tom Courtney, plays amazingly, staggering over the Beck and the call of Lear, picking up a bottle to go to the pub, or sharply insulting the former Fool, Mr. Davenport-Scott (often mentioned but never seen!). <br /> <br /> In the attractive cast there is Edward Fox as Oxenby (typical arrogant second hero), Xena Walker as her lordship, Lockwood West as a fool and many others. <br /> <br /> This film has tremendous energy, although it carries with it a part of the makeup of its stage origin, this is true, but, being so well-functioning, you don’t notice it. Very well done actually.
