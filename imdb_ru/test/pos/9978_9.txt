If you like your sports films about dignity and best values, this will work for you. Supersensual places? Of course, of course - and proud of it. This is the biggest and best trip to the carnival, and you need to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Large production figures, simplicity of the story, creative shots: it’s not difficult, it’s a very good and surprisingly pleasant movie. It really looks like the love work of Bill Paxton; and I bet his son understands this. <br /> <br /> The build-up is slow enough to counter conflicts, and the British against the Americans are coping with the degree of meanness of the cobweb, but with dignity between the two main transatlantic heroes are always in the foreground. I have a little difficulty: the bill wants to be James Horner, but he is too bloated, and there are too many close-ups and pan pictures for 2005, but if you want a simple, decent and beautiful sports film, then this is it. <br /> <br /> So that's the thing, and I feel that I know my film, but in fact I liked it more than Seabiscuit: this is the best film, but the Greatest Story is just Disney in its essence and extremely enjoyable! Thank you, Bill.
