I am the next generation of people ... I have never seen the original doctor, who, but I heard about the series, which caused great fans in the past and still makes its mark in the 21st century; The new Doctor Who appeared in 2005, but for those who live here, in states like me, we largely view it as new episodes on the science fiction channel or BBC America; In the first season, we meet a new player Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and a pretty cool new doctor played by Christopher Exxelson (sorry, last name with an error). these two perform many amazing and extremely extremely dangerous missions to save the world ... from time to time they have companions from ex-boyfriend Rose Mickey to now existing Jack Harkness (who can now be seen on the back) Torchwood. ") Season's pace is almost correct ... stories can be from strangely strange to the most action-driven, but in any case, this is one roller skating trip from the very beginning of a thematic song that is very memorable. <br /> In the second season, it becomes to others and changing, and those A new doctor (David Tennant) continues to struggle to save the world with the help of a rose, and from this moment there may be some who say that part of the season was not as good, but I have to disagree, and it was sad to see Rose and Dr. parted, but it leaves the introductory role of “partner” Martha (played by the very sexy Frima Agiman), which helps to continue the struggle to save humanity ... the third season is now more at the level of action / adventure and sometimes emotional, but not so much like the first two se zone; here the relationship between the doctor and Martha is suitable, but attractiveness MAY sometimes attack, and it is obvious that she has NOT grown, Tyler, because you have experienced her company in the first two seasons, and not in the third season, it can be a little awkward , it was for me, because you got used to Rose and her ways, and now you see someone who sometimes doesn’t actually ask the doctor questions on an emotional level, but at the same time makes the tempo very exciting for the audience, who keeps you edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one exciting trip on a TV show, I would give more, but there are also disadvantages to this show, which I cannot mention, because it is sometimes difficult to pick up, but only one, who is a doctor, and Martha's relationship is hasty and not aligned on meeting you; I have seen good shows on British television, but this is one of the coolest sci-fi adventures for the old and the new generation, but you don’t need to take my world for it ... step into the Tardis and join the adventure
