Satya was excellent .... The company was equally good, but more polished, probably due to the money earned in previous films. Ab Tak Chappan, however, is even more interesting. The dialogue is sandy, rough and sometimes cheerful. Nana Pataker again shines in a role that only he can play with power, but the cast is very talented. The direction is tough, and the story develops at a satisfactory pace with a very dramatic climax. As an image of reality, this may be too dramatized, but in the end it’s a film, so the balance is in place. I ordered my DVD and can't wait to see it at home. As a lover of this type of gangster films, it’s very nice and highly recommended to fans of the Bollywood gangster movie “Not Yash Raj”
