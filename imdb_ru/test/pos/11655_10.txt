Susan Sarandon, for lack of a better word, is incredible. In my opinion (and yes, I understand that not everyone will agree with me here), she is one of the greatest actresses EVER and should have at least 2 Oscars in her asset. I mean, it was an AWESOME show at Lorenzo's Oil (but I think her every performance was amazing), and they gave it to Emma Thompson ... what was that ??? And by the time she got this Oscar, she worked in this industry for about 25 years. I could not think of anyone who would deserve it more, especially for a job as brilliant as her image of Sister Helen Prezhin. But then again, she is beyond Hollywood’s all artificiality and she doesn’t need an Oscar - people still know that she’s good. <br /> <br /> This film carries very deep, provocative thoughts, so unnecessary to say that this should not be taken lightly. Tim Robbins, of course, cannot avoid a loan here. You might think that because of his personal feelings against the death penalty, the images made in this film will not be accurate. However, equal attention is paid to both sides of the death penalty debate. On the one hand, you see Matthew's interesting side, the human side, which makes the evidence of his death quite heartbreaking. At the same time, you see how he destroyed his victims and the constant torment for understandable reasons of grieving parents. One word for Tim is BRAVO. <br /> <br /> A brilliant film and, as I said, a well-deserved and long-awaited Oscar for Susan.
