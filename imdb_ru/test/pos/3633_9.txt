A few years ago I read the book Makina. When I reread this little book over and over again, I canâ€™t stop wondering at the writer's imagination and the wealth of Brazilian culture. <br /> <br /> When I found out about the film, I was really afraid that someone would spoil one of my favorite books! Well, fortunately, my fears were unjustified, and the film is such a wonderful and delicate work of art. <br /> <br /> I can not remember any other film that could cause tears in my eyes because of the very beauty of the text. Also, I can not remember such a powerful performance, like Gustavo Falcao. <br /> <br /> You can see and feel how colossal his love for Karina is. You can understand that he will move mountains and do something for this love. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, see it through the eyes of a child who lives inside you, fascinate yourself!
