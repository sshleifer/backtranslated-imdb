I thought I was spending my precious 50 bucks to watch this movie. But at the sincere request of my friend, who is an ardent fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to turn to the film. Walking into this cheap theater really bothered me, because I saw King Kong for $ 50 in one of the best theaters in the city. In any case, the film begins, and surprisingly I did not complain. <br /> <br /> Great story and really great game with Shabana Azmi and Conconoy Saint Sharma. Shabana Azmi, divorced, dedicated her life to the well-being of her mother and half-sister. Concon Saint Sharma is a schizophrenic (save me from spelling) who constantly imagines. Rahul Bose also gives a stellar presentation. <br /> <br /> The story is that Mitye (Saint Sharma) is a schizophrenic, and after she was brutally raped at field work as a reporter, her level really rose, her bride left her for who she was has become. In all her world falls upon her. Shabana Azmi, her older half-sister, takes care of her, and Mitya thinks in her mind that she is married to her fiancee, she has 5 children, and they stay on 15th Park Avenue (which is really a place in New York ). The plot continues when Mitya becomes suicidal, as she believes that no one believes her and her husband is captured in her home. By the will of fate, Mitya and her bride meet when they both embark on a journey. 11 years after the brutal rape, her bride does not exist in her real world, she cannot recognize him. Her bride, now married and the father of two children, considers it his duty to correct the mistake he made 11 years ago, and he promises to take her to Park Avenue. and he does. He took her to Calcutta, which supposedly looks like her husband's house. Like Joydip / Jojo (Rahul Bose), her bride is talking on a cell phone, he is losing touch with Mitya. Everyone is looking for her, but she is nowhere to be found. Finally, she gets what she was denied, her family, her own creative family in her own world on 15th Park Avenue. <br /> <br /> I have to say that it touched my heart. I myself am now a fan of the direction of Aparna Sen. The camera work is great. And the quality of performance limits. Concon Saint Sharma gives solid work as a schizophrenic. Shabana Azmi plays another terrific role as a divorced older sister who is responsible for supporting her family. Rahul Bose, another neat and quiet role (I donâ€™t know why this guy has big breaks, he has so much potential). Finally, Aparna Sen, she still fascinates the public, even if she is not in front of the camera, but behind it. <br /> <br /> Very deserved 8/10 ....
