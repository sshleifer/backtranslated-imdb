I saw this series in 1999 on London television and was amazed. As commented by another user - this is what I would like to see when I first watched “Jurassic Park” - The life and death of dinosaurs in their natural habitat in the form of a documentary. CG is very realistic, and the variety of dinosaurs and habitats shown makes it also very educational. <br /> <br /> The series describes everything that was really known about dinosaurs, and gives a lot of good ideas about "what it could be." “Compose what then looks like a documentary series. What I missed is a small histogram that resides in one corner of the screen, moving between “fiction” and “fact” along with narration and pictures, because you often wonder how much it costs to guess, and how much is pure fantasy. <br /> <br /> To understand some facts and fiction, you should see the 50-minute “Creation from”, which is not only very informative about the process of computer graphics and collects and incorporates the knowledge of paleontologists in the series, but it is also very funny (Dinosaurs smoke cigarettes and complain about computer graphics animators.) <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this series before going to the upcoming film about Disney dinosaurs or watch a movie about Jurassic Park again (for example). This will certainly make you much more critical towards these films. Disney trailers looked particularly bad.
