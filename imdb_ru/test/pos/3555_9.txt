After reviewing 3 of the 4 sitcoms of Perry and Croft, I thought that I would do everything now. "Army Dad", my favorite comedy series of all time. This is not a half-hot mom, but a classic, just like you, Rang M'Lord. I don't think Hi De Hi is classic, but still funny. <br /> <br /> This is a camp similar to Butlins, but instead of red it’s yellow. She is ruled by Jeffrey Fairbrother, a good-natured man, but he has the character of a sock. The staff includes fun entertainment manager Ted, his assistant Spike (he ended up throwing him into the pool in almost every episode), Gladys yellow coat, Peggy's careless maid, who was eager to be a yellow coat and Punch and Judy Mr. Partridge, who hates kids. The situations occurred mainly around the pool, where in every episode someone was thrown (of course, in clothes). <br /> <br /> Not a classic, but still funny. Jeffrey Fairbrother went halfway through, so this, a bit like “Only Fools and Horses,” exceeded all expectations. In fact, Jimmy Perry was wearing a red raincoat in Butlins. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Peggy's Big Chance, episode 2, episode 2.
