It was a truly epic production, in which there were all the elements that I would like to see in a fantasy film. Costume, music, cinematography - all the artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and gave a rich experience. <br /> <br /> Ted Danson, best known for his roles on television in the films Greetings and Becker. was excellent in the role of Gulliver. Mary Steenburgen (Time After Time, Cross Creek) played equally well her limited role as her wife. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed other performances: James Fox as Dr. Bates, Alfre Woodard as Queen Broddingnag and Peter O'Toole as Emperor of the Lilliputians. <br /> <br /> This would be a pleasant children's film, but it will also definitely appeal to adults for its deep social commentary.
