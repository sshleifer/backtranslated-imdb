Absolutely one of the 10 best music films ever! Absolutely necessary educational experience for any music fan - especially for young rock / punk fans today ... to understand how any particular "artistic" movement begins, it is absolutely necessary to understand the roots of music, as well as the thinking and musical environment of the times .... not to mention the political and social factors involved at the time. And besides all this, this documentary is just rock and roll F U N !! Do not miss it !!! However, can anyone tell me when, if ever, the "decline of Western civilization" ... part 1 (not part 2, metal version) will be available again ... hopefully on DVD?
