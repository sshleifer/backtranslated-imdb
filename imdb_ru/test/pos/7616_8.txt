I can't say that I take it as a romantic comedy, since I found a little bit funny about it. I found him sweet, interesting, warming and always sweet, and although there were some witty moments, I found them more bitter than comedic. <br /> <br /> I liked this one. Barrymore grew up as an actress, and it's always great to catch her on the big screen, but it also has a good effect on the small screen. In fact, when I watch this movie later, I like it more and more. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the romantic comedy, then you may not like the comedy effect with this movie. but if you love this novel, you will definitely find it. <br /> <br /> He estimates 7.8 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
