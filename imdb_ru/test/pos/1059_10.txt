Barbara Stanwick admires this wartime comedy about a sailor who was invited to spend Christmas with the family of a popular journalist on her farm in Connecticut. The problem is that she has no husband, child or farm, which she writes about in her column, and she cannot even cook; her wonderful recipes were provided to her by her good friend "uncle" Felix, the owner of a Hungarian restaurant in New York. <br /> <br /> The situation becomes even more difficult when its strict head of the publishing house invites himself for Christmas. The scheme is hastily planned: her sultry bridegroom provides a real Connecticut farm, the neighbors are a borrowed child, and a quick wedding is planned when the publisher is not looking. But when a handsome young sailor arrives on Christmas Eve, romantic complications arise as the supposedly married author falls like a ton of bricks on a good guy, a naval guy, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> This is a charming, warm film that deftly balances humor with feelings and is an excellent showcase for Barbara Stanwick to show her considerable comedic talent, helped by such wonderful character actors as Sydney Greenstreet, Una O'Connor, SZSakall and many others. The Christmas night dance at the Town Hall is a delight, and the unexpectedly sweet and feminine side of Stanvik is a wonderful surprise for viewers who saw her mostly as tough, bitchy women in the fatal roles of a woman. A truly wonderful film that stood the test of time.
