Anna Christie (1930) <br /> <br /> Anna Christie has stunning roles and stunning performances, and yet it should be even better than it actually is. This is a drama. Some scenes are really atmospheric, and if the internal shots around the table are boring, other shots at night and at sea are really quite exciting. Then there are almost historical, vibrant scenes on Coney Island (even a short, nervous ride on a roller coaster) and an episode where two women sit behind the net on separate beds, and visitors halfway can throw balls trying to knock them over. and the women (in poorly dressed) male eggs look weirdly sexy. Garbo (in front of the crowd) looks all the time. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garbo makes this film not just another good early chatter. She plays all sides of her character. She is shy, skeptical and in some inner torment. She laughs and cries, leaves and pushes out. In a sense, this is a great future-oriented film (directed by Clarence Brown, who has a whole series of significant films from this era of pre-coding sounds). <br /> <br /> Although based on the successful Eugene O'Neill play, this is a scenario that fights a little, as the actors seem to be passing by from time to time. Marie Dressler is gorgeous in this exaggerated way she almost traded. And there is also Greta Garbo, who does have a natural presence, even if it seems that she replays only a little, from time to time (but then, like everyone else). Garbo, of course, is first known as the silent actress, and this is her film debut. The audience loved her so much that she made the German version the following year.
