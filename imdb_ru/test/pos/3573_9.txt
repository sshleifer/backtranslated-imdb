I actually went to watch this movie with low expectations, as it was the only one that matched my schedule. And surprisingly, I found it really original. I have already commented on other Colombian films and agree that there is usually a similar scheme in Colombian films, and I always try to refer to ordinary vulgar people, especially trying to make jokes because of the constant curse. But let's face it, the language used in this film is not particularly exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is what real people say. The storyline and tempo are brilliant, and it can be extrapolated to any country in the world. The game was great, and the script for me is one of the best ever created in Colombian land. I think that anyone around the world can get an hour and a half of entertainment with a beautiful, well-directed bluff comedy with black humor. It reminded me of movies like snatch and the like. I highly recommend it and hope that it can be viewed by a large number of people, since Colombian films seem to have become more internationally oriented since last year.
