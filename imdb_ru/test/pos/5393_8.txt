Returning to the “old-fashioned” westerns of the 30s and 40s (such as DODGE CITY), DALLAS offers several things: Gary Cooper in his coolest and brightest technicolor photo of Ernest Haller (Max scale Steiner (KING-KONG, GWTW, DODGE CITY, etc.). In addition, there is a masquerade, an erroneous person, a falsified death, and more shoots than the Republican series. As always, Cooper defines what it means to be a man under pressure. Forget the western 50s ... it's pure entertainment!
