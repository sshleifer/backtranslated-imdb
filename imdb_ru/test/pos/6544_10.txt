For those of you who saw this photo on VHS, I would recommend a DVD. Actually, VHS is complete nonsense. The main reason is that the film was shot in widescreen (2.55: 1), and the producers ran out of money to create a version of VHS, and it was released in 4: 3 format. As a result, several actors do not appear on the screen , and in many strolling races, less than half of the cars are shown, as one on each side of the screen. The DVD is actually a reasonable version of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many of the best scenes of the film were shot before the final release. They were considered too offensive for minority groups. In fact, the prospect of release in the US caused an even shorter film. For example, Americans generally do not understand words like Petrol & Strides. <br /> <br /> Mike's dad and mom were supposed to be hippies. Dad survives in the film as a wasted smoking dope guitar player. But the next scene with my mother was cut. The scene took place on the roof of the house, which was lined with aluminum foil, incandescent lamps and planted with plants ... You see the picture. Manufacturers collected a lot of real plants for the foreground, and when they saw the result on a large sheet, they got scared and the scene was cut. Underpants! <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is marked as a cult Australian classic. Took second place in the Street Cars category for the top 100 films of all time, almost Mad Max Ll. The latter had more than 10 times the ROE budget. In fact, the ROE budget was so small that the director could not afford to break any of the cars ... even if someone destroyed a real HO, there would be a public protest. (Compare this to Smoky and Bandit or Blues Bros, where dozens of cars were broken.) <br /> <br /> So, there is one real GTHO and two fakes. One of the fakes was bought from the local indigenous population in Kobar after a backup GTHO crashed into the back of a Country Boy truck. (It was unrecorded! The car had to break free from the side of the truck.) Since the budget was so narrow, the car was made from a regular brown masking tape instead of a gold-colored real thing. br /> <br /> 55 chev are absolutely real. The car began as a very simple 4-door and was brilliantly and quickly transformed into the blown 55th in the film. The motor was pickled 545, which made about 1,000 hp. This has been reduced to 600 for filming. The car could easily accelerate to 170 miles per hour, as shown in several scenes of the film. <br /> <br /> For reference: anyone who has $ 12,000 could pick up ALL cars after the film. XO, Dodge, 53, Utah, Rammer 53 Chev ... a lot. I wonder where they are now? <br /> <br /> SW
