Perhaps many viewers, disappointed with this film, live their lives without even thinking about life itself. Here I want to note that “distant” is not only a feature film, but also one of the best feature films. Of all the movies I've seen, “distant” is one that really stands out as a sparkling piece of gold. It is even fair to say that the cinematography of this film and the image of human emotions are superior to Tarkovsky’s nostalgia. One commentator correctly understood that sex, exhausted, a common feature of foreign films, surprisingly lacks “distant” and good ways. What is most remarkable in the “distant” is that it reflects the details of life that we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence, which often plunges into the noise and visual extravaganza of our commercial world. Fortunately, the "distant" not so many people who could save, and what we see on the screen - a naked portrait of people.
