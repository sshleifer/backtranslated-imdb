Yes, maybe there are some parts of this film that require some suspension of faith, but this does not remove anything from the charm and surprise of the film. It was shown as part of the youth film festival of our city and was a favorite of the organizing committee. What is not surprising. The subject is unification in a torn race, although post-apartheid South Africa is very relevant and the interpretation of the topic is inspiring. Of course, as mentioned in the previous commentary, the film has its flaws, but the realism and the way the director treats his subject refute these flaws. I saw this with my wife, and we returned that evening with the children. A film to watch, meditate, discuss and act.
