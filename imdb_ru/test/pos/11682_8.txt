Let's start by first saying that I was a punk fan for most of my life. I always lacked respect for the Los Angeles scene of the early 80s, which, unlike X and Black Flag, in The Decline of Western Civilization, was more likely New York and English punk. After I saw this movie, it completely changed. The people presented may look like a group of idiotic, agitated children who think they can achieve something more than street Cree in their lifestyle, but this is the best manifestation of hedonism at best, combined with funny, loud rock and roll. One of the best scenes, and in fact the most insightful, is an interview with Claude Bessie from Catholic Discipline or Kick-Boy, as the readers of Slash magazine knew. Hailing from France, he wanders around punk, like an old dirty Frenchman, and introduces the audience to many aspects of punk or homemade, attitudes towards music, politics and life in general. Darby Crash of the Germs is considered to be a complete idiot most of the time, but Germs’s performance in Manimal is pretty decent, complete with young Pat Smyr. Black Flag's performance with vocalist Chavo Pederast (it was shot a couple of years before Henry Rollins joined the group) is worthy, and X and FEAR give the best performances in the film. Look for interviews with young punk kids. You will hear some of the funniest things you’ve ever heard in a documentary. Highly recommended.
