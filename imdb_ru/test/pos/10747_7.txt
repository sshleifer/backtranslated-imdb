Project A II is a classic Jackie Chan movie with all kung fu, crazy stunts and humor. Not as good as a prequel, but nevertheless, it's a great movie if you just want to watch something interesting. The story is simple, Jackie Chan is against evil people. So if you want a movie that you do not need to understand, I would suggest this one.
