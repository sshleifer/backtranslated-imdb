First, I must say that I do not speak Spanish and, as a rule, I donâ€™t like Spanish-speaking films ... BUT Two Coyotes are an exceptional film. There is enough action and tough drama, and it does not matter that this is a Spanish-language film. The subtitles were easy to read and did not block the action - OR the drama! <br /> <br /> I would say fans of Spanish-language films and non-fans of Spanish-language films go to see this movie. The action and drama are worth every penny. <br /> <br />
