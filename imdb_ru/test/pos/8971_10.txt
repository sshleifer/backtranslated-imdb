Charlie Wilson's War is a great example of how films should be made. This film is of the highest quality and perfectly filmed. Tom Hanks takes the lead and delivers exceptional performance. In addition, Tom Hanks is complemented by the unprecedented acting ability of the incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman. I have never seen him in a role that suits him so much. <br /> <br /> The film is witty, clever and well written. Julia Roberts also plays a major role in this film, but she is easily eclipsed by the other two hosts. <br /> <br /> I rated this film 10/10 and would gladly recommend this film to anyone interested in high-quality cinema.
