Renoir's story about Paris, Kankan, girl puck and Moulin Rouge. More muffled, but very interesting version of the opening of the Moulin Rouge. Jean Gabin demonstrates its excellent characteristics. The photograph of Technicolor in the print that I saw was exquisite. Easy evening viewing. Chris V Galla
