Despite some truly scenic spots in the east and the sporadically energetic music of Franco Mikalizzi, this film does not quite reach the level of such effort by Joe D'Amato, while remaining equally dirty. The author of the original book "Emmanuel: The Joys of a Woman", Emmanuel Arsan, was also a director in this film, which mostly pornographically demonstrates very young Annie Belle, as she gets in various strange sexual situations. Her boyfriend, played by Al Kliver of ZOMBIE, actually endorses her sleep and even convinces her to continue the practice even after they get married! Orso Maria Gerrini enters as a professor who is usually married to two women at the same time, one of whom is played by Arsan herself. Despite the fact that everything began promisingly and with several cheerful lines of dialogue, like "do you see me with the naked eye?" ... "I can see you better naked!", The film is meaninglessly roaming the plot down to a less impressive finale. Just like Emanuel and Last Cannibals by D'Amato, all the main characters are in search of some lost tribe, but don’t hope so, there’s no violence in this film, and no special sex either. Just a lot of nudity and silly dialogue. I could not help but find some appreciation for this little film, if only for the entire logic of the Cornball the film passes.
