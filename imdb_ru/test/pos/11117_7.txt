This film and its subsequent television series have become a landmark substitute for what is good in America. <br /> <br /> Glory is famous for its music and performances. There are several prominent personalities, including Irene Cara, Paul McCray, Ann Meara * and the gorgeous Gene Anthony Ray. The latter, who plays a dancer without any academic or other "street" powers, is an amazing person, and he should look at what, in fact, portrays him. A wonder to contemplate how one king could say. <br /> <br /> The plot has an interesting format - sometimes chronological, sometimes genre, in some cases, a person ... but in fact everything ends in some confusion. <br /> <br /> Parker succeeds in pushing this film into periodic overload - with extremely sharp, and sometimes beautiful and frank marching music, which follows the step by step. <br /> <br /> The culmination of the film is a culmination for all times. And this full climate composition of many talented musicians, dancers and musicians, fortunately, is repeated in the credits. This is one set of credits worth exploring ... achievement for centuries. Christopher Gora's music is a gift to contemplate.
