I have to admit that I did not bother to see this film in the theater. This cute little film was released at the beginning of the summer season of blockbusters, but it could not help getting lost in the shadow of multi-million films with special effects, could it? <br /> <br /> "Come back to me" has a beautiful and simple history at its core, and it is extremely well directed and written by Bonnie Hunt (who was in many of the main films as an actress herself ... along with this one! ) A charming story perfectly woven with a clever comedy and brought to life by great performances of veterans, as well as young actors. <br /> <br /> For those who say that David Duchovny didn’t really know how to challenge his mold "Fox Mulder" I agree. I saw his other works in the cinema, and surely this is the best that he he could do for himself. Minnie Driver is just beautiful, charming, funny and alive in his role as Grace. <br /> <br /> However, besides these two leashes, you are surrounded by a close-knit family and friends of Grace. Jim Belushi is an absolute stitch, Bonny Hunt is stable and real strength, but I can't help but mention the talents of Robert Loggia and the deceased Carroll O'Connor. Ironically, I watched this movie again on DVD only one day before his death. It was his last film, and he gave an idea that an actor of his level could proudly leave as the finale of a great career. <br /> <br /> In general, “Returning to Me” turned over what could have been just a funny love story so far and turned into a movie that has become one of my favorites! Do not rush to rent this ..... it's worth the effort!
