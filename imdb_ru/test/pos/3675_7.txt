This is one of the strangest films I've seen in a long time. Usually, if they are so strange, I help out early and rarely regret it. Fortunately, I held on to it. Although I cannot say that this is a great film (it is not), I can say that watching it is like a good acid trip - just a few really horrible moments, and the rest is filled with “did I really just see one?” surprise. Lots of laugh out loud. Excellent cast with Meredith Eaton, outstanding in the role of a dwarf daughters-in-law with an attitude. Keep an open mind.
