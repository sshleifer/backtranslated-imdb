I tend to get angry when I find out about Lucio Fulciâ€™s reputation as a director. Too often, he is classified as a non-talented director, only to shock and disgust a whole audience with images of pure blood. True, his films contain more blatant filth and illness, like ordinary mainstream American production, but his films are always well represented, and the stories are terribly painful. Do not try to duck - this is another story! This film is a real gem of the Italian shock movie! I easily dare to call this film a masterpiece - this is old-fashioned hyallo, which includes all the brilliant aspects of real horror. The film shows the search for an inhuman serial killer in a small Italian mountain town. The bodies of three young men found terribly mutilated. There are quite a few pseudo-madmen in the city, but each trail leads to nowhere. Among the suspects - a greedy ass and a terrible woman who is obsessed with witchcraft and voodoo. As a real mastermind, Fulci knows how to find the right creepy tone for his film. He portrays a small city as a claustrophobic and inevitable setting of terrible events, supported by a frivolous soundtrack. Fulci also develops as a genius narrator. The script is always one step ahead of you, and a complex plot will mislead you more than once. In other words, this is a unique giallo (murder mystery slash of horror). The mountain does not seem as grotesque and overt as in the later stages of Lucio (among them the legendary Zombie 2, The Beyond and the New York Ripper), although there are still some sickening and hard-to-watch shock sequences shown, <br /> > Do not torture the duckling - this is the most convincing and effective achievement ever made by Lucio Fulci, and it is easily among the greatest Italian horror films ever created. Right next to the masterpieces created by Mario Bava and Dario Argento. The film is exciting from start to finish, some aspects of the plot are frighteningly realistic, and the tension is constantly increasing with adrenaline! Be sure to look for horror lovers and absolute priority for Italian shock lovers!
