This multi-level thriller did not give me rest. It is alarming and informative to see how perverse human behavior can be. It is also instructive what past wounds can motivate real behavior. Nobody except Sandra Bullock's partner is very cute. However, everything is plausible. Sandra did an excellent job. Her character, Cassie, comes to life with all her pain, fear and protection. She survived, and her life experience finally brings her to a healing moment. I really liked this movie. Tom landers
