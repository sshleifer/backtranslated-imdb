Of course, there are things that Coens and Elmore Leonard did before, but so what? If you want to have fun, are depraved and smart - "Judas Kiss" is almost perfect As for the British, making the convolutions, I strongly doubt it. This film is clearly a labor of love, and the budget is probably not half the salary of Mr. Tarantino. Maybe guys don't like it as much as women. I thought it was swinging. Go Coco!
