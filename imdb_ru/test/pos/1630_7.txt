I was at the premiere of the movie last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, however there are many changes from book to film. The tempo of this film is much faster than the Davinchi code. Many things were cut, otherwise it would be a 4-hour film. Many things have also been changed to give the film a quick pace. I think the feeling of the film is important, and it works well for Hanks, Brown and company. <br /> <br /> In the book there are some things that look very implausible in the form of a film. I do not give any spoilers, except that the end of the film is viewed a little differently. The way Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who watch the film may be interested in reading the book in order to get full information about the story. Some minor details are also cut from the film. <br /> <br /> Although they were filmed in Rome, they had to recreate the internal shots. Since I went on a walking tour of Rome the day before the film, I can say that the interiors are authentic in appearance. Kohler is not in the film, and little is shown about CERN. Hanks does a good job, and there are some interesting scenes involving the Vatican archives. Of course, they did not have access to this area, and Iâ€™m not sure that anyone really knows what the Vatican archives look like. Eyelet Zurer has a break in this film as Victoria Winds, and he does an excellent job with Hanks. <br /> <br /> This film is better perceived by critics and the public, but you will never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in an interview and, as we saw him and the actors before the film, that it was just a film.
