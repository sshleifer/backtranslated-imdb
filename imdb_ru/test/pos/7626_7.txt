I was 9 years old when I first saw it on TV. Friday night. I remember the full page of advertising in the TV guide with the image of Rex. It's amazing how some things are remembered after 30 years. In any case, if you are a child who likes monster movies, this movie is quite interesting, especially if riot and Keats are rampant with each other. The special effects are not Harryhausen, but it costs an hour and a half if you find it somewhere on TV late in the evening. Not seen him for several years for some reason, this classic has disappeared from cable television. If you catch him late at night, do not be too critical, just have a snack and enjoy it. It may be silly, but I thought it was much better than a remake that was released in theaters a year ago.
