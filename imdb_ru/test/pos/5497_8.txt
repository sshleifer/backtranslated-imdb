Clint Eastwood has achieved great success in this thriller since 1993. Eastwood, teaming up with Wolfgang Peterson, the absolute master of extreme mood, is doing everything possible. In addition, John Malkovich is on my list of the most effective villains in cinema history. like a crazy killer. Regarding René Rousseau as Clint’s love interest, I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said, referring to his own career: “I keep getting older, and my leading ladies keep getting younger. This film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises for you to continue. Eastwood and Peterson should come together more often. Top quality movie.
