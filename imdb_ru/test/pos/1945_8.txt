River's Edge is an extremely disturbing film written by famous American screenwriter Neil Jimenez. It is based on a real event that happened at a time when most American teenagers tried to make sense of their lives. This is one of the most outstanding films made by American director Tim Hunter. Much of the film’s focus is on the reckless murder committed by a helpless teenager. This sad event sets in motion a whole series of questions about the real motivation of young people in American society. Those who saw this film during its first release must have had vivid memories of the great actor Dennis Hopper in the confusing role of sympathizing with a social outcast. The star of the Matrix Keanu Reeves also looks good, like one of the teenagers, before he reached star status. At a time when teen films are being made without any serious preparation, there is hope that the “River of the Region” cannot be simply ignored, just like just another stupid teenager. the life of a resident of a sleepy city was like the absence of birth. For today's generation with their ill-advised overdoses of Internet props such as Facebook, Twitter and Orkut, the Edge River may seem outdated, but its importance cannot be denied by any serious film fan.
