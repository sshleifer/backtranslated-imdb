Well, as you can see, I got to this party rather late, but I have the advantage of reading all the previous entries before making my comments. I found this site by accident when I was looking for other Marine films. So let me start by saying that I played in the film “Sea shoes”, Pvt. Labarsky, and was stationed in MCRDep, San Diego at the time. Jack Webb and his team selected 15 full-time employees, of which some of us had speaking units, and another 15 marines who had just completed training camp. This constituted Platoon and Marines, who portrayed various "DIs". As I recall, the captain and Pvt. Owens (Don Dubbins) was not in the marines. We spent about three weeks in Hollywood (Studio City Film Lot), California, filming a part of the film we were associated with, and then they finished the other shots after we left. <br /> <br /> So, I take a stroll here, let me explain some of what has been called into question in previous articles, as far as I can. “Cuff Daddy” commented on the ability of our platoon to shout “Yes, sir”, without moving, etc. Yes, we shouted for “Sonic Guys”, and this was during the filming of the scene. Like you comrades marines, remember when DI or the one who ever started asking a question, and before they finished it, you sighed with air, letting you scream at the top of your lungs for the right answer. This is how it was done. <br /> <br /> 74Sooner commented on a walk through the same building on the island of Paris, however, as I mentioned earlier, all the scenes were filmed in Studio City, CA. They were built on the basis of photographs taken on the island of Paris, as well as on the ground and from maritime advisers from the island of Paris. Sorry, you were in real buildings, not in film sets. <br /> <br /> "schappe1" brought a lot of good comments, but about the incident with the platoon on the island of Paris at the time when everything that Jack Webb said we were, "the film appeared due to an accident, and Marine Corps infantry did not want to release anything that would affect any member of the Marines family who died that night, although the Marine Corps would provide any Marines and the help needed for a film that responds to the public why the marine does what he does ". <br /> <br /> As some of you mentioned, I was also at the time when we were shooting the scenes, caught me thinking that this dialogue had been cleared to a large number and, obviously, not the way it goes in real life. Back in the 50s, it was just that. <br /> <br /> I would like to tell one story about the interaction that happened between us, the marines and the film crew, and between the film crew and Jack Webb. From the very beginning, according to custom, the marines answered “Yes, sir” to everyone who moved. In the second week it became more common to hear that “Yes, sir” from all sides. On the stage, someone would shout a request for something to do with the lighting, and from nowhere on the podium a “Yes, sir” would be heard above the stage. To all of this at one of our informal gatherings, Jack Webb said. "If I knew that I would receive so much respect from this team, I would bring you here many years ago." There was one lieutenant brought up from San Diego to play the role of DI from another platoon and with who Jack Webb fights, but during one shooting he was going to take number 32, and yet Webb continued to try to work with him through how he wanted it to be done, and showed no patience with him. The next day, they turned to an adviser to the Paris island, who was a sergeant. from the Isle of Paris, and he did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> At that time I was a little camera lover and met the cameraman to get a pointer from him, and as it turned out, he gave me more shots and part of a 35-mm film of daily shooting that were not were going to use. I cut these strips of film and made slides of them. After the film was released on VHS tape (The DI, 11706 B & W / 106 min.), My children and grandchildren were delighted when they tried to see who could find me most on the screen.
