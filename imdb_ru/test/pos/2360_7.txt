Black Day Blue Night was actually a good modern noir. Three young nomads on the run from their own lives are united in a desert journey in the middle of the desert (as most modern noirs do). One woman discovers that her husband is cheating on her, and, finding him in a hotel room, decides to leave and start anew. Oddly enough, she travels with her husband's mistress, who is excusable, given that the scum had never told her that he was married. And together, driving in the pouring rain, they meet a third, very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets. Despite the fact that they are frivolous and free and everyone is suspicious of each other, the police in the city mark them as suspected of being a police officer. <br /> <br /> Black Day Blue Night begins with an immediate confrontation, and adds a pretty good story with all its twists, designed to mislead your suspicions about one character after another, which leads to a very unusual ending. Thus, the film begins with an immediate confrontation of action, and as soon as you think the story is revealed, you immediately get another turn in the plot, revealing a little more than you expected before the film ends. <br /> <br /> But, as some viewers wrote, the final is a bit confusing and a little disappointing. The killer is not the one you immediately expect, and as soon as he is revealed, he becomes somewhat confused because of a rather subtly explained memory revealing all the necessary motives for solving the mystery. But in fact, there is a finale that I think is the most interesting of the film. Since modern noir always includes the range of criminal suspects, almost always they are all guilty of something, this is also a genre that is always associated with money. And so the question always arises in these films: how much are the heroes ready to go for the money? <br /> <br /> If you like this performance of a modern film noir, I would advise to watch Red Rock West (it also got JT Walsh and some sequels in the ruined wilderness)!
