I happened to read all the manga released by Junji Ito in English. I watched Tom's movie, and it was a big steaming pile of turd. THANKS Uzumaki actually does justice to the manga. I think that those who read the manga will really appreciate this film more, as many screenshots and camera angles are exactly the same as in the manga, and itâ€™s interesting to see how the characters of the book play in the film. This movie reminds me of creepy Indiana. The ending is different from the manga I was expecting. Kyrie looks like her manga colleague, and her male friend fits all. I must admit, very terribly, this film feels like a feverish nightmare, the way you were in your childhood. Not exactly scary, but strange if you understand my drift? Another horror from Japan, take yourself a copy.
