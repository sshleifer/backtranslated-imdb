My family (two 40-year-olds, an 8-year-old and my 71-year-old mother) saw this in a preview on April 29th. We all loved the movie. The story was good, and knowing that it was based on real events, it became much more pleasant. Luke Wilson was a cry (pun intended) to watch Tim Blake Nelson be. And it was nice to see Neil Flynn play something other than a “mean-spirited scrub cleaner.” The children in the film have succeeded, and I am sure that they will all appeal to a certain demography at the heartbeat level. The visual effects were simply amazing, and Jimmy Buffett’s music added “Florida feelings”. Well, maybe the story was too neat and well packed for some adults, but who cares? I can't compare it with a book, I honestly did not hear about it until the movie came out. <br /> <br /> It was just a good movie with a good message. Simply and easily.
