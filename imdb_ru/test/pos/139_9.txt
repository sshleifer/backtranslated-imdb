They say that in horror movies it is always better to leave things to the viewer's imagination - to hide certain details from the viewers, to tickle their imagination, to plunge into their fears and allow these to generate their darkest thoughts. <br /> <br /> This was not the case when I watched Bakjwi under the American name Thirst. Now I play in select cinemas near you. It seems that the filmmakers did not want to spare you the details. There will be blood in this film and you will try to look away. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the review please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi. .html Thank you and hope you enjoyed reading above.
