This film is pretty good. It seems that they used Tyrannosaurus Rex as a blown balloon, just like Godzilla, just maybe, in those 60-70s, the scientist did not get enough information. on all sorts of dinosaurs. Scientists were still doing dinosaurs at the time, so I think this film was based on the movements of the Tyrannosaurus Rex in the 60s and 70s. There is even a part where a giant stone, released by someone from the Tyrannosaur, damages the Tyrannosaur, and was knocked out for a while. In the end, Tyrannosaurus Rex returned in search of food. There is also something wrong in the film, like a rifle, for example, how one rifle can kill a tyrannosaur when it can be 1000-5000 stronger than us. If this movie is going to make a remake, I suggest making it more interesting and exciting, because if you're lucky, when watching an old movie, it looks like it will be redone.
