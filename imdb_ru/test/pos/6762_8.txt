This is a novelty in the Danish film. The mood is no different from the mood of Blinkende Lygter, also from Anders Thomas Jensen, but with a new touch. One of the differences is in a smaller number of characters, leaving much more space for them. And what characters ?! Two butchers are perfect. Mads Mikkelsen is a dominant, irresponsible parody, and Nikolai Li Kaas is an indifferent loser with a twin brother, a more or less unholy pair of two.
