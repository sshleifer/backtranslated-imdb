I recommend that viewers of films, if they are in the New York area, go to the Museum of the Intrepid and get an idea of ​​how close and close accommodation was for crews of vintage submarines from World War II. Especially since it should have been for sailors during the First World War. It must have been a real hell below. <br /> <br /> Walter Houston and Robert Montgomery lead the cast of Hell Below, Houston as written in the book. Captain and Montgomery, as his free move number two. Both of them are quite plausible, since naval officers and other actors, such as Robert Young, Eugene Palette, Jimmy Durant, Madge Evans, Sterling Holloway, etc., perform their roles fairly well. <br /> <br /> Silent service became more popular during and after World War II. It's amazing, but I could call a whole bunch of pictures of submarines, such as Torpedo Run, Operation Pacific, Hell Cat, Silent Run, Run Deep, and many others, and you will see the same plot situations. in all of them. I believe that in fact there are limitations on the situation. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Durante is very interesting. He is pretty funny, and his scene with a boxing kangaroo, when he goes ashore, is really very funny. But I must say that such a character as he, in these cramped rooms, is probably very necessary for morale. If you do not have such a person, to relieve tension on board a submarine, you must immediately transfer him to your ship. <br /> <br /> But for me the main thing is the scene of the death of Sterling Holloway. Very similar to Sean McClory in "Island in the sky." It will haunt you long after you see this movie.
