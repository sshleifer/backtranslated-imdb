I usually don't like this movie, but I worked at home and wanted to watch something halfway while I was doing it. I was so absorbed that I quit working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour without a break. And I am sure that I usually did not cry because of such a show, but I cried at the end. Many emotional nuances. Great game and good sense of the south. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors, and the guy who played Luke was also really good. Highly recommend.
