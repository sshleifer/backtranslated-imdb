What I got was something better. <br /> <br /> Like many of the films I have commented on recently, I was looking forward to it. Especially after seeing one of the other Blue Spring films by Toshiaki Toyoda, which easily enters my top 20 favorite films. I really liked the 9 Shower trailer, and I thought it sounded very good. I have not heard anything bad about it. Now I know why. <br /> <br /> This film begins as a comedy, and then during the last half of the film it quickly becomes something else. This becomes more dramatic as each of the characters faces their own tragedies. Each character gets enough time on the screen, and you care about what happens to each of them. Despite the fact that in just two hours we need to learn 9 characters to take care of, Toshiaki Toyoda is brilliantly coping with this task. <br /> <br /> After I saw Blue Spring, I hoped that the soundtrack would be at least as good as it was in this movie. I got my wish, because the soundtrack for “9 Souls” was also incredible. The music used in each scene, in particular, more dramatic, is simply gorgeous. I loved every second of it. <br /> <br /> I wasn’t sure if I wanted or not to see another movie Torshiaki Toyod, the “porn star”, but after I saw it, I was going to. Definitely. Also, because I read the plot for this, and I think it sounds really good. I look forward to it. On DVD R1 "9 Souls" there are two interviews with Toyoda. He says he finished another film, and he wants to start writing the script for his next one. I can't wait for both. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. You should see this. Now.
