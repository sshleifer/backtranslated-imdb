This is Hitchcock’s second film, which will appear on the list, and Hitchcock’s second film, which I saw in full, was the first “Rope”, which I really liked. With Saboteur Hitchcock, there was more room for free movement, while Rope was located in one room. I didn’t like it as much as Rope, but that doesn’t mean that it’s a bad movie, it just looks like a regular movie that could be more than that. <br /> <br /> It seems that the film, which Hitchcock take as a break between his more serious. As a thriller, I feel that he does not manage to stand on the edge of his place or join the battle with the main character, who runs around the States. The culmination of the film is the missed opportunity to really increase the tension. Sound design is almost absent. You can hear their dialogue and a little environment, but important things are missing, the seams are torn from the sleeve, there is not enough music to increase the tension, everything is missing. Deliberate, no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional impact that one would expect from such a scene. Then it ends abruptly, leaving you empty inside. <br /> <br /> The film also does not feel as it should, it almost moves around the globe from place to place, but still it feels more limited. The script itself is very average and seems to be talking about more stupid ways to make the plot move. <br /> <br /> There are performances, but nothing surprising. Each plays a role in the writing of script words on the page. The relationship between the two leads is weak and requires additional work. One of them is Otto Kruger, who has such a rich, ego, evil person. <br /> <br /> In the end, I wanted more from this. I understand that this is one of Hitchcock's least exciting films, but I had a good time watching it. I can recommend it, but not enthusiastically.
