The fat man and the little boy were codenamed of two atomic bombs, which were dropped in the reverse order on Nagasaki and Hiroshina. The story of the emergence of this film - as they appeared and fell into the hands of Americans. <br /> <br /> The terms, by the way, are the codenames of two bombs filled with plutonium and uranium. The Fat Man was a plutonium bomb, and this bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, and the Little Boy was used on Hiroshima. <br /> <br /> The film is basically a conflict between General Leslie R. Groves of the United States Army and physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led a group of scientists who designed the bomb under Groves. With two men from different walks of life, conflict was inevitable. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who has been a disarmament activist all his life, plays General Groves. To his credit, Newman does not play a man whose views he would have very little in common, like any kind of caricature. Groves, first of all, a military man, who has an engineering education. He wanted a military command, as naturally would have been prepared by military experts in this greatest war. But because of his experience in engineering, Groves headed the Manhattan Project, which was codenamed. So be it, Newman is determined to contribute to the counting of military efforts. <br /> <br /> Most of us first met Dwight Schulz from the A-Team as H.M. Murdoch, a pilot whose grip of reality is weak at best. If you only knew the A-Team, you would think that Schultz has a great future in comic roles. <br /> <br /> Instead, Dwight Schulz is one of the best actors in the English-speaking world with an amazing range. dramatic pieces from the moment they left this television series. J. Robert Oppenheimer in life was a complex man who realized the danger and benefit of atomic energy. The problem problem also intrigued him. Later, Oppenheimer got into a real connection because of his left-wing political views and allies who everyone knew when they went to the Manhattan project. <br /> <br /> Some of the less significant roles are Bonnie Bedelia as Mrs. Oppenheimer, Natasha Richardson as Oppenheimer's mistress, whose friendship with Oppenheimer subsequently gave him such a jackpot, and Laura Dern as a nurse at the Los Alamos website. <br /> <br /> But the best of them is John Cusack, who, like Michael Merriman, consists of several real-life scientists who can be accurately named the first victims of the atomic age. His scenes with Laura Dern, especially with what happens to him, cause real urgency. <br /> <br /> Disputes about bombs and their use continue to provoke heated debate. The fat man and the little boy present the facts and let you decide what might happen if an alternative use were made.
