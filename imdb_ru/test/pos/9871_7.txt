I bought it in the budget department last week. I already had Halloween and Halloween II, and since I'm going to collect all the horror movies, I chose this. In the end, the first two were good. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty clever to tell the truth. It seems he creates the right atmosphere and has a pleasant “Michael Myers story.” he uses the old locations from the original, and the main character is the child whom Laurie came with the child on that fateful Halloween in 1978 ... <br /> <br /> The climax is also quite satisfactory. In any case, this is MUCH better than H20, which, frankly, is absolute crap.
