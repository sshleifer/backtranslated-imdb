Obviously made from cheap to capitalize on the notorious “Mandingo”, this insanely indulgent piece of insanely rancid Italian trash from sexual exploitation really pours out dirty things with a commendable lack of taste and restraint: an evil arrogant white family who owns and manages a generous Plantation slaves spend most of the screen time, participating in shawls with each other and with various slaves. Directed by Mario Penzauti and screenwriter Tecla Romanelli overwhelm this fetid dirt with an abundant excess: we have vile rape, interracial copulation (one white lady makes wild love with a muscular black stallion while she is tied to a cross), an abundant woman nudity, cruel whipping, vile, naked, furious black horse a lot of sinister soft sex and a cruel perverted tragic surprise, ending with mixing elements of incest, murder and mixing in a dubious attempt to make a statement about the horrific inhumanity of slavery. Special praise for the fact that the chanterelle-brunette actress Paola D'Egidio, whose lustful and licentious picture of the depraved and depraved evil bitch Ronda, positively burns the screen. In addition, the funk, pulsating score of Marcello Gombini strikes a great place. The rather polished cinematography by Maurizo Centini also does its job. Satisfactory purl piece of mucous fly.
