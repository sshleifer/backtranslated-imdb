I am very sad for some people who have reviewed this film. Obviously, their standards are so high that they can never enjoy a movie just for the fun of it. Or perhaps their pleasure comes from the act of choosing films; Are you looking for a reason not to love them? <br /> <br /> The Long Kiss Goodnight is an action movie in every sense of the word. Of course, there are holes in the plot that are big enough to drive through the semi-finals, but not one of them is enough to stop the flow of the film itself. I have never been a big fan of Gina Davis, but I was impressed with how she was able to create two completely different characters, Samantha Cain and Charlie Baltimore. In my opinion, it was not even necessary to change her appearance in order to distinguish between the two ... her games were more than enough to get things done. <br /> <br /> Although more than anything else, this film was Craig Bierko. In the hands of others, Timothy’s character could have been just another interchangeable villain. His decision to play him with a more casual approach was the correct counterpoint for all action scenes. It is not often possible to meet an actor who can express himself so well using only his facial expression ... a specific case: a scene in the freezer with Charlie and her daughter. Where most films would clutter the moment of “revelation” with unnecessary dialogue, Bierko’s eyes told the whole story. <br /> <br /> Main story? Thin to be truthful. The seemingly average housewife suffering from amnesia gradually discovers that she was the murderer. When her memory returns, people who want the killer to die. Is she really Samantha, a housewife for baking cookies, or Charlie, a cold-blooded killer? Or maybe a little of both? For me, The Long Kiss Goodnight was a pleasant journey to find out.
