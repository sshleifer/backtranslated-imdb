Glenn Close returned in the role of Sarah Plain and Tull, a woman who has a family in good and bad times. The game is gorgeous - Christopher Walken (unusually spooky), as her husband again demonstrates a first-class performance. It's nice to see young Christopher Bell grow up; It is a pity that we do not see much of Anne (Lexi Randall, also a few years older), but the new addition to the Whitting family (played by Emily Osment) was very helpful. And finally, Jack Palance, as the long-lost Whitting Patriarch, is fine, as always.
