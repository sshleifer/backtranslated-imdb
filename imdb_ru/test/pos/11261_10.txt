This film tells about three teenagers who have been best friends for a long time and make the most complicated trip in their lives. When the heroine becomes the best drug in their city, these three teenagers are captured by all of this. In this film, heroin addiction is very well reflected, and this is something that you cannot stop watching. MTV has never been the best at making television movies, but this one should have good content to not watch it. I liked this film, at first I thought it would be the worst film Iâ€™ve seen, but then it got better and I couldn't turn away.
