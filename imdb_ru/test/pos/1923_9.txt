If you are interested in extreme actions (and I do not mean Hollywood, such as UFC & X-Games) and those who pursue them, then look for this document. <br /> <br /> This is one of those truths, fake fairy tales about Donald Crowhurt's obsessive idea to show himself against all odds. These odds were collected by mother nature, the media and his own mind. For us, this is also a lost time - although it was only 40 years ago. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers did a great job collecting a wide range of materials to tell their story and the story of a great race that swallowed him. <br /> <br /> I could not help thinking about Timothy Treadwell and the Apollo astronauts in the two great documents “Man with horror” and “Shadow of the moon”, testing - you do not just “look” - this story. <br /> <br /> If you live in a big city, buy or rent it. It is worth the effort to find. I had to drive 100 miles to Los Angeles to buy it, and I'm glad I did.
