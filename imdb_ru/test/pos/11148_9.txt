The film opens in a stuffy British men's club full of men on leather chairs smoking cigars. This is the world of Denistoun. The courier delivers him a small box, which opens to find gold earrings. Earrings site reminds of the time he spent in the company of Gypsies. The rest of the film is a memory. <br /> <br /> Golden earrings have long been loved by me and probably the most romantic movie I know. Dietrich plays against her usual type. Here she is dark-haired, earthy and by no means mysterious. Instead of a femme fatale, she is a tower of strength and vigorously intends to use all her resources to help Denistoun survive and achieve her goal. To make sure that he is a truly convincing gypsy, she pierces his ears and makes him wear the gold earrings of her dead lover. With his clothes and a little fat, she turns him from an inept British gentleman into a wild and sexy-looking man. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up, I heard the song "Golden Earrings", which is sung in the film. I think the melody is humming Dietrich a little. / There is a story that Gypsies know is true / That when your love wears golden earrings / It belongs to you.
