This is the promise of the trailer that I saw and on which I rented Hitch. Similarly, a serious film viewer should not expect much more from this title, but, surprisingly, Smith, Mendez, James and Valletta managed to achieve a theatrical performance that can be expressed metaphorically in their rap dance floor by the end of the film. : their characters formed an effective combination that can cause more than just laughter on this Sunday afternoon DVD, provided that your date is not an exquisite fan of the film from the French directors of the 60s. <br /> <br /> PS: Methods to score, everything is TRUE, especially the "cocktail girl" routine!
