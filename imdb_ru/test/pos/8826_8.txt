Every time when the prospective researchers and we, the audience, aim to see for the first time one of the wonderful new worlds, for some godless reason the filmmakers decided to distract themselves with an “emergency” or some kind of false alarm or some kind of artificial drama. the unknown. <br /> <br /> Therefore, instead of quietly enjoying Io’s surface, or standing above Saturn’s rings, or concentrating on the magic of flying a comet or an asteroid, we are distracted by concerns about the welfare and survival of the characters. Big disappointments !!!! <br /> <br /> The filmmakers are not sure what they want. A documentary about natural wonders in our solar system or a thriller in which the viewer cares more about characters than about the subject. Come on. <br /> <br /> Hello. If I wanted tension and tension, I would watch a real science fiction science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a documentary drama. But the characters and their survival here (the risks of such a mission should be secondary to the subject). Wait. Yes, the risks of such a mission are an important part of the subject, since in essence it is a film about a space mission, and not just about the solar system. But he was exaggerated and greatly distracted from the discovery of new worlds that we were to enjoy. <br /> <br /> For the rest, the film was wonderful, it gave a very realistic picture of the human elements of the space mission, quarrels, tension, burden of responsibility, almost fatal mistakes, victims, etc. Moreover, it would fit very well in the hard-sci-fi subgenre - in fact it would be one of the best, because here science was almost closely related. <br /> <br /> But the distractions were terrible. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I missed showing the influence of astronauts for several years after landing on Earth. Also no
