This film was advertised as a comedy, but it was much more serious than trailers. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but I expected more laughter. Great performances by Robin Williams and Laura Linney. Worth seeing, but don't wait to roll on the floor. The film made me think about what would happen if the character of Robin Williams was a real person running for president. Will we choose a comedian? I doubt it, unfortunately. This kind of absolute honesty today is very lacking. This is a movie that I’ll add to my DVD library as soon as it’s released on DVD. The film has a heart.
