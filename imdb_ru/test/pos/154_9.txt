No pun intended. I'm not going to spoil the story, but we can assume that you already know what character the main actor portrays. And, of course, being a priest, being “naughty,” exaggerates it all. In addition, it is the most erotic film from Park Chan Vuk. <br /> <br /> If you've seen previous work / films by Wook, you know that he is very visual (in a good way), and he is shown here again. While it deviates from the theme of the vengeance of his previous films on the surface, it still has a rather high temperature hidden under it. And when it boils, quite a lot of bad things start happening. But through all this darkness, there are also moments of light (fun) that will be there. A very stylistic and albeit provocative film that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job ...
