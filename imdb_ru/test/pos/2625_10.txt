I was a 20 year old college student who lived with people when I first saw it, and I never forgot it. I'm a big fan of Joan Hackett, and this film is perfect for her wonderful talent. I am so glad to see that so many other people have such fond memories of it. Naturally, this is not available on any media! It would be ideal to show on Lifetime, but because of its age, they will not. You never see anything there until the mid-eighties. I still remember what made me watch it when it was first shown: Rex Reed watched it in the New York Daily News and said it was like a return to the great Hollywood films of the forties, and whether then Hackett and Grimes would play Stanwick and Crawford. Think about it! Postscript So sad that Joan Hekket left us so tragically young.
