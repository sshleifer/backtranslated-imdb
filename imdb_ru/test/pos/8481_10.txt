Jamie Foxx is absolutely Ray Charles. His performance is simply brilliant. He owns the film, just as Spacek owned the Miner's Daughter, and Quaid owned the Fireballs. In fact, it is difficult to remember that the role of Ray Charles is performed, and not the person himself plays. Ray Charles is legendary. He has proven himself as a musician, and the music is deep, complex and innovative - even more innovative than I thought before watching this movie. The film should make new fans of the young audience who can come to him, knowing little about his music. Ray Charles’s life has provided excellent biographical material for a film that goes far beyond just another film about a musician. I admit, I knew very little about the life of this man until I saw this film. I came out of it under the impression of Ray Charles’s courage, strength and innovation as a person and a musician.
