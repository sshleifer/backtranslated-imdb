I remember watching it when it was done, and thought it was brilliant at the time. The second time, after almost 20 years, I still think that Traffic is great and much better than the American film that was based on this drama. <br /> <br /> He should also be watched by all of our today's gone tomorrows politicians who think they can win the war on drugs, because the problems raised in this film are as relevant today as they were then, at the end of , and if they do not change their policies, they will be the same after 20 years. <br /> <br /> Well written, well done, beautifully played and superbly shot. A drama that evokes a thought that entertains as well as reveals some of the harsh realities of the criminal drug trade.
