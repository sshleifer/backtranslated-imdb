Blimey! it is even better than i expected! The best animated film Asterix ever! and it is so nice to hear Roger Karel say the voice of Asterix again! I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Astérix comics! but I suggest you watch the French version, because it is definitely the best, and you hear the original cast! Did you know that Roger Carel has been playing Astérix for almost forty years? I think he did an amazing job! and the song from Céline Dion at the end is coming to victory! the music is good, the pictures are good, the actors are wonderful ... in one word: a masterpiece! go to see it! You will not regret it!
