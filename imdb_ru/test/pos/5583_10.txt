I also remember watching this film as a child at a local small theater, which presented foreign films every week. Since then, it has been a bold adventure that remains in my memory. <br /> <br /> Particularly impressive was the scene with Noel Purcell when the old sailor Paddy, who drank too much, saw or heard the phenomena, and died of fright in a cave. I always tracked Noelâ€™s career even decades later, because I saw him then. There is also a young Cyril Cusack, who, like James, is an exhausted boatman with pictures of the beautiful Gene Simmons, shown as Emmeline grew up. <br /> <br /> I would very much like to have a video of this haunting movie and update my memory of this. Where can I send a request?
