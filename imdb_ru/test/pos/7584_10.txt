“Horses on Mars” is a fascinating animated video that sometimes looks at the evolutionary process through the eyes of those who have not yet developed. The story is personal and sometimes sentimental, and is supported by strong digital animation and narration that engages the viewer in this fantastic story. I was lucky to watch this short film in widescreen format at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, and I must assume that when transferred to a small screen, it will lose some of its ability to attract the reader to a no less thoughtful story and stunning graphics.
