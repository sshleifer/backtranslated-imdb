Television produces dozens of films about real crimes every year. You can watch 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and on Court TV you can count on a few every weekend. So I started watching Morrison's Murders, thinking that I know very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real family murder. What I received was a subtle, beautifully played drama that swallowed me from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Both brothers were absolutely convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the difficult role of Luke. The appearance of Georgia was in almost every frame. If I had any complaints, it was Gordon Clapp as sheriff. He just does not look and does not behave like a lawyer in a small town called Byron Calhoun. It looks and sounds like Medava, and Medava is not suitable for this part. <br /> <br /> But this is a small talk: Morrisonâ€™s killings are worth seeing, not just on a rainy Saturday afternoon. If you go out, tape it. You will not regret it.
