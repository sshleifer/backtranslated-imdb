This is one of those films that I can watch again and again and do not get tired of it. This is definitely one of the best adaptations of comics. I liked this one even more than the X-men. In fact, this film is a cross between X-men and the matrix, and it came out earlier. Wesley Snipes does an excellent job with Blade's character. He's just not an insensitive super hero. In addition, this film does not have sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. Of course, comics are mostly for kids, but I like it better in my films. Let's face it, if we were in such situations, we would curse the storm to make it more realistic. This comic book adaptation also has something that many do not. A good end fight between a bad guy and a good guy. Let's face it, none of the Batman films had a very good final fight.
