You must love this movie! I mean, another Swedish movie about splashes can be so evil, whimsical and completely cruel ... The whole movie is crammed with some kind of strange humor, like: An old black duck simply tears off his head, and the boss just wipes the blood of his glasses and speaks mean voice: - Your fired !!! wouppie !!!
