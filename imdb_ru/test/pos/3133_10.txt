Two horse traders arrive in the city and meet with the leader of the Mormon group, who are heading for the valley, where they can settle down and live in peace. Plot scenes in the city where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson are discussing prices, and Bond introduces the idea of ​​how Johnson and his partner, played by Harry Carey, Jr., lead the train to this valley, are among the best in the film, like Johnson, a real cowboy cuts a piece of wood while he pokes fun at Bond. Once on the trail, they run into Joan Drew, who John Ford may have seen in the Red River, and offered her a much better role in this film. There are a number of notable characters on the Morman train. The Mormans are a peace-loving group who are challenged along the way by a group of criminals who do not really live. In their case (criminals), in the case of people on the train, and then the Navajo groups they encounter, and in the well-written characters played by Ben Johnson and Ward Bond, the film completely avoids stereotypes, while the Camera seems to spends so much time to give the viewer a big picture of the Monument Valley framing the train, when it moves along with several water transitions along the way, in stunning black and white color, and then returning to what is happening in this moving community, all to the accompaniment of a beautiful Asnoy vocalizations of the Sons of the Pioneers.
