What a cool mini-series. The original TRAFFIK stole me completely from everything that was included. Much more captivating than an American remake, the original TRAFFIK boasts an amazing cast of lesser-known actors in the North American audience. Juliette Binoche, who is mainly a recognizable actress who plays a drug dependent teenage daughter of a government official. But this film is not a star power (although I liked the American version, I felt that it was shot by famous Americans in the picture). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I saw the American version before I found the original BBC mini-series. Of course, there were no image filters, lush locales and celebrities / directors. However, the sand and mud of Europe (through the world of drugs) perfectly complement the impending sense of danger that permeates the entire film. Problems such as getting rid of drug addicts by providing them with more funds, a bad anti-drug campaign, and resistance from foreign governments helping to destroy their drug addicts from within, make TRAFFIK bold, exciting and terrifying at the same time. time! <br /> <br /> All the incredible parts of the film come from Pakistan. My God, I never knew how serious the problem was in Europe ... even in everything! For real acquaintance with the problems of drugs, in addition to how they affect the human body, you should look at this and the American version. In each show, one very clear and undeniable fact. Those countries that are leaders in the eyes of the world have a culture that has led to the death and suffering of many people. <br /> <br /> Drugs are worse than war. They work in the shadows, the dark secrets of any "successful" society.
