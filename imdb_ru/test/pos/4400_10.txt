After seeing most of the previous films of the Coen Brothers, I was expecting something different and a bit off center. OBWAT is, of course, those things, but it also has a heart as big as ... well ... as big as Mississippi. This is one of the most enjoyable films recently released: smart, well-designed, smart and superbly played. <br /> <br /> Characters are delivered in their countless shades by a group of amazing actors. George Clooney completely conquered me with his appearance and character of Clark Gable. I only ever saw him in the movie “Three Kings” and his cameo “The Thin Red Line”, and now I'm a fan of it. More comedy please, George. <br /> <br /> John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson help skillfully, especially Nelson. If the Simpsons ever be turned into a film, it must be natural to play Cletus with a relaxed jaw. I do not think that there is a performance that does not reach the superiority of the whole composition. My favorite hero is Stephen Ruth, like a blind man in a radio station. <br /> <br /> Magnificent early music, Clooney's dance, which I am trying to master, and the feeling of an era of depression in the southern United States, amplified. Sepia-like photos make this the best film I've seen in this century. The only drawback of the film is that it almost ruined me for the purchase of a soundtrack, a DVD and a DVD player for playing it .... that is good! <br /> <br />
