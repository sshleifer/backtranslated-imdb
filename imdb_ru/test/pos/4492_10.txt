During the study, Susan Harrison (“The Ballerina”) in connection with the Episode of Bonanz reminded me of this precious stone. <br /> <br /> This episode inspired Dylan's “Everything along the Watchtower” (Hendrix probably knows the cover well, and this is one of his best), which is one of his best. <br /> <br /> So this episode is responsible for some of the “best” - not bad for about 22 minutes of television. <br /> <br /> But this is the Twilight Zone. Further comments on the series are not needed. <br /> <br /> “5 characters” is a typical serling. Intense, dramatic, tending to the end, as inevitable in retrospect as it is amazing when you first see it. <br /> <br /> This episode is spoiled in one sentence and too good to spoil it for those who have not seen it. <br /> <br /> But you will feel ambushed. And you will never again listen to Hendrix with the same ears.
