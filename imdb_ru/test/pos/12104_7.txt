Winner of the 2004 Akin Award “Head-On” / “Gegen die Wand” portrayed the temptingly chaotic world of a self-destructive but dynamic Turkish-German rocker named Cahit (Birol Ünel). This documentary is an offshoot of Head-On and explores the range of music that can be found in Istanbul today, if it were as energetic and curious as German avant-garde musician Alexander Hakke from Einstuerzende Neubauten (who arranged the soundtrack and performed several Head-On music) and with the assistance of a film crew and Turkish speakers provided by the director Akin. You get everything from rap to the most traditional Turkish classical song, with rock music, Kurdish music and Turkish pop music between them. This is the same chaotic and open world, like the world of Kahit, where the East is East and the West is West, but they somehow meet. <br /> <br /> Like Istanbul itself, which is on the verge of Europe and Asia, combining two worlds, remaining sui generis, it is a melange that includes Turkish pop music, traditional Turkish songs, Kurdish lamentations, jazz musicians of the Roma and a group of street musicians (Siyasiyabend), live and unusual pictures of the street life of Istanbul and some speak to the camera about the synthesis and some personal and musical history of singers and musicians. While working at the Grand Hotel de Londres in the Beyoglu quarter of Istanbul, where Kahit remained at the end of Head-On in search of his beloved, Hakke wanders around the city with the team and equipment, talking to people and recording their music. <br /> <br /> Does he start with some loud rock from the "neo-psychedelic" band Baba Zula ?? these are musicians with whom he communicated, putting together musical scores, and he speaks here for the absent bass player - and Turkish (including brave) rappers ?? thus forcing some old people to leave the theater early and skip the mostly melodic and easily listened sounds that make up the bulk of the film. (Head-On narrative excesses were occasionally held back by musical interludes played by a traditional Turkish orchestra sitting outdoors on the other side of the Bosporus.) Hakke gives us the opportunity to meet and hear some of the most famous living Turkish singers, including Müzeyyen Senar, a woman in her late eighties, whose aging elegant musicians resemble one of the ways that the great Egyptian singer Umm Kulsum performed. Hacke makes Orhan Gansbey, a film-songwriter star, play an amazing solo on the long neck on which he wrote all his songs and convinces the now elusive great Sezen Aksu to make a special performance of one of her most famous “Memory” songs. Istanbul ". This is a coup, and just as the beautiful Kurdish singer Ainar is crying, recorded in the bathroom, whose acoustics are impressive if only they could reduce the heat? The faces of the singer and musician are sweating from sweat. fluent in Turkish, who sings the Turkish folk song with expression and fervor. A high quality sound mix in everything. I would like to see a sequel; many great examples of Turkish popular and classical music were omitted. <br /> <br /> The film released summer 2005 and shown at festivals in 2005 and 2006. Opened in Angelica Film Center in New York, June 9, 2006.
