One morning I went outside when I was checking something on TV and came across this movie. I never remember, saw it or heard about it. How fun and interesting to watch. Well, my meeting was postponed because I could not get out of this movie. There were some really interesting things in it that marked his time in history, and some funny things that they don’t have in today's movie, because it’s not beautiful. Well, that was a lot of realism. The acting was good for the 1954 film. Subtle and sincere actions by the characters that made me see what they were going to do next. That's why I finished watching this. I do not know why they do not show it more often. I would prefer to watch this than some movies in which they play more than necessary. For history buffs, this film will appeal to people who like historical films and those who participate in films. "Egyptian" has many tastes associated with many things that should be paid attention to in human nature, which have not changed since that time. What does this say about us? Those who do not like films that waste time on unfolding and tell a good story ... are not filmed in the film. <br /> <br /> I didn’t have time to withdraw it, if it is, but if I had a chance to see it again, I probably would have voted for 10.
