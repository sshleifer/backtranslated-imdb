I sit, looking through the lists of films and not seeing anything that I want to see. My appetite keeps saying, “Something like BROADCASTING NEWS.” This is what I want. Something clever and funny, with ideas for adults, great acting and writing work and directorial style that does not attract attention. It is quite possible that this is Hurt's best performance (in my opinion, this or THE BIG CHILL): no matter how eccentric he is, Hurt is smart, and playing an unreasonable person without making sure to wink - hey, I'm not stupid ... well, acting right there. Hunter is perfect for taking notes, and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And he can read and sing at the same time!) Excellent, great job. <br /> <br />
