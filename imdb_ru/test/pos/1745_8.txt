Despite the fact that Disney has been an animation studio for the past 70 years, there have always been competitors in their superiority. For example, when this review was written in 2009, companies like Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Warner Brothers and Ardman produced animated films that can be said to challenge Disney's dominance. In the beginning, in the late 30s and early 40s, when Disney served cinematic banquets, such as Snow White, Dumbo and Fantasia, the competitions were held by brothers Dave and Max Fleisher. Despite the release of two very commendable films, they did not corner the market. many explain their fall by the commercial failure of Bug Goes To Town, released the same week as the Pearl Harbor attack (which gave the American public something more important than thinking than going to the cinema to watch a cartoon!) in relative obscurity - parody. <br /> <br /> A bunch of beetles are in terrible danger in an overgrown garden. People use the land as a label, discarding litter and cigars, as well as other dangers, right above the beetle houses on the go. The owner of the honey shop Mr. Bumble (voiced by Jack Mercer) is afraid that the future is bleak, and he wonders how he will be able to raise his daughter Honey (voiced by Pauline Lot) in a safer environment. A very unscrupulous creature, Bagley S. Beatle (voiced by Tedd Pierce), offers her a safer place to live if she accepts his hand in marriage, but Hani is much more interested in her childhood lover, forever cheerful and optimistic Hoppity (voiced by Stan Freed) Hoppiti believes that everything should be decided for the better, but it looks silly when Bagley Beatle and his pair of funny girlfriends manipulate the crisis to their insidious end. Only at the very end, when their patch becomes the basis for a huge new skyscraper, do beetles switch loyalty back to Hoppity, when they hope that it will lead them to a new, safe home away from the destructive influence of people. <Br /> <br /> What really works in this film is an amazing feature ?? all mistakes are carefully thought out and designed to maximize the attractiveness of the audience. The awkward villains were especially remembered: “Hit the fly and smack the mosquito” (funny names, if you stop thinking about it). Equally remarkable is the narrator's story? This story may appeal to even the youngest children, and at the same time, she skillfully conveys a message to a senior audience about how a man’s carelessness can affect the survival of wildlife. Time inevitably dated some aspects of the film, and when viewed its audience should accept (and forgive) these random signs of general age and wear. But in general, “Bug Goes To Town” is a complete, fun and very cleverly presented animation with a decent message to download.
