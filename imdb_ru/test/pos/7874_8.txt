It was a rather frustrating view of a supposedly functional family faced by a friend of their drug addict daughter. Father gets confused with a drug addict guy and eventually kills him. Falling wine, he shows a drunken cattle that he did. Things quickly go out of control until complete degeneration. The end you are afraid of is chasing the viewer everywhere, but it can still strike when it finally arrives.
