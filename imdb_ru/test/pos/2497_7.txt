“Love Letter” is a rather pleasant, very restrained romantic comedy in which the use of only a few correct words in a mysterious love letter reveals the secret passions and passions of sleepy residents of the coastal city. <Br /> <br /> This is not for all viewers. The “love letter,” I feel, benefits from its simple and quiet tone. Never intentionally stupid and fake, like most romantic comedies, he is whimsical, picturesque and comfortable. However, for the same reasons, many viewers will be bored and disinterested. <br /> <br /> The cast is good. It's nice to see Tom Selleck again, and this is such an undervalued role. And it's hard to believe that this is the same Kate Capshaw, which we met 15 years ago in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom." She is quite naturally good here; improves in every role I have seen since Indy’s nerves. And is it possible that with the age of Capshaw it becomes more and more beautiful? (What is that Spielberg!?) <br /> <br /> This is not so much; but after another noisy summer film season, I’ll probably recall this novel about the light as a feather with a little love.
