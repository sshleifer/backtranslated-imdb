A wonderful little Hitchcock thriller with lots of good machinations surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a conspiracy of foreigners and a few random taxidermists. Jimmy Stewart, as always, is a great hero for Hitchcock, the story unfolds before its climax at the embassy, ​​but he lacks the brooding threat of the black and white low-budget original Hitchcock. Nevertheless, another great film from the stables of the great master.
