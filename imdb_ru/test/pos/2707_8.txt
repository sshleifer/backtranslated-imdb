The story of Karen Carpenter reveals a little more about the difficult life of the singer Karen Carpenter. Although he does not give accurate facts and details. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a good choice. She is a good actress, but she plays a very naive and stupid Karen Carpenter. I think the role needs a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality. <br /> <br /> Louise Fletcher’s role in the role of Agnes Carpenter is awesome, she does an excellent job with Karen’s mother. <br /> <br /> There are great songs in it that could be included on the soundtrack album. Unfortunately, they were not, although this film was at the top of the rating in the United States and some other countries.
