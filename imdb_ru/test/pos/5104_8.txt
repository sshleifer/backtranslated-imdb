Yes, 1939 / The Robert Donat-Greer Garrison version was the best ... Perfection ... Donat won an Oscar in a very difficult year ... Gable in GWTW and James Stewart in the role of Mr. Smith. there were 2 of his competitors. Wow, that was a tough year. Most critics in New York hated this version. so I do not see in the theater! Finally, A.M. at TCM and enjoyed ... Peter O'Toole was superb and glad that he was nominated for an Oscar, and especially glad that Oscar finally gave him a special award last year ... Petula Clark was good as Mrs. Chips but her character I feel badly written ... Some good songs, especially. You and I ... performed by Ms.Clark and later recorded by many others, including T.Bennett / S. Bassey & Carmen MacRae ... the black and white version was more authentic ... but this is a good film, beautifully photographed in color and a panoramic view ... nice to see and Bravo, again, Mr. O'Toole!
