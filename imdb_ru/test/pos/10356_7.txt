The final recording of the American production in the "Islands of Blood" series of Filipino horror films concerns Abdul Amir (Reed Hadley), the ruler of a fictional country. He is dying of cancer, and yet he figured out how to get it back: put the brain into the donor's body. A mad responsible doctor (Kent Taylor) puts him in a very unlikely body: a giant servant with scars on a face called Gore (John Bloom). The doctor, a friend of the ruler, is trying to correct the situation and put an end to the plans of the insane doctors. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers Samuel M. Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) are driving a few of the actors that they have previously worked with Taylor, Adamson's sexy wife, Reggina Carroll, Angelo Rossitto, Zandor Vorkov and Vicky Volant. They tried to use the previous Blood Island recordings, but it can be said that it was made in the USA. Although it is not necessarily a “good” film, there are a lot of funny elements in it that can form an entertaining and dirty whole. Angry dwarf (Rossitto), bloody operations, rather unconvincing work on make-up on Blume, plot of political intrigue, caves full of cobwebs, etc. The narrative is actually quite coherent, with plot twists thrown here and there. I think it might be a bit trimmed; some scenes are pulling. But he has his funny moments, and people can't wait for the end. <br /> <br /> For this kind of things, the game is not so bad. Both Taylor and Rossitto are funny; the latter seems to have a good time in his role. Volante is quite attractive, and Williams is OK. in a heroic role. In any case, it's nice to see all these familiar faces in one of these films. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing special, but as a crappy "horror" (I use this word fluently, none of this is exactly scary) a movie, it certainly is amusing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
