** and 1/2 stars from **** Lifeforce is one of the strangest films I've ever seen, so ridiculous, but at the same time strangely compelling and never boring. Whether it is because of rampant nudity, a lot of violence and action, it all comes together to make an entertaining 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> Churchill's space shuttle was sent to investigate comet Halley when they discovered something hiding in a coma of a giant stone. A small team led by Colonel Carlsen (Steve Railsback) was sent to search the area. What they discover includes hundreds of frozen, bat-like creatures and three naked and seemingly unconscious humanoid creatures in strange crystal containers, two men and one woman (Matilda May). They decide to take with them all three, which leads to disaster. <br /> <br /> When London receives no response from the crew, another team is sent to find out what is going on. When they dock with Churchill, they find the remains of the team, all expelled beyond recognition. Humanoids are still in perfect condition and return them to London. <br /> <br /> After various tests, scientists still do not know what these creatures really are. Then, late at night, the guard in the complex feels compelled to enter the room where the woman is held. He touches her shoulder, and she wakes up, gets up and smiles at him seductively and viciously. She comes up to him and starts kissing him when it becomes clear that she is actually taking his life force away, sucking all his energy out of him (the effect is a bit silly). <br /> <br /> She escapes from the complex and begins to leave a trail behind. Another man, Colonel Kane (Peter Firth), is invited to hunt her down. Then men discover that there is a pattern in the process of life force. The body of the guard wakes up after 2 hours and takes the life of a doctor. It seems that every 2 hours this process is repeated by the victim. With the help of Churchill's only survivor, Carlsen, they try to hunt down the girl before it is too late. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is pretty good entertainment at night. It contains all the elements that can be found in such a film, nudity, blood / blood and many special effects. It is certainly better than the similar movie "Views", thanks in part to a more exciting finale. <br /> <br /> Performances range from decent to terrible. The easiest way to survive the worst is Steve Reilsbek, who replays without end. Much better than Peter Firth, who comes and convincingly, and the magnificent Matilda May (she is as beautiful as the French actress Sophie Marceau and Emmanuel Seignieur). May really does almost the whole role without clothes, and there were reports that she was hard during the shooting, so the fact that she is able to go through each scene without fidgeting and looking uncomfortable is impressive. There are times when she can be pretty creepy, just seductive. Most of the film manages to work thanks to her. <br /> <br />
