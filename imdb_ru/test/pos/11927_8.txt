It came as a huge surprise to me. I had never heard of this film when I first saw it, and the name really indicated something different than the situation with the terrorists and hostages in high school. Toy Soldiers - the best of its period of the early 90s, where the militants were carefree and very pleasant. The action is good, the plot is interesting and unbelievable, the bad guy is an ugly hated moron (that's great), Louis Gossett Jr. is in it, just a movie of well-being that I really liked. <br /> <br /> You canâ€™t go wrong with this if you like the action. I give him a firm 8/10 rating.
