I just got this movie for Christmas and already added it to my favorites list. Nice and simple story that makes a beautiful film. Who could not love Uncle Felix or not drink water from the mouth at the sound of all this food. Certain points go to Sydney Greenstreet for his play by Alexander Yardley, as well as Reginald Gardiner, who played John Sloan, an incredibly boring bride. Truly a gem to watch every Christmas.
