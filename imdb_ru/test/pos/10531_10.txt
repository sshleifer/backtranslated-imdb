This film is a very long remake of the famous Fritz Lang masterpiece "M-Murder". It is well made and has an interesting key to talk about rather serious events and contemporary problems in Europe, but not only all over the world. Ethnic intolerance is such a huge evil and very contagious these days. Thus, "Children of Wax" or, as is known in the spread in the United States, quite amusingly reveals the question of German and Turkic hatred. There is no doubt that the great brothers Weinsten happily perceive them as a source of distribution. Most of all I liked the participation in this film of the favorite actor Lars von Trier, the great Udo Cyrus, who with such pleasure shows Bulgarian director Ivan Nichev with such pleasure.
