I always wanted to watch this movie, and when I finally got to it, I realized that I was in for a pleasant surprise when the name John Boorman appeared on the screen. Known mostly for his epic films (he shot the first Conan and wrote Apocalypse Now), compiled into a classic Hollywood structure, this film fits perfectly into its catalog. <br /> <br /> I also cannot express how perfect time took into account that Myanmar (Burma) is re-experiencing an uprising of monks and students against a military government ruled by a "junta", which is the same (since leadership, but essentially the same), depicted in the 1988 Movie. Now, more than ever, this film should be shown on television (it was filmed at the IFC) due to recent events.
