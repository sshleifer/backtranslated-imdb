As in many episodes of the twilight zone, one of my favorite parts of this episode is the frank social commentary that Serling makes with history. As in the case of the recent episode "Howling Man", I was reminded of my long-standing suspicion that, for example, if Jesus came to Earth to bring his followers to heaven, he would immediately be declared insane and probably thrown into asylum. Our main character in this episode faces a similar problem, trying to convince the Americans of the 1860s that he is from the future, and President Lincoln is going to kill. The episode mistakenly states that this means that some parts of the past are subject to change, while others are not, but, nevertheless, this is an exciting and exciting trip. <br /> <br /> Of course, we donâ€™t know for sure, the story can be changed by time travel, because time travel has never happened and, unfortunately, it never will. But it seems logical to me that if you could physically put yourself into the past, you could physically prevent something, if you weren't spinning like crazy, screaming about murder. <br /> <In my opinion, one of the invariably interesting things about time travel movies and TV shows is the method by which time travel takes place. There really is no method here, our main character talks about time travel in a posh gentlemen's club, and then goes outside and begins to blossom from the early 1960s to the mid-1860s, but this does not matter. Until now, the twilight zone has not hit me with its sophisticated kits or high performance. <br /> <br /> Russell Johnson plays the role of Peter Corrigan, the time traveler, and found that he was somehow transferred back to the exact day of the murder of Lincoln, he manages to throw himself in jail, but fortunately for him John Wilkes Booth, for some reason, just hung out at the police station and overheard the insane Corrigan, who was desperately trying to describe the murder itself, which Bout had planned for that night. <br /> <br /> Booth asks Corrigan's custody for some psychiatric experiments, and the policeman sees nothing wrong with abandoning custody of this guy. After all, he had a business card, how bad could he be? <br /> <br /> It looks like the show shows that you can change people's lives by slightly changing past events while traveling in time, and while not wanting to agree that time travel involves such restrictions, it's still a funny episode that really makes you wonder what is one of my favorite qualities of good shows in the twilight zone ...
