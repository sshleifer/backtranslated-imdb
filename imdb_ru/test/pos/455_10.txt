I really like this movie. The first time was at Turner Classic Movies. All the actors did very well, but Brynner played the show again, as always (he's so sexy!). This is one of the movies in which you see Brynner's emotions. In fact, this film is the first time I saw him laugh, because he plays very strong, serious and serious roles in other films. In this film, you see the masculine, tough, and sensitive side of Brynner. In this film, Brynner seems like a "ladies' man." It's amazing how Brynner eats a glass cup and speaks Russian, it drives me crazy to love. I donâ€™t understand when both Brynner and Kerr (both of them have very good chemistry) are shot together in a movie, and then Brynner always dies in the end, it somehow reminds you of "The King and Me."
