Just watched it and it was awesome. There were serious doubts about renting a DVD or not. So, if you ... and like to watch other brainless action movies ... do not hesitate. Don't let the boring cover push you away. Script is one of the best ever. Intelligent, funny, original, touching and keeps you on the edge of space throughout the film. I already watched another movie right before this and was really sleepy, and usually I get bored watching the second movie in one night, but this one really made me wake up and I didnâ€™t have any boring moments. It also made me rethink many things in life and gave me a really good feeling. <br /> <br /> In addition, a great game (one of the best roles of Kevin Spacey). The visual effects are beautiful and the use of music is very well chosen. If I have to come up with something negative to say about it ... well ... I can't find anything ... Enjoy! 10 out of 10
