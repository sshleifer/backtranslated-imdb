Of course, I am a bit prejudiced, but at that time it was the most accurate image of the Marine Corps ever shown on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I was at Camp Pendleton, where I was training for the infantry, when Webb led his team to filmed several scenes in the open air, and our company was invited to participate. As I recall, it took about two or three days. <br /> <br /> Webb and Don Dubbins were serious and business people. <br /> <br /> During the shooting of our short scene, which seemed to take forever the 18-year-old - Webb very diligently approached things (sea things), and he coped well with one exception - the scene where the recruit wore sunglasses . It never happens for a variety of reasons. <br /> <br /> I have a video of the film and I will tire my grandchildren any time when I can make them sit still for a few seconds while I show them my dad when he was a little Stud and some of the greatest combat power in the world (without boasting, just a fact). <br /> <br /> I was amazed at how well the real marines played their acting roles. That was before I realized that JI must have acting genes to do his job. <br /> <br /> The only film I have seen since it is equal to DI is the first half of Full Metal Jacket, and this part is superior only because of obscene language. When the DI was done, the curse was not allowed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite the absence of profanity, this film can still be rented. <br /> <br /> Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! or die
