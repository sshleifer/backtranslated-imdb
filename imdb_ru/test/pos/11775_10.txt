Tell us about your classics! Ernie Fossilus (“Foss”) has developed a cute and creative trailer that completely fakes Star Wars. This gem is so packed with tributes and gags that I laugh every time! Not only that, when Star Wars reissued new special effects, hardware wars did the same! Talk about a parody that just won't die! There is a reason George Lucas calls this his favorite parody. He was so impressed that he even hired Foss to work on Returning the Jedi (do not believe me, check his IMDb entry!) <br /> <br /> This should be first, and in My opinion, the best parody of when or made. I think the Special Edition was a bit exaggerated, but if you think about it, I think it’s perfect for a modern reissue of Star Wars and proves that it is sometimes wrong to improve. > Yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> You will laugh, you will cry, you will kiss $ 3 bye! Well, maybe 15 for a DVD, but you will be very happy you did.
