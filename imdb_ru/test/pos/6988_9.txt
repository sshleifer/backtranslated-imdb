If you are a science fiction fan and have only seen this movie once, PLEASE go and treat yourself to a second viewing. I just did, and I was amazed at how well I thought the film was, unlike when I first saw it three years ago. For the first time, of course, I was struck by astronomical perspectives to which we appeal in this film, but by and large I did not think so much about the film as a whole. It was an alien plagiarism, and I thought that the description of monsters is a case of really bad science. The fact that they were allergic to light was especially funny to me. Based on my first viewing, I recently rated this movie as 5. <br /> <br /> However, now that the sequel to The Chronicles of Riddick is on the way, and the poster for this movie looks amazing, I thought I'd better refresh the show Black again, so I borrowed a video from a friend. I'm so glad I did. Much of what I thought, I remembered from the first viewing, which turned out to be extremely inaccurate. I thought most of the characters died very early in the film. This was not the case. I thought that the character of Claudia Black was the first to die. This was not the case. I thought Riddick was the only survivor. This was not the case. <br /> <br /> Now I see that the movie works * very * well. There is no excessive, tedious attention to monsters. This is much more human drama. The main characters are attractive and capable of some convincing game. And there are so many small details that make the Peck Black universe consistent and believable, such as the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet they fall into, and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet and therefore they turn on each other. <br /> <br /> And I must again mention astronomical perspectives. I mean, we are starting to see a spaceship passing through the tail of a comet, with parts of cosmic dust making their way through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Like the shipwrecked people, they think that it will soon get dark, on the opposite horizon the blue sun rises, and everything is absorbed by the blue radiance. As the eclipse approaches, we see a huge neighboring gas giant rising across the sky, and in the final scene of the film we see the ship glide over one of these rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder, and detail, and I don’t think I’ve seen any other SF film that would really make that point by including these things. I hope that in the future we will see much more than that. <br /> <br /> Pitch Black now receives a rating of 9 out of 10. Is it a cult classic? You bet!
