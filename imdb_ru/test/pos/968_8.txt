Big Fat Liar is a great watch for kids of all ages, even adults. I had a great time watching this movie and recommend it to children from 10 years and under. The laughter never ends, and the adventure story is also pretty good! Frankie Munis is hilarious, and Marty Woolf is hilarious! In general, a beautifully made film for children, so that they can enjoy and just have a great time.
