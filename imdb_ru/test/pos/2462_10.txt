The era of the Vietnam War, of course, was much earlier than my time, but it always interested me, and I saw many films about it. Everyone else I saw dealt only with the front of the battle. When I read the description of War at Home, I found this concept intriguing. Not a single film about the Vietnam War that I have ever heard of was ever told about what happens to a soldier when the fighting ended. <br /> <br /> One night, watching the channels, the film was aired on The Sundance. I put down the remote and sat back down to watch it. I did not move from my seat for the entire two hours; This is one of those films that interests you very much, because there is no way to predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> This movie made me a big fan of Emilio Esteves. I really liked him, like Billy the Kid in the films “Young Guns”, but I never saw anything that he did afterwards. Emilio was very talented in writing and directing, and in acting. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is very well done. I find it hard to think about the point where it pulls. <br /> <br /> What surprises me is that he did not receive an Oscar or any real recognition when he came out. This is a dramatic story about parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not who he was before and will probably never be the same as they remembered him again. Definitely worth a look.
