17/02/09 “More” (1969) Director: Barbet Schroeder <br /> <br /> For a film that most viewers agreed was rather average, I am impressed with how many different interpretations were offered for him, I only briefly I searched the network, and I was already told that “More” is a 19th century novel, a hint of Icarus history, a simple film full of boring people, and interest only for Pink Floyd ended. Therefore, it is fair to say that the critical technique is mixed. I would say that these wildly scattered readings of the directorial debut of Barbet Schroeder in 1969 are sufficient proof that “More” is not an ordinary film at all. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not a masterpiece. I approached Moru in the same way as Antonioni's “Easy rider” and “Blouap” - like the film “Time Capsule”, a snapshot of the era - despite the differences in tempo, style and content between these films. All of them have similar flaws - either vague or completely unbelievable characters, actions that seem slightly far from reality, easy editing and sharp endings that cause outrage among viewers. These films never try to be persuasive or meet the audience halfway - they are what they are, dude. In itself, this is not a problem if we have a souvenir with experience. Fortunately, “More” offers viewers a few truly memorable images, sounds, and sentences, and this is what saves him. <br /> <br /> Stephen is a young man who came to Paris recently after studying in Germany. The first part of the film follows him when he meets with a group of French hipsters, accompanying them to incredibly cool and shy parties and bars before meeting Estel. These two characters are becoming sexually and romantically involved, and he promises to follow her to Ibiza, contrary to the advice of his friend Charlie. This is where Icarus comes into play - she is the Sun, he is chasing her. Now you can guess how it all ends. <br /> <br /> Ibiza is an idyll, so far from the hustle and bustle of overcrowded Paris, that the naive Stefan knows that he must be ready for good. Estelle remains elusive and chaotic, and the island has a less coveted belly. Until now, I had little concern for any of these characters and their focused desire for something to be truly free, but as soon as the action comes down to these two, the film suddenly becomes sharp. During just one thoughtful exchange of dialogues in a remote villa where they live, in a place where their changing love crystallizes, I went from observation with fading optimism to complete admiration. I can not remember many other films in which it was made. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Stefan and Estel is real and human in the sense that we can see how they move from life-determining closeness to disappointment and cruel coldness. They take a lot of drugs and jump naked on terraces, rocks and beaches. Their lives revolve around nothing but each other and beautiful Mediterranean surroundings. For a time, their situation itself is the essence of freedom, emotional openness and experience. But Stefan does not control the situation, and this fall is not only his future in Ibiza. <br /> <br /> Pink Floyd's rating is perfect for the exotic, intimacy and premonition of “The Sea”. This is one of the most memorable inclusions, as well as a mosquito net around Estelle’s bed and their hallucinogenic abundance around the mill ). The scene in which they take acid to escape from heroin abstraction illustrates the fundamental shortcomings of the couple - they cannot “land” without an accident. Maybe they got too close to what they wanted. <br /> <br /> Stefan never contacted either his family or his friends before his arrival in Paris. It remains for us to assume that they have no idea where he is. While other films about the counterculture of the 1960s are devoted to debauchery, extravagance, the media and voyeurism, Schröder instead presented us with a story focused on one person who hid in some corner of the world and quietly disappears.
