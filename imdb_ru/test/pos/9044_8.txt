This is a 1972 Disney movie. At that time I was eleven years old, and I fully enjoyed this film. Feeling nostalgic, I bought three series of DVD films about Dexter Riley, and even now, at the age of 46, I still liked them. It was all about fantasy, magic and pure fun. And it still is! I was not sure which of the three films came out first, then the second and last. So now I have official dates. On December 31, 1969, tennis shoes were on the computer - on July 12, 1972 you now see him, but now you don’t — February 6, 1975 is the most powerful man in the world. I still think the average movie was the best. The special effects were amazing in 1972 for us children. I definitely recommend it to all ages.
