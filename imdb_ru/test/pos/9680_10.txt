Being a Russian myself, it is sometimes difficult for me to find jokes about American broadcasters or celebrities. In addition, “Family Guy” is the most intelligent, funny and politically incorrect show on earth. The voice acting is great and sounds clear enough even for not speaking English like me to understand. The animations are good too, maybe even too good for a TV show. Here we have the equivalent of an adult swimming channel, but nothing there simply compares to this precious stone. Even the Simpsons or South Park. Hope that the creators will continue to entertain and entertain us. I do not want to see how all this turns into mediocre entertainment.
