I really liked this film, it completely reminds me of my school years. The soundtrack is awesome. I'm a big fan of the cage, and this is my favorite movie in which he is being shot. I like the storyline, it's a complete love story, no matter what. I think that anyone who graduated in the early eighties (1980-1984) should watch a movie. This completely brought back memories of high school.
