I tried to understand why I liked this movie? This is not because of the money spent on it, that's for sure !! Did I see a painted water gun there? Maybe in Scotland they have no similar houses with visual effects? Or maybe they just had no money? The creation clearly shows a gang of very brave guys making the film against all odds. Awesome! But what I really liked was the gist of the gigs. Mike Michell and Patrick White play the lead roles as 2 normal guys. There is no Hollywood story. <br /> <br /> Good, so the effect doesn't work very well. Spaceships just don't look as good as they should in today's FX world, and I have seen much better free stuff on YouTube. But the film is very well kept, as soon as they get on the Planet. Was it shot in Scotland or just a Scottish team? Or is it just the best effects work? Did they edit the water? By the end, I loved this movie and was disappointed when they all died.
