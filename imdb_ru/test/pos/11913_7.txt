Toy Soldiers is the story of how five losers (especially Shaun Astin, Wil Wheaton and Keith Coogan) try to save their school from terrorists invading after the American government imprisons its father. Lou Gossett Jr. plays the headmaster, a stubborn guy who tries to instill in his students a sense of discipline. <br /> <br /> “Toy Soldiers” is a fun and pretty cool action, and certainly better than films about the hostage crisis in school. I think most of the appeals come from teenage actors, but also the terrorists don't seem to be completely useless, while in some films they never look as scary as they should be. Trapped in a boarding school and the threat of being killed if the military or the police intervene, this is a very difficult task for this group of guys who are planning to save the school. They are actually quite smart about it. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that it was a pretty good movie. He maintains a steady pace and does not become ridiculously sentimental or something like that. Astin and Gossett Jr. give good results. <br /> <br /> I also agree that this is an underrated fighter.
