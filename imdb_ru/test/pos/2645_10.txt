It was such a wonderful movie. It was made with such a beautiful design, such symmetry. I like how classical music is connected with the classical art of the earth, the cosmos and not only. It was such a quick and thoughtful masterpiece. I liked how monoliths never changed, although primacy, earth and space changed. I liked the way it was the question “Do you need us now?” The film expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, refinement, gentleness, courage and innocence. What else can you ask for from a simple movie? Perhaps the addition of the film. Any connoisseur of 2001: “Space Odyssey” will find the film “2010” - an addition to the 2001 film. 2010 is more history-oriented than 2001.
