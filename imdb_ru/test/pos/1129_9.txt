Until now, I watched two episodes, I really like it. Although I no longer study in college, it makes me miss the beautiful student life. I would like me to spend a little more time in communication. I identify with rusty. When I was in a hurry to brotherhood, my elder brother was not at all like Cappie, I would like me to have such an elder brother like him. So if such a show can really make people identify with the characters, then this is a pretty good show. <br /> <br /> This is more realistic than the American pie with less explicit sexual jokes. Can we also call it the younger version of "desperate wives"? some of the authors must be the Greeks themselves, the story seems to reflect some real life of fraternity and sorority. This was shot in high resolution. And they actually shot outside, not inside the studios. so the picture quality is very good. They could easily make this movie good. Unlike the film, which can last only a few hours, I can have about 45 minutes of fun, watch it for free on TV weekly. <br /> <br /> The cast is great, the actors are about the right age, and they are new and fresh, so this makes them more real. This show is about almost everyone. The show also involves Asian and black boys and girls from the female society. It is almost a little shocking that they had a little story about two frat guys who had sex in the first episode and then tried to connect again in the second episode. I do not think I have seen something like this on TV before. This show somehow reminded me of a Warner bro teens show called Young Americans, which was canceled in early 2001. In this show, the girl who dressed like a man kissed a guy, and that guy thought she was a homosexual man. . <br /> <br /> Greek life can be fun, but at the same time, students should prepare for exams, and so on; by the time people really have some free time in their lives, they no longer have fraternity to join them. I do not know how long this show will last; sooner or later these people will also have to “graduate” from college. Perhaps they will find new actors for another 4 years of fun student life!
