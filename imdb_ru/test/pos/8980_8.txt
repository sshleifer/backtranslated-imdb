Said in a flashback, the film opens in 1989, when Charlie receives an award for his role in the defeat of communism. I have to admit that my heart has fallen, since at the thought that he must endure another serious, somewhat boring and long life story. As far as I was wrong, because this short scene is as close as the film gets boring. <br /> <br /> The film is full of entertaining and amusing scenery and stunning dialogue in the most unexpected places. The next scene after the awards ceremony is Charlie in the Jacuzzi with several naked women and a guy trying to get him to invest in a television program. Another pretty funny scene, about 3-quarters of the film, includes Charlie, a group of his pretty sexy secretaries, CIA employee Philip Seymour Hoffman and a bottle of whiskey. As for the dialogue, what about this for the line: "The senator says that he can teach us how to print, but he cannot teach us how to grow boobs." Well, schoolboy, I know, but the film is riddled with wonderful lines. <br /> <br /> With regard to good performances, Philip Seymour Hoffman, as usual, steals every scene in which he plays. Hanks is fine, but, surprisingly, in any case, Julia Roberts is very good at playing the rather eccentric Texas oil millionaire. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilsonâ€™s War is one of the best biographical photographs not owned by a musician in a long time, and also a rarity in a film that entertains, cheers and informs everyone equally.
