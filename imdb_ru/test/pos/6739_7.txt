This is a slightly funny comedy about coming of age, coming from a later, more mature period of writing by Neil Simon. Despite the fact that there are many wise men who can be circumvented, this is not one of those plays by Neil Simon, where each character presents one-line jokes for 2 hours, as if they are guest stars in a special edition of Bob Hope. There are also dramatic elements (some works, some unnecessary) that give weight to the story. <br /> <br /> Good performances in all directions, especially Blythe Danner as a mother (although she and Judith Ivy were oddly a WASP-ish choice for Jewish women). I have never been a fan of Jonathan Silverman, but I will say that he gets into the right notes as a disgusting, awkward and completely horned narrator / adolescent hero of this story. <br /> <br /> In its tone, the film is very similar to Woody Allen's Radio Days, but the latter is much more creative and fun than this one.
