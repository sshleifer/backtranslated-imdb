I personally found the movie great. I did this on pre-order for a month and watched it twice a day when I received it by mail, and several times since ... Yes, the intervals may be a little longer, but the rest of the film clearly compensates for this, All cast, but acting was right for every role. The plot itself is just ... haggard! There is no other way to describe it. Who makes a film about how someone is being bullied? Bam, that's who. Genius. Just a genius. Two thumbs up. I would be honored to work with him any day, any time, with any thing.
