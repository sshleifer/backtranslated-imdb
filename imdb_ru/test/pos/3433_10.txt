First of all - I almost never watch Swedish films, and this is the second time in my life when I watch Swedish movies in movies! Therefore, I believe that this is one of the best Swedish films ever! The combination of thrill and humor is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you donâ€™t even know whether you should get scared or just laugh! The plot of this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after World War II and help the Germans start all over again. On the way to Germany, he tries to help his friends on the train, but this is a bad idea. What an awkward moron! And poor Robert Gustafsson - a wounded soldier - always interferes ... OH !!! But he still got his great mood. Positive guy In recent years, Robert Gustafsson has shot some less wonderful films, and this is really a relief. He is great in this movie. In the end - this is one of the best Swedish films ever, and Peter Dalle did a great job! Congratulations!
