"Walking with dinosaurs" is absolutely gorgeous in all respects. Kenneth Branagh tells you to listen. The screenplay of a documentary really sounds like researchers and writers have done their homework, itâ€™s so insightful, and it will hook you and never let go. The music is also great, very dramatic when necessary. But the visuals and scenery make this documentary so good. The landscape is breathtaking, and dinosaurs look so real thanks to simply amazing effects. It is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults, but also children. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this is a must see. Not only did I love it, but this is probably the best documentary I've ever seen. In any case, it could have been done longer, except that it is perfect. 10/10 Bethany Cox
