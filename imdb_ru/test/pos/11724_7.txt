Bert Reynolds’s counterstrike to Clint Eastwood, who attempted to play his comedy lawn with his orangutan comedies, was to create his own “Dirty Harry” in the Sharqi-style Chicago thriller. Originally intended for John Boorman, but in the end, the director of the star itself, this is a complete commercial package with the people's commissar Reynolds, who was taken to the vice-detachment (literally - they are in the basement), who is sent to nail the mysterious criminal lord as the next governor. You can guess the rest, but although Reynolds sometimes loses sight of history, he is well versed in certain scenes and almost gets an idea from Rachel Ward as a high-class prostitute to whom he belongs. The romantic plot is extraordinarily well developed, there are a couple of good action films and some nice touches, such as the double of the villain Vittorio Gassman in the mirror image of the hero or Reynolds and the murderer, who are looking at a witness from neighboring apartments in the same house. building. One of the best movie stars of his glory days, this is not a classic, but it makes a more than effective Saturday night special.
