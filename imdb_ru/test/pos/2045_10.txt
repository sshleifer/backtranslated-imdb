I'm a lifelong Gina Davis fan because of this movie. I have always loved Samuel L. Jackson. And these two make an excellent pair on the screen. Nevertheless, I think that TLKG is the best fighter I've ever seen, forget about the surprises that viewers expect now, and that the directors are now trying (mostly failing) to include them in their films. <br /> 10/10
