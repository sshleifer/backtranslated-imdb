I work in a cinema, and every Thursday night we have a screening of one film, which comes out the next day ... Today it was The Guardian. I saw trailers and commercials and never expected much from it, and in no way expected to see this movie. Well it turns out that this film was much more than I would have thought. It was a great story first. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner did an amazing acting job in this film. Being a big fan of the '70s Show, it was always hard for me to think of Kutcher as someone other than Kelso, despite the great game he played in “The Butterfly Effect”, but after watching this film I think finally see him as a serious actor. <br /> <br /> It was also a great tribute to the memory of the unsung heroes of the US Coast Guard.
