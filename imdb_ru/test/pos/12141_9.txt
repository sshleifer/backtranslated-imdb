Classe Tous Risques (“Big Risk”) is a French gangster film that does not strive for style. That is why he has a style. Because the film is so undervalued and so actual, it becomes more and more exciting. And since Abel Davos plays Lino Ventura, we emotionally invest in this silent, tough assassin who loves his wife and children, meets with customs agents at night on the coast near Nice, which neither he nor we expect, and who it turns out he just ready to shoot a cop or a traitor with as little emotion as shaking off a little nap. First, we meet Davos in Italy with his wife and two young boys, one about 9 and one 4. <br /> <br /> “This man was Abel Davos, sentenced in absentia to death,” they tell us. “For years, he watched his resources run out, even though his anxiety made him move. When the Italian police closed every day, France was again his best choice. Maybe they forgot it. ” <br /> <br /> Davos was the main gangster in Paris who cared about his friends. That was a few years ago. The heist to give him money to return to France goes very wrong. Now he is hiding with his two children. He calls his friends in Paris to help him. He and his children have to get from Nice to Paris, but the police are hunting him, and they have established checkpoints. For the two best friends of Davos, time passed, and they went on. They do not want to put themselves at risk, and for what? Obligation gives caution. Therefore, they hire a young thief Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo) to pick up Davos and the children in the ambulance, and then go to Paris with heavily tied Davos and hidden children. We are on a journey where the opportunities for Davos are becoming increasingly limited, where he has to find ways to take care of his children, where he understands that there are no longer any friendships, where betrayal seems likely, and where it is possible that his only friend left Eric Stark <br /> <br /> This somewhat cynical film works so well because it does its job without any fuss. There are no cloaks with tucked-up collars, there is no gangster code melody that many French directors loved so much. The Risk Class gives us Abel Davos, a man who was once someone, who now slides down to anyone, and who reacts with violence and resignation. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura dominates the film, but when he is paired with Jean-Paul Belmondo, there is a curious chemistry. Ventura, like Davos, is gloomy and concerned about taking care of his sons. He is humiliated by his situation. He is a strong man who believes that killing someone, if necessary, is only part of the business in which he is located. Belmondo, as a young thief who is initially sent to be a driver with consumables and ultimately turns out to be a friend to be counted on, provides brightness, keeps the film from another trip down the elevator. Belmondo was 27 years old and he looks younger. His incredible star power as the lead actor - a broken nose, a raised jaw - shines right on the screen. He makes Eric a match for Ventura when they divide the scene. And the scenes of Belmondo with Liliana (Sandra Milo), a young woman who becomes his girlfriend, radiate charm and good-natured sex appeal. The end is a bitter-sweet fate, without a stylistic pose in sight. We hear Davos say, “Abel is gone. Nothing left". It would be nice to see Classe Tous Risques, to understand what he means. <br /> <br /> There are many excellent French gangster films. I would put this one right there with Touches Pa o Grisbee and Bob le Flamberre. To see one of the best performances by Lino Ventura, see The Army of Shadows.
