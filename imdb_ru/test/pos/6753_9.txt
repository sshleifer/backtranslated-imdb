I agree with most of Mr. Rivera’s comments, and I just want to announce a couple of warnings. This film "Talisman" is criminally ignored in its current form. In this respect, as well as "Vampire". "Talisman" is not a "bonus feature" - it is designated as a chapter in "Vampire". Despite the fact that it is quite clear that this is a separate film, the producers had to consider it as such. And while I'm in it, Vampyr also needs some respect and cleaning. I had a feeling that the decision to put Talisman there was something like this. <br /> <br /> Dude A: “We just transferred“ Vampyr ”to DVD, but before that there were about 20 minutes left. We need to put something in there that won't cost a lot of money. Can you believe that film critics want to be paid for talking about movies! "Dude B:" Do not worry. I have this little animation thing that sits in my drawer. Just continue and add it as an extra chapter. "Dude A:" You're awesome, Dude B. "The Talisman animation is great and I don't need to repeat what Mr. Rivera did so well. However, this thing needs some serious cleaning and restoration, especially audio. The plot is traced in the dialogue. And in my copy there were so many hiss, crackles and places where the sound just disappeared (I would not have guessed that the dog was going after he hadn’t read the box.) and made hissing and hissing louder. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: Starewicz films should be placed in a respectable collection, cleaned, wiped, liner notes and nine yards in other words. five.
