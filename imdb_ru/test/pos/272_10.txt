Children from Stepford, besides the fact that they are very well made for television films, show a very alarming result of ideological processing. It is quite a statement about how to get to act within the framework of what is considered “good” behavior, can destroy everything that makes a person unique and individual. I think this is a film that parents who want to preserve some kind of thought that hangs over the hearts and minds of children should watch with their children and discuss what the film says. I don’t know if this was somehow the goal of this film, but I have always been of the opinion that this is one of the best films against the desire to make children meet an unrealistic and domineering claim to what happens in the film. the best interests of anyone other than the interests of the children themselves. I hope one day to see this movie on DVD. I'm at the starting gate ... waiting.
