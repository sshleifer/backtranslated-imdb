this movement was intriguing and exciting; however, the story was a bit choppy and sometimes difficult to follow. Although the two main actors have done an excellent job, just seeing how Senn Penn is shot in every cell of his being and steals every frame makes this film very memorable. Later films showed that he is not just an actor with one role: he also showed comedic talent in Sweet and Low. Surprisingly talented and not as easy as I used to think. /
