When I watched this film at the age of 6, it was in the KIDS section on Erols Video, because it was an animated film. We watched it, and it was a completely different ball game! Very cruel history and graphic deaths are VERY interesting and irresistible, but not for children. Avoid family viewing, my mother almost had a heart attack, and he ripped the video apart!
