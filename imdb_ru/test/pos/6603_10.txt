My son, an avid skateboarder, sat me down and made me watch with him. Since I like documentaries, it did not require much pressure from him. The whole amazing story of all this - a bunch of poor children drift together and ultimately creates something revolutionary from nothing - well, more from wood, wheels and the lack of surfing waves - it just infuriated me. It still does. I did not think I would enjoy it the way I did, nor did I think that I was bursting, watching Stacy Peralta burst because of the fate of Jay Adams. And just looking at Jay Adams himself ... at the obvious genius of skating a child and shrugging an adult. Last night I watched him again, and I still get goosebumps, watching him fly down the slope, and Jimi Hendrix's Freedom plays in the background. And I came to myself again. Not too many films have the same effect on me after a few views. Brilliant.
