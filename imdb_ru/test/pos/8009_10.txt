I like the full house and step by step the same. I don't have a favorite episode, I just like certain scenes. but I donâ€™t like some of the scenes, but I have to say that the reason I started watching this show is that it was Suzanne Summers. and my favorite character was Dana. and Karen could sometimes be a snob, but she was also a good character. I just love watching family shows instead of trash, which is a lot of drugs and violence. This show is very similar to other family shows, where one of the parents always strictly observes curfew and dates. except step by step, my other favorite shows are the full house, the teenage witch Sabrina, Homer Pyle Usmts, the show of Andy Griffith and the dukes of Hazzard.
