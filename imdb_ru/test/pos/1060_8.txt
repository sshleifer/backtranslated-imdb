Personally, I don’t like a lot of b / w movies, but there’s something magical about this movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stenvik). “Liz” writes in a journal column that she is “Martha Stewart” from Connecticut. Of course she lies. This becomes a problem when its publisher, Mr. Yardley, asks her to take over a navy sailor for Christmas. In addition, Mr. Yardley, who will be alone at Christmas, invites himself to the farm for a Christmas party. From there, everything just goes crazy. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds on a farm in New England, he has a warm weekend. Plus, the characters are funny. Mr. Yardley always shouts out orders, and a friend Liz Felix always shouts, "Disaster!" When something goes wrong. Finally, the movie ends the way a Christmas movie should end; cheerful fat man laughs and shouts "What a Christmas!" <br /> <br /> In short, no matter how old you are, you will love this movie.
