I inserted a DVD, expecting perversions in the camp from the creators of the Society and the Resuscitator, and was very surprised that I was embroiled in a truly tense story. The acting was top notch (it's nice to see Vosloo as the main character after a long line of villains), the storyline with participation, and a few turns pretty amazing. I thought that I would have sped through most of this to get to the abduction scenes, but instead watched it just by letting it down at the very end. <br /> <br /> Maybe I’m too indulgent, but as I said before, I didn’t expect much more than alien sex. Of course, if you are looking for some hot alien sex, you will be disappointed. Basically it was nonsense from a fast examination table with a glimpse you miss and an interesting alien.
