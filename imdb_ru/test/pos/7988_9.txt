When I first rented "The Return of Batman," I immediately thought that this would not be entirely exceptional. I mean that Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without it, how could there be a good movie? Just add Danny DeVito. <br /> <br /> Batman’s return is perhaps a darker movie than Batman. There are more villains, less relevant dark comedy in many aspects and more nervous problems. However, the music is similar to the first, if not darker. The landscape is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail right up to the time of year. This film is made in the same comic format, which we loved in the first “Batman”. <br /> <br /> Now about the performances. Michael Keaton, fortunately, returns in the role of Batman / Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first movie and in the same way in this sequel. Keaton didn’t have enough time to screen, as Batman needs more! Danny DeVito made the award-winning Penguin play, the most grueling, disgusting, attractive, evil, evil, sad, pitiful villain who ever adorned the superhero film. You hate him so much, but at the same time you feel him so badly. And this explains it to the last detail, which makes it even more controversial. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman / Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. In fact, she also got a lot of stories. Christopher Walken did not disappoint Max Shrek, the greedy, judgmental, selfish CEO of a power company. Michael Gough also, fortunately, is returning as sweet Alfred, and he was just as good here. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, although I feel that he has never really been the center of attention. <br /> <br /> With lots of great twists and background scenes, Batman Returns will surely please any fan of the original. <Br /> <br /> 9/10
