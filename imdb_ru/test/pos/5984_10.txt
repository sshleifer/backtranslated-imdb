This is one of my favorite movies; amazing comedy; so I was very pleased to know that he would be released on DVD in the UK in September 2007. <br /> <br /> Romuald, played by Daniel Otey, is the president of a rich dairy company. Juliet, played by the excellent Firmin Richard, cleans the company's Paris offices. Juliet, a dark-skinned mother of several children, discovers a plot against Romuald, who initially ignores her attempts to warn him. He slowly understands what this charming girl from the Parisian lower class is trying to tell him. â€œHe seeks refuge in her crowded apartment, because his marriage and career are crumbling. Incredible love blooms. Cultures collide in a truly delightful carefree comedy.
