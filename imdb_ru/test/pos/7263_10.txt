I usually hate periodic movies. Living in England is a real nightmare if you are allergic to historical dramas, which I do. However, this is the best. It doesn't take itself seriously, and Johnny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are great together, Liv Tyler is also good, although her English accent is boring !! <br /> <br /> The film has everything for someone who just wants to go to the movies to have fun. This action, adventure, drama and comedy. I'm not sure how well the jokes move across the ocean, but hopefully they will. American viewers would be ashamed to miss this film. This shows that English directors can produce something that is not associated with constant curses and sex. Both have a function in this, but in a balanced format. The camp of Ian Robertson, depicting a well-working gentleman, is magnificent, and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class are very funny! <br /> <br /> In the role of the trailer for the movie “The Spy Who Seduced Me,” Say .... "If you see another movie" ... this spring make it Plunkett and McLean. It's fun, action packed and, of course, Johnny Lee Miller with an English accent for a change!
