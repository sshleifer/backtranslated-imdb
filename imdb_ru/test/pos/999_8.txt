From the very beginning of “The Edge of Love” the viewer is transferred to the amazing world of the Second World War in London. We are following the lives of four people who could only be created for this film, the study of female friendship and the tensions caused by her marriage and infidelity. With the exception of one of the heroes named Dylan Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reaction to the world around him was not only selfish, but sometimes truly despicable. <br /> <br /> This film is based on Thomas’s love and romance writings. They were adapted from the sharp script of Sharman MacDonald (Keira Knightley's mother). Directed by John Maybury claims that the other three main characters were real people. <br /> <br /> All four are very strong. Sienna Miller - Dylan's wife, Keira Knightley - cabaret singer Vera Phillips. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas, and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first part of the film takes place in London during the Nazi air raids, when Vera is pursued by Vilaim, a soldier awaiting deployment. By chance, Dylan meets his first love, Faith. From there, Vera meets Caitlin, the wife of Dylan. While the three are drinking, William successfully breaks the guard of the Faith. <br /> <br /> The film tells about their lives, because Vera and William are married, and he is sent to war. Vera became pregnant and returns to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin. There they face a harsh existence: Faith supports Dylan and Caitlin with the help of her husband’s war. In these times, the friendship of Faith and Caitlin grows. Like the passion of Dylan Faith. She gives up. This creates the first test for two women. <br /> <br /> When William returns from the war, he barely recognizes his wife and has no connection with his young son. The situation worsens when Dylan watches idly as his friend struggles with fatigue on the battlefield (post-traumatic stress disorder). William realizes that something happened between Dylan and Vera, and in a drunken rage shoots Dylan’s house. <br /> <br /> “The Land of Love” begins as a stylish affair in London torn apart by war and ends in the harsh, sandy life of motherhood, infidelity and the attempted murder in Wales. Treatment for PTSD is well done, and you should talk to an American audience. Someday (see Ending). <br /> <br /> Every star has a great moment. Miller, when she jerks the stitches in her head in response to her abortion of another man's child. Knightley and Murphy, when he finally contacts his son. Oh shit, almost all of their scenes are awesome. And Rhys, when he cleans himself on the stand, to send her husband Vera to prison. <br /> <br /> However, the real star of the film is the cinematography of Jonathan Freeman and directed by John Maybury. They seem to understand that no matter how good the story is or how historic is Thomas, two great actresses of our time dominate this film. And they value their scenes with amazing shots. Although this is not the best material for the image, it is a very good movie (much more attractive than "The Dutchess"). It has a visual lyricism that emphasizes the use of Thomas’s poetry. In addition, this is undoubtedly the second best performance of Knightley in her career and, perhaps, the best that Miller has. <br /> <br /> I have always felt a weakness for an Artist in a fight, whether it be Mozart Hulsa or Capote Hoffman. But I was stunned by how little sympathy I felt for Dylan Thomas. His struggle with alcohol is well known. But his antagonism of William and Caitlin to seize his first love, Vera makes him ..... a bad person. <br /> <br /> So is this Academy Award worthy? Clearly not. At least not this year. It will be released on the state side in March 2009, which makes it unacceptable for academies. This is 9 months after the UK release. Between "Atonement," "Miss Pettigrew," and "Return to Brideshead," the United States filled out British plays during World War II. Very bad. This film is better than others except the Atonement. But in this, Knightley's soldier returns, but as the shell of the man who left her.
