I wonder if I can sit in a musical comedy from Russia or East Germany or other countries that for decades have almost always produced propaganda films, anti-fascist films, anti-war films (as this documentary indicates) that simply reflected dark, exhausting times with Stalin and life behind the Iron Curtain. Then it is interesting to see the other side of the coin, clowns and rebels with music on their side, to try to please the masses more often than not to get stuck in socialist life. One film actually seemed quite impressive, called “Jolly Fellows” by the pioneer of a very small group of music filmmakers, Grigory Alexandrov. From the clips that I saw in this film, I would argue that this was one of the only works that really loses its balance and enters the wild, insane, funny mode. But, as this film shows, if you were a director who wanted to have fun, it would be better with a “message”. <br /> <br /> Through an interview, some random quasi-dramatization (such as the Russia / Germany movement, etc., etc.) combining pictures at the censorship table and clips, everyone gets a complete picture of how it was - behind the scenes and on the screen - just to make mass entertainment for the masses. Some of the films (well, most of them, since, apparently, only 14 shown in 40 years in these countries) have contributed a lot to the change, but why really? A person is also drawn into the culture of all of this, how much he is different from the American approach “if it works, make them as long as they are hot”. But at the same time, perhaps because of these repressions, some interesting, funny and (from what I saw) positive films were made. Perhaps they were quite typical of what they were asked to show to the masses, in Stalin’s warm but demanding conditions, like living with tractors. It will be even more juicy story, although, as we show, as it was in the 60s, the latest wave of musical comedies, when rock'n'roll and pop melodies finally hit their air. <br /> <br /> In short, some good things ... but only if you are interested, really. I was shown a film in a documentary class, and half the class fell asleep. So keep in mind, on the one hand, while on the other hand, if you are looking for it, this can be a really useful journey into the history of European cinema.
