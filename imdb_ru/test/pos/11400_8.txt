This is not so much a review, as evidence that it is once again proved that the Academy encourages money, and not artistic achievement. And I must say that I am saddened that this usually artistic and intelligent group of participants imbd came out of the top 250. Boogie Nights - powerful, rough and courageous thanks to the script, direction and action. Very few films can claim this triple crown.
