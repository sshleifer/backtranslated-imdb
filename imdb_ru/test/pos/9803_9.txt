This film was a soulful movie fragment that helped show the dark side of childhood and the little things that shaped who Tom Hank was. Using a very mysterious story, they were able to give you an idea of ​​what really happened to the character Tom Hank in childhood. And although there have never been such scenes as a flying machine, it helped to show that even denial can help tell the truth. With a clear conscience, I could not rate it lower than 9 out of 10, excellent performances of all the actors, and although many may not understand the mysterious ending in which the brother was killed by his stepfather, and Tom Hanks covers up using a contrived story about the aircraft, pay close attention to small details, such as the tortoise that he still has, although his brother has "flown away" with her. Truly, a wonderful part of the movie, and every actor deserves recognition for it.
