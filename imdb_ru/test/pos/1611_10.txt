Are seaside resorts sad, dull places that they always portray, like in movies and novels? Of course, this film, along with the almost modern “Don't Look Now,” portrays Venice as a particularly wretched and decadent tourist trap (for a more carefree approach, see “Just Got Married” with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). I have never been to Venice, I can not say for sure, but it is ideal for this dark, but luxurious performance from Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema. Having watched the film, I would now like to read the book by Roman Thomas Mann, on which it is based (which also inspired the opera by Sir Benjamin Britten). Since I do not know the background, and the film has nothing to do with the plot or the exposition, I can only be surprised at the obsession of Ashenbach (Dirk Bogarde) with young Tadzio. Is he homosexual? Pedophile? Or is his desire for a beautiful youth something more innocent? Perhaps Tadzio reminds him of who he could be, and now he knows that he will never be. Those who complain about the slow pace of this film should stick to car accidents and kung fu: at 2 hours and 15 minutes it is not particularly long, and it moves at a slow, but barely sluggish pace. The film benefits from the delightful music of Gustave Mahler, on which the character of Ashenbach is clearly based. Dirk Bogarde gives a spectacular performance, and the film is decorated with the presence of Silvana Mangano, one of the greatest beauties of Italy, as Tadzio's mother.
