PUBLIC ENEMIES is a kind of return to those gang biographies of the early 1960s, like MOBSTER'S PORTRAIT, MAD DOG COLL and KING OF THE ROARING of the Twenties. Although the film is shot cheaply, it has tremendous energy, and acting, especially Eric Roberts and Frank Stallone, is quite good. Theresa Russell may seem too charming, like a mom, but she has some very good moments. It is worth noting two action scenes: a shootout at the hotel and a machine-gun fight in the middle of the street between Barker and the FBI. Both sequences are well made, and compared to other cheap gangster junkies, such as DILLINGER AND CAPONE, this film is brilliant.
