I mention that there may be a spoiler here, just to be careful about what I’m discussing, although I don’t think I am giving out something important. Any "surprises" are really not important for the success of this film or the ability of the viewer to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Despite some minor flaws, this is a beautiful and very touching film about friendship, time, insecurity and the choices people make in their lives. However, at the same time, it is also a very humorous film, in which small, mostly understated comedy pieces are woven. For most of the film, it develops at a rather slow pace, but it doesn’t seem slow, as the movie draws into it and into the lives of the characters, and at first it’s mostly pretty lighthearted. Some say that much of the film seems slow, but it is such a wonderful image of the lives of such sympathetic characters that it could be watched almost endlessly. As the movie progresses, it becomes more and more emotional and moving to the very end, and the progression is beautifully processed. <br /> <br /> In the end, some characters decide to rob a bank, and although this may be hard to believe, this is irrelevant. This is a great addition to emphasize the love these friends have for each other, while emphasizing humor and adding a little more irony to the film. And although this is hardly original when a bunch of old guys rob a bank, the context and details are quite original, and they do it wonderfully, which makes it rather funny, for example, when Ismet (if I remember correctly) exaggerates his aggressiveness in order to “disguise” the fact that he is old. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the other comedies are quite modest, but still very funny, so I was constantly laughing. <br /> <br /> Actors are probably the key to the film. They give the characters a deep personality and empathy and portray them with great care and warmth. There are small changes or small details of the characters' personalities that are made seamlessly and beautifully. Of course, the film is about the personalities of these characters and how they care and interact with each other. This is so good at them, and if smaller actors had roles, the film could well have failed. <br /> <br /> Gule Gule is not without sadness, but it just provides a full range of emotions and gives you a stronger experience. In fact, the film is so touching and filled with such love from such rich characters that, after all, it is a very sincere, hearty and even happy film, despite its sadness. I could watch it again and again.
