I never read the book by Sarah Water. Although I did not read the book, the 3-hour film is very interesting. An interesting storyline begins with a twisted finale. I have to say these 2 actresses are awesome. Sally Hawkins amazingly successfully portrayed a character in love with his mistress and betrayed by her love. Their romance slowly flourishes as they spend more and more time together. The love scene is very tender and emotional, well played. The end is quite intriguing, and the two ended up together after they passed, which is a blessing. In general, this is a great movie, a very interesting story with excellent characteristics.
