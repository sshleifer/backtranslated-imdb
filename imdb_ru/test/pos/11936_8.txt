Colombian terrorists hold a military school in the United States hostage until their demands are met. Students decide to fight back. Can they do this? <br /> <br /> Stupid premise, but the film really works. When this film was released in 1991, a group of children who fought were on the verge of success: Sean Astin (looks very cute); Wil Wheaton (looks miserable); Keith Coogan; George Perez (a Latin American sign that is very handsome, very muscular and mostly shown only in tight underwear); THOSE. Russell (symbolic black guy) and Sean Phelan. None of them is a very good actor (except for Astin), but who cares? This is a meaningless fighter. The only good performances are Denholm Elliott (with the ball as a director) and Louis Gossett Jr. as dean. <br /> <br /> In addition - there is a lot of action, suspense, explosions and little brains, In other words --- fun! <br /> <br /> Only a complaint (and it is insignificant) - it is too long (there are THREE endings) and a lot of accidental, bloody violence (R rating was well-deserved). However, I really enjoyed it.
