I recently had the pleasure of seeing this emotionally charged film directed by Mani Ratnam at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. I honored this feature with my highest honor of the film festival. Make sure that you do not allow the opportunity to experience this cinematic stone past you ... but be rewarded: this film will make you shed a tear if you belong to a species known as homo sapien! ten !!
