I watched this show before puberty, but still found that it reflects many of the situations that worry us when we are teenagers, although it was a family-oriented show. Until the mid-1990s, he focused more on young people and their situations. <br /> <br /> That's why I loved Step by Step. I mean, he offered situations for all ages and, unlike many shows of this kind, he lived up to expectations. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest; it was not a very funny show, no, but there were some situations in it that you could relate to, but only funnier. <br /> <br /> Patrick Duffy and Susan Sommers had a very good charm. Duffy swayed! Sommers was gentle and really funny. I was in love with Stacy Keegan because she was incredibly sexy (she loved her legs) and witty. But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with his character Cody. He was a man in those days! Oh, memories. At present, this show has not been able to adequately correspond to new generations, and therefore it should be stored in a repository of memories. That's all, just memories. <br /> <br /> Thank you, step by step, for the fact that my puberty has become funnier.
