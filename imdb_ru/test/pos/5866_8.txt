In this short film Daffy Duck there is only one racist joke, in which, basically, when Daffy goes to Black Beauty, this is a black woman. In part, I can understand why this joke was included, because at that time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist, and even discrimination against black people was not illegal. <br /> <br /> Beyond that, In general, Bait Coy is a fun, interesting short film in which Duffy meets characters in books and does things in books. I really liked this short one (despite the other reviewers here). The way Duffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing, but at the same time very funny. Porki is a good edition for the episode, although it was not vital for him to be there. The wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves and in those days, bloodthirsty, terrible animals, which of course they never were (unless they are very hungry). I also liked the style of animation used - and the theme of the episode. <br /> <br /> For people who are totally addicted to Daffy Duck, and for people who donâ€™t mind the occasional racist joke in cartoons, enjoy "A Coy Lure"! <br /> <br /> Available on YouTube .
