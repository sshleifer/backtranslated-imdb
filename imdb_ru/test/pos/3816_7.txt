This film has interested me enough to watch it several times. There are holes in the plot, but leading performers make it work. <br /> <br /> Katherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge) does an excellent job with a 37-year-old woman who sacrificed everything else to become a doctor. She worked for years to earn money to go to medical school. She speaks brilliantly in her residence and is going to pass the exam on the board and realize her dream. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Julia’s sister and son-in-law are killed, and, as a close relative, she is forced to take her niece Amanda (Arlen Aguayo-Stewart) so that she does not become the wards of the state. Amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance. Amanda is so traumatized by the murder of her parents that she became mute. It goes without saying that the 16-hour days of Julia are becoming more caring towards Amanda. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney, a charming neighbor living in their apartment building that enters the life of Julia and Amanda. He is always with a trick or joke to help Amanda deal with her misfortune. Amanda is really starting to warm Kevin up as the film progresses, perhaps more than her aunt. Julia begins to rely on Kevin, who takes on some of Amanda’s care when she tries to cope with the workload and prepare for the blackboard exam. Kevin is always there when a crisis comes for Julia. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Rob and Katherine Mary was great. You keep watching them get together until the end of the movie. Chemistry between Rob and Arlen was good too. Arlene managed to convey quite a lot without words. The plot made Julia and Amanda gradually warm up with each other. You can see how they build relationships as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> We discover that Julia’s sister and son-in-law (Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three employees who intended to share the thefts from the theft. Julia discovers that Meyers was planning to skip the country under false names. The plot is unclear whether Meyers intended to cross their partners twice or were themselves twice crossed. <br /> <br /> In any case, Meyers was killed in his house by two of his former comrades. The killers do not try to extract the microchip's location from Meyers before they kill them. The killers search the house and cannot find their prize. They leave a living witness to their crime, Amanda. Then the killers spend the rest of the film, making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from Julia and Amanda, who have no idea where the prize is. In the end, the killers kidnap Amanda in the hope that she knows something about the whereabouts of the microchip. <br /> <br /> In the end, Julia learns the truth about Kevin. He is an investigator hired to return a stolen microchip. After some difficult moments in the relationship, they manage to save Amanda and send the bad guys. In a predictable ending, all three form a family and together happily move into the future. <br /> <br /> I was struck by serious holes in the plot. Kevin moved to the same house with Julia and Amanda the day after Meyers was killed. How does he know that the microchip is no longer in the hands of murderers? Murderers blithely leave fingerprints at the scene of the murder, without worrying about hiding their identity. The killer, who pretends to be a psychiatrist, reveals Amanda remnants of red paint from the murder scene on the sole of his shoes. He was not shown on the scene of the murder at the beginning of the film. There are other disadvantages too numerous to mention. <br /> <br /> The film could have been much better if the script had been finalized before the shooting. Filling holes in the plot would add little cost and greatly improve the effort.
