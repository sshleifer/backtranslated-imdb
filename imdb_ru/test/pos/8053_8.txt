Born in 1946, I was about eight years old when I first watched this film, and he left a deep impression. Not only scary, but because of the lack of a better word, this film has haunted me for over 50 years. . The only scene that I remember during those 50 years was the murder of a little girl and an indifferent policeman who called her "little n - kid." These words were replaced when the film was shown. recently on television, maybe there are two versions of the film, or someone has been forced to change this heart-rending scene a little. Accurate or not the film played an important role in formulating my opinion of the South, and so far the closest me. We came to the southern city - El Paso. This may seem extreme, but there is a bit more history. When the film was shown recently, it became clear why he had been pursuing me for years. With a newsreel, as the beginning of this film, it seems that what is shown is a fact. The film was shot, presumably, one or two years after the depicted incidents increase its realistic authenticity. Terror in the film is not created by creatures or space aliens, but by people living in our society at that time. The killing of a little girl A recent scan helped clarify the effect he had on my 8-year-old mind. When this film came out, the only school I ever attended attended mostly African Americans. The victim looked like a girl in my class, It was like an actual murder. It made the horrible scene much worse. Perhaps no one would find this review helpful, but it helped me.
