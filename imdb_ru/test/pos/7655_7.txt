"Latcho Drome", or "Safe Journey", is the second film of Tony Gatlif's trilogy about the Gypsy people. The film is a visual description and historical record of the life of Roma in Europe and the Middle East. Despite the fact that the scenes are mainly planned, rehearsed and staged, there is no usual plot line, and the dialogue does not explain the action from scene to scene. Instead, the film allows the viewer to occasionally see, and sometimes even more deeply, see these people in different eras and in different countries, ranging from India, Egypt, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain. /> <br /> The importance of music in gypsy culture is clearly expressed throughout the film. This is a vital part of every event and an important means of communication. Everything they do is expressed by music. Dance is another important activity. Like gypsy music, it is specialized and deeply personal, which they alone can do right. We are given the opportunity to look at their daily activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. Rather, it is evidence of their culture, focusing on the music and dance that they created and which made them unique. <br /> <br /> Mr. Gatlif portrays nomadic groups in a positive way. However, we also witness the rejection, mistrust and alienation they receive from the non-gypsy population. It seems that the culture that they have developed for countless generations and inspired from different countries will disappear, because in ordinary society there is no place for nomadic ways. <br /> <br /> Other films of the trilogy are “Princes” (1983) and Gadjo Dilo (1998).
