“Black Water”, directed and directed by David Nerlich and Andrew Trauki, is very simple to perform, but effective. The film is a low-budget Australian film, which, unfortunately, will not receive the recognition it deserves, because, as far as possible, it is one of the best. Installation is fairly simple; Grace, her husband Adam, and her younger sister Lee tour some mangroves in the Northern Territory when the saltwater crocodile turns their boat around and leaves them stranded in the trees. The whole film is about their survival, while the crocodile is hiding below while waiting for a strike. Unlike Greg McLean's “The Robber” (another horrible movie about crocodiles, released earlier in 2007), “Black Water” is not about the audience having fun guessing who will be eaten next; that three people will get out safely. <br /> <br /> Three unknown actor copes with rather complex roles, given that they were filmed on the spot with a real crocodile instead of computer graphics. Characters act realistically in a situation, and the dialogue seems natural and not imposed. Suspension accumulates throughout the entire film, we don’t see many creatures, but simply knowing that it is close is horrible enough. This is a great place to sit, and is highly recommended if you like the original and (most importantly) scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> 4/5
