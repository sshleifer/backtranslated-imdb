Being raised at the time this film was released probably influenced my surface mind, but it is a good film nonetheless. This is a film about a hostage situation in which a preparatory school participates, to some extent populated by charming adolescent boys who seem unable to get out of trouble. What's bad about it? He has no special effects, but so what? Who needs special effects? The fall of the cinema began around the same time that special effects became popular. Coincidence? I think no. It turned films with potentially good plot and feelings and turned them into a great, harmless light show for innocent children and self-helpers. Well, you know, not all films need special effects. About three-quarters of the top 250 IMDb films have no special effects, but almost all Top Grossing films of all time have some special effects. Think about it: "Star Wars", "TT", "Ghostbusters", etc. All good films, but the rest of the highest-grossing films, as a rule, are replete with food with meaningless stories and lots of sweets. Well, some films do not need any of this junk. <br /> <br /> Sorry for leaving on a tangent, which I usually do, but I was so sick of this junk with special effects. Back to business: Toy Soldiers is just a great movie. I admit, some of the content is a bit banal and ripped off, but well, each movie to some extent disrupts the other. Think of Resovoir dogs. Countless thanksgiving sites dictate the fact that the beloved Quentin Tarentino, which, I admit, I like, copied many, many, many films when creating his first major film Guide Dogs. Many say that the whole plot was taken almost offstage from the scene of the Japanese and Chinese gangster films that Mr. Tarentino loved and probably still loves. Sorry again for the tangent. <br /> <br /> Toy Soldiers is fun. He has complete disobedience from adolescents to unwanted representatives of the authorities, that is, hostage-takers. It's nice to see children take over when they are held for what they donâ€™t want to do. Gosh, teen-inspired insurgency was a key theme for most 80s comedies. In addition, there is tension and the thrill of the characters using firearms and knocking out the bad guys, etc. Plus, there are some emotional moments in the film. When one of the characters dies, the other has to cope and adapt. This is not an ideal acting game, but it is superior to most other jokes. <br /> <br /> In short, Toy Soldiers is exciting, interesting and fun. How dare, exhausted shards, poorly evaluate this film! Shame on you all! <br /> <br /> Personal rating: 8/10
