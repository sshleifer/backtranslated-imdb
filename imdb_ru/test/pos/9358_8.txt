“Crossfire” is by right the well-known noir of 1947, the secret of murder with a strong message. It featured Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Leven and Gloria Graham, and director Edward Dmitrik. We see the murder in the shadows at the beginning, and for the rest of the film, Young, as Detective Finlay, in charge of the case, is trying to figure out which of the three soldiers is responsible for the death, and last but not least, Why. The victim Joseph Samuels (Sam Leuven) is the one whom the soldiers meet at the bar; they go to his apartment to continue their visit, and Samuels is dead. <br /> <br /> I don’t know about 1947, but seeing “Crossfire” today, everyone knows who did it and why at that moment when we saw the suspects. I don't think it was so obvious when these actors were just starting out. Nevertheless, the film contains a big hit due to its powerful play, good direction, cruelty and uncompromising anti-Semitic language. <br /> <br /> Characteristics, including Gloria Graham in a small role - she is a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspected soldiers, in a bar and can provide him with an alibi. Big role in the film belongs to Robert Ryan, but everything is fine. Robert Young is especially effective as a tough but smart police detective. Mitchum is very cute as a soldier trying to help his bewildered friend Mitchell, a lonely man, not sure that he still has feelings for his wife. <br /> <br /> Truly excellent, and you need to see it.
