Uzumaki has an impressive reputation in Lovecraft circles, and now I know why. <br /> <br /> Uzumaki is based on the manga name (which is, incredibly, supposedly better than the film) and follows strange events that precede a typhoon in an isolated Japanese city. I'm not going to tell you about what is happening in this film, because this is a film that you definitely need to watch. I watched it for the first time last night, and I was amazed. He made the list of my best films of all time, and Labyrinth of Pans was the best science fiction film (in the literal and photographic sense) that was released in the last decade. <br /> <br /> This film is very loving by nature without formally having a direct connection with Cthulhu's myths. This was done in the same way that Lovecraft was writing his stories; it radiates power, because the aura “something is not quite here” is amplified through the brooding phase, causing fear and, eventually, terrifying due to subtle progressive changes in the soundtrack and cinematography. This is indeed a “strange tale” for the most part. <br /> <br /> Just awesome.
