Saw the film at the Hollywood Film Festival in October 2004. Mark Robertson ventured to write an extremely complex role for his first film, and it paid off in his film about Kelly Overton. I had a strong feeling that she came from the theater, so I watched her here and ... surprisingly, I'm right. More and more Hollywood actors should follow her example, abandon expensive acting lessons and return to the theater, because only with such training you will be ready for such a trip. Despite all that I can say about the film and the director (and there are a lot of them), I just can't stop talking to people about Kelly Overtonâ€™s masterful performance. No doubt we will see MORE her work. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mark and Kelly on a cheeky movie. Get it in cinemas so that I can attract everyone to watch the movie as soon as possible!
