Immediately after moving to her new cottage in the English country, Hercule Poirot receives an invitation to dinner from Sir Henry and Lady Angkatel, the owners of a large mansion nearby. But the next day one of the guests was found shot dead by the pool, and his clumsy wife keeps a revolver a few steps away from him ... <br /> <br /> This mystery of Agatha Christie is somewhat subtle, although the Killer Plan is still very clever. This is exquisite filming and cinematography, which raises the story to a higher level. This episode basically retains the serious tone of "Five Little Pigs" and "Sad Cypress", but contains darker humor than they. The cast includes perhaps the two most famous actors who worked on the series at this point, Edward Fox (as a butler) and Sarah Miles (as Lady Angkatel), although the outstanding role is given by the dazzlingly beautiful Megan Dodds as her leading Henrietta her personal encounters with Suchet sparkle and are highlights of the film. Oh, and since the English police inspector is really involved in the case, I think they could return Philip Jackson for this. (***)
