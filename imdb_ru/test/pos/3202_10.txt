This movie hit me. It seemed to me that I knew a little about the prison riot in Attica. After seeing this, I see that I did not know anything. The story is told through a relationship between a lawyer and a black prisoner. Both the personal story of these two men and the unfolding drama in the courtroom were exciting. The sequence of memories in prison was amazing. It is hard to believe that these were not documentary shots, it was so real. It was not only a magnificent dramatic performance, but also an incredible lesson in an important chapter of American history. I am with Ebert and Roper. I give him two thumbs.
