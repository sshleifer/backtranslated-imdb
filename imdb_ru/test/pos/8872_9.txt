I thought the interaction between Crystal and DeVito was excellent. The film is rather shot from the wall, but there are a few unforgettable lines. Ramsey in the role of "Mommy" is vulgar and excessive, but also very funny and effective. A character MUST be terrible, why would anyone else think about the death of his mother? Now Krystal's wife is a “whore” that everyone would like to get from her, so her role, although insignificant, is also effective because she has to justify the ridiculous case of Krystal “writer's block”. Although, of course, there are dark moments, the film is not depressing and, despite the fact that the main characters feel suicidal impulses, they also have redemptive qualities. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of the funniest films that I can remember, one that I don’t mind watching several times.
