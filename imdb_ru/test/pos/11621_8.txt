The film "... and the Earth did not devour it", based on the book of Thomas Rivera, is a stunning film for most people. It tells about the exploitation that migrant farmers undergo in order to survive. <br /> <br /> Sergio Perez uses impressionistic techniques to portray Rivera's story. He uses sienna and grayscale effects to portray some scenes, and he uses special photographic techniques to make the scenes look like they did in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Perez also gives life to the film using music that fits in with the time, including ballading and playing the guitar. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this is a good film to watch, as it shows in detail how migrant farmers live, what they do for fun and what their beliefs are.
