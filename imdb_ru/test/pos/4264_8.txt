This documentary is about the 2001 Gothenburg events. In the Swedish media, demonstrators were portrayed as criminals who advocated anarchy and violence. This film shows that no, in fact they are smart, well-articulated people who have something to say - and they say it with the power of a brick. They believe in a better world, a world in which people can think and say what they want - without focus. But are their beliefs in the ability to change society realistic? I think not. <br /> <br /> This documentary gives us insight into the issues of greed, capitalism and the future it can bring. This is a great documentary that is not propaganda because it is not shown, because what they say is correct. All that he shows is what some people think, and the viewer has to decide whether he is doing or defending what he is doing and defending. <br /> <br /> I heard that many people call this propaganda and therefore choose not to look at it, I think they make a bad decision, because even if you sympathize with the police or the convictions of the demonstrators, all that you get - it's more facts you can rely on, for example, the guy who shot, says he thinks it's good to throw bricks at McDonalds window, because this is the step between thinking and doing the way you think. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film made me mad because you cannot ignore the fact that several policemen who fought violence with violence were not convicted or even detained, although there is evidence that they threw bricks on a demonstration march (and in some cases beat people with a baton, even if they lay outside without resistance), where it is good as soon as they can. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10 - Very good, but not better!
