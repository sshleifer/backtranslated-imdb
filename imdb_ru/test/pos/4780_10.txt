It was the first Mickey Mouse cartoon and the first cartoon with sound. In the cartoon, Mickey does not yet wear gloves. He still does not say either. All he does is whistle and play music. The song he plays is Turkey in the Straw, using several farm animals as musical instruments. For example, he plays the cow's teeth like a xylophone and pulls the nursing pigs like an accordion keyboard. I recorded this cartoon on the Disney Channel and I think it's great. It was based on the silent film starring Buster Keaton titled "Steamboat Bill Jr."
