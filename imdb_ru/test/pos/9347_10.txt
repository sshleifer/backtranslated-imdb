The first music video I've ever seen, Thriller, my mom told me that she took me home from the hospital, and when we arrived, my sister had MTV on TV, and Thriller played, my mom said that I smiled . Stupidly, I know, but from that day I loved Michael Jackson, the Thriller music video inspired me to dance, but I still remember this dance. I even performed it for the audience 3 times! Words cannot describe the power of this song, which makes you want to sing and dance, but Michael, of course, had to raise the bar for MTV at that time, signing a contract with American Werewolf in London, director John Landis and directing the only Thriller. <br /> <br /> Michael and his date, Ola Ray, have finished burning in a dark wooded area. They go into the forest, and Michael asks her if she wants to stay calm. She accepts and he gives her a ring. However, he warns her that he is not the same as the other guys, in fact, not the same as the other guys. The full moon appears, and Michael begins to frantically suffer ?? turning into a terrible werewolf! His date screams and runs away, but the werewolf catches up, knocking her down and begins to rush at her with her claws. The scene ends at the cinema, where Michael and his date actually watch this scene in the movie "Thriller." Michael smiles, but his date is scared and says she is leaving. Michael catches up with her and says that this is just a film, but she does not like his jokes, and she starts to leave. Michael and his date then go down the foggy street, and he teases her with Thriller's opening verses. They walk past a cemetery where corpses suddenly begin to rise from their graves when Vincent Price performs his rap. Michael and his date are surrounded by zombies, and suddenly Michael himself becomes a zombie. Michael and the undead perform a complex song and dance number, followed by a Thriller choir. <br /> <br /> Thriller is probably the best music video of all time, the funny thing is that people who want to argue with other Michael Jackson videos, but what makes Thriller so special is the dance, the story, the effects, this at that time it was the most expensive music video of its day. Michael, of course, raised the bar again with his famous music video Scream, and then again with Ghosts. But tell me what you want, Michael was the star of the 1980s, there was no such celebrity as he, he loved life, he lived it, breathed it and hugged it. Thriller is proof that he wanted to work to make the best, and this is what we got with the legend, which is Thriller. <br /> <br /> 10/10
