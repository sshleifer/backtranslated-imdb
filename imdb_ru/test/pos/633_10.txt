Man, I never laugh so hard this year, and it's pretty hard for me to make me laugh. While I was expecting a hostel-style movie, I had a smile from the very beginning. This film in the film shows a woman slaughtered by a “victim” who idle the whole set until she finally “dies”. Her excessive attraction to directing and his funny reaction tell us viewers that Mute Witness is not a typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> The main character, dumb American makeup artist Billy Hughes, plays a beautiful but talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. Her performance is top notch; her character cannot speak, so body language and the emotions on her face should compensate for this. Oh boy, she did a wonderful job. Her sister (Fay Ripley) is a friend, a bride or the wife of a “director” (Evan Richards). They were both very funny most of the time. I won't spoil anymore, but the scenes that follow the moment in the bathroom, with the two of them, the fake cops, and then the evil neighbor, were just a brilliant black comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot is distorted near the end, it is possible to mislead at one particular moment. But don't worry. You can watch such a tasty film in the family or with your boyfriend / girlfriend / friend.
