Extremely down-to-earth, well-made and current "Rodeo" Western. There was no need to give stars, as all the actors were ordinary people telling the real story about their parents and their surroundings in the west of the 60s and 70s. But I take off my hat to Slim Pickens for what he gave me, it seems to me, a signature, especially considering the fact that he was a clown-rodeo in real life. His role went far beyond the simple role of a clown, as he deeply understood all the ups and downs of the tough rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so often surrounds such a lifestyle. He and Mr. Koburn have teamed up very well as partners, not only on the track itself, but also in the real world outside the pen. Also, check out Ann Archer as Coburnâ€™s love for the last part of the film. Must be one of her first roles. <br /> <br /> Not as luxurious as, for example, Junior Bonner, but equally deny and impressive in its image Thank you to the Encore Western Channel for occasionally showing this true essence of an underrated film.
