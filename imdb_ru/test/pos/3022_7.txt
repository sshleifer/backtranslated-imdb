After you have watched enough films, very little reminds you of other films. However, it was a watchable, albeit somewhat disturbing film. From time to time I had to turn it off and come back to it later. Like The Silence of the Lambs, it talks about finding a serial killer who kidnapped someone and locked her up in his horror chamber. Like the "Flat Liners", the main character explores the world of dreams through an experimental procedure. Surrealism of the sequence of dreams is what makes this film, because everyone finds characters in situations and landscapes in which literally anything can happen. And besides this continuity and “reflection” there is no need, which makes him a dream and a director. <br /> <br /> The only thing that seems a little strange is that in the end someone is hoping for the ransom of a serial killer or the expulsion of his demons. You do feel sympathy for the little boy inside the man, but it is obvious that the boy’s innocence cannot be separated from the man’s terrible actions. The focus shifts from saving a person to saving his victim.
