Axel Nordman (Cassavetes) appears in shipyards in New York in search of work, but with a hidden past. He gets one, provided that he gives the blow to the sullen boss of the crew of Jack Warden. While there, he makes friends with black Sidney Poitier, which unfortunately leads to a painful moral dilemma for a person who, as we learn, usually runs away from his problems. <br /> <br /> The film is similar to Oscar The winner on the embankment, feels like the embankment, and most importantly, in many respects similar to the Kazan production in 1954. However, his racial theme is innovative for that time. Black Poitiers and white Cassavetes are considered equal in all respects. It can even be called the first of the black-and-white "friendly" pictures, which later will dominate many action movies. <br /> <br /> It helps that the two characters play so well with each other. However, the main drawback of the film is not able to indicate why the boss of the Poitiers film crew first of all advances friendship with the stern Cassavetis. He really tries his best to make friends with a newcomer. But why he will overcome racial barriers has not been proposed. One possible explanation is that Poitiers wants to use Cassavetes as a pawn in his rivalry with another crew chief, Warden, but then becomes genuinely like a guy. In some suspicious reactions of Cassavetes, there is a hint of this, but in addition, the relationship seems unmotivated. <br /> <br /> If there is one stage in the whole film, I could not detect it. Everything is done on the sloven of New York, without the usual additional films. In this sense, this is an anti-Hollywood spectacle, thoroughly exhausted even before the night club scene, which in itself looks like a real after-class crowd. I believe that sociologists would call this rather crude piece of life "a glimpse of the working poor." <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, despite its many merits, the film remains too close to Brando-Kazan film for comfort. Here, the beautiful unknown actress Kathleen Maguire gets the role of redemptive girlfriend, the Guardian as the corrupt labor boss, while Cassavetis, like Brando, must suffer a bloody beating before regaining her moral position and doing the right thing. And yet, despite the derivative nature, the sandy urban drama retains enough of its original strength to deserve the look.
