Pity the poor reviewer who didn’t like / understood this wonderful film. What a sad life he must lead! <br /> <br /> This film can say more about life and relationships than most of those I've ever seen, but it is not dark and not preaching, like a film like “ordinary people”. This is mainly a humorous film, although technically it is not a comedy. <br /> <br /> It’s all a bit like science fiction, perhaps Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night's Dream. Beautiful, smart women abound, with excellent cinematography and a harmless scenario that does not miss the slightest blow. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing it every time this film is re-shown on cable. It's like rereading your favorite, treasured book.
