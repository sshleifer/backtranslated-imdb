The first scene of this movie is incredible. I saw some science fiction films with great special effects, but my roommate and I looked at each other after the opening sequence, and he said bluntly: "Sensory overload." The plot of the film is quite simple, but the nice thing about this sci-fi film is that it allows the audience to deal with most technologies themselves and not waste time on a “subtle” explanation. The creatures in this film are also very interesting. You don't look at them very well until you have walked two thirds of the way. Overall, a very interesting movie.
