"In the firing line" is one of the best thrillers I've ever seen, it develops and develops to a huge apogee. This film really draws you to your heart, beats, and you choke on action. The cast turns into a strong performance, in particular, Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. This film is masterfully directed by the unknown master Wolfgang Petersen. Thrillers do not get much better, do not miss it.
