Traffik is a really well-done 6-hour drama about drugs (circa 1987). In parallel, there are three stories about how opium is grown in northeastern Pakistan, how drug smuggling is shipped from Pakistan to Europe and, finally, how people who are addicted to drugs get out of control. All three stories are told realistically and with sympathy. You see enough character lives to understand how ordinary people can be drawn into a life that is truly immoral. <br /> <br /> This is not cardboard clippings, opium is trying to feed its family a dry area filled with weapons and other opium producers. The drug smuggler is a rich German who does not have a heart, but his wife (one of the three main characters) is an ordinary woman who has to choose between living as before or giving up on life. Finally, the protagonist, the government minister, plays the most difficult role, since he must deal with the emotional devastation caused by his own daughter. She plunges into the world of addiction and begins to steal, suffering from poor health, emotionally attacking her parents, and everything so that she can continue to satisfy her craving for the drug (heroin) that destroys her life. <br /> <br /> Traffik is one of the best dramas I've ever seen on TV. The scenes in this show will stay with you for a long time. Highly recommended. - Colin Glassey
