I guess this film will receive rave reviews in Canada - especially in Quebec. This is because Canadians have traditionally loved hockey, and the Canadians of Montreal have been Canadian gods for decades. As an American, New York Yankees are closest to us. If you are a fan, then this is the best and most winning team in history. If you are not a fan, then this is the command of Satan !! Well, at least it was when I grew up in Washington, DC, regarding the Dallas Cowboys. Therefore, I am almost certain when this film was shown in the north that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction - their national sport. And the closest thing they have to the national team in the NHL. <br /> <br /> Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it starts, and the main character talks about how he grew up in the Ottawa area and was rooting for Canadians And Maurice “Rocket” Richard. However, when his mother accidentally bought him a Toronto Maple Leaf T-shirt and made him put it on, I immediately realized what a terrible and shameful thing for a little boy. This ability to communicate with a character — even if he lives in a faraway country — is what made this very special short film. The way other children dealt with him and his conversation with God at the end, make this wonderful nostalgic film. Very clever and memorable.
