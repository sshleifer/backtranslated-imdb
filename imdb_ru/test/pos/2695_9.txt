"King of Queens" can be divided into two eras. <br /> <br /> The first epoch, consisting of the first few seasons, reflected the problems of the daily life of a man and his wife, experiencing life in the city. paycheck by paycheck. <br /> <br /> The second epoch expanded the scale of the show, embracing the current problems of mass culture and marital relations with a comic touch. <br /> <br /> But besides all this ... <br /> <br /> This show was damn fun. <br /> <br /> Kevin James, when not filmed in crap comedy films with Adam Sandler, is the genius of laughter, and his chemistry with Leah Remini has no analogues. on TV. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller, as a psychotic living father-in-law, added his own unique style of quirky humor, and Patton Oswalt as "male child" Spence Ulchin was amazing (he is a great comedian too) "The King of Queens" TV series of the 1990s, which came out of the air, and it is a hell of a shame. Now all we have to watch is idiotic sitcoms, full of untalented actors and actresses, whose only attraction is their appearance. I like many fans of really funny TV shows, now I'm in a state of grief
