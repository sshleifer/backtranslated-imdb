Dude, I really liked it, at least for the Fred Willard comment at the dog show. There are some dead spots and some gags that do not work, but in general the film works very well. When I was younger, my parents bred dogs, and the people I met at these shows were not significantly less strange than the freaks on this show, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I liked this film for its artistry and its comment on how we tend to take frivolous things too seriously ... I enjoyed the game for its accuracy (most accents were perfect) and its subtlety ( I liked how every man walked his dogs) ... <br /> <br /> Rent this film if you appreciate the oddity of human existence.
