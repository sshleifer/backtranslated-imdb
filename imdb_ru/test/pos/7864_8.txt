Combining the conventions of both Western and Gothic horrors, and often directed, as if it were a feature film, this is one of the best works of Siegel and Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Eastwood plays a Yankee soldier who, after being wounded during the civil war, finds refuge in an isolated southern seminary for young women. Far from the world, women project their romantic fantasies onto him, and he responds with violent masculine manipulations. But envy and resentment raise their heads, and he finds himself in the world of cruel vengeance. And the boy is a cruel revenge. <br /> <br /> Perfectly shot by Bruce Surtis and carefully thought out, “Cheated” is an obsessive, elegant work that seems to have influenced the sexual life of her own Eastwood Play Misty Me and Rope <br /> The film is a fascinating description of a fierce battle of the sexes and combines a fabulous mixture of horror and sexuality.All characters are ambiguous, showing traits of both good and evil, leaving us the right to choose who we should support. <br /> <br / > Don Siegel left behind a lot of beautiful films. Everything from "Invitations to steal body to "Dirty Harry" If you look today, I just don’t think they have stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> However, “Cheated” is in a different league. A mature, ambiguous and sharp shot, this is a shame, it is not widely known. While developing technology and technology have made most of Siegel’s hard, male thrillers obsolete, “Seduced” still attracts an audience thanks to its surrealistic atmosphere and unique storyline. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10 - better than “Black Narcissus” with a similar theme, in my opinion, the best film of Siegel. Partly horror, partly drama, partly sexual odyssey, “Seduced” is an amazing feature film (especially considering that Siegel viewed his films as quotes “meaningless”). Much of the mastery of the film belongs to Clint Eastwood, who from now on will make an effort to select mature material.
