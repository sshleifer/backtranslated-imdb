What a great movie !! This is a touching story about four school friends who grew up in the 1960s. Within a decade, friends are somewhat separated, but sometimes they see each other. There are many tragedies, but there are also many happy moments that make you laugh and smile. This is a heart-filled story about life, love and friendship. Definitely a must see for drama lovers.
