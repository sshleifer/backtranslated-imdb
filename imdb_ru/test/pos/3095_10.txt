During the first 30 seconds of the movie, you can tell if you want to end the show. The film begins with images of planes landing at the airport, one plane after another is immersed in a runway filled with mirages. You can guess for sure that this film is not about “history”. When you first view it is even easy to think that the initial images are duplicate shots of the same plane. The initial drama lies in the sharpness of your perception, which is based on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images. If after this discovery you want to watch a movie, you will not be bored. You can even be hypnotized. A film can be an emotional experience; it may be an intellectual experience; it could be both. Judging by the commentary on the DVD, which is necessary, it was first and foremost an emotional experience for Herzog, and at some point he says directly that the film is a collaboration between the director and the audience. The viewer has enough space to make from this film exactly what he or she wants to make from it. Gamble?
