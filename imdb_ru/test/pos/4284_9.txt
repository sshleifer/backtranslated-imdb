In the plot of this wonderful film, which makes one think, there are much more difficulties than just disloyalty and concealment of responsibility for the accident. I was amazed at Wilkinson's seemingly kind-hearted husband who wanted a driver when he thought it was Everett, revealed to the police, and a change in heart (and morality) when he found out that it was his wife. Also, was he really good, and / or was he trying to redeem himself by letting her go with Rupert. Then everything changed, and she decided that she should admit that she hit him. Most importantly, the ransom theme (for an accident — for infidelity — in its own strange, flawed way) is Watson’s strongest concern for the sick Everett. I suppose that's why she made these efforts. <br /> <br /> This seems to be a common theme in modern British novels: “Return to Brideshead”, “End of Case” comes to mind. Love it.
