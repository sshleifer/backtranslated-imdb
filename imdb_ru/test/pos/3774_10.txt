I like this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More classic sci-fi / horror movies should be remade to this comedy level, which, in my opinion, is at the top. A film without drinks, you laugh so much that you will pour it on yourself. Can we expect more? Will hope. I would suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brooks made several remakes of classic films. He made a very strong contribution. A picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope that some producer or director will be able to get into the idea and bring us a new comedy on our screens. we need a good comedy surge to keep the level of laughter higher than ever before. Good comedy FIX.
