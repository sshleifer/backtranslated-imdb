A cactus flower is what I call a “pizza movie” —a personal favorite that never ceases to satisfy. Perfect for a pizza evening home. Knowledge of all lines (and which lines!) By heart only enhances the pleasure. <br /> <br /> Since many others have retold the story here, I’ll just add the correction that Bergman’s character had, Miss Dickinson. the nurse registrar, that is, she was a qualified nurse and, therefore, an educated person, and not “just” an administrator. <br /> <br /> In this film, the performance of Bergman and the film itself was largely rejected. but today's audience will be amazed at its range; not only impeccable comic timing, but also the ability to make us believe that her character is not aware of her own feelings, while also revealing them so clearly for Tony and for us. While the general plot is credible, Bergman’s performance is irresistible: honestly and perfectly believable. <br /> <br /> The performance of Jack Weston as an old friend and accomplice of Matthew, Harvey, is also highlighted. No one could deliver such a zinger as Weston and I.A.L. The diamond script gives him a lot. For example: "This is such a big, dirty, rotten lie, it has a class." Weston succeeded in the slightly battered characters, because it radiated warmth that allowed you to forgive the shortcomings of his characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a fairly direct adaptation of the play by Abe Burroughs (which was adapted from the French play by Barille and Grady). On Broadway, the role of Mattau was played by Barry Nelson. Bergman Lauren Bacall and Hawn Brenda Vaccaro. It involved 1234 performances (three years), and he was nominated for two awards "Tony" (Vakkaro and Bert Brinkerhoff, who played Igor). <br /> <br /> For me, the film's assessment, written and adapted by the legendary Quincy Jones, is another highlight. The main theme (“Time for love is always”) is performed by Sarah Von over the opening and closing credits. It also hints at various arrangements throughout the film, especially in the sense that romantic piano music emphasizes Berman's speech to Hawn at the record store. Jones also created covers of popular songs from that period (To Sir With Love, I'm A Believer) for nightclub scenes. As in all elements of the film, there is a huge amount of talent, taste and professionalism. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, few modern romantic comedies can hold a candle in this classic. Great to finally have it on DVD. Time to call for pizza ...
