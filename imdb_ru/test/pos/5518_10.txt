This film was different. This required some typical thriller story, and she got to a more interesting and deep look at the struggle of individual characters with faith. Of course, it helped that the main performance of Andrew McCarthy was quite excellent. Other performances were also quite interesting, though not so consistent. The ending was a little disappointed, but there were a lot of good points. The filmmakers tried something different here - they didnâ€™t just go for obvious chills and fears. This is a dark film (not for everyone), but if you want to be entertained rather than talk, try this one.
