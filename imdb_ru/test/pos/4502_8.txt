I have not read the novel on which the Running Serpent is based. My wife and daughter, who thought so, thought that the film was far from the book, and I am ready to take their word for it. But the film itself is good - not great, but good. How accurately does he portray the chaos created by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? How convincingly does this show the intolerable Taliban regime that followed? I would rate C + on the first and B + on the second. The human story, an Afghan-American who returned to the country to save his boyfriendâ€™s son as a child, was well done, but for that reason I said that the book was much more convincing than the film. However, the most exciting part of the film - kite competitions in Kabul and, later, mini-competitions in California - can not be compared with the book. I would put money on it.
