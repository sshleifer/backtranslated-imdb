The best years of our life are often compared to “This is a wonderful life.” They should never be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about the war that claimed millions of lives. It’s hard to know what value an individual life can have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people forcibly died in the last century? What kind of statistics do we have to live.) In addition, our feelings for war have changed in 60 years. We have gradually moved away from the idea that war is easy if the enemy is right to believe that no war is absolutely fair, especially those that have been fought recently. <br /> <br /> I was a lifelong pacifist, I am against the whole war. I recently checked this position. This happened when I was on the ship Lexington, which is constantly anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship demanded a crew that is 3 or 4 times larger than the community in which I live. This is a powerful experience, traveling on its decks. She saw a lot of action. Someone gave me the right to be a pacifist, and it was not cheaply bought. <br /> <br /> I can't watch “The Best Years of Our Lives” without thinking about things like Lexington. <br /> <br /> Each of the three veterans paid their dues. And they also paid me. <br /> <br /> None of them got off easier than anyone else. The Navy, Air Force and Army paid the same, albeit in different ways. Everyone had problems directly related to the war. And everyone had to work hard to overcome these difficulties. It took more courage to confront their civilian environment than to fight the war, because everyone had to do it on their own. Everyone could understand and sympathize with the problem of others: in the end, no one could help. <br /> <br /> The moving part of the film (this may be the initial part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the leading men found someone who knew enough to give advice. An obvious case is when Derry told Gerald to marry a girl. Feel free to do it tomorrow. It’s hard for Harold to believe that someone could love him when he was a soccer hero and a sports star before the war. But to his credit, Harold is listening. <br /> <br /> Another case where Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Fix your relationship with your wife ?? standard exhibition of films of the 30s / 40s. Derry did not argue about this: he felt that he was not suitable for Al's daughter. Therefore, he agreed. The truth of the film is revealed when we believe that the daughter feels the same in relation to Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings, feelings and honor. I sometimes think that we believe these values ​​do not exist. Perhaps that is why people who watch this film have problems. <br /> <br /> Al is not free from advice he doesn’t need. Every time his boss talks to him, Al is tied in a knot. And it is right. There are some things that cannot be assessed by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by huge total intangible assets, and only those who are tested by the seriousness of life will understand what kind of intangible assets they are. down to the end, where all the planes that fought so bravely were dismantled, folded, stored, thrown out and soon to be disposed of: their functions, value and pride are as transparent as those of Derry himself. He can overcome the translucency that he does, making him suitable for his mind for the woman he loves. <br /> <br /> I gave the "Best Years of Our Life" 10 points, and there are a few films that I feel about. This is not a movie for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very fortunate that the eve fell for something as personal as the lives of these wonderful people. We must be careful not to abuse this privilege.
