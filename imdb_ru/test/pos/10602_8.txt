When I first heard about this film, I was a little interested. The plot seemed like an opportunity to have fun, and Bam Margera as an actor and director seemed like something good. When I found out that Ryan Dunn was in the movie, I was even more interested (I was a Homewrecker fan when he was ... Yes, I'm the one lame). However, I didnâ€™t really believe that it was good. When I sat down to see him, I was afraid that I was wasting my time. <br /> <br /> But even after five minutes it became clear that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought the comedy of this film was amazingly idiotic, and definitely not suitable for all kinds of people. The game was pretty good, much better than my expectations. I thought it was pretty easy to associate with the character Ryan, who gave the film a center that was believable. This is a key point in the film, as outrageous as this one (and, probably, therefore, I was not a fan of Borat). <br /> <br /> The film is not at all suitable for young people, an OS, and it will definitely create more than a fair share of clumsy turtles when viewed from parents. But this is a good option for you and your friends in the movie night.
