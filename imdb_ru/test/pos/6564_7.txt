As often happens when manga is translated into live action, much is lost in translation. However, it remains a very interesting film. The premise is unusual and presented in a calm, restrained style, so common in Japanese films (ha!). The special effects are a small 70s camp, but, it adds to the comic's film feel. I would not recommend this film to anyone, but if you are familiar with (and liked) other Japanese horror films, such as Evil Dead, you will like this film.
