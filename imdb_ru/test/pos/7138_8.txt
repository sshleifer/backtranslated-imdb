I loved this movie! Markie Post is really good at it. I've seen it all my life, and it's in the same entertainment class as films, such as: “Betty Broderick's Story,” “Locked up: Mother's Fury,” etc., entertaining films! that is trying to break away from its predictable personality from the middle class. This movie is just pure entertainment! This should not be a realistic look at heroin addiction. But it shows how any “ordinary” middle class person can (and they do!) Become heroin addicted. Addicts are not just homeless uneducated people on the street. {By the way, if you really watch this, check how the child controls his mother! Spoiled!} 8 out of 10 stars.
