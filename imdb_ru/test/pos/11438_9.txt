This film has almost never been seen today - the only reason I can enjoy it again and again is the slightly worn VHS copy I made when the film was shown on television in 1991 here in England. <br /> <br /> An The cast of the ensemble is obviously amusing, and this is reflected in the viewer. A razor-sharp script helps in this, and as soon as you see this, you will want to watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Rogers is a “star”, but everyone contributes to a great movie, with a great jazz soundtrack to download. There are emotional moments during the film, but they never reach the painful and sweet sentimentalism - these are guys on a lifelong journey, and they perfectly convey this excitement. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if you really can get to see it.
