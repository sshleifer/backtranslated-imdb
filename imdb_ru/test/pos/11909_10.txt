I like this movie. This is almost all I can say about this. Lou Gossett did a good job, although I am still very disappointed in him after all the films about the Iron Eagle. And even if I smiled from the inside, when the first primary teenager dies (I wonâ€™t give it up), it was done in a good, appropriate manner. Almost everyone in this film does a good job, so check it out! This is another one of those films that I found very cheap, so I bought it and I recommend the same.
