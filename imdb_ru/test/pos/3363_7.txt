In general, the film "Daddy's Army" is very funny, although the humor is not as catchy and brilliant as in TV shows and TV shows. So where does this leave us viewers? If you have never seen “Daddy's Army”, then this film is a good way to develop yourself and get hooked on the insane world of Walmington o / S. The disadvantage is that you may not “understand it”, because, as I said , the humor in the film is a bit mediocre. <br /> <br /> For Dad's Army fans, the film doesn’t contain anything new, as the story is more or less a part of the television series, but this is a unique opportunity to see your favorites in high resolution compared to the crappy BBC video quality. <br /> <br /> The film also has to have the loudest delay in the history of the universe. I can't decide positive or negative though.
