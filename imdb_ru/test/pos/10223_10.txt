In my opinion, this is Clive Barker's masterpiece. The film has a great storyline, amazing makeup and effects. The only thing I would like to see is the sequel. The film was created to continue, and with improved technology, the second film can be incredible. David Cronenberg should appear in the sequel, as well as Craig Schaeffer. But this particular film was a great original, creative, and interesting idea, and I could watch it again and again. Cronenberg was perfect in this film, and Schaeffer added an interesting spice to the film.
