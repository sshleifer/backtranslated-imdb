I personally LOVE this movie in the Halloween series. After watching with many friends, I found that you enjoy it completely or consider it absolutely unbearable. Personally, I watched him dozens of times, and he never gets old. In the film itself there is a wonderful backstory, and in the end a lot is explained. It's a rather short movie, it's shy of 90 minutes, but it's definitely an exciting ride. <br /> <br /> In this film, the figure looks pretty cruel, but the acting is still where he walks, stalks and kills. There are many neat little screenshots with Micheal appearing in the background, which adds more of the creepy element to the film.
