Hey, this Ralph Westhoff seems to know a lot about people! We have nine women and nine men taking part in a quick meeting event, each of whom has five minutes to talk to each opponent. Good idea to make a movie of these conversations. And even better: it works very, very well! The dialogue is witty, original and authentic, each person is subtly characterized without falling into the cliché trap, which is unusual for German films, remember: all these years we, the Germans, have been tormented by silly comedies of the spirit of the time, such as “Workaholic” or “Stadtgespräch” . <br /> <br /> But now the time has come for young German directors to go about their business and risk creating films that will be entertaining, funny, intelligent and sensitive at the same time. The timing of the “Shoppen” is also good: although it is mostly a dialogue, it saves tension and interest. After a while, you really become curious to see what this man and this woman will do. Some of the participants meet later for two, it is interesting to see how they interact with each other in "real life". Of course, the film has several drawbacks: it is not very cinematic (but can there be such a film?), The musical soundtrack could have been better, but all this is only marginally. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie: we have some pretty darn good actors here. Imagine that they are still rather unknown even here in Germany (most of them were derived from the Munich or Bavarian theatrical scene). But I predict that of the 18 main actors, at least 11 will quickly become very famous in the movies and on television here. It is nice to see so many fresh and at the same time talented people. Fine! <br /> <br /> For those who want to know more, here is a brief summary of all 18 actors: (spoilers!) <br /> <br /> Sebastian Weber: The still waters are deep! Remember his monologue "Flower Garden", with this you can win the heart of any woman. <br /> <br /> Anna Bøger: Hell Woman! Every time she opens her mouth, you can't help but laugh and feel good. Listen to how she says "asshole" and calls the guy in the pink shirt "Bürscherl"! <br /> <br /> Felix Hellmann: “Bürscherl” is interesting to watch from above. The inconvenient truth is that there are too many such guys. His appearance somewhat reminded me of Flo Weber from Sportfreunde Stiller. <br /> <br /> Katharina Schubert: This woman has everything: love, hope, despair, beauty. Her scene "Want Children" is a classic. Without a doubt, a great actress, about which we will hear again. <br /> <br /> David Baalke: Now this guy is a loser or not? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti in Sideways. I hope this is NOT an acting technique. <br /> <br /> Julia Koshitz: “beautiful” woman in a circle. Julia played in the theater in my hometown, thank! I think she will appear on many TV shows. <br /> <br /> Martin Bucke: A revolutionary guy catches the sweetest and most ordinary woman at the end. Would you like to share a taxi with this guy? <br /> <br /> Kathrin von Steinburg: Last year she gave a terrific performance in Tatorte. Her trance performance in this film is no less. See her beautiful face and hear her dirty laugh. The best scene in the film belongs to her. <br /> <br /> Matias Bundshukh: I know that these are “recording everything” - the guys returned from school. I'm not sure that the hot blonde got an allergic reaction because of him or his cat. The image of Mathias about such a chicken is outstanding. <br /> <br /> Mediha Cetin: my ex-girlfriend's sister-in-law was as talkative as she was. The day I met her was the only day in my life when I needed tranquilizers, so there are bad memories here. <br /> <br /> Thomas Limpinsel: “Good and desperate guy” in a circle. Limpinsel has a comic talent that is much better than most so-called "comedians" on TV. <br /> <br /> Liza Wagner: Victim of Sebastian’s Metaphor Flower Garden. Lisa's face is funny and full of melancholy, her story made me feel good and sad at the same time, wow! <br /> <br /> Oliver Burgin: A “good looking” person in a circle. No wonder he catches Julia at the end. These two really fit together. I think it will appear on many TV shows. <br /> <br /> Julia Heinze: “Pretty, ordinary” woman. I hope she will not be underestimated: Yulia’s face changes from naive to mad - that’s great! <br /> <br /> Stefan Zinner: “The boy of nature” from Partenkirchen likes to cook, eat ?? and good sex. Watch body language between him and the hot blonde! Zinner usually plays on the scene of the Soder politician SSA! <br /> <br /> Anya Klavun: The “girl merchant” has good moments, but, I apologize, you can’t (like most actors) play drunk on the screen. br /> <br /> Christian Pfeil: plays an arrogant and narcissistic guy. I could not believe that this actor owns two art-house cinemas in Munich. <br /> <br /> Tanya Shlyife: plays a girl who sleeps with every man around. I am sure that many male visitors will follow her. I heard that she can also play dramatic roles, so I'm curious.
