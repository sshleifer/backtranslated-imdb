It would be unreasonable to judge that this, either narrative or documentary, should be more authentic than another. Both formats have the basic form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality, as producers seek to reconstruct and tell stories in their perspectives. Since both formats usually do not address some of the problems due to the “complexity of the plots” and the timing of the screen, it deprives viewers of the opportunity to open debates and conduct further research and construct the real truth. In addition to the viewer's inability to assess sources (for example, comparison with a written story) and the logic of arguments, the story can be opened to distortion through narration and a documentary. <br /> <br /> For most people, a documentary may seem more truthful because it usually includes testimonies from real participants and real stories. However, these visual elements are selected and edited to be organized in such a way that manufacturers can present their version of realism to the audience. In Holly's True Friends' Story, Paul McCartney tries to create Holly Buddy, as his family and friends recall, and how Buddy influenced the rest of the music world. Testimonies can be distorted, because the memories can be inaccurate, and emotions have evolved to make Buddy a legend. The documentary really corrected the version of the film and covered other events, for example, there were 3 Crickets members, and that Buddy's music really sounded outside the US at that time (he had to go on a world tour!). However, this did not enter into a deep discussion about what happened to Buddy’s wife after his death. Criticism and / or negative discussions may have been excluded from the documentary, as producers seek to introduce friends that the world should have remembered. In the end, we are unable to build the whole truth, as we confine ourselves to the past “realities” that the documentary tells us about. <br /> <br /> Personally, I prefer the narrative film because it gives rich visual images that helps us reconnect with the collective memory of that era. This gives viewers a more constructive story structure, and this leads to a better memory preservation for viewers when they retell the story. There is also an element of flexibility that allows filmmakers to express their thoughts and views on certain issues. Racial issues were highlighted in The Buddy Holly Story, and viewers can certainly relate to these issues in relation to current situations. <br /> <br /> Film lovers are constantly striving to reconsider certain emotions when watching a movie and using these emotions. viewers can choose personal connections with the values ​​that the cinematographer wants to create. In most stories, people more often recall struggle, inspiration, and how the story ends. Thanks to Buddy Holly's Story, we remember how Buddy and Cricket fought, how Mary was a source of encouragement, and that Buddy Holly was a great performer until his death.
