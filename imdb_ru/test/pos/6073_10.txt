Since 1996, when I first watched this film, I feel that I will never reach the end of my satisfaction, I feel that I want to watch more and more so far, my God, I do not believe it was ten years ago, and I can believe I almost remember every word of the dialogs. I love this film, and I love this novel, absolutely perfect. I love Willem Defoe, he has a strange voice to say the words “black night”, and I always say that many times, never bored. I love Szararem music, it is so spiritualized that it made me enter another world deep in my heart. Can anyone feel what I feel, and can anyone make a movie like that? I do not believe in that. Thanks Ondaatje thanks Mingela.
