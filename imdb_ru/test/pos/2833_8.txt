... I saw this film when it first came out in France, in my hometown, 54 years ago, I was nine years old, and today I still remember every black and white frame, especially black, because it was so tense, terrible these sneaking attacks through this dark pass in the mountains, two soldiers, prisoners forced to fight each other with their invaders, the last battle with the disclosure of the carriage with Gatling discarded, the last battle between Peck and the main, and the happy ending that allowed me my breathing. I have not seen it since, and I donâ€™t know if it would be a good idea to see it again today, it was such an incredible moment for the child I was.
