Like almost everyone, I am familiar with the music of Ray Charles. Who has not heard "Georgia ON My Mind" and "The Mess-Around" and some other wonderful songs featured in this film. But unfortunately, I did not know about the life of Ray Charles until I looked at it. I must say that Jamie Foxx brilliantly revived Ray Charles. His performance was powerful, down to the manners and intonations of his voice. The film also contained an unimpeded account of some of the trials and tribulations that Charles faced during his life, as well as some demons from the past who pursued him until adulthood. Perhaps the strongest scene in the film was heroin cancellation, which was painfully realistic. The film tells about the growing awareness and participation of Charles in the civil rights movement, the culmination of which was his refusal to play in front of a separate audience in Georgia, which led to a ban on his speech in the state. His addiction and extramarital affairs are also well documented. The film revolves around his mother’s plea when he was a child: do not let anyone or anything make you crippled. “The fact is that drugs did exactly that, and to honor his mother’s memory, he had to beat them. There’s not much about his later life and career after he gave up his heroin habit, but until that moment it’s really powerful thing.
