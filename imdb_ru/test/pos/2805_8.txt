This is a very well-made film showing the life of foreign students during their “Year of Erasmus” in Barcelona, ​​which, by the way, is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and is the perfect place. <br /> <br /> The idea with all the different languages ​​is gorgeous and gives the film an original atmosphere. There are a few clichés about countries, but most of them are true! The characters could not better represent their different countries. <br /> <br /> Having experienced Erasmus during my exchange semester in Italy, I can say that this film is incredibly authentic. I had a lot of events that looked like characters (except for the fact that I was not put to bed so often). The film is also quite funny, but not like all those stupid American college films. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film also covers some important issues, such as the transition from student work to work. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (although perhaps I’m not very objective)
