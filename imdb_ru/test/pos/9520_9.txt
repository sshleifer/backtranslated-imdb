Or at least you feel pretty high after this movie. This is the type of film to which the word “noisy” can really be applied, although it sounds completely at ease, intelligent and open-minded, like the French. <br /> <br /> No, Catherine Deneuve doesn’t spend the entire film high (sorry to disappoint all Puritans with the agenda) .. but one scene I refer to includes all the participants in the wedding party - And this is a musical number! Anyway, everything fits perfectly with each other, and an unusual, bright, colorful family (mother Deneuve is a lesbian, Deneuve is her kind daughter) alternately entertains and annoys us like real families ... but since this is a film which is mostly entertained. br /> <br /> I don’t want to talk much about the ending, but Deneuve marries a man who was twenty years younger. This is quite plausible, as we see how relationships develop over time, and when they naturally converge. The ending is happy; and like the rest of the film, satisfactorily bizarre as well as a wonderful pitch.
