This is my favorite movie of all time. This is the best parody of a science fiction film in history; the fact that it was a Star Wars set only improved the situation. <br /> <br /> I love farce. Think of this as the Marx brothers or the Three Puppets meet Star Wars. The letter is ridiculous. Effects - beep. Free association guarantees all sorts of things coming out of the left margin. (I almost got my pants wet when the monster wookie turned to the princess.) <br /> <br /> “Space Balls” was a much longer movie, but it was only about 15 minutes of good material, and I felt torn like buying a hamburger, which turned out to be mostly filler. "Hardware wars", despite the fact that they lasted only about 15 minutes, would be worth paying a special price, IMO.
