A very intelligent, intelligent drama about a group of international travelers who held virtual prisoners in Hungary in 1956, invading the Russian communist regime. Kerr and Robards play lovers, she is a British baroness, he is a Hungarian freedom fighter trying to make a contribution to his country. Other New York-era theater stars Ann Jackson and E. Marshall play an American couple traveling with their two young sons, including Ronnie Howard in his screen debut. Jackson's character is extremely pregnant and does not want to give birth in a future communist country; In the third act of this film, she gives a passionate plea that foreshadows the naturalistic acting styles that we have learned today from Redgrave, the Foundation and the Strip. At the head of the pack of Soviet wolves is Yul Brynner, the magnificent commandant and the sexiest since he played with Kerr in the movie "The King and I". He is angry, nasty and terribly conflicted because of his attractiveness to sweet, patrician and heroic Kerr. This is one of the great transitional films of the last part of the Golden Era of American cinema. Do not miss it.
