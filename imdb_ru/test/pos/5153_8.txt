You Live (2007) <br /> <br /> Mordant. I have never written this word before, but it comes to my mind. Let me see. Well, that part of it is corrosive, but funny, damn it. So corrosively funny. This is a harsh film, of course, with so much dry, dry, witty and strange humor, that it is impossible not to like it at some level. Filmed in a very extraordinary style, often with a static camera and truly balanced, stable compositions, such as theatrical scenes, we see that a short production takes place. <br /> <br /> But it makes him seem ordinary - whatâ€™s wrong, Ordinary life is shown to be dull, ironic, delightful, shy and depressing. And impossible. We, the living, must live, and since we are alive, we can also take note. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who said you were laughing and did not know why. Exactly. And in the promotional material somewhere it was said that this is something between Bergman and Monty Python, and they mean that they look dry, silent and probing, like the famous Swedish films of Ingmar Berman, but they have some a touching, somehow touching element of British comedians, <br /> <br /> I would say, definitely, be sure to look at least half an hour of this. There is a part of me that thought that by this time it had already passed - the rest continues in a similar set of small parodies and moments, and they gradually develop, but there is no big plot or culmination of the usual look. Some wonderful moments later, even just attention to the thunderstorm, which pleasantly takes us out of worldly human events. <br /> <br /> Filming is great in its classic control, almost like a series of scenes by Gregory Crewdson (and even surpasses the photographer). And acting, with all his very ordinary, not glamorous people, is excellent. Awesome, beautiful, weird experience.
