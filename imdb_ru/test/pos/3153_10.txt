I broke my brain for another movie that reminds me of this. I really can't come up with one. I think this is because most of the films devoted to this topic (war, peace, violence) are made in a fixed documentary style. There are some amazing films, all of them are better known than the USA TM, I'm sure, but they are intended to be informational and to convey your emotional reaction to the surface by intellectual means. This DVD, in a sense, may seem more intelligent, but in reality it is not. Perhaps this is a philosophical approach, but it bypasses the information mode and goes straight to the same place as a piece of music. It makes you feel, but sometimes you don't even know why. You just got somewhere on a wave of feelings. When you watch it, notice how well it is assembled. This may not be for everyone, but for everyone who is looking for a rare cinematic creation that respects you.
