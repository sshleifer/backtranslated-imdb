This is a great achievement that three stories shot by three completely different directors can be at the same time so insightful about gay and bisexual relationships, as well as their struggle! <br /> <br /> “Pool Days” is the awkwardness of adolescence and mutual attraction between the elderly and the youngest. The story of the experience and vulnerability! <br /> <br /> “Friend Dorothy” talks about a common dilemma that many gay and bisexual people experience at some point in their lives: a strong attraction to a person who is heterosexual. Thoroughly studied, this story really made me feel excited! <br /> <br /> “Disco years” show another version of a hopeless situation: communicating with someone who is not only embarrassed by their sexual orientation, but also afraid to be exposed like anything other than the direct one! A very inspiring story for those of us who have survived the betrayal of a sexually confused and frightened person! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that these three stories will please everyone who has at least a little sympathy for others, they will psychologically empower those who consider themselves to be gay, bisexual, or a seeker. Each story stands out in its own way!
