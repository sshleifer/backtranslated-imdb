I always liked Sean Connery, but like James Bond, I always preferred Roger Moore. Still, Connery set the standard for Bond, and by 1983 he had established himself as something other than James Bond, the money had to be insurmountable for him to make another appearance as 007 and save the world from the evil designs of the Ghost. <br /> <br /> And in what design they never say never. SPECTER, with the help of a stupid young Air Force officer who turned out to be Kim Bassinger's brother, stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise, and now SPECTER led by Blofeld, played here by Max Von Sydow, threatens blackmailing the world. <Br /> <br /> Von Sydowâ€™s operator is Klaus Maria Brandauer, who also cares for Bassinger and is a little crazy. And he has a female killer working for him in Barbara Carrera, who makes Angelina Jolie in the role of Nora Croft look like Mrs. Butterworth. <br /> <br /> But before Sean Connery has time to begin, he must deal with the new 'M working in British intelligence. Edward Fox believes that Connery is old-fashioned in his methods and costs too much money to British taxpayers with his violent methods. I really enjoyed Fox's performance, he looks like the great-grandson of Colonel Blimp. <br /> <br /> I also liked Carrera, she looks at something and is quite inventive in her methods. When she dives from Connery in the Bahamas, notice how she puts Mr. Shark in the 007 case. <br /> <br /> Will Connery do James Bond again? He was widely quoted, saying to whom would they take the role, as at the moment, of Roger Moore's father? But I think Connery will still be formidable in a wheelchair.
