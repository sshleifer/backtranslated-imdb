Just went to YouTube and finally watched this Oscar-nominated animated short film directed by Richard Condi. I used to watch his funny Getting Started there. In this, a couple plays Scrabble. The wife continues to shake her eyes until her husband has nothing but E on his side. Wife for a while leaves vacuuming her bed and bath (!) Before catching her husband looking at her. Shortly before this, the husband catches the TV show “Sawing for Teens”, where the stars are sawing something, and the husband gets his own saw. This program is interrupted by a special report on nuclear war (here the journalist is a skeleton) when everyone panics on the street, although the husband falls asleep at this time and thinks that the parade is on as he and his wife continue to argue about the game ... There are many other things before a touching ending. Pretty funny and worthy of attention any fan of animation. Can't wait to see more animated shorts from Mr. Condi ...
