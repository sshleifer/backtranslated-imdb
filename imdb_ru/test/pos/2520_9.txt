Direct X-file, which shows that the action is always equal to intelligence. The direction of Rob Bowman is clear and sharp, the episode looks as fresh as it was almost a decade ago. David and Gillian both show excellent results, and both seem to enjoy lack of baggage - this is a separate X File, which even lovers can love. Junior Brown defeats both for his money during his scene with them, he is so convincing that you can believe that the team went to nowhere and knocked on the first door to which they came. Brian Cranston is as energetic and energetic as Patrick Crump, he has since admitted in an interview that he knew almost nothing about the X-Files before this role, and this fact makes his amazing performance incredible. Brilliantly dumb episode.
