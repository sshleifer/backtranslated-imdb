The film itself is absolutely brilliant, this is the noise, that impulse that makes you just want to quit, blow up your salary and lose yourself. This is the whole essence of the weekend, our sanitation, where we can get together and be ourselves, without caring about the world. The film is multi-layered, and local dialogue is just in place, especially with the Jeep. The characters themselves are instantly cute, especially one of them is obviously a bloody character and his views on what is Star Wars, a genius. <br /> <br /> If you have an hour to kill before you exit. Stick to this, you will immediately feel confident, definitely recommend it.
