This game requires a tricky, smart, and steady hand. The gameplay is simply the best; In addition to this, although there are interesting additions - bullet holes remain in the walls, enemies react to certain points where they were hit by bullets, there are a lot of animations that capture the movement that make the enemies seem very real (for example, he will stand there, waving away flies, sneezing or scratching himself), the list goes on. This is the best conversion of licenses and movies ever, and it puts you in the place of a super-spy. This game is the best reason to own an N64.
