It's hard to convey the destructive beauty of Traffik, in part, because I'm still trying to figure it out myself, a few hours after my second viewing. First, it must be said that there are some of the most incomparable and unforgettable scenes I have seen in movies or television productions in Traffic. The game is excellent, especially for Bill Paterson in the role of the British minister, who is fighting his heroin-dependent daughter, and the agreement on assistance to Pakistan, which is related to drug problems. Another storyline describes these drug problems at the ground level in Pakistan and revolves around a struggling opium poppy farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler. The third main storyline includes the prosecution of the Hamburg drug importer and the conflicting efforts of his wife and two German detectives while he is under investigation. The profound achievement is that the interaction between these stories seems natural, going beyond the confusing plot that is often found in Hollywood films. An even greater achievement is that work covering three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so focused and exciting without the need for simplification. It is destructive - dark and cruel, but never apathetic. In short, Traffik is a rare work in a film in which complex objects are viewed with unsurpassed sympathy and clarity.
