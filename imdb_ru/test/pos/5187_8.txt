I recently purchased it on DVD, because I did not hear about it and I love Robert Carlisle. <br /> <br /> Obviously, there will be no special effects from the Hollywood blockbuster in this film, although he said that the special effects were quite decent. and with the game, too, everything was in order. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that the film is a pleasure, and I do not even regret buying it, because its duration is almost 2 hours, and this is just the right duration for this type of film. <br /> Do not expect an exciting explosive action from start to finish, although this is a fairly balanced film with a fairly decent storyline!
