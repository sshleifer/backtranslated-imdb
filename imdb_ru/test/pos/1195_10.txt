Milos Forman's hair was an ideal film that actually showed how life changed in those years, not only in the US, but especially in this country. One of the plots in the film was to be used in other films after “Hair”, for example, in “American graffiti”, etc. This was an original story with a touch of sadness in the generation. The characters in the film were like lonely “cells” in a “body” that was changing everywhere. All in all, a very good movie, perhaps a bit underrated. Annie Golden’s role was insignificant, but she acted very well. It was a film that actually started John Savage as an actor. One of the members of Chicago played a role well, although it was a minor role.
