I really liked the movie. In Italian work, everything is simple. The explosive guy, the safe cracker, the computer genius, the man behind the wheel, and the man with an exciting 35 million theft plan without using weapons. This film is interesting, although it does not have a central idea. This is a non-stop movie with a lot of action. All the stunt work is great. From chasing on a speedboat in Venice at the beginning to chasing on busy roads in Los Angeles with the participation of three mini-coopers and even a helicopter. The best chase I've ever seen. I like mini-coopers. Experienced thieves used mini-coopers for fleeing cars. The race between mini-coopers and motorcycles is amazing. They chased underground. I can say that there was no moment when I was bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Crocker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve) are really good work. I like the actors in this movie. I have seen many films about robberies, but Italian Work is one of my favorites. Great Hollywood fighter without a drop of blood. In the end, I love this movie.
