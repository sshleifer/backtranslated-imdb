Although not as good as the murder was announced, which was not only delightful, but almost surpassed the book, it is a great adaptation. And you know that this is a huge improvement in the Geraldine McEwen version. Now I am not proud of the poor expression of adaptations Geraldine McEwan, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started well, but were destroyed either by a bad script, or by an intricate final decision, or both. The Geraldine McEwan version suffered from slowness and both of the above problems, and I consider the second worst variant of ITV adaptations, the worst of which is Sittaford Mystery, which even by its merits turned out to be boring and confusing. This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a huge improvement, it not only respects the book, despite several freedoms, but also largely corrects the problems encountered in the ITV version. Despite the additional character of Lionel, which looks rather annoying, is more related to the way it was written, than to the way he acted, and to one or two moments of slow stimulation, this is hard as an adaptation of a decent book. It is beautifully shot, with good photography and historical details, and the music is excellent as always. The performances are great this time, and they make most of the overall well-made screenplay, with Joan Hickson, brilliant, as always, like Miss Marple, and solid turns from Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hall and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tizak is outstanding, albeit scary and touching, like Clotilde. In general, it is worth looking better than the latest version in almost all departments. 9/10 Bethany Cox
