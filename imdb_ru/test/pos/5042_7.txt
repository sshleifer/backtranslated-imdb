The name of the film seems quite appropriate, given the nature of the main character, Fanda. He is an elderly man who lives in the late autumn of his life, and yet is frisky like a cheerful schoolboy who has just entered the spring meadow. The weakness of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions for him. His wife supports this idea when she remarks: "Fanda laughs at funerals and death." In other words, death is not something Fanda takes too seriously; he has more important things to do than to worry about what is already inevitable. However, life and the pursuit of a full life is the philosophy that governs the existence of Fanda. He is not alone in order to simply exist, but he must live every day and every passing moment, because tomorrow is not guaranteed. <br /> <br /> The film has a strong commentary on life, as if there is no tomorrow, let alone death. Too many people take life too seriously and, therefore, miss the actual part of life. Fanda's wife for example; she is so worried about preparing for death, not some kind of religious overtones, but too practical, even lifeless, that she forgets how to smile, laugh and just have a good time. Her humanity seems to have turned into a zombie autopilot mode. Fanda, on the contrary, may be too careless and scattered for his own good. He needs a man like his wife Emily to help balance him. <br /> <br /> As if Fanda has the invincible spirit of a child, like a child trapped in the body of an elderly man. It is presented as an adventurous type; he pretends to be people he doesn't want to receive, spends money, lies evilly and is always ready to laugh. Deep down, he is a kind and gentle old man who wants to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife. These two balance each other very well, although neither of them appreciates the binary quality of their relationships until they are metaphorically doomed to death: meaning, divorce It is in this scene in the courtroom that Fanda realizes the reality of death and that it means if he is separated from his only love. His wife emotionally recalls all his shortcomings, but still tenderly seeks to continue to love him, despite his crazy behavior. At this moment, when she forgives him, Fanda is aware of her selfish behavior, driving him crazy, and making an inner obligation to make her happy. <br /> <br /> Ironically, after accepting this commitment, he becomes, as his wife later calls, "a living corpse." The lifeblood within him drains as it becomes more and more like it - a zombie, making daily movements. It seems that he no longer lives, but exists. For example, he gives up his insane jokes, does not spend money, quits smoking because of his wife (not because of his health), and in general simply agrees with what she wants from him. Simply put, he is changing because of the desire to make her happy. Thus, the binary quality of their relationship begins to fade. Realizing that her husband is not who he was before, there is a part of Emily who misses old Fande. She misses her husband's estrangement and the fights they had, because it was in those moments that they really lived, and not just existed. <br /> <br /> I suppose that the filmmakers tried to convey a specific message here; that real and loving relationships will not always be easy or comfortable, but times often require sacrifice and patience in order to go through seemingly bad times. The possibility of death at any moment is something that reminds people to live every moment. Life is often taken for granted, but when it is threatened with death - whether literally or figuratively - people wake up from their ungrateful dreams and wake up to start living a full life. As if they are afraid that they will never live again, so itâ€™s better for them to get the most out of it while they are. Fanda and Emily were married for 44 years, fighting along the way, but only after they were threatened with the possibility of a similar separation of death, did they begin to show their true colors. As the old saying goes: "Love does not know its depth until the hour of separation." They both begin to understand what is most important in life, and these are the people they meet along the way. More importantly, the close relationships they establish with their significant others.
