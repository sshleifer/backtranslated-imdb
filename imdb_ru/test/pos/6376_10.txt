Teen Deviyaan is a great movie. Very light artist and very modern film for its time in the 1960s. The music and songs are awesome, although the lyrics of Majrooh are meaningless in places. Dev Anand is a terrific star, and, as usual, he does an excellent job with his role. Kalpana is sexy and Nanda is fine. Simi is also almost normal. In the film, the stunning dialogue of Vrajendra Gaura, who wrote most of the films of Dev Anand, such as Mahal, Duniya, Warrant, Jaali Nott, Manzil, etc., etc. , Simi and home Nanda. In the end, he chooses Nanda. The story is about OK, but it is told in an exciting way, and the dialogue and Songs and the great Dev Anand is the highlight of the film. Be sure to watch the movie for all fans of Dev Anand.
