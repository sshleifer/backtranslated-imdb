Even if it is not labeled as a click Slasher, it has all the elements. The fact that slashers are well known for their low budget, unfortunate plot, ridiculous effects and everything you can add does not mean that there can be no good slasher films. "Opera" fills the description. Even though it is part of the Italian giallo; This is far from a subgenre slasher. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento proves that he deserves the title of one of the best directors in a horror movie. "Opera" - one of the most stylish horror films in the past 30 years. Although the film takes place in a beautiful, radiant place; situations and blood turn him into one of the worst places ever used in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> “Opera” is a stylish slasher, although there is a deep elaboration in the plot and character development. The cheese factor, often used in most Slasher movies, is absent here, but in return we have an amazing, visually stunning bloody story. The plot of the film is simple (as in any slasher). In the opera, there is a psycho who is somewhat obsessed with a leading actress / singer and makes her watch a horrible death. Death scenes are extremely terrible and are the best thing in the film. In my opinion, the notorious death scene "peephole" - the highlight of the film. This is a terrific scene of death that no one else could have shot but Argento. A knife through the neck (and mouth) is another terrible scene, but less cruel than the death of the scissors. Blood in the "Opera" will please the evil and lovers of violence. <br /> <br /> What I didn’t like about the film was the lack of consistency or logic. I mean, after seeing the first death, the lead woman, reassured, as if nothing was happening, gets home and does not matter much in what she saw. In addition, she was left alone at home and did not take security measures. However, the obscurity in the film makes you forget the lack of logic. Argento knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious. For example, when Betty's friend tells her that someone is watching her outside, she worries and sets the suspense in case something happens. <br /> <br /> The direction of the film is excellent. For Italian hyallo, this is great. Creative first-person shots of Argento are impressive. The crows also added an eerie feeling to the movie. Argento adds its own unique spice. <br /> <br /> “Opera” is one of the most underestimated, but popular among the horror community, in my opinion, for the following reasons: - death scene in the peephole (brilliant) - ravens attack in the end - staging the opera - the knife through the neck and mouth - heavy metal in combination with opera music (this music never scared me) - the ferocity of the killer <br /> <br /> The only thing I don’t like in Opera is the heavy metal songs used in the death scenes. You can disturb the audience, but I think Opera’s music could add a more eerie feeling. Nevertheless, the “shocking” version The use of heavy metal in the film is particularly troubling. <br /> <br /> Watch “Opera" even if you don’t like blood. There is a lot of tension and tension that can frighten the most skeptical person. It's not "Suspiria", but she deserves to be among the best argento.
