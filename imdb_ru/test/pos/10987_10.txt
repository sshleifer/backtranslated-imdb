Manna from heaven. This is a family movie - teenagers and grandparents can enjoy it together. But it is not thick, sweet or stupid. Characters really are "characters." The plot is somewhat complicated, and you should pay attention to it, but it is the same as putting together a puzzle, as everything gradually falls into place. The beginning of a period is like looking at an old photo album or remembering back when. It is very well done with very accurate hairstyles and costumes. The story quickly unfolds with turns, turns and lots of fun. <br /> <br /> A special pleasure is to observe numerous familiar faces, many of whom we have not seen for too long. Part of the fun is finding out and calling them mentally as they appear, although this can be distracting. By the end of the film, Cloris Lichman looks as if she beat Oppra. I never saw Fay Grant in the film - I only knew that she was the mother of Grace in the TV series “Salvation Grace”. She was gorgeous, even without a southern accent. And I didn't even recognize Shelly Duvall. The five sisters who created this beautiful film are a very talented quintet, and Sister Teresa is a heavenly treasure.
