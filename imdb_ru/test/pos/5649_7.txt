I saw this in 1993 on a VHS tape, but since then I have not been able to find it in any source. This is a very dark and uncompromising view of the last days of the Japanese army in the Philippines. Anyone who is interested in the war in the Pacific would love to watch this movie and see the conditions in which the other side fought. From what I can say, this is historically true and shows how easily people can fall into complete barbarism. I understand that the Japanese army was completely cut off from any recharges in the Philippines by 1945, so there is no doubt that many terrible incidents occurred here. Perhaps I could not identify myself with the characters in the film, but I appreciate their humanity and the struggle for survival. If I had to make a list of the ten greatest war films, this film would be on it. See if you can.
