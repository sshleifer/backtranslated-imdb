Big Fat Liar is a long-awaited - shallow, but welcome - a breath of fresh air after one too many films that feature bathrooms, bodily fluids, acid-based pets, gaseous jokes and crotches. In the end, "See Spot Run", "Big Move of Max Kibla" and "Snow Dogs" signaled the "Degenerative Spiral of Children's Filmmaking". Worse, the realization that young viewers will later sate with the dirtier sentences of “Not Another Teenage Film” and “Slackers”. Author of the film - Nickelodeon producer Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who concurrently appeared in the 80s comedy series “Class Leader”), Frankie Muniz in the role of Jason, who is always ready to get out of fuss with good falsehood. (Where is the English newspaper? Dad choked on a Swedish meatball.) His teacher (Sandra O) gives an ultimatum: hand over the newspaper by the end of the day or go to summer school. Jason pulls out a story called “Big Fat Liar” and gets to school on the road in a limousine with insensible Hollywood producer Marty Wolfe (Paul Giamatti). The wolf gave him a lift, but Jason leaves his newspaper behind. No one will hear the truth this time, and dad tells him that he has lost confidence. <br /> <br /> A few months later, Jason and best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) are watching a preview of the movie “Big Fat Liar” and go to Los Angeles to destroy Wolf’s life - all to get a confession that he stole Jason's paper to make a movie. They even get the sympathy of some of Wolf’s outraged employees, including his assistant (Amanda Detmer), the former driver (Donald Faison), the movie star (Jalil Urkel White, who plays himself) and the stunt coordinator (old Lee Major). <br /> <br /> Since Big Fat Liar doesn’t have the barrier that his comedy series Malcolm in the Middle is known for, Muniz is easy to support, but he has nothing to work on. Similarly, for Bynes, who runs her own sketch show, Tracy Ullman on Nickelodeon. All stiffness is given to Jamatti, whose eyes are bulging and her cheeks wriggle with every mocking insult. <br /> <br /> The film breaks down just when trying to make a big road and should appeal to its target audience (especially because most of the high jokes occur at a lot of Universal Studios). But here is one dizzying thought: the message is that it’s worth telling the truth. But didn't we see how Jason sought reckoning by telling all the white lies throughout the film? Well, at least there is no poop.
