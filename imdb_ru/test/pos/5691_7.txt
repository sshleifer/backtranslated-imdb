This low-cost crocodile movie really delivers the goods. The fact that he was inspired by true events means little if you come across a fake crocodile, a bad C.G.I. or obvious studio setting. Fortunately, none of the above is associated with this terrific, very realistic film. The crocodile is real, no C.G.I., and on-site filming takes place in a real Australian swamp. The actors were obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances, and they succeeded. You can put yourself in their predicament, which shows how realistic “Black Water” is translated as entertainment. Highly recommended. - MERK
