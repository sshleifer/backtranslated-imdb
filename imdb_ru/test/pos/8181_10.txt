This story, documenting the rise of the first Chinese emperor and his efforts to unite the empire, was the most expensive film production in Chinese history. <br /> <br /> It is worth every penny. Visually dazzling cinematography, a stunning score and outstanding characters make it one of the best epic works ever made in films (foreign or otherwise). Please do not miss the opportunity to see it on the big screen.
