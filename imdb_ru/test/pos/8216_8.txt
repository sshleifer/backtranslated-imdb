This film was intense and fun to watch. Since I am a fan of such films, I really enjoyed it. The premise is a little scary, but the fact that I didn't rate this figure at 10 points was due to the fact that the film was a bit higher in some areas. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Cmon: No one could identify this girl? I understand the concept of self-isolation, but it's hard for me to believe that ANYONE could not identify this girl as Angela Bennet. It was too much like the scene when she went to someone's desk and started typing. In general, it was a really good film, intense and retaining interest. Dennis Miller was great in the role of Allen, REALLY believable, Bullock was good as a lonely reserved computer worker who everyone underestimated the bad guys. <br /> <br /> I think the PRICE of the film was really different - and scary. Nowadays, who knows what might happen? But some of the most popular scenes prevented this film from becoming 10.8 out of 10.
