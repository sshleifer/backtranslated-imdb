Witticisms, colorful characters, family relationships, cope with difficulties, live with pleasure and humor. This film has everything and more. What a wonderful story of "every man (and woman)", with a plot and a super script. It offers pure fun, lots of laughter, lots of smiles and pure fun for the whole family. Other reviewers describe the history of some. Will I just offer this comparison teaser ?? this is part of "Best of Show", "Grumpy Old Men", "Millions" and some other comedy and life films combined in one. <br /> <br /> This film gem most likely had a limited release and probably not very affordable for rent. But now it’s on DVD and I highly recommend it. If you like good old fun and entertaining films for the whole family, you can’t miss Manna from heaven. This film is a sure cure for blues or to chase the dark in inclement weather days or hard times.
