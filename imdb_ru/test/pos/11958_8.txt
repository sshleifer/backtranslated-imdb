So there are always people who seem to consider it necessary not to like films, because they are good, but instead prefer to love films based on how depressed or boring they may be, or on the fact that they are from another country. Among other things, One Crazy Summer is a great example of what a great American comedy for teenagers should be. The jokes are a good combination of farce (a la Bobcat Goldthwait), surrealistic (Bobcat under the inspirational guidance of Steve Holland) and dry (John Cusack, one of the darkest and funniest actors in American cinema) there is no character in this film who would not pronounce at least one funny line (well, except for Demi Moore). <br /> <br /> Yes, it is immature, yes, it is a prank, yes, Bobkat dresses like Godzilla and smashes a large-scale model of a seafood restaurant. It's damn funny too. Watch it
