I spent many years studying all the great directors, such as Kurosawa, Lin, Fulci, Lenzi, Deodato, Pekingapa, Kubrick, and admire them. My favorite movie Once Upon a Time in America. <br /> <br /> I just recently became a fan of D'Amato, and although he was not a master of horror, his films were extreme, whether it be soft core, hardcore or extreme. <br /> <br /> Porno-fiber is now one of my favorite films, as his shot is brilliant and the music touches. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato was not the Master of Horror, he was not Fulci or Bawa, but no matter how he was a master of erotica, no other director could make erotic films like him, he also never make films outside the genre. <br /> <br /> Long live Joe D'Aamto-Master porn and erotica!
