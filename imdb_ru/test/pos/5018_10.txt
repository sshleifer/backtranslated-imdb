This is a film with a theatrical message mixed with some clever moments. Such films are stretching sites for great actors, they like to throw the ball into open parts like these. The angel that was not what we see in old books and churches is a rather pleasant change. This is repeated in a play by Kevin Smith, Dogma, almost in the same spirit of farce. <br /> <br /> - = 0) Watch this movie for a good day after you have absorbed it all. Maybe so many films are trying to be complicated, that we forget the simple movements of films like this? Perhaps one of the funniest things I've ever seen, I stumbled upon this on VHS in the bin, because this summer someone’s cellar was flooded and I took a few tapes. <br /> <br /> In a trash can or on a silver screen, soft comedies like this are fun, you just don’t need to tell everyone in the trendy nightclub that you like it or a chic political party. Just keep it for yourself, and I bet that many people will take it from time to time.
