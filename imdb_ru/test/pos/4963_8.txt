This film is a journey of strength from Julia Taymor, which guides and makes the design of the scene and disguises. No one can match her imagination on the modern opera stage. Since the creation of this film in 1992, she has had great success in creating films and staging musicals. One can only hope that she can be persuaded to return to the opera once. I would like to see the Ring cycle directed by her. The current Rheingold in Covent Garden has giants with huge hands, like the characters in this film. The current Butterfly in ENO uses Japanese puppet art. It may be a coincidence or evidence that Taymor's influence is widespread. <br /> <br /> Teimar uses fantastic costumes, masks, marionettes and origami birds to recreate the story of Oedipus on stage on stilts above the lake. Red ribbons - a recurring theme. They are used as a umbilical cord when Oedipus is born, they hang down from Oedipus’s eyes after he has blinded himself, with a breathtaking effect they are used to create an intersection when Oedip’s murder of his father is recreated by dolls. <br /> <br /> Stravinsky’s neoclassical opera ballet used justified ambiguity until this film brought it to life. The music is boring, but harmless, and Philip Langridge, Jesse Norman and the very young Bryn Terfel get the most out of it. The singers are quite motionless, in accordance with the wishes of Stravinsky. Min Tanaka is a dancing Oedipus with singing Oedipus Langridge. This creates some confusion at the end when Oedipus dances, sticking his eyes out to Oedipus singing. <br /> <br /> Libretto is in Latin, but don't worry if Latin is a bit rusty in high school. There is a helpful storyteller who introduces and describes each scene in Japanese.
