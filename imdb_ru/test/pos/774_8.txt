I really liked this movie, which horn. Rupert and Julie are great along with Rupert, who almost poker runs into Juliaâ€™s animation, which worked well. Laura did a good job as a powerful mother. Of course, Julie, as usual, is amazing. While this film will make you laugh most of the time, it also has a sharp side, as it reveals the secrets of the main characters' lives. Interestingly, it was titled Driving Lessons, as this may lead you to believe that this is the main feature of the film, and this is not quite true, although it can certainly be seen as Ben, who finally found driving position in your own life. Like most fun things in life, there is always a sad side, and there are some exciting moments in this movie. Very nice movie worth watching.
