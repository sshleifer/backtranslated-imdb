Great movie in many aspects. Vicente Aranda managed to portray time (1830) with careful thoroughness. Light, places, feelings are perfectly perceived from the very beginning of the film. And at the same time - in contrast to what happened with “Mad Love” (Juana la Loca), a rather episodic historical film - all this beautiful photo / music / clothing envelops a very moving script that reaches its climax in the only possible way. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, Paz Vega as Carmen is outstanding: a liar, seductive, aggressive, absolutely sexy and very handsome Carmen. Sbaraglia convinces the audience a little less in his instant insane love for Carmen, but he manages to convey the correct tragic mood throughout the film. I recommend it to everyone: the best Spanish film of the year.
