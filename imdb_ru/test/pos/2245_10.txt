Once again, Doctor Who delivers the goods on loading the bucket. It has humor (“You just do it as you go!” “Yes, but I do it brilliantly”), action, monsters (in this case there are still more cyber-killers), tragedy and intimidation tactics. In short, what the doctor prescribed (pun intended). The way in which emotions move from one to another is done so well that there is no feeling of “continuing this”. So draw 3 of the last 4 episodes that made you laugh, then made you cry and made you keep up. <br /> <br /> In terms of character development, this is definitely a decisive factor for Noki Clark Mickey (and Ricky). As one of the Doctor’s companions, you know that he will do the right thing, and they may even suspect how he does it. However, it is still an emotional breakthrough when he confirms his future path. <br /> <br /> While the Cybermen Rise led to an ominous rise of terror, the Steel Age is all Explosion. Like "Alien" compared to "Aliens" - both are real classics, but in different ways. Can the series keep it at this level? Will hope.
