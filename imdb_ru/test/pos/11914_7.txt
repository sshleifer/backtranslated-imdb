Toy Soldiers is a good fighter, but what really stands out is the amount of effort that screenwriters and directors make to accurately depict American counterterrorism forces. Enough to check the final loans - in the list of more than a dozen American officers and officers. The film accurately depicts the FBI controlling the hostage situation, but transfers it to the US Army Delta forces (which are not named in the film, since the Pentagon still denies their existence at this time) as soon as the president abandoned the Posse Commitatus Act US code. In the end, the US Army forces are precisely clothed and armed. And even using AH-64 Apache for air support â€” which may seem a bit excessive, is not terribly unrealistic. Much more expensive and frankly better films depict American counterterrorism forces with much less accuracy.
