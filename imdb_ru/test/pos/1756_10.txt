Hello again, I've been thinking about this movie all my life. I saw this when I was 5 years old in Los Angeles, California, in 1942. What a wonderful story about how to be good to each other, kindness and mercy. You forget that these are errors related to each other. It was as if they were human. I love this film and my adult children. Such a beautiful color in this film. I need to see this movie again. The film has a story about an envelope, and I just can't remember why. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your attention.
