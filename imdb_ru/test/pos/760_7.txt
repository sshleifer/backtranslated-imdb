I had never heard of this movie before I stumbled upon it when I looked through the shelves at the local box office. Having just reviewed the latest issue of the Harry Potter book, I was intrigued by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. Reading the description on the back of "an overly zealous evangelical Christian benefactor" and identifying myself as an evangelical Christian, I myself thought: "Oh, this should be interesting." And so it was. I found the story of Mr. Brock beautiful both in words and in images; and unfortunately everything is too familiar. The contrast that he spent between interpretations of Ben's parents about what it means to be a Christian was a sharp commentary on how Christians see themselves and how perceptions affect others. On the one hand, we have Ben's mom, who says: “Whatever happens behind these walls, Ben, we are God's ambassadors. We show the world a smiling face. ” Ben's dad, on the other hand, discusses the truth in his preaching at the beginning of the film. At the end of his monologue, he states: “The more a person demonstrates his Christianity for the benefit of others, the less I am inclined to trust the Christianity that they demand. God tells us that true faith is the freedom to choose the truth. Now, as you express it, the way, the manner, the means at your disposal, these things don't matter, whether you are a Christian or an atheist, unless you are true in your heart. ” If only our churches were full of Christians who attributed to this last definition what it means to be a follower of Jesus, not the first. Who cares what to do! Being a Christian and a psychologist, I would like to have an imperfect but genuine faith in a perfectly polished image on any given day. What a tragedy ?? to feel that I always need to play a role when, in fact, I just need to rest in the freedom to be completely what God created me. I think Mr. Brock gives a refreshing insight into how this freedom looks in Christ. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to take a fresh look at faith.
