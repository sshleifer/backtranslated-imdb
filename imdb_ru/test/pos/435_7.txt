It was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall. In many ways, this reminds me of Hollywood musicals from the 40s and 50s, as there are many clichés in it that lead to the inevitable conclusion (“Will the show go on?”). Although, of course, all this is not new, it was pleasant and well done. The musical numbers at the end are frantic and beautiful to watch. In many ways, this reminds me of a more sexual version of the GREAT ZIGFELD. In real life, Siegfeld was a real player, but it was sanitized in an American film. But in the FRENCH LANGUAGE, the characters have fully functioning libido, but in fact nothing is shown, so the film is suitable for children. <br /> <br /> Nothing new, but nevertheless well done.
