In my opinion, this is the best film about the ninja, and if you have not seen it yet, its worth a look. I would rate this movie on 10/10 if you want to see more, and then watch http://uk.geocities.com/ninja3thedomination The opening sequence where the evil ninja kills everyone in his path is excellent, his character is the best. Then he must have a young woman who finds him dying. Then she must take revenge on the cops who killed him, which means that there are more murders and actions. But only a ninja can destroy a ninja, so she and her boyfriend, who is also one of her goals, enlist the support of Yamada (Sho Kosugi) to free the evil ninja spirit and destroy it.
