I have always loved French films, because I think they are filled with much more emotions and feelings than Americans. This film is a pearl. <br /> <br /> Beginning with a wedding that is so funny that you just want to join them, and in the end, little family children tell us who is who, who is very funny. Catherine Deneuve is just hot and so good that it is perfectly possible that a young man can fall in love with her, and Vincent Lyndon is perfect for this role. The best scene (except for the wedding party) is a family reunion, when Antoine became angry and shouts to Lee in front of the family. It is a pity that I could buy this film only from the French, and not from the British (so I have to learn French to enjoy viewing) !!
