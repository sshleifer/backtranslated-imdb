The movie was great and all that, but there were a lot of mistakes in the “football” scenes, I wonder if any of the guys who worked on the movie had seen a football match before ...? First, I do not understand how she wanted to try herself in the boys team? in football, boys and girls cannot play on the same team, and these are FIFA rules. And don't start me with someone whom, when they found out that she is really a girl, they allowed her to continue playing ... !! secondly, players cannot paint their faces with colors and play like that, again FIFA rules are not mine. <br /> <br /> and do not force me to start with how they score goals, it was ridiculous, completely unrealistic. and it seemed to all the players that they did not know Jack about football. <br /> <br /> and when the duke coached Viola, why did they focus only on shooting, what happened to Paz and dribbling. or shot her only problem ?! and what the hell were all the posters on the wall in their room for Chelsea players ?! Don't they like other players from other teams? as if it was the only team they know ...! but besides this, the film was good, and the rest I liked, just training and playing scenes were unreal for me. they really had to consult someone about them ...!
