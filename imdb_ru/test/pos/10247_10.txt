Some people may call "Coolie High" the same as "American Graffiti", but I would not. For starters, in AG, they were all white, while in CH, they were all black. In addition, it has a Motown soundtrack. In particular, the film tells about several students of the African-American working class in 1964 in Chicago and their antics. The film is mainly about family life and relationships. In their apartments, we see that there are never dads around. But these young people always know how to live life to the fullest. <br /> <br /> One thing that really distinguishes this film from most other images of black people is that the teenagers in this film are depicted as very responsible, worried about the missing school. Two really funny scenes - a gorilla scene and one white guy in the movie. But overall, the main star is the soundtrack. This is truly one of the best soundtracks in film history (we even have it on vinyl at home). Classic in the truest sense of the word.
