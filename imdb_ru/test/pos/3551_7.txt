John Barrymore plays a gentleman who is also a thief, Arsen Lupine. Although no one knows for sure that this is the case, the inspector (Lionel Barrymore) is sure of this, but cannot prove it. So, Lionel spends most of the film following John - hoping to catch this brilliant and slippery thief. <br /> <br /> Although I liked the film, I really think I had high expectations and it could be better than just having a very good time. This is because in the film he played John and Lionel Barrymore, and since these brothers were such dynamic actors, I think I was expecting sparks and magic, but instead I only glimpsed her here and there. This does not mean that this is a bad film, of course not. He just did not rise to the level of unforgettable or film, which I strongly recommend you to watch. Thanks to an adequate script, the film is pretty good, but I was surprised when I did not hear the French accents in the film at all, although it was supposedly about the French! In addition, the film did not have much life until it was almost complete. The final was really excellent and interesting - so good that it raised the film from 6 to 7. It is nice to see that it ended on a high note.
