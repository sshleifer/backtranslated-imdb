(This was edited for space) <br /> <br /> Chan-wook Park's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Nominally, a horror film, the central character is a vampire, in the film there are elements of comedy, theology, melodrama, cultural invasion (and the analogue of viral invasion into the body), romance and some other things. This is a film that has too much on mind. The film takes its own things and mixes them with classical European literature, in this case “Terez Raken” by Emil Zola. This is a strange mixture that does not always turn into a gel, but nonetheless has incredible strength. It has been almost 24 hours since I watched the movie at the Lincoln Center (after the film was discussed by the director), and I found that my cell was shaking more and more. The point is not so much what is happening, but the fact that its extensive history and its themes look back at the bells in retrospect. <br /> <br /> There is a will in the plot of the film, beloved by the priest, who decides what is best. Help mankind - voluntarily go to a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. Infected by this disease, he eventually gives up and dies, but due to the blood transfusion of a vampire (this is not explained), he actually survives. Proclaimed a miracle worker, the priest returns to the hospital, where he served as sick. Unfortunately, everything is not very good. The priest thinks he needs blood to survive. He also finds that he has all the typical problems of a vampire, and he cannot go out during the day. Things get even harder when he meets his childhood friend and family again. The priest, awakening some of his animal passions, takes with him the wife of his friend. From there, everything goes sideways. <br /> <br /> This is an ever-changing film. This is a story that rotates in different genres and tells a very human story about a man who discovered that his life has changed radically. by chance and discovers that he is not the one who he represented himself. This is a movie with which you have to stay until the end, because the movie turns into something else forever. It is also a film in which there are many interesting things, and the themes in which he plays are constantly explored in various ways. <br /> <br /> In the film, it’s enough that you can, and people probably write books discussing the movie. <br /> <br /> The two strongest parts of the film are its elements of the vampire and its romance. Part of the vampire story is great. There is something about the way in which the basic rules and nature of “grief” are laid out, which has such perfect meaning that it partly repels the old ideas of vampires. Sitting in the theater last night, I was amazed at how well he worked. I think the fact that he played more or less directly is so amazing. Here is a vampire who just wants to live a normal life. This contrasts with what happens later, and makes it clear that the existence of a hunt for people really does not work. This is not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys, but something else. I personally think that the film turns the playing field from a cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible. (The sequence in which the forces take effect is simply cool) The novel is also superbly handled. Of course, sex scenes are full and well done, but other things, looks, conversations, gestures outside of sex make it special. I like the looks, the quiet looks, when the forbidden couple looks at each other, craving each other and unable to act, disappointment and grief of betrayal, both real and suspect, and the insane passion of a possible conclusion. This is one of the best on-screen novels of all time. He perfectly conveys the feelings and emotions of deep passionate love (and lust). If you have ever loved deeply, I think you will find some part of your hearing on the screen, I know what you did. The statement “I just wanted to spend forever with you” evokes a sad urgency. This is the statement of what was the intention, and the depth of emotions. A tragic romance will break your heart. <br /> <br /> I will not lie to you and say that the movie is perfect and great. It's not as good as in the plays, and almost all of them are great (especially the actors, whom I unfairly called amazing), not always all together. Different genres, thematic elements and melodies sometimes come across each other. I often wondered where the film was going. I was hanging there, although the film seemed to wander aimlessly. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie. I loved the plays more than the film as a whole. Ever since I saw it, it has been hanging in my head, and I suppose that it will be like this for a few more days. It doesn’t matter to love or to love, because this film is really worth seeing, because there is so much to it that it will give you enough material to think and talk a few days later. One of the saddest and most intense films of the year.
