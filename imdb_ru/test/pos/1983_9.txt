eXistenZ combines the traditional love of director David Cronenberg for blood, blood and exploding heads with the more intricate aspects of the reality-twisting David Lynch film. And it actually works efficiently. I will not try to give here even a brief description of the plot, because it will only cause even more confusion. All you need to know is that a movie about a virtual reality computer game that is so incredibly realistic that it becomes difficult to tell the difference between reality and virtual reality. It seems that at the end of the film, he almost gives up his technological fear, but then he adds the last turn in the very last line of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> There are also very rude sexual imagery based on the ports' biography in the backs of the main characters, as well as some very rude acts from Jude Law. He manages to prove himself as a naive, stupid, boring and any other annoying skill that you can think about. Jason Jennifer Lee looks much better, and everyone else can be called a secondary character, including Willem Defoe in the functional, albeit inconspicuous role of a mechanic who is crazy about money. Overall, eXistenZ is a very effective sci-fi film about the possibilities that technology can present and the possible consequences it will receive.
