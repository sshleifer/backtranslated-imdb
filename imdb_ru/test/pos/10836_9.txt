This was recommended to me by a friend who said that it was cute and sweet for a "lesbian sex click". The boy was wrong. I think he just did not understand. Growing up, not understanding, and then recognizing oneself through trial and sorrow, it’s more like that. <br /> <br /> Characters are full and vibrant, and theatrical performances tell you enough fun to interest anyone. <Br /> <br /> Rachel Sterling in the role of “Nan” is doing everything possible to find the love she dreams of, only to find that it was the only person she was also afraid to reveal, and ran away. Johdi Mae as Flo was wonderful. I spent a couple of hours trying to remember where I had seen her before, only to find that she was the quiet sister of "Alice" in "The Last of the Mohicans." Fortunately, I grew up in a liberal family and had no problems trying to make a movie like this. So many people miss such films. I'm glad I took my friend's advice and tried it. But I'm sure I liked it more than him.
