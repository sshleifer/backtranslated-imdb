So, Ghoulies 4 is bad. And there is not even a ghoul in it. And the game is bad. The storyline is stupid. But I forgot to mention how funny this movie is. It's so polite and so funny that it's too fun not to enjoy. There are only 2 ghouls in the film, and they do not seem to be related to the ghouls in another film. But they are pretty funny. And it's funny that Jonathon Graves is returning for it. If you saw the first one, he was a character in this. In my opinion, this is better than the first. There are several classic scenes and several classic lines, one of which is in the grocery store. "Attention K-Mart Shoppers!" Watch it if you like bad movies. This is so bad, this is good. And did I mention that Barbara Aline Woods is hot?
