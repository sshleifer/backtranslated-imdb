People of my generation and those who are older know about World War II (or, as they call it in Russia - the Great Patriotic War) not only from school textbooks, but also from witnesses and participants in the event. My grandfather was a soldier at Stalingrad, and when I was a little girl, I listened to his stories about how he defeated the Germans. He also told me a few jokes, not everything he told me was grim. But it was a long time ago, and no, when I consciously interested in what happened in the Battle of Stalingrad, I have to turn to books and movies for information. Anyway, most of the films I saw were made in the Soviet Union, only a few in modern Russia. And Stalingrad is an exception. In the film, the war is described from the opposite side, and the fact is interesting. Everything shown in the film is very different from what I'm used to. <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of the Remark book “Zeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben” because the war is shown through the usual perception of a German soldier. And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed, repeating that he is not a fascist at all. The heroes of the film come straight from the neat and enthusiastic Europe, from the Italian coast, to the snowy, hungry Soviet Union. They are doomed to death; this is clear from the start. <br /> <br /> After the elite squad took part in their first battle at Stalingrad, one of the soldiers uttered a phrase that reflected the whole idea for me; he said: "If you start thinking, you will go crazy." And, in my opinion, this is also true for the audience. On the one hand, you might think: well, I’ll just watch this movie and it will not dispel me, I don’t need to feel sorry for the people on the screen, because they attacked my country, and not vice versa. . Probably when the lieutenant restrains tears, seeing Kolya’s execution. <br /> <br /> “Stalingrad” is difficult to observe, all these frostbitten legs, dirt, executions, snow, hunger, destroyed illusions. <br /> <As far as I know, Lieutenant Hans von Witzland is one of the few films where Thomas Kretschmann played his star roles. I watched quite a lot of Hollywood films, where he was given unimportant pieces of french fries, for example, “Next” or “Transsiberian” (why did he do this?!). And after I watched Stalingrad, I can't see the desire of European actors to star in American films, even second-rate at any price. This fact deeply puzzles me. I think that Thomas Kretschmann deserves better details and much better scenarios than those given to him in Hollywood. And from what I saw with him, "Stalingrad" - the best, no doubt. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the worst disadvantage of Stalingrad is the way they speak Russian in the film. I mean, of course, those who should be Russian. Say, a boy who spent some time with the Germans, or a girl with whom they planned to escape. Was it really so hard to find actors capable of uttering a couple of phrases without this terrible accent? At first, I looked at Stalingrad to listen to German speakers, because I was learning a language. I did not expect anything extraordinary from the film. But it made an impression on me, made me cry when I wasn't going to at all. I know that I was late for 15 years to watch it, but “Stalingrad” is not an ordinary film, and after 15 years it is still watchable and shocking.
