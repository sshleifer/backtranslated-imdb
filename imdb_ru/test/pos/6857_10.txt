With Anatomy, German film producers have tried to do something completely new. Usually, these are just dramatic or comedy films - a horror genre (or was) completely new at the time. <br /> <br /> The story is also new and shocking. Franca Potente brilliantly plays her role, and, I bet, you wonâ€™t know who the killer is. It is possible, but difficult. A really great movie with a lot of talented actors.
