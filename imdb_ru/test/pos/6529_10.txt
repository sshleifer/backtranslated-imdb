I just realized, and this is a great movie! I like it! Although Jane Brightons is voicing that the beginning is so annoying because because of her braces she doesn’t open her crazy mouth ... but you need to watch this because it is a great movie !! the things he says here are so funny and very cute !! and I'm sure Aaron will probably say some things in real life, because I don't know, it just seems like that !! haha, there is a part in this movie that is really funny ... her sister Jane is dating him ... but I can't tell you what's going on, because the patient just has to let you see yourself !! I went to see Aaron's concert and it was so much fun !! n he smelled so good haha ​​... I still can not believe that I should meet him !!! I have photos if someone wants to see them! Steph
