This event has defined an era of struggle, which, in my opinion, cannot be compared today. Colorful characters - in their stereotypical outfit - bring a certain charm to the show, which has since been raped by society and overexposed. The fight was a bit innocent then. The child could watch it without watching the episode with Jerry Springer. <br /> <br /> Looking back (I was 5 then), although I loved both the Warrior and Hogan, I think I enjoyed the Warrior because of his mystery. Hogan was a brand hero who had an impressive public image. The Absolute Warrior, on the other hand, was a man in a few words in a mask - a hero, not in the center of attention of another audience. <br /> <br /> This rivalry was as exciting as a child, because of this, the duality in me is played out for each fighter. I had a place for both of them. Since there was bloodshed in this long and hard battle, the stakes were high â€” at least for me as a child. At the same time, because of Hogan's defeat, it made him more humane - I remember how sorry I felt for him. <br /> <br /> All these emotions in the soap opera of the young boy made Wrestlemania VI such a great time to witness this game.
