In this film, some of the best conversations ever written. All the really good lines are given to George Scott, a man who knew what to do with lush dialogue. I just watched this movie again, for the first time in more than 20 years, and the dialogue is as good as ever. The bizarre events in the hospital are so creative that they can hit you. They often include such wonderful poetic justice that they are almost brilliant. I love this film!!
