During the Southern Independence War, GENERAL SPANKY mobilizes to protect local women and children from the invasion of the Yankees. <br /> <br /> In 1936, Hal Roach decided it was time for his popular children from our OUR Gang to disperse. in random feature films. With great success, Shirley Temple in the two films of the Civil War period in 1935 (Little Colonel, The Little Rebel) was quite natural that Roach would look for the same direction for his Gang. Despite the fairly generous production and distribution of MGM, GENERAL SPANKY was not a critical or box office success. Little gangsters will now stick to short plots. <br /> <br /> Despite being given the highest and the leading role, George Spunky Macfarland is rivaled by little Billy, Buckwheat Thomas, throughout the first half of the film. Here were two of the best young actors who have ever appeared in American films. With the experience of old, experienced professionals, these two players could steal scenes and hearts with equal bravado. Constant joy, without a false note between them, they provide the main reason for watching a movie today. <br /> <br /> Phillips Holmes gives a quiet, gentlemanly representation of Spankyâ€™s adult defender. Almost forgotten now, Holmes was a good actor who died too early during World War II. The genius Ralph Morgan is especially good as a sympathetic Union general - his scenes from Spunky are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Other OUR GANGERS appear in the middle of the film, especially Karl ?? Alfalfa Switzer; does he get to trill ?? Before the battle, mom. 'Even the pretty Rosina Lawrence (the school teacher of the Gang) appears to play the beloved Holmes. <br /> <br /> Irving Picel is particularly slimy because the cowardly cardiologist has become a vengeful captain of the Yankees. Clumsy Willy Best and furious Louise Beaver play Miss Lawrence's slaves. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that there is racism in the film, which is not uncommon for Hollywood of that era, but almost completely absent in the original series OUR GANG Shorts. <br /> <br /> 19th century music lovers will love to pay attention to the soundtrack, which is a series of ancient melodies.
