I cannot argue with other commentaries that the storyline focuses more on the romance between the characters Mary Martin and Allan Jones, in many ways in the spirit of Showbot than on the life of Victor Herbert. But in the 30s it was a box office? Instead of VH Life, perhaps it should have been VH Music. It is in abundance. <br /> <br /> For me, the thrill of the film began towards the end of the film when Suzanne Foster sings "Land of Romance". More than ten years have passed since the second time I made this film in the local theater of “old films”. At first the spectators were stunned; then it broke out with spontaneous applause. I remember a shiver running up and down my spine. My memories of little things reminded me of the information provided to a local journalist by a curious public when the film first came out in the late 1930s. “This note, released by Miss Foster, was much higher than high C.” <br /> <br /> She may not have been four octaves in the spirit of Yma Sumac, but the teenager then certainly had a range!
