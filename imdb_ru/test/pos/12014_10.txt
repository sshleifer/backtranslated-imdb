Night Crossing reflects the feelings that the vast majority of East Germans experienced from 1961 to 1989. I lived in West Berlin for most of 1967 and weekly traveled through the Wall to East Berlin. What for? Excitement, crossing the border into a country ruled by the Soviet Union, experiencing the smells and sensations of East Germany, which is why Night Crossing is excellent, it captures this feeling and excites. I was arrested by Vopos at Checkpoint Charlie, and he was approached by a man in his leather coat and dark glasses, which I suppose was Stasi. When I watch a movie, I smell cheap diesel and vegetable oil, I see outdated cars, dim clothes that the public wore, and dim products in shop windows. It brings back memories of how lucky I was to live in a free country. In 1988, I traveled through the GDR from east to west, from north to south. East Germany has changed little since 1967. Trabants, constantly collapsing, were still the main type of private transport, there was still nothing in the shops that could seduce me, the uniform was still common, but people, ordinary people were nice when you won their trust. Watch Night Crossing, it's as close to the truth as any movie you see in divided Germany, even closer than the other two favorites, “The Spy Who Came from the Cold” and “The Funeral in Berlin”.
