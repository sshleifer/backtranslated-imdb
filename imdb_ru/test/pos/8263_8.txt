At the beginning of the 19th century, a young woman with a hare coat condemns the ambitions of her family and the prejudices of the local community, but she meets a man who can see her differently and simply can change Pru's life forever. <br /> <br /> “Precious Bane” is an adaptation of the British Broadcasting Corporation to the well-known novel by Mary Webb. This is a beautifully filmed piece that meets incredibly high standards, the story {the script of Maggie Wady} is excellent, and the details of the period and the use of the dialect are second to none. It is a pity that this film has not yet been released on DVD, one would have thought that with Clive Owen (great here, like Gideon) would become a celebrity, the BBC would get it, but unfortunately not, so the only way to catch it in very rare when TCM shows it. The main role of Janet McTyr in the role of Pru Sarn is simply gorgeous, courage and sincere emotions go hand in hand, as McTyr gives her everything. Pru has to contend not only with the disfigurement of his face, but also with the constant insults and sufferings of ignorant villagers. This is the time when people believed that if a hare runs in front of a pregnant woman, it means death, bull baiting time, time of superstitions and talking about witches. Despite constant setbacks, Pru is strong and resourceful, even her own family rejects dreams without even realizing it, but this path may well be terribly bumpy, but hope is eternal, and Pru has hope in abundance. <Br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
