A very gentle retelling of Shakespeare's play (and much more outspoken than the Forbidden Planet). On Cassavetis it is always pleasant to watch, and even more so that Gene Rowlands divides attention. His view of the role of Prospero is well suited for the kind of rude all-knowing expression he brings to history. This is especially true in the scene when, after seeing his alienated wife and her lover in a speedboat, he causes a storm (accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate choice from Go to Stomu Yamashty). This is only one of the moments of the film, when the line between reality and fantasy becomes blurred, and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more likely than you can imagine. Add to this the excellent performance of Raul Julie, as well as the good work of Susan Sarandon, Vittorio Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and the film will be a pleasant little occupation to take place behind your eyes.
