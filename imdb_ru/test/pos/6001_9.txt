Lemuel Gulliver (Ted Danson) - a doctor who goes missing in the sea, leaving pregnant wife Mary (Mary Steenbergen) behind. Eight years later, he appears, disheveled and seemingly insane, chatting about his adventures on the lands of tiny Lilliputians, giant Brobdingnags, the floating island of intellectual Laputs and hoyonnms, a race of intelligent, talking horses that have to deal with Yahoos - a race of bestial people - among many other adventures. Not very good Dr. Bates (James Fox), who has plans for his wife Lemuel, put Gulliver in a mental hospital, and Lemuel, Mary and son Thomas (Tom Sturridge) must find a way to prove their sanity. <br /> <br /> A magnificent adaptation of the satirical novel by Jonathan Swift, this film is a magnificent adaptation on various levels: history, satire, characters, visual effects, a brilliant cast. It’s just fun to watch, and it’s almost amazing, considering that it was a film made for television. <br /> <br /> The film brilliantly captured Swift's sinister satire, which pierces the British ax in society at the time, but still resonates today. Wise Brobdingnagi and Hoynnma - almost perfect people who are almost impossible to understand why Gulliver speaks with such pride in the vices and evils of his society. The scenes where Gulliver struggles to prove that he is not the same as Yaho are perhaps the best, with biting satire in describing how they choose their leaders ("they seem to choose the worst among them ... who rules until he finds someone else worse ”) to go to war (“ We enter the war only for a very good reason - for example, if they are weaker than us, or we want their whole land ”), etc. Scenes with Laputa are also effectively made - intellectuals are so in their specialized fields that they have no time for something else, and they are acting have a little common sense. And adding the asylum line to the story greatly improves the story — Dr. Bates is a really nasty personage, and when he talks about investigating Gulliver’s alleged flaws, it becomes quite clear that he describes his own shortcomings. <br /> <The film uses beautiful and rather convincing CGI-effects, depicting very diverse settings of the novel with great effect. The contrast of sizes is made in a very skillful way, and all the worlds depicted in history are convincing in their own way. The cinematography (especially concerning the asylum) and the costumes are brilliantly made. Editing a gift with Lemuel’s memories is a device that can be inconvenient, but works very well. <br /> <br /> The cast is really great; real who is who is who of british and american talents. Ted Danson as Gulliver demonstrates an excellent multi-layered game, effectively showing his transformation from a man bewildered by his strange surroundings into a crazy state in which he was, when he reappears, to his rational, intellectual personality at the end. Danson, best known for his work on the sitcom, shows that he is not just Sam Malone in this wonderful serial-comic play. Mary Steenburgen is effective as his wife, and James Fox is absolutely disgusting like Bates. The rest of the cast consists mainly of cameos: Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Warwick Davis, Kristin Scott Thomas, Geraldine Chaplin, Alfre Woodward, Edward Fox and Sir John Gilgud - the most memorable, but even the smallest. the pieces are very well played. <br /> <br /> The book Gulliver's Travels, although not 100% true to the book, is a triumph of history and images. This is not to be missed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
