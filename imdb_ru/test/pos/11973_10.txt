“Observers” is a funny film, if you do not take it seriously, Dean R. Kunz’s novel is obviously much better, but the film itself is interesting in its own way. In the film, there are a lot of changes for the novel “Observers”, the only difference is the main character Travis. In the book, he was an adult and retired Delta Force soldier, while in the film he is a teenager. The audience has its advantages, the film has several bloody scenes in parts. I am a fan of Michael Ironside, and it was great to see him in this film, he always performs superbly in all his films. The OXCOMHOM suit looks a bit strange, but the camera never shows the creature fully until the end of the film. The Einstien dog was impressive, as it was well trained. <br /> <br /> In the film, two genetic experiments escaping from the laboratory: a dog and a monster. Both experiments are telepathically related, since the two animals are part of a military project, if a dog penetrates the enemy base, then the Creature will attack and destroy them. The dog finds a teenager named Travis, who takes him home and discovers that he is smart, and therefore he calls Einstein's dog, while OKSKOM wanders around, killing people and hitting his eyes, two government agents are sent to find two experiments before of this. The incident is out of control. Soon, Travis learns that he is dangerous, as OXCOM is attracted to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in his path, so Travis and his mother go to rescue his girlfriend, who is kept in the hospital by two agents. Then they hide in the forest, while government agents and OKKSOM do not lag behind. <br /> <br /> Observers are not the best adaptation of Dean R. Kunz’s novel, but this is an exciting 80s horror film, some book fans may not want to watch it because it’s not true to the book, but fans of raw horror films are 80- x may want to check it out.
