TV presenter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her radical operator Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are at a nuclear power plant when a serious accident occurs. Plant managers downplay it, but Adams took it all down. Wells and Adams try to air it, but the corporation that controls the plant prevents it. Plant manager Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) understands that there are serious problems, and the tests have been rigged. He is trying to make the leaders believe him - only they know that. Wells, Adams and Godell believe that their lives are in danger. <br /> <br /> I saw it at the cinema in 1979. I was only 17 years old and it scared me. Worse, an accident occurred at Three Mile Island, which made the film even more real. Seeing him after 20 years doesn’t scare me, but it’s still a great movie - it works like a mystery, a thrilling drama and a revelation of nuclear energy. Fonda (with red hair) plays one of her best roles in the role of Wells - she perfectly conveys the growing suspicion and horror of her character when she realizes that a nuclear disaster can occur. Lemmon is (as always) excellent. He begins to believe in his company and work and slowly begins to disintegrate when he begins to sort things out. For this, he was rightly nominated for an Oscar. Douglas is good, but he has a small role, and Lemmon and Fonda completely overshadow him. <br /> <br /> A truly wonderful film - one of the best 70s. Do not miss it!
