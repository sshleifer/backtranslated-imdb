What you saw in BULLITT and the FRENCH CONNECTION is nothing compared to what you have here. The chase lasts about 15 minutes and is the best you've ever seen. This film has become a classic crime drama since the heyday of the 70s. This is a rough and realistic image of the mean streets of New York. With one of the smartest guys ever to appear on the screen, Tony Lo Biancoâ€™s behavior in this movie is cool as ice. He disrupts his partners and makes it appear as if the police are responsible for them. His childhood friend, Roy Shader, is a street detective who is puzzled by the disappearance of thugs. You can say that Lo Bianco enjoys playing throughout the entire movie. Although sometimes the film becomes boring, but then when you feel that you want to abandon it, something big happens and it draws you back. Don Ellis's bill sets the tone for a cold gray winter in New York and to top it off, my man Joe Spinell appears in one of the first roles in the role of Tordano in the garage. <br /> <br /> Rated 7 out of 10 stars
