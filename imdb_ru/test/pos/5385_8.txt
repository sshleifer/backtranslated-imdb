I have seen this film since 1918 recently in our local Helsinki Film Archive. It seems that the Danish Film Institute reconstructed it in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Nordisk film company, which was one of the largest in the world at the beginning of the 20th century. I believe that at the moment in Europe there are several copies circulating with English translations. <br /> <br /> The film seemed fascinating to me, and the trip to Mars was well thought out. The storyline is certainly original, but I really donâ€™t want to reveal it at the moment, as now there is a danger of spoiling things for you ;-). <br /> <br /> The film is also available on DVD, request the web pages of the Danish Film Institute (Det Danske Filminstitut) at dfi.dk using Himmelskibet for more information.
