Jack Webb's image of a maritime training instructor who forms new recruits in basic training does not require any interpretation. Straight, straight, straight, it all applies to this classic. At a time when the analysis of the statements of our leaders is necessary in order to understand what they are saying, this film does not play games with our language or our moral wave. Good and evil are clear and easily determined. If you like a clear, well-understood dialogue in a disciplined military environment, this film should suit you.
