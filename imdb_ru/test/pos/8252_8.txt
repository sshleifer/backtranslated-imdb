I remember that I watched this movie in the mid-80s, I thought it was a well-planned and well-played part. Now, I often work at Berkeley Square, and I had to get a copy of the DVD to remind myself how little the territory has changed, although my office has been updated, it is only 30 seconds from the “bank”. Even the Jack Barclays car dealership still sells Bentley and Rolls Royce there. <br /> <br /> It looks like the DVD will be released soon in Region 2. I have a very poor quality copy 1. Let's hope they removed it. <br /> <br /> Just a little tricky escape from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great movie, but I think that this corresponds to the caper tag with which the movie comes.
