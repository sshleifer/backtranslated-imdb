This is an incredible movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a good yarn, and it is vividly told in a series of memories and alternative points of view. What was intentional, and what was a coincidence? Who loves whom? <br /> <br /> You get the opportunity to put yourself in the place of each of the characters in turn (sometimes literally), and this helps to determine each character with sufficient depth. <Br /> <br /> With a little effort after turns, you can understand each of the characters; and key events in the film are reviewed from the perspective of different people. <br /> <br /> Take the opportunity if itâ€™s about the Arthouse Cinema again; it looks good on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Most likely, you will not guess, the plot is distorted so much that you just sit and watch what is unfolding - I can not predict to anyone! <br /> <br /> But, most likely, you will need more than one viewing - I saw it in the photos in the original issue three times, and each time everything became better. <br /> <br /> The game was very good, with outstanding success. the performance of Romana Bringer as Alice, torn in three directions by three other characters of the ensemble. <br /> <br /> Classic. The second best film of the 1990s.
