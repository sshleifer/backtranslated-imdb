Chris Smith is an excellent director with a rare talent to see a good story and then get out of the way. Smith's “American Cinema” is a real recording of a film that film director Mark Borchardt, a loser, tends to milk his elderly uncle for cash to complete his short horror. But never, under any circumstances, do not try to find paid work or support the children he conceived. <br /> <br /> Such is the skill of producer Smith that Mark looks more sympathetic than otherwise. Even though he seduces Uncle Bill with his dreams filled with sugar and the credits of an executive producer, he desperately wants to be someone to match his name with the likes of Scorsese and Spielberg who touch us. <br /> <br /> “American Film" also belongs to that rare, often undertaken, but rarely achieved subgenre, which successfully combines fun and horror. Humor comes from Ed Wood's belief in the Borchardt style in his genius. From his terrifying attempts at acting, from the fact that he replaced his mother, not savvy in films, a lost operator, and from his hiring sweet, but brain-damaged friend Mike, when he has little actor or team member. <br /> <br /> The horror arises from the fact that Borchardt can not: this is America. His attitude, “I want, so I have the right,” keeps him from knowing how much he needs to know about his chosen craft. He is so sure that he cannot fail, that failure is guaranteed.
