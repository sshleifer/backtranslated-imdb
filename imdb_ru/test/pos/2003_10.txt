(Possible spoilers are included, but nothing critical is given.) <br /> <br /> I just watched this classic low-budget movie on video and was amazed at the level of energy present on the screen. All the actors are proud of themselves, especially John Daniels, should see another of his films. Not only does this movie boast excellent performance, it also manages stylish episodes, for example, when a baron throws someone out of a window, and we see pieces of glass falling into a pool that erupts from a fallen manâ€™s blow, I like how slowly Photographing was used in the 70s cinema, dreamy and hypnotic. Cool and witty black guys spew out great liners, while the slimy clumps of white garbage end in unpleasant ends. I like my rating is 10/10. If it ever comes out on DVD, consider me a purchase.
