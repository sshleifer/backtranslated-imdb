The idea of ​​marital fidelity presented in the film seems obsolete today, but it is precisely the adherence of the main characters to this concept that makes the whole story so touchingly tragic. It is this concept that ennobles them and allows them to stand out when they refer to their respective spouses, “not to be like them.” <br /> <br /> As Tony Leung said in the film, love just happens, There should not be a rational explanation of how this happens, it's just like that. Despite the fact that they did not want to stoop to the level of their spouses, it happened. Devotion, social mores and terms all conspired against the fact that these relations were realized. Just being in love is far from enough. <br /> <br /> I was not lucky to sit next to a young couple (still at the university because of fragments of conversations they kindly told me throughout the film and were not associated with the pain of lost love and missed opportunities). Their complete inability to digest the subtlety and the deeper emotions caused made me realize how much a film, such as this one, as well as other works by Wong Kar Wei, is being spent on a local audience.
