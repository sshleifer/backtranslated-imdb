Overview without any spoilers. <br /> <br /> I saw this film yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival. My first reaction is surprise and happiness. I am so glad that such films are being made in our age of blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Roy Andersson's new film “You live” is nothing more than a complete masterpiece. You, The Living consists of 50 vignettes shot on a static camera. I will not hand out the content of the scenes here, because I hate it when people spoil even the smallest details. But, yes, most of the scenes made 1000 people in the Claude Debussy Theater completely baffled and amazed. When the film was finished, we applauded for a few minutes and we had no other choice. <br /> <br /> What is the "You live" account. Hmm, Andersson is not afraid to answer hard questions; History, wine, gend. The Holocaust during World War II is a big topic (and these topics work beautifully together). <br /> <br /> The created images are brilliant, the depth sometimes exceeds “Songs from the second floor”. <br /> <br /> Well, sorry for this ranting, praise feedback. Look for the Flying House in the front row! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars are a Masterpiece (I never throw this rating away).
