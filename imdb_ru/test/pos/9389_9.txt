I love horror movies. However, I’m usually not a big fan of "so stupid that it’s ridiculous." I MUST rate it so high, simply because Death Bed: the bed that eats is so unique and so original. There are a lot of question marks, lots of spaces and the WTF coefficient is increased to 11, but I was not bored for a second. I really couldn't call it creepy at any moment, Every minute I told myself "what the hell is this bed / movie going to do next!" I watched it with a friend who is in no way a fan of horror or B-movies, and even she liked it. The effects were very creative, the colors and atmosphere were pretty good. it retains a very consistent and even tone throughout most of the film (albeit an incredibly ridiculous sequence), and the action was not HORRIBLE. I can see from the fact that there are certain inconsistencies in the bed actions that make it almost impossible to suspend faith, but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept that this fact did not bother me. seriously, for me this film got into that realm, which I will not only never forget, but I guarantee that I will think about some scenes in the future. Does anyone else know about any other films in inanimate objects that feed on people of the genre? absolutely fantastic
