I go to the cinema to have fun. I was very entertained by the first film in this series: The Da Vinci Code. It had a lot of twists to make me very interested. Angels and Demons are no different. If you liked the DaVinci code, then you will certainly enjoy this movie. "Angels and Demons" are made mostly in the same style as the previous film, but faster, which I liked. Ron Howard kept me glued to his place for two whole hours, not missing a drop. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about this film is that, although it’s obviously fictional, they leave quite a real story to it that seems very plausible. If there is something that I didn’t like in this film, it’s that the plot itself is very incredible (I don’t want to give any spoilers). But hey, this is a movie. I was entertained by all this and was very pleased with what I saw.
