in times of predictable films that abound in violence, cheap romance and melodrama, it is surprisingly surprising to find such a strange film. The plot itself is irresistible, and the actors are excellent, especially Alan Rickman. If you want to watch a movie that does not give all the answers before asking questions, a movie that will surprise you (in good or bad) is Dark Harbor for you. And if you are not sure, believe me, that the performance of Alan Rickman is worth it ... especially at the end, ladies ...
