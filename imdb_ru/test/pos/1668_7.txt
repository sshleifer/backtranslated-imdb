After watching “Naked City” and “Night and City” (which is still my favorite Dassin), I was more than happy to see his “Masterpiece” (O-Word criterion) RIFIFI. <br /> <br /> Now I am a little disappointed with this story. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I have at least the following five questions: <br /> <br /> 1. In the final countdown, Louis Grootter shot and killed the main character, Tony Le Stephanou, from inside the house. He could not know whether he was still alive or not, but he didn’t care, and he ran right behind him (with money) to get to his car. So of course, Tony was not dead and shot him. BIG QUESTION. <br /> <br /> 2. In another important scene, a safe specialist, Cesar, presented a diamond ring (which was part of the robbery) immediately after the robbery to a woman who worked for Louis Groter in a night bar. Stupid, because before this character was not so stupid. And, of course, Louis knew that Tony was planning to rob a precious stone. SMALL QUESTION. <br /> <br /> 3. After the murder of Louis Grutter by gangsters Mario Ferrati and his wife Tony and his best friend Joe planned to take revenge on the gang Louis. At the same time, they do not care about the safety of Joe’s wife and his five-year-old child. Of course, Louis Banda kidnapped her son. Inexpensive and simple. <br /> <br /> 4. Perfect robbery: of course, this is the top 30 minutes. a long scene on the whole plot, without any words spoken for all the time, but was this a perfect robbery? Compared to other films on this subject, I could only smile when, for example, Tony took a fire extinguisher to turn off the alarm clock. Just too. <br /> <br /> 5. The Grüter brigade went to Mario’s house because they knew (but ...) that the jewels would be there. Then they kill Mario and his wife. And then? They are not looking for it! NO. They ran out of the apartment. And more. They do not watch the apartment behind her, so Tony may after a while (it was the same day) pick up the jewels. BIG QUESTION. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good movie. Because of the brilliant 30-minute silent scene of the robbery. Because of a very good cut (The final scene in the car through Paris is amazing). Because of a very good actor named Jean Servé. Because of this black and white fever you will get while watching. For other reasons that another user has written, but please do not tell me that this is an amazing story.
