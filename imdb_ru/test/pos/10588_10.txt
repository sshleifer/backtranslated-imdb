The film was fantastic. If you're a Cky fan of Bams video, a donkey or his Viva La Bam show, you can't help but like it. I have some friends who are not fans who like it, and others who think it is not so great. Those who didn’t like it were mostly girlfriends, they really didn’t appreciate some rude humor that I personally thought made the film so funny. I’m pretty sure that the whole movie was shot in Bams’s hometown, which includes many of its regularly visited places. The cast consists of all his friends and buddies, and also includes some famous skateboarders. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with HIM music. In my opinion, Haggard has it all. Great plot, characters that you will never see anywhere else. A lot of humor, great music and cast, dedicated to the project.
