On the other hand, I like Rachel Ray. She is cheerful, sweet, fresh and such a joy to watch. I have to change almost everything she does, as I am a vegetarian ... but it's nice to see her with a program that shows more of her personality. After all, she is a television personality. I think it's cool that she is so attractive with her fans and still seems mundane. The studioâ€™s audience seems to be rather small, but it just creates a more comfortable atmosphere. Some people published that show sucks. I think it depends on your own interpretation of this and her. If you notice the first episodes of a 30-minute meal, you will see a completely different personality than in the past few years. I am sure that she will find her comfort zone in this show. Good luck, Rachel!
