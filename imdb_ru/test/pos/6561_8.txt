Uzumaki, a visually stunning film, and I don't think anyone can challenge this. But, unfortunately, the story has failed somewhat. <br /> <br /> The film, however, is very interesting. It uses its wild style to tell a somewhat non-existent story. The film almost works, only based on his characters and style, but, in my opinion, leaves much to be desired.
