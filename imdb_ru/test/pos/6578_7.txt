Paha Maa is another Finnish film. But the things that distinguish it are copied abroad. Some narrative techniques are descended from Amores Perrot, Jackie Brown and the Elephant. Scenes shot from different sides. “Paha-maa” is a good film, but it is not so good that the hype says: “A realistic film, without a happy ending and without commercial methods. Some actors did a great job. Sulevi Peltola was as good as the peddler of a vacuum cleaner. Jasper Pyakkönen also demonstrates his skills. But Mikko Leppilampi was so lame. He is such an overvalued actor, he is a handsome and good guy, but not the best actor in Finland. But if you like Finnish films, Paha Maa is worth a look.
