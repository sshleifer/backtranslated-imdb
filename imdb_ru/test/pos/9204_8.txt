Las Vegas is very funny and focuses on the content ..... <br /> <br /> The plots are awesome and the scenes on the street are awesome; All characters are very funny and cool. <br /> <br /> Women are a plus .... <br /> <br /> Holly Sims is cute as the daughter of James Caan, who heads the casino security service. While Josh Duhamel is very funny and allows you to put up with it, he looks like he can kill anyone. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Marcil and Nikki Cox add this special touch. <br /> <br /> from time to time it is very funny and strange. <br /> <br /> You can just relax in this show and not create heavy storylines, like in other TV shows that manage ratings ...
