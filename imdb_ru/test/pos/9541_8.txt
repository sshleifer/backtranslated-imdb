This almost perfect cinematic performance of the popular children's novel Edith Nesbit follows the life of Roberta (Bobby), Phyllis, Peter and their mother after their father was unjustly accused of treason and sent to prison. Do they live in an almost uninhabited house in a country that stands near the railway line? Mom writes stories to earn enough money for food and candles, while children spend most of their time near the train station and, in particular, wave one specific train to “pass on their love to their father.” <br /> <br /> Always an exciting and smart romance, the characters here come to life under the insightful guidance of Lionel Jeffreys (better known as a wonderful character actor). Jenny Agutter plays Bobby, and Sally Tomsett and Gary Warren play her sister and brother. Their mother is Dina Sheridan, while other unforgettable characters are played by Bernard Cribbins (railway perks) and William Mervin (an old gentleman on a train). <br /> <br /> “Children of the railway” are fun entertainment from a different age, but it does its job well. As we watch Bobby grow up, worrying about the lack of a parent struggling with his own needs to be alone and have fun, we can only rejoice when events come together at the end of the picture. In all we have a sense of time and place ?? whether from locomotives, from the pursuit of the university newspaper, or from under the red flannel skirt worn by girls (and used to prevent disasters!).
