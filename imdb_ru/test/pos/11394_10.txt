What should change in today's attitude to films like Boogie Nights is the approach. The approach is terrible! Comparing it with Pulp Fiction, seeing only pornography and all its aspects .. there is more to come to people than in this beautiful movie. And for all skeptics, didn't Paul Thomas Anderson show himself worthy again and again? Magnolia is one of the main reasons why I generally watch American films and still believe in the “industry” that filmmaking is doing today. What about there will be blood? This is a film that will remain in the history of cinema, whether you like it or not! Yes, you! The so-called consumer .. you know something: F # * k you! You do not deserve it, you do not deserve anything. Today, so many artists are struggling to get recognition, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to make serious films, even the mainstream, because people just want celebrities to do stupid things, like Britney Spears sales. it was very painful for me to talk about it because I don’t want to see it, I don’t want to believe that today all that matters is the addition of numbers ... sales revenue and sales revenue ... I want to see magic the magic that Fellini, Bergman and Kurosawa brought and created using the language of the movie ... Because this is what PTA does ... it creates magic !!
