“The Great Dictator” is perhaps one of the most widely known films of Charlie Chaplin. He is notorious for his glaring satire of Adolf Hitler and Nazism. Before watching, I knew only about his fame. Now I know how much the film deserves it. <br /> <br /> The film mainly shows the feats of the somewhat clumsy, ambitious, short-lived and impressive dictator of Tomania, Adenoid Hinkel; and with him, his close and dear employees: Field Marshal Herring and Herr Garbitsch. In addition, this entails the exploits of an amnesic, emotional, and often awkward Jewish barber, a veteran of the First World War. <br /> <br /> Stopping on the plot, I would like to say that this film has various qualities that make it unique and wonderful. While comedy is definitely both oral and dazzling and casual, the entire film shows how seriously it perceives Nazism or aggressive nationalism as a topic with various interludes. Chaplin's impeccable acting skills in the film are widespread and widespread, he continues to gain momentum until he explodes. The position of Paulette Goddard as an ambitious potential uprising of the Jews and Henry Daniel’s supply of the “Calm as death, serious as heart attack” nose line creates an excellent overview. <br /> <br /> Next, one aspect of the film is what makes it so special: it doesn’t pull blows. It is not "secret", it has nothing to do with being secret. This is the “blatant”, crying, in your eyes, blatant alarmism of both Hitler and Nazism. <br /> <br /> Summing up, look. Just look, you will see.
