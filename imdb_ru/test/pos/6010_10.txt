This film is a great example of quality dramas that Channel 4 and BBC have been producing for many years. Ted Danson demonstrates the powerful performance of a man tormented by memories that no one will accept, and by a society that considers him insane. This is a wonderful performance by a man best known for his role in the comedy series Cheers. All supporting actors are very well chosen, not least Mary Steenbergen, Danson's wife, who plays the role of Gulliver's wife in the film. But, above all, it is the smooth and very subtle shifts between our world and the world of Gulliver that make this film. The difference in views between giants and dwarfs acting real actors, perfectly captured. A rare pleasure from cinematography and directing.
