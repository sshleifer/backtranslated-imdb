I found this step beautiful, enjoyable and inspiring. Initially, local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me. Later I was lost in the power of the film. How do you pay a gift from God? The ability of characters to rise above their basic nature and respond to the touch of God warmed my heart. The whole audience applauded at the end of the film. I left the theater with a light step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race. What else can any movie do? Hollywood, I hope you noticed. America loves positive, positive films.
