I first heard about this movie from a friend. She loved it and always watched it. When she told me about it and told how old she was, I immediately decided that I would not like it. I was so wrong. Dirty dancing was such an awesome movie! I love music and dancing. I bought the soundtrack and DVD immediately after watching it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray were great at it. They captured the characters' emotions and feelings so well. They were both such good dancers. After watching the film, I would like to dance just like them, and I hope soon to do ballroom and Latin dances. I became a fan of this kind of dance and now I am fascinated by all the films and programs about it. Dirty dancing revealed my passion for dancing and music. My favorite parts of the film are when the Kid enters the headquarters of the headquarters and sees how they dance, and, obviously, the last scene where the Kid and Johnny dance together before everyone. I think everyone should watch Dirty Dancing at least once in their life. If they do not, it is their loss!
