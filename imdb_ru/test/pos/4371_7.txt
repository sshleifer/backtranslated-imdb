George Carlin is probably my favorite comedian. I saw a lot of his special offers and even had the opportunity to see his performance live. He had a certain cynicism that always attracted me. His last 2 events (especially “Life is worth losing”, “Complaints and resentment”) are devoid of a certain spirit and content. George seemed overweight, old and tired (not to mention withdrawing from rehabilitation). "I SAID NOT TO INTENT IT"! Anyway. Life is worth losing it was especially tragic, because he was overweight, dissatisfied, out of rehabilitation (we are here again ...) and was completely unfunny. If there was a way to pity the comedian, without cutting him off backstage, George achieved this with the help of “Life is worth losing.” As if in the new millennium and after September 11, America tramples on George’s spirit. Bs became too big to manage. <br /> <br /> The return is partially successful with “Bad for you!”. This special conversion is complete. George no longer tries to rekindle his glory days. He fully accepts his age, being old and dealing with the impending prospects of death. He accepted the fact that he was a solid old SOB, and enjoys it. This is better than his previous events, but far from Jammin 'in New York. This is a bit tragic. His observations are no longer advanced and seem more like Andy Rooney than Lenny Bruce. George is no longer George. He no longer criticizes us, but the man in the high castle indicates how things are and how different is modern life. <br /> <br /> This is an improvement over the two previous events, but George has not yet regained his old glory (if ever). It was reduced from critical social and political harsh comments to mostly personal feelings. When he becomes political, he still has something to say. It has been obtained to a large extent (especially if you have seen any of his previous works), but it still works, unlike his random speeches that do not have a certain relevance beyond the baby boom generation. The last 25 minutes is the best this special offer has to offer. <br /> <br /> Now I will worship the Sun and pray to Joe Sands so that George can recreate himself as an ultra-modern septuagar. This is a 50/50 chance. Life seems to have become more tiring for George, and his “art” has now become his life. This is a step in the right direction from his previous two special offers, but he is far from his former self. Where is he going from here? He may never recover, but perhaps he will be able to transform / improve this new or unnecessary old man’s routine even more. There is hope for another 7 words that you cannot say on TV, or at least in a windmill that he can handle.
