This show has an amazing story with good and recognizable actors (such as the girl from Boston Legal and Boris Myasnik from Snatch). Even extras and a guy whom I considered to be a commercial could be a weak link, they surprised me with their skill. These are just the little things that the director should set up. As a guy who makes a summary of the last episode at the beginning of each new episode, should be fired. The presence of the narrator tells you what happened, partly destroys the story. The only other minor problem I encountered was that they sometimes took too much time, but not nearly as long as some shows, such as Prison Break. Does anyone know when they will resume the season?
