This is a good film, I will not go into details, as comments from other users will take good care of this. However, I disagree with the statement that this is Eastwood's best work. It's just not a very protected position, based on the volume of strong films in which he starred and starred. I would like to point out that it is interesting to me that the two actresses who played in this film, Patti Mattik and Peggy Drier, never again appeared in another film or television show, despite good performances. My curiosity makes me wonder what happened to these two actresses?
