A letter to the guys. I tried, guys, I really tried! I tried so hard not to watch this movie. I left the room when it was turned on, or jumped on the computer when my wife watched it. This is her second favorite film, “The Godfather” - the first (which I love). <br /> <br /> In the end, I caught small pieces of this film and, finally, a year later I sat down and watched it with her. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I liked this movie. Dalton plays the magnificent Rett, and his audacity pats. Wally plays the delightful Scarlett. Full of fire and sulfur, and ANYTHING won't stop her. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when it is abroad (Ireland?), and the government is going to demolish the peasant's house because they are in rent. Scarlett is angry at this and is paying the entire debt, thereby making himself a huge name in this small town. <br /> <br /> Everything I say guys, you can try this movie ... especially if you are a fan of Gone with the Wind. It takes a little time to get used to new actors, but I think you will find them refreshing.
