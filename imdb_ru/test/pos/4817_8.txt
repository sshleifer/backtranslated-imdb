The world will miss John Frankenheimer. It was his first feature film, and four years passed before he shot the second, but don’t let it discourage you from his search. Frankenheimer's leadership is guaranteed, and he gets some compelling action from his cast. <br /> <br /> Someone else has pointed them out, but I also want to talk to James Gregory and Whit Bissell in two key support roles. Both will again work for Frangenheimer — Gregory, first of all, the clumsy senator in the Manchurian Candidate — and they will work well here. <br /> <br /> If everything seems too simple in the end, it's just because Frankenheimer and writer Robert Dozier decided to tell a simple story, and they do it well. Stay tuned - Turner Classic Movies movies may appear again.
