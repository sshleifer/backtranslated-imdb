Two years after its first release, Goldeneye still stands in the field of first-person shooters for the Nintendo 64. Even the Quake and Turok series did not have a combination of graphic detail, sound quality, enemy intelligence, complexity, and general fun that I bring back to this game over and over. Each of the missions has specific goals that make you think like Bond, not only to shoot at every villain that appears on your screen, but also to avoid cameras, turn off security systems, save hostages, protect the girl from Bond and so on. In this game a lot of gadgets, including the famous clock. At the heart of the game is the storyline of the film, which includes all the main characters and the best scenes of the film, from jumping on a dam to jumping from a propeller to a tank chase through St. Petersburg. Even the layout is saved where it is possible, so you will recognize different situations if you have seen the movie. Other levels are added to challenge the player and connect scenes a bit more. With each level of difficulty, mission objectives become more difficult, smarter enemies, and bullets are deadly. I still haven't gone through the 00 agent levels. Cheats can be opened not by entering codes or pressing buttons, but by going through certain levels within a certain period of time, and additional characters can be opened for multiplayer. Multiplayer is still the best among first-person shooters. It’s not as clear as a Turk, but it doesn’t slow down much the same ... Tons of options give your friends a reason to blow each other up again and again, and one more time just for kicks. There are better games for the N64, such as Zelda and everything else in Star Wars, but Rare has continued a series of outstanding games with a first-person shooter that has not surpassed and will not be surpassed until in 2000 it surpasses itself with Perfect Dark. .
