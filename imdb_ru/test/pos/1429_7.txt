Proof that a film does not need to have a deep multi-layered history and other complex elements in order to be a good film. Even if the story can be expanded in many directions, especially in a more sociological sense (people crave money), it seems that it is perfect exactly as it is. Through many sudden changes, he brings the viewer to the end without any unnecessary complications and not allowing the viewer to look at the screen. <br /> <br /> But the game is not so good for me. With the exception of Lindsay McKeon, the rest were average or even worse. In some scenes, they just looked empty in front of them. Except for Lindsay, who was more convincing. This is a really simple movie, just relax and enjoy. <br /> <br /> 7/10
