This is one of those rare comedies where you can try as much as you can, you can't help but giggle, laugh, scream and even laugh out loud. Speech of the main actor in the role of Hyde is a purely manic genius. See if you can keep a calm when he is transformed. Good luck. :) On the other hand, there are times when a movie gets stuck. It seemed longer than its 90 minutes.
