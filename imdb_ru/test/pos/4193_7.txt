The Beatles have just completed the Magic Secret Tour. There was a general feeling that the view, the world and the drugs were going along naturally. There was a film subculture in Los Angeles that knew something had happened. Nicholson was in several of these gangs. <br /> <br /> Before he decided to seriously become an actor, there were several experiments to do with this before the “Easy rider”, before the “Pink Flamingos”, before “Day to Night”. Important is the "Manuscript of Zaragoza." This is another one. <br /> <br /> Jack writes. He plays with a circular narration, self-referencing, cinematic references, hatred for the performance itself, the pain of creativity - all this on the outskirts of the safe kid. You should see this, at least find out something about Jack. <br /> <br /> Some actors act in their own way. This is a common technique. Some people dig deep, but after a while they get bored because they are incredibly small people. There are not enough things to support a career. Think of De Niro and Hackman. <br /> <br /> Others are quite interesting people who eventually become more interesting. When they dig in a barrel, they put things back because of the pain of digging. Think Sean Penn and Jack. At the bottom of the barrel of Jack, at the end of the thread that he turns, because the basis of each character is this experimental, risky writer / director. <br /> <br /> Who cares if this is a bad movie? This is bad because he took risks. See how the director wipes a tear from Annette's cheek. This is love stupidity in everything that concerns Brando, about which I heard Marlon laugh. This is one of the richest moments in the history of Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> There is another reason to watch this. Cinema music has deep roots in dance. The cinema revolution often relies on music. Thus, it is possible to reach whole cultures. <br /> <br /> The Unspeakable Giantess Inventing the Dance of Billions - Tony Basil. She was as influential in pop choreography as the Beatles in music. She was already in her career when she had to work on it. But this is one of her first appearances on the screen. You can see her work everywhere, and she herself in a rather steep segment of “Daddy's Girl”, on one of Nilsson's best songs. (Followed by Frank Zappa's cameo.) McCartney mentioned this scene in his special years in TeeVee. <br /> <br /> The third reason to watch the movie early (about 6 and a half minutes) in the film: a character called "Lady Pleasure" kisses each Monkey in a long continuous shot and then departs dismissively. She is credited as I.J. Jefferson, but in fact Mimi Manchu, Nicholson's mistress at the time, and an LSD partner. Red hair, psychedelic behavior. Beautiful. This scene says everything about me, about how Jack relates to boys. <br /> <br /> Ted's score - 3 out of 3: Worth seeing.
