Well, I think I had a mood for a movie that really captured me from the very beginning. This film was not the case. During the first 40 minutes, he walked at a rather slow, deliberate pace, but in fact there was nothing in it that terribly interested me - there is an intriguing and mysterious enmity between Jean Reno’s character and the old man, but the main character’s dominations which I knew little about and which I could not relate to at that time. For the most part he wanders alone, does not meet with anyone; I suppose the director tried to portray the loneliness of a person in this post-apocalyptic world or something like that, and that's all well and good, but I still wish he would cut it from 40 to 15 minutes because it can be incredibly boring . <br /> <br /> But after these 40 minutes, everything becomes very interesting. I think I will not say more, because I do not want to spoil anything. So, if you watched the first 15-30 minutes of this film and think about turning it off (like me), just stick to it - it will become much better. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting things I discovered in this film was the fact that there was no dialogue in it, which really made me think about what was happening, how the characters feel and what they are motives, why everything is as they were in this post. - the apocalyptic world, all of which gives the plot a lot of space for the audience to interpret. And it's amazing how much more satisfaction the film brings when the actors don't tell you exactly what's going on.
