More and more French films demonstrate that this is the only one who can withstand Hollywood and spend large sums of money on their films. If Bon Voyage were made in the USA, no one would be surprised. Ideally arranged in France, in the 40s, when the Nazi invasion, technically impeccable, and with some of the most international French actors (Depardieu, Ajani, Ledoyen ...). The Bon Voyage Center on two parallel stories: the scientist and his student (Ledoyen), who is trying to hide one of his discoveries (a kind of water that can work like an atomic bomb) from the Nazis; and a poor guy in love with a famous actress (Ajani) who is in prison on charges of a crime he did not commit to protect her. <br /> <br /> Bon Voyage, it seems, is made in the old style, without unnecessary camera movements and effects. No big turns in the plot. As I have already said, they have done a great job regarding the production itself. But the main problem of this film is the script. Is this a spy movie? Romantic comedy? Spy comedy? Comedy of intrigue? It is not clear. This makes Bon Voyage a bit unbalanced. When you think you are watching a comedy, it suddenly changes to another storyline, more dramatic, slower ... I think they should have focused on one of the arguments (the one about the plot of the spy) and left the romantic details in the background . <br /> <br /> My rating: 6.5 / 10
