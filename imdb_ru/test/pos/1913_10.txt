For me, Dolemite is the object of my deep affection. Everything is there: a gang of karate fighters, Dolemite, punching a fist into the belly of Willie Green (directed by Martin), tall pumps and 100 gallon hats printed in a Dalmatian print. Mura's unique comedy raps, in fact, toasts are close to the roots of hip-hop. It is not surprising that Dr. Dre mentioned “Dolemite” three times in his classic album “The Chronic”. Add the best list of characters that have ever graced the film, such as an agitated preacher, a hamburger pimp and, of course, "one who no one knows until that time." I must pay tribute to director D'Urville Martin, a guy who probably doesn’t get as much attention as he needs in movie circles (I’ve been looking for a copy of him and Fred Williamson’s films from the very beginning of the 70s and I’m not ). <br /> <br /> Many people are really disappointed in this film and say that it is really bad, and it’s true that you can see booming microphones appearing everywhere (look at DP Nicolas Josef von Sternberg, for which, I I think it was a very early effort), a lot happens in this film. First of all, there is no other movie like this. Secondly, you will see how Rudi Ray Moore shoots (very sanitized; everyone who has not seen Moore’s outrageous live performance, will have to use his imagination) a cinematic version of his toasts, plus he lives the life of his comic book super live. The action scenes are quite scarce, but the dialogue of the characters, when they speak garbage, more than compensates for this. He is full of strange little details (for example, the fact that the pimp Hamburger wears a T-shirt with dolemit inside-out - was it done intentionally or did the guy just pick up any shirt lying on the set and put it on?) Are you coming back to watch it again and again . <br /> <br /> At least I have. <br /> <br />
