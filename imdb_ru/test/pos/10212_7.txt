“Western Union” is one of a forgotten classic western! Perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact that it is not available on DVD in the United States. However, all is not lost, as it appeared on Region 2 in England. This, being in a sense a blessing, is not only irrelevant, but ironic, considering that the film telling about the founding and creation of such a unique American organization as The Western Union Telegraph Company is not released in Region 1. It is hard to believe! It just does not make sense! <br /> <br /> Fox producer in 1941 was directed by Fritz Lang. It was only the second time that a great German director committed himself to directing a western! A year ago, he did an excellent job with Fox “The Return of Frank James”, and in 1952 another Western tour awaits him with a magnificent “Infamous Ranch”. Lang was neither Ford nor Hawk, but with Western Union, he turned into a beautiful solid Western that holds very well. Beautifully photographed at the beginning of the three-lane Technicolor by Edward Krondzhager, he had a good cast, led by Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female role is played by Virginia Gilmore, who really can do little in a photograph. An actress who has never done anything from her career. Her presence here is just cosmetic. <br /> <br /> Curious that Robert Young has the best score for Scott! This is clearly a picture of Scott from the very beginning, when we first see him in the stunning introductory part of the film, pursued by detachment across the plains. Young has nothing in common throughout the film and seems out of place in the west. He just looks stupid, battling with Barton McLane in a shootout! An actor who never distinguished - except, perhaps with "Crossfire" (1947) - Young appeared in a series of unforgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties, the culmination of which was his greatest success when he was television for seven years " Marcus Welby MD "seventies. He died in 1998 at the age of 91 years. <br /> <br /> Western Union talks about telegraph wire connection to Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed criminal hired by Western Union boss Dean Jagger to defend the line from Siu's looting, and fight with McLain and his gang, who are trying to destroy the line for their insidious goals. Robert Young is a young engineer from the east who joins the company and vies with Scott for the love of Miss Gilmore. Some comic help — and annoyingly, as some would say — Slim Summerville and John Carradine, turns out to be in the meager role of the company's doctor. <br /> <br /> In general, although a flattering good Western, albeit for Region 2, but in excellent quality, that fans will be delighted. My only cheat sheet is that there are no add-ons here, not even a trailer and that awful cover with this boring graphics. Ugh! <br /> <br /> Footnote. Interestingly, Western Union associate producer was Harry Joe Brown, who later created a partnership with Randolph Scott that would create some of the best Scott westerns in the 50s.
