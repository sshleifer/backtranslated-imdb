I have a feeling that Lisa Kruger is easy to miss. I personally discovered that her first film, “Manny and Lo,” of 1996, was a surprisingly detailed study of the characters, and the performances were extremely remarkable (with special thanks to Mary Kay Place). The film played for a week or two in major urban centers and disappeared. One or two critics really liked it, but many regarded it as insignificant. Kruger's second film, Committed, was released this year (2000) (after almost two years of delays) and also disappeared. And again, critics rejected the film as insignificant and pushed the film aside, mostly praising Heather Graham’s presence on the screen, but rarely her acting ability. And once again, for me, Committed is a solid success. It seems to me that Kruger has a genuine voice and a personal visual style, and these traits should not be so easily ignored, simply because she is working on a very restrained conviction. <br /> <br /> The name has several meanings, but basically it refers to Johlin (Graham’s refusal to allow her husband Karl (Luke Wilson) to crumble and leave her. She follows him from New York to El Paso and becomes one of the most attractive stalkers in the latest cinematic history. Her respect for her marriage vows leads her to Mexican mysticism and self-knowledge. And yes, the plot is so simple and, therefore, so easy to ignore. <br /> <br /> Jolene, of course, is the weeping voice of a generation whose parents divorced at a rate approaching fifty percent. And for me, her personal revolution against broken promises and deception is pretty smart and powerful. Believing in the belief that people simply lack faith in each other, Jolene must inevitably find that her beliefs do not coincide with the beliefs of society as a whole. In several comments, she called her character one-dimensional, and I am afraid that this is a simplified reading of the film. Or perhaps even a misreading. If Jolene were just innocent, she would not be interesting at all. The fact that she understands the world and refuses to play by the rules of "normals" makes her so interesting. Sociologically, she is a complete deviance. <br /> <br /> Kruger sometimes falls into moments of fussy dialogue, and her direction of this film is rather strangely excessively dependent on pictures of clouds moving along the El Paso horizon. However, her mistakes are quite rare, and in this film, as in Manny and Law, it is the performances that bear this day. Graham has never been better, because she never had a character as perfect as her, as Jolene. For the first time in his career, Graham seems to feel comfortable playing an adult, even in a slightly delayed development. She's great at wearing a movie. Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck (like Brother Jolene), like Alfonso Aarau, have some wonderful moments in the role of the Mexican mystic, Mark Ruffalo and T-Bo, a slightly psychotic truck driver. As in Manny and Law, the characters are part of their environment, well-detailed, fully organic creations. These characters may sometimes seem pointlessly bizarre, but they make sense in their context. Even Goran Vishnich, being an artist inspired by Joel's devotion, fits in some strange way, although the alienity of his character is never discussed. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a film that looks deep into the past. Another commentator here talked about stereotypical Mexican images. And again I feel like calling it a misreading. Jolene is looking for self-justification. She knows that her obligations are out of control, but she is looking for some spiritual path that could help her figure out herself. The character Arau understands that most people don’t believe in him, and he maintains his faith when he sees a woman who respects him. <br /> <br /> I suppose I can understand how this film can be considered as stunning, I simply would not agree. It is always funny, often fun, and all the characters exude warmth, which is very wonderful. <br /> <br /> I give it 7.5 / 10, and when I go to the vote here, it will rise to 8.
