Less than zero might have been a film from the 80s, in which adolescent apathy manifests itself in the most extreme form if they really stuck with this damn book. But where it was not, this film presents its work and leaves you with the most terrible feeling, when everything is over in ways that were not until the end of the nineties with the films of Larry Clark “Children” and “Hooligan”. <br /> <br /> Social outcasts of adolescents face a rather curious dilemma (they don’t treat her the same way as one) when their estranged friend (Daniel Roebuck) brags them that he killed a teenage girl on the river bank in their suburban town. Keanu Reeves may be the only civilized person in the group, at any rate, the only person who wants to show any conscience, while others either do nothing about the girl’s death or want to help her friend hide the body. <br /> <br /> I don’t know who is more sick in this film — Crispin Glover — who becomes almost obsessive and fatherly, trying to protect a friend and hide a crime by smuggling him out of the country, Dennis Hopper, a drug dealer (who clings for a female doll exploding), which provides support to teenagers (as a dealer, of course) and suddenly becomes involved in events. Or Josh Miller, who plays Riva's younger brother, Tim. He seems to be the most apathetic of all, at least until his emotional breakdown at the end. This is definitely not a vigorous 80's teenage fare, obviously. And, of course, makes it clear how serious the squad that these children face (despite the bizarre series of events) thanks to many excellent performances (even Reeves has proven some acting skills). <br /> <br /> Help yourself comedy to recover if she shakes you too much.
