The banter and humorous scene of salvation help make this one of my favorite TV shows from 14 films. Great game, great cast. And this film contains one of the few noted facts about the career of Sean Bean. The part where he and Alice Krieg fell from the horse into the water was not written according to the script, but was left, as they both continued to act after it happened. <br /> <br /> This is a good continuation of the intense end of the enemy Sharpe.
