It is a beautifully made film in which delicate human stories (both before and after 1945) and the indiscriminate battle for war are perfectly balanced. Using excerpts from the “Battle of Britain” (a film that depicts almost not so well the 1940s!) Enhances rather than diminishes the whole. Deeply impressive work that has lived in my memory for 2 years since I saw it, and I just bought it to explore the possibility of creating add-ons. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film (film). Like Aces High, it alternates between intuitively exciting (or frightening) sequences of air battles, where the viewer may experience the actual loss of the characters they care about, as well as unpredictable interactions on the ground, where skilled writers and real life experiences inform involving and moving events. It also underlines the fact that for many people, 1945 was not only the end of one conflict, but also the beginning of another, and even today we still do not recognize the loss, courage and sacrifice of so many nameless heroes or, even worse, we read them on distance, not allowing them to be people with all the emotional weaknesses that entail - making their victims even more valiant. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is an experience that will lift you from a height of friendship to the depths of jealousy and a return to love that lasts even after death. If all war films were like that, we would never have to fight again. <br /> <br /> I have already said that it is worth seeing? ;-) <br /> <br /> 10/10
