Yesterday I watched this film again with a 20-year-old intern from my office (well, it was a quiet day after Thanksgiving), and both of us enjoyed it. I like the unique plot, David Duchovny, David Allen Greer, and how the dog continues to wait at the door. Does not a part of each of us look like this dog after the death of the one we love? <br /> <br /> I also love older people in the restaurant - they remind me of some older people in the southern part of New England, where your ethnic group is a very important topic for discussion. And I love the wedding at the end. <br /> <br /> Minnie Driver is great in this film - and Bonnie Hunt should have won the award for everything. <br /> <br /> Bonnie - make more movies!
