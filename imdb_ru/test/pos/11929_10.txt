Such films simply do not get the credit they deserve. This is my second favorite movie of all time, (Stand By Me, being the first.) I watched this movie because it was Wil Wheaton and he is my favorite person in the whole world, and I think he did an amazing job in this movie and Sean Astin too. I just watched it last night, and it just amazed me. Everything in the film is very exceptional. Scenario, acting, script. I was on the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mom wasn’t in the room, I would absolutely be pampered whenever Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) died. I did not expect this! Quite !! I was very surprised when I learned that it was not very popular in the 90s. I was born a few years after he came out, so, of course, I did not go to watch it in cinemas, but I’m sure that I would get it if I were alive. If any of my friends watched this, they would say, “Oh, okay?” But this is only because they are not cool enough to appreciate such work. If you have not seen this movie or want to see something like a bomb, this is the movie for you.
