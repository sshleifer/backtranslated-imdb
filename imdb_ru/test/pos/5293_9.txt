Ponyo - a beautiful animated film with dark shades. It tells the story of anguish and love in childhood with environmental consequences, but this is not a sermon. Hayao Miyazaki has merged Andersen's Little Mermaid with the native myths of Japan and his signature fancy steam punk flights, and the result is very useful. There are some terrible moments of storms and floods on the shores of the ocean, but they are exciting, not horrible. <br /> <br /> If you ever wanted to run with the waves along the coast, ride a jellyfish as an elevator Having completely transformed yourself or made friends for a lifetime, Ponyo is a fable for you.
