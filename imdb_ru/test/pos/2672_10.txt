RKO short theme. <br /> <br /> A group of hooligan little hooligans teaches a lesson of tolerance from the Frank Sinatra stage, which compares America with the HOUSE in which I live. <br /> <br /> This small film delivers the appropriate message about the evils of prejudice and bias. Sinatra is completely natural in front of the camera; tense and sincere, he is the perfect representative of the values ​​spoken of here. <br /> <br /> Sinatra sings "The House I Live In" - Lewis Allan and Count Robinson. This subtle melody, with a firm pro-American message, returns after the terrible events of September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> After Pearl Harbor, Hollywood fully entered the war against the Axis, Not only did many of the stars join or perform in the service at home, but the studios' output was largely aimed at military action. The newsreel, of course, brought the latest military news to the district theater every week. Features featured combat stories or themes related to war. Even short stories and cartoons were used as a quick means of disseminating allied propaganda, raising morale or spreading information. Together, Uncle Sam, the American people and Hollywood turned out to be an unbeatable combination.
