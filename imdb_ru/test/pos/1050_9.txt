This is a delightful film “They don’t make them like this.” Well executed by all and populated by interesting characters of actors. An intelligent, witty screenplay acted with the right mix of broad comedy and understated humor. Suitable for repeated (annual?) Views. <br /> <br /> ** WARNING ** rethinking this eponymous film by director Arnold Wattshetting is an unbearable mess - it hurts to watch - without the scintilla of charm and wit of the original.
