A great movie. I laughed all the time. What for? Well, I'm from Austria, I can get along with the German (Bavarian) kind of humor. Therefore, I think that this film only makes sense when you speak German. Stefan and Erkan both speak with a new kind of Turkish-German accent, which has become really popular in our countries (GER & AUT). But, of course, they are very stupid. As with any comedy, your personal humor will decide if your thumb is up or down.
