I usually try to avoid Barbie movies, but this one was unmistakably amazing. Kudos to the graphics and character behind the scenes. Everything went well. This charming fairy tale is great for others, but worth buying! I have no children, but children whom I nurse (including boys) find it intriguing and love the extra features on the DVD. I honestly do not know why it is so low, but for children, especially for your beloved Barbie, 8 years old, it will be pleasant. It is not simple and predictable, like most films. This “childish” film is notable for its excellent morale and shows teamwork. There are no expletives, bits of romance (if you are old enough to understand this) and a beautifully written storyline. That's why I give him ten out of ten!
