I saw this movie when it first came out. Patty did not want to part with her brothers and sisters. However, the juvenile justice system does not care. When Patty reviewed the case file, the judge sent her to the juvenile detention center. He claimed that she violated the privacy rules by viewing personal files. She just wanted her family to be together. I could not blame her. Parents were not even suitable parents. One of the little children had to have a toilet. Father stopped and let them go. He drove him away and left the children in a difficult position at the service station. Patty had to take power to protect them, since she was the oldest. They were placed in foster care. The good part is that the social worker returned them as a family. The chief social worker, continued to tell him to get up and not interfere. He was crazy. It was he who put Patty in a juvenile facility. Why they did not go after the Father, who was released from prison, for leaving. However, children find themselves in the center and feel insecure.
