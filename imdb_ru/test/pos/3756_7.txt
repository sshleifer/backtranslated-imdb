I only saw this movie once when it was shown on TV, but I still remember it 15 years later, so I have to say something about it. I thought it was a smart look at schoolwork, friendship, bullying, and the impact he could have on adulthood. <br /> <br /> The name really refers to how good or bad in sports can make you the lowest low, or you will be tolerant of clicks in school and even later in adult life, if you are good at it, installed in a private school in England, but it could be anywhere. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is bad in games, seeking revenge in later life, which ends with a climactic standoff on the cricket pitch. I have to admit that I was shocked by the finale - it was strong and sad.
