I learned a lot from previous viewers reactions. Is there one that doesn’t mention “propaganda”? Too glib. "Perception depends on the concept." I love Fred Astaire's musicals, great, great songs and the incomparable grace of Fred. But, comrades, if you see idle, brainless, rich parasites dancing on the oppressed and unemployed, this is a serious criticism of "capitalist propaganda." Any film is saturated with the values ​​of its time and place, not to mention those who finance it ?? Pipers who call melody. Great art surpasses everything, as does the Nevsky, as well as Everything is Quiet on the Western Front. I confess. I saw it the last 40 and more years ago. But the images are burned in my brain. This is the greatest scene of the battle that has ever been filmed. And it terrifies you to be excited. "Plastic ice" someone said? This is the real death that you watch. The real extras died by doing this. “Real Look” is now defined by special effects. Similarly, “too long” - for a century of shrinking attention? Did Mozart have “too many notes”? Is propaganda of the Catholic Church tainted? The Vatican was HOWEVER in this when they called upon ancient patronage to receive the government of a democratic German Christian. recognize Croatia in the 1990s ?? remember the chaos and genocide? Forget the props, the lighting of the Nevsky painted the medieval world ?? like bruegel. One of them in the palace of Hampton Court shows the slaughter. Rough Dutch nationalist propaganda, maybe, but it breaks the heart. Stylized acting game? So what is Henry V (Olivier film)? Naturalism? Does anyone believe that the English medieval knight-knights said so? As said, Prokofiev's music is great. Only Ken Russell and Eisenstein had balls and genius to match the sound and image at this 100 octane level. Well, you want Snaffle & a little. I will risk a nervous torobred every time. Eisenstein did not copy the Wehrmacht’s helmets; rather, his model seemed to be the buckets worn by the “Teutonic Knights” in the Nazi theatrical performances of the 1930s. Eisenstein was a genius, but unlike Hollywood directors, he had almost unlimited (non-commercial) time and funding. Modern Russian directors are free from political shackles, but have no money. Even Kurasava had to shoot a late (great) film in communist Russia. He was respected, but not financed in his own country (just like Russell). How much propaganda is in the eye of the beholder? Imagine sane people from another, peace-loving world. How would they react to Nevsky? Will the battle or the sorrow of the dead dominate their knowledge? If we didn’t know about the gas chambers and the SS, how about the “Triumph of the Will”? Where to get Nevsky DVD, cheap?
