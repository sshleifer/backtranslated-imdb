Listen ... I was expecting this level of acting from William Macy ... the guy just keeps playing amazing performances ... but MEAT LOAF? At what point did His Tramp decide to leave Jim Steinman behind and throw his apparently less weight in the amazing world of Stanislavsky? Well what can I say? I am properly impressed. Paraphrasing the old saying: “It's not about meat, but about emotions” ... and the Loaf has been quietly straightening its acting chops lately. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern looks great in the 40s here ... great job in costume and hairstyle departments ... David Paymer is a typical player, but right on the money. Solid cameras work throughout the film. The storyline resembles the "Gentleman's Agreement" (anti-Semitism after the Second World War). It is worth spending time ... especially on the growing legions of helpers of Bill Macy. <br /> <br />
