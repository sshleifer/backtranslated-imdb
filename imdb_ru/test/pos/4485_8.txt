Strange, but surprisingly original film. Genuinely frightening, creepy and funny in equal proportions. The setting of the high-rise red brick apartment is an ideal backdrop for the pursuing action. The idea of ​​a secret locked room in a place like this is good enough, but when the leading naive couple starts to clean the old bed they find in this room, the scene is for some classic cold. The cast is fantastic. Tanya Dempsey is really chewing on some scenes, being underestimated in other films about the full moon. Joe Estevez proves why Brother Martin Sheen is so much more in Hollywood - his moving eyes during bed scenes are really funny. Charles Band co-produced Stewart Gordon, and this is a truly exceptional release of Full Moon / Darkwave. Danny Dreyven also sent Hellfire with Dempsey.
