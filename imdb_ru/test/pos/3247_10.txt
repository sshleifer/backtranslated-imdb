Before I begin my review, I’ll give a brief lesson on Australian slang, which can help you with watching a movie and understanding some other reviews from Australia and other countries. <br /> <br /> In Australian slang, "thongs" are a pair of rubber sandals (not to be confused with the same American word that refers to underwear with bare ass), "stubbies" is a brand of Australian shorts, "stubby “- a small bottle of beer, and a“ stubby holder ”foam insulator for a small bottle of beer. <br /> <br /> If you like black comedies about little criminals, then you will like this film, unfortunately, many people on IMDB with a weak stomach and do not appreciate dark humor have watched this film, which, unfortunately, makes this film more mediocre than he is. Many reviewers also compare it to Lock / Stock and Pulp Fiction, although it’s the same genre, it’s a completely different and original style. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers also panned this film for using Heath Ledger’s “Dead Brother” characters to open and direct the film to this movie, while not watching the movie carefully enough to understand that his brother was killed by the same villain. , who wants to kill the hero of Hits, this is explained in the middle of the film, but not clear enough for most to understand. <br /> <br /> This film also resembles the Lok / Shtok and Reservoir dogs in the sense that it is the debut function of the director and screenwriter, and for the debut function he rates the same as these two films. In fact, as Lok / Stock and Dog-reservoir, I rate this film as 10/10 for a debut director and screenwriter, unfortunately, unlike Tarantino, and Richie Jordan does not live up to expectations in his subsequent films, such as Ned Kelly. br /> <br /> This is a film that you sho Oldd will definitely add to your DVD collection, and it quite easily supports several views.
