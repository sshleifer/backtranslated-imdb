This is a very strange little short film, which initially did not impress me. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the animation here is certainly not beautiful, although after a while you notice that simple and silly drawings have a certain strange charm. Probably because the script is just as weird as this one, the animation works. <br /> <br /> The film shows an elderly couple sitting at a table and playing Erudite. At the same time, they are fixated on this game or other strange activities (for example, the obsessive desire of a husband to cut things - even a chair and a table)! And all this happens when television warns about the expectation of atomic destruction - Armageddon is definitely here! Naturally, the neighbors scream and rage - at this time the couple unknowingly continues this idiotic game. Hell, even their cat knows that the end comes when the couple starts arguing about who can or could not fool - which leads to a very surreal end !! The film deserves praise for being unique and very funny. Despite the fact that he did not receive an Oscar, he was nominated for "Best Animated Short Film", which he fully deserved.
