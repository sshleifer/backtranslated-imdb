This is a story about a journey made by a man who once had a dream and courage. Donald Crowhurst was an English businessman and amateur seaman who participated in the Golden Times yacht race on the Sunday Times, a yacht race alone. <br /> <br /> I was very intrigued by this story after listening to a radio interview with producer John Smithson, who also produced the film “Touching the Void,” one of the first documentaries to achieve commercial success in 2003. I went to the cinema with great hope and did not know too much about a historical event, and I am glad that this did not let me down. For 92 minutes, I went through a haunting story and thought of something to think about. <br /> <br /> Without any reconstruction in this film, limited frames of audio and video archives were used, which they found, and turned them into an exciting story that allowed the audience to understand Crowhurst from a personal level. The story was revealed as people who had direct connections with events, including his wife and his son, and a possible winner, as well as the only one who returned from 9 competitors, Robin Knox-Johnston told about what happened almost 40 years ago. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst’s logs (magazines), which he kept for 243 days at sea, haunt me so much that it became much easier for me to understand what could be completely isolated. the man. Although Crowhurst's body was never found, another rival Nigel Tetley, whose yacht sank just a few weeks before claiming the prize for the fastest passage, committed suicide three years after unsuccessful attempts to properly complete the voyage around the world. <br /> <br /> Everything can take its toll. This is especially true of the sea. <br /> <br /> Director Louise Osmond also attended the question and answer session after the show, along with producer John Smithson. I had no idea that this is a female director, and it was a very pleasant surprise. The film will be released in limited edition in the UK (a couple of days in certain cinemas). Catch him in the movie as long as you can, unless you have a modern sound system that can recreate the sound of a raging Southern Ocean ... then I’m sure they will appear on DVD soon.
