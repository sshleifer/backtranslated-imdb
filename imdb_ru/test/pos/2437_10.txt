It was a sweet introduction for the most elegant Seaman Warrior, Sailor Mercury. It consisted of a new "in the Crowd", Merciurios. He first wrote Ami's love letter, which would be awesome (of course), and now, Ami Tix, he is Chibi-Einstien, and he is attractive (in the end, he looked like Umino (Melvin)). It was halarios (for example, the scene of Minako “I have no skin on my neck” (HOT!)). Well, I really like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon series, I personally consider it the best anime! Funny, but not as adventurous as Sailor Moon R. It was more like the movie "S". I saw this @ Sailor Moon Univewrse, with a real Player, and that was pretty good. (Overall)
