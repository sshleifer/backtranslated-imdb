My reaction to this remake of “Italian Work” is probably hopelessly mixed with the events taking place in my life when I saw it; This is the first film I saw after I just got a job after 8 months of unemployment and returning to school for retraining. There was still little money, but I no longer had to choose between watching a movie in cinemas and paying bills (or having dinner), and the feeling of relief and gratitude that I felt at that time was huge. As a result, my pleasure from the “Italian work” was probably far out of proportion to its real value. <br /> <br /> However, I took it used on a DVD a few weeks ago and looked again, and I still enjoyed it. I have never seen the original (although I heard that this is an absolute classic), but its modern counterpart is especially noticeable if you have a taste for modern production values ​​applied to the subjects and themes of old films. <br /> <br /> What originally attracted me to this film was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the most flexible, textured and enjoyable soundtracks. IJ opens with a tricky, witty, pulsating arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brush work and quiet moments - he completely subdued me from the first seconds. And the whole movie is like this: I haven’t heard such a sonorous, sonorous, pulsating soundtrack since Stuart Copeland left the police and started making soundtracks for films like Rumble Fish. There are at least a dozen irresistibly collected motives, along with some remakes of pop songs that range from “all right” to “inspired”. For people who care about the soundtrack, this film is a delight. <br /> <br /> For the film: I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg, but he is fine as a moderator, and the film does not ask him to do what he cannot do well. He is the weakest “main” actor in the film, but that’s because the rest of the cast is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland in some role. Mos Def, Jason Stedham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron - all this turns into fat free performances. Norton seems to be mostly calling about this (it is rumored that he didn’t really want to make a film), but he is still natural even at 1/2 power. The only thing I discuss with the actors and actors is the “Wrench” character, who seems to be a male model, pretending to be an actor. His role seems to be included in the film, and he has a bit of chemistry with the rest of the cast (although you can blame part of that on the size of the role and the "late walk" on the character's character). If I were cynical, I would be interested in who the actor slept with to get into this film in such an irregular role? No, it will never happen ... <br /> <br /> Production values, camera work, stunts, plots ... everything fits pretty well, and Gray and his film crew are pretty easy to combine (except for the "Wrench", see above). <br /> <br /> Dialogue has a pleasant, light touch that rewards your indulgence, and on this path there are several satisfactory major and minor benefits from the plot. (My favorite moment is when a Norton character tells Wahlberg a character that he just lost the element of surprise. Wahlberg goes to a cold Norton member with a right cross, and then asks him: “Were you surprised?” Hmmm, maybe you should have been there ...) <br /> <br /> Of course, a certain level of “suspension of disbelief” is necessary for the film to work, but if you just relax and agree with this (and do not think too much about the mechanics of hacking the safe under water or the likelihood that anyone can successfully hack and manipulate amb traffic in Los Angeles via a laptop, and so on. d.), you will enjoy your trip. <br /> <br /> “Italian work”: it’s a light summer fluff, but it’s very good at what it is and doesn’t try to be something else. This is not good enough for "8", but I would give it "7.5".
