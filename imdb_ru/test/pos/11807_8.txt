Yesterday afternoon there was nothing else on TV, so I thought, “Well, let's see.” I did not know the plot, and I had no expectations, I thought that in a few minutes I would send the surfing channel again. But then the story began to unfold, and the characters perfectly played the two boys. The story had unrealistic parts and scenes, but overall it was a really good film. Very well worth seeing.
