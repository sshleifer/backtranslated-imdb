I saw it because my cousin is extra in one of the wedding scenes. I read somewhere that Oz and Rudnik wanted to make jokes about liberal films with messages, but the climax ended up being directly from one of these films. In addition, a bit of humor is a bit hidden, Joan Cusack was too excessive for me, and someone has a strange chronology of the Oscars. However, there were more than enough fun moments, such as a kissing scene, a wedding that does not exist, and a scene with the director to enjoy it. Kline, as always, is good, but for me the real surprise was Selleck, whom I am not a big fan of, but makes fun of it myself.
