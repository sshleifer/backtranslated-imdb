Long before Terry Schiavo raised the question of life as a “vegetable” for public viewing, Joe Egg's Day of Death dealt with this issue. Alan Bates plays Bree, a schoolteacher whose daughter is almost entirely edged. He and his wife Sheila (Janet Suzman) try all sorts of dark feelings of humor to try to continue their lives, but they cannot escape the facts. At some point they even consider euthanasia. The question that surrounds them and their friends is: what will happen to this predicament ever? <br /> <br /> In this film, Alan Bates continued the series of really good films that were preceded by “Greek Zorba”, “King of Hearts” and “The Fixer”. We can safely say that he will be sad to miss.
