Blimey! Where to begin? <br /> <br /> This adaptation of the third novel by Sarah Waters is one of my favorite movies ever! !!!!! <br /> <br /> I’m not too fond of fiction novels (seriously, I NEVER read fiction), but the book is just as incredible as a movie! Or should I say that the movie is just as incredible as the book ?! I ONLY LOVE THIS HISTORY !!!!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I put off watching this three-hour film (2 episodes on DVD, 3 episodes on TV / in a book) for about a year and a half, It just didn’t look so interesting ... BOY WAS I AM WRONG ! <br /> <br /> I immediately plunged into a rich and tense conspiracy ... absolutely delighted! Just like a book, you can't stop watching / reading. It captures your attention for all 3 hours ... and when it really ends ... you would like it to be not. <br /> <br /> The story just flows so beautifully, and you will be interested in where the time has gone. <br /> <br /> A lesbian patch was just a icing on the cake! The parts that I love the most are subtle facial expressions and looks / eye contact between the two characters. You really feel their desire for each other, and yet they cannot act on it ..... as long as they do not. <br /> <br /> Can I point out that the “lesbian theme” is an important part of the film; obviously, the film is based on a genuine unexpected love story, but this is certainly not what the whole movie is about. For me, this is what makes this story so unique and intriguing. I have never read or heard anything like it. Sarah Waters is a real genius! <br /> <br /> Because of the twists and turns, you hang on the edge of your chair. Seriously! My hands were pressed to my couch at every unexpected plot twist, and I even shouted several times (“Oh my God! NO! THIS IS NOT JUST HAPPENED!) The only thing I can say about this film is what I would like them to add more from the book, but it’s obvious that the adaptation would be limited by time, they couldn’t add everything I liked, how terrible it is, though ... I think now I’m just very selfish ... forgive me. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes seem a bit hasty. However, they put all the important beats to the place where even if you just watch the movie and decide not to read the book, you will be most satisfied with the result. <br /> <br /> The actors are just super! Brilliant even! Wu Sally Hawkins (Sue) and Elaine Cassidy (Mod ) such a great chemist on the screen that they cheered up your TV. Just electric! Emotions ... despair ... the struggle that each of them is experiencing, it would seem, without the efforts of these amazingly talented actresses. Rupert Evans plays such a good bad guy like a Gentleman. I found myself boiling every time he appears on the screen, but I like it because he's damn nice and somehow still charming, even if you want to twist his neck. Imelda Staunton gives another fantastic presentation like Mrs. Saxby. She is such a hearty actress that you can't help but love her ... even when the character she plays is not so delightful. Everyone else in the cast was perfect! They really understood the characters well and were as I imagined them after reading the book. <br /> <br /> This is a must see for any movie lover! In fact, NO ONE and EVERYONE should see this movie AND read a book! Most likely, you will not be disappointed! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars from me! There are only four other films that I gave to the same rating. I very rarely really like the movie so much that I put it on 10/10. This is one of those movies. Fingersmith is a true masterpiece!
