Although it’s not half as fun as The Chicken Run, Wallace and Gromit’s new comedy The Curse of the Were Rabbit (*** of ****) causes more laughter than most comedy fighters. British director Nick Park, who created the characters of Wallace and Gromit, and co-director Steve Box, rely on the old-fashioned slow motion technique, which is best known as glination, to create several visually delightful characters in more than enough split scenes about a monstrously mutant hare to absorb every vegetable in sight. Strangely enough, but the bizarre storyline, the heart of the fun lies in the creative approach with which Park and the company have painstakingly lined up characters and are fond of the brand of plasticine called "Plasticine." In fact, for each shot that you see in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, you needed patient souls who made minor changes to the clay characters for a series of individual shots that merged into a real fun installation. Hollywood became the pioneer of the climax as a form of animation in the silent films of the 1920s, before the industry turned its back on a complex process. Animators studio Aardman managed to display only three seconds of useful material per day. For the record, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit took five years. Rough characters with thumb prints, clearly visible in their clay complexion, look incredibly funny with their eyes on a ping-pong ball and biting their mouths. Interestingly, Gromit appears as the funniest character, an attractive fool without a mouth, but an expressively expressionless face that speaks more than most talking characters. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit master and pood respectively. Being a human half of a duet, Wallace is a lousy-looking moron with no idea who somehow manages to create machines that do quite incredible things. One of the most amusing scenes shows the wizard and the pooch, awakened by a system of gutters, hatches and spring devices that dress and feed them. Meanwhile, Gromit is an animal half. The main joke is that Gromit has more common sense than his master genius. No matter how good his ideas and inventions were, Wallace would not have been able to succeed if the faithful Gromit had not helped him. Our heroes run a pest protection business called Anti-Pesto. In fact, they have to protect every stretch of vegetables for miles around, using a clumsy device called the Bun-Van 6000, which literally sucks the rabbits from their land into a huge glass container. No, Wallace and Gromit do not kill creatures. Instead, they keep them as pets, and Wallace is experimenting with the invention of Mind-O-Matic, designed to turn hares into carrot haters. This “Frankenstein” encounters the approach of the “Fly”, plunging poor Wallace into deep trouble when he exchanges pieces of his brain with the brain of a rabbit. Shortly thereafter, a mysterious high terror pursues plant sites on the full moon and creates havoc for everyone when the 517th annual Village Vegetable Contest approaches. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit originally appeared in the Oscar nomination for the Park, the project of the film school “Great Holiday” (1989). Since then, Aardman has released ten more animated shorts, including "Wallace and Gromit: Shaving" (1993) and "Wallace and Gromit: Wrong trousers" (1995). The Curse of the Were-Rabbit is not only different because it represents the debut on the duet's big screen, but also shows a whopping 85 minutes. The first two thirds of "Were-Rabbit" contain better jokes than the last third, but Park and company never miss a chance to slip away in an adult joke that children won't get, but attentive adults will appreciate. "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were Rabbit" is an occupation for hares.
