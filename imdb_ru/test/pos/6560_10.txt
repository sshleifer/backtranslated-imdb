I am a fan of horror films, and it must be one of the most phenomenal horror films I have ever seen. The plot is completely original (who could come up with a city that is completely obsessed with a certain symbol to death and madness?) It also makes a big difference. The spiral symbol is omnipresent. Spiral notebook, spiral shells, spirals on cakes. Of all the forms they could use (square, triangle, trapezium, rectangle), this was one of the best options. If you can find this movie, be sure to watch it. This is definitely unique and completely unforgettable.
