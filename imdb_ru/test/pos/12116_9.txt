It was a great anime. True, the animation is old, but it is still worth seeing, and the plot is better than that of the Ninja Scroll, the problem is that it is rather long. <br /> <br /> Japanese cinema star Hiroyuki Sanada, who played Ujio from Last Samurai, played the lead role of Giro and his director Rintaro, who starred in Galaxy Express 999 and Metropolis. <br /> <br /> In the anime there is a good animation for the old anime, interesting characters, such as the main villain Tenkai and Ando Shouzan, and, of course, do not forget the wonderful musical scores in the film. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is worth watching for fans of anime, animation in general, action films and samurai / ninja films. Despite the fact that the film has flaws, because of which the film was not great to watch. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie.
