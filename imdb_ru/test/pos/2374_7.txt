In the latest issue, Sho Aikawa and Ricki Takeuchi (look cooler than ever in their convertible coat!) Fight each other in one final battle, this time in the future. The plot is largely due Blade Runner, but made in a low-budget, crazy, comic style Takashi Miike. I felt that it was the weakest of the three DOA films, and although the finale was still outrageous, it lacked the shock value of the previous two. Compared to players such as Ichi Killer and The Visitor Q, DOA: The final is far from being so extreme, but it is true to the other two films of the trilogy. However, fans of the first two (and Miike fans) will get a lot from this, as he ties all three films together and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two main characters.
