This is definitely the most intense episode of the X-Files of the first season. This episode is what I think about when I hear the X-Files. The plot is simple but exciting. Our main team, as well as several scientists, are sent to explore the outpost of Alskan, in which his research team seems to have killed each other. It turns out that a small parasite, dug out of ice, infected a research team. The parasite attaches to the brain and causes paranoia and insanity. Soon no one can say who they can trust and who is infected or not. <br /> <br /> This episode was a direct tribute to the great movie “The Thing” by John Carpenters. The case takes place in Antarctica, and a group of scientists finds a destroyed outpost in which its inhabitants were killed or killed themselves. The alien, who had been buried in ice for 10,000 years, was thawed out. It has the ability to imitate any form of life. therefore, the main characters can no longer distinguish friends from enemies. <br /> <br /> Believe me, THE THE THING is one of the most exciting and intense horror films you have ever seen. If you liked the ICE episode, I advise you to watch it. Or, if you have only seen “The Thing”, I advise you to see ICE. <br /> <br /> ICE is the best direct tribute to John Carpenter's “Things I have ever seen,” and it corresponds to her inspiration from the best episodes of the X-Files. I put it on 10/10.
