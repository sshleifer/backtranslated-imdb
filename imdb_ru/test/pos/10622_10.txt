This movie made me suffer, and I loved it! LOVED IT! It haunted me for several days. I think Eric is a character that you both hate and mourn. The most horrible sex scene ever filmed. This is Haneke's best work. He is the only living director who has redefined the pace since Kubrickâ€™s time. The violence in this movie is great. In short, a film about self-loathing. In a movie proposal about trying to find love, to stop hating yourself and discover that this is hopeless hope.
