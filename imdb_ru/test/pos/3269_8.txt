The inspiration for this film was the fact that American gangsters dress well, but Australians are good, when you can kill a guy as soon as you look at him, then you can dress as bad as you like and people will not criticize you. <br /> <br /> Jimmy is a fighter, an illegal boxer, sometimes a bouncer, and he is offered a job by Pando, the local gangster boss on the cross (that is, the famous Australian district of Kings Cross, and not the fame of the Cross of London, as many British tourists face with difficulties). <br /> <br /> Because of the feeling of love, he fills up the job, loses a lot of money and has to deliver it to Pando before Pando and his heavyweights can kill him. . <br /> <br /> A lot of dark humor, interesting actions, revelations about the reverse side of Australia and human nature. He is very focused on Australian nature and explores the nature of Australian criminals (compared to American and British). <br /> <br /> One of the problems is that each of the elements of the story lacks content and depth, but this is a picture with broad strokes that covers a large area not previously covered, therefore as a general package it’s worth it. <br /> <br /> Combine it with Chopper and Dirty Deals for your Aussie Crime festival or “Stocks and two smoking barrels” and Miller’s Crossroads for an International Competition that doesn’t make it to the festival of criminal gangs. <br /> <br /> By the way, Brian Brown is a great actor who has just made a huge amount of really bad movies. Here is one of his great movies.
