It is a pity that such an important film is virtually unknown. <br /> <br /> I don't think Alan Bates made a better film than this one. <br /> <br /> He was never shown on television. The only time I can remember that he was shown on British television was in the summer of 1998. I have it on the tape, but, unfortunately, the quality is not very good because of the sly antenna at the time ... <br /> <br /> I remember how I wanted to watch this movie before it even appeared on TV. It was shown on channel 4 early in the morning, which ensured its invisibility, with the exception of a very small audience. <br /> <br /> At that time I lived in Bristol, and it was ironic that when I finally saw the film, I realized that I had passed by VERY at home, where it had been shot several times before !! The film is on the thin side; a couple trying to shed light on their tragic predicament â€” to cope with their very mentally retarded daughter, laughing at it and even involving the child in their jokes. <br /> <br /> Direction and action are so excellent that the film is always compassionate and touching, and it never threatens bad taste. <br /> <br /> A couple of years ago I saw a clip with a cinematic performance by Eddie Izzard in the role of Bri and Victoria Hamilton. plays Sheila. <br /> <br /> It showed that Izzard improvises and mocks, and Hamilton jokingly tells viewers to ignore him when he is. <br /> <br /> I may have struck it out of context. I only watched a short clip, but after reading the play and seeing the film, this is clearly such a delicate topic that this approach is both insensitive and disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Izzard was praised for his performance, but I felt uncomfortable with what I saw. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps surprising that such a successful play could not find the audience when it was finally filmed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best British films of the 70s, and hopefully one day it will be released on DVD.
