1st watched 10/10/2009 - 8 out of 10 (directed by Billy Wilder): A spectacular performance of the famous Lindberg flight by James Stewart as Lindberg and directed by Billy Wilder. There is not much history in this story, but this is normal, because Wilder makes this event truly remarkable because it comes directly from Lindbergâ€™s point of view, since he used his book as the basis of the film. This early flight film should be one of the best about the act itself. Stewart, speaking and thinking about himself during the flight, gives you a lot of insight into what Lindberg went through in this 33-hour solo flight across the Atlantic. And he completed the entire flight, not sleeping last night - which is amazing !! There is a small background on how he bought the plane and received funding, and some memories of his life during the flight, but the film is mostly about flying. The story is also beautifully made and photographed, and watch her joy, despite her age. I appreciate the fact that they did not add a lot of fluff and simply allowed stories to tell about themselves. Well done in everything. This is a classic film that everyone should watch.
