It must be the best movie for chicks. We recorded it with T.V. many years ago, and I watched it about 30 times over the years. I have not seen him for about 12 years and just recently watched this movie. I'm not lying, I cried from the initial credits to the final credits. This film really breaks your heart, even if you do not have children.
