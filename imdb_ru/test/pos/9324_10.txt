For those who are too young to remember, or too old to be part of the "hype", Michael Jackson's fascination in the early to mid-80s was in a feverish hype, like excitement around the Titanic, except it was just letting the song, every video, every word pronounced by Michael, was important. Nothing of the kind has been around since the heyday of the Beatles. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this video on the rink for the first time. Everyone stopped skating. There was no doubt as to whether you are a Michael Jackson fan or not; you were. Everyone gathered around the projection screen and watched the video ... <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the longest music videos ever, and certainly the best. It constantly gets # 2 in MTV's annual top 100 video (# 1 is always the flavor of the month, and somehow no matter what was # 1 of all time, slides past # 2 to make room for the new # 1. figure.) and the thriller itself has become a phenomenon. <br /> <br /> If you ever have such an opportunity, you should watch the video; not only excerpts shown on MTV or VH1. If necessary, you should look for "Creating a thriller" in the video rental store. Hey ... your parents probably made you watch the Beatles and Woodstock footage, because "it was important" ... well, it is also important.
