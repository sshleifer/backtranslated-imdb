Ray lives on <br /> <br /> Ray Deer - Taylor Hackford Cast - Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Regina King, Clifton Powell, Curtis Armstrong and Sharon Warren. The authors are Taylor Hackford and James L. White. Rating - *** <br /> <br /> "Go on a journey, Jack, and do not return, no more, no more, no more, NO MORE!" Who would have thought that this immortal line, which almost became a correctional mantra for breaking relations in popular culture, was conceived over the fight of lovers! Ray Charles was a genius. And if there was one thing he knew, breathed and lived for; it was music. Thus, in a life that included acute poverty, a desperate struggle with darkness, guilt, drugs and painful affairs; Ray still found moments when inspiration struck him out of nowhere, and words and notes took on their own form to form an instant eternal classic! <br /> <br /> There are several lives that deserve transformation on a silver screen. Ray Charles's life was one of them. It is almost shocking when you find out that this project did not have studio support until it was completed! And this support probably came after the initial shows, where Jamie Fox's performance was praised and predicted as the undisputed winner of Oscar in muted voices. Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray almost convinces us that this is indeed Ray Charles, acting on the screen, and not imitating the actor! From a twisted all-knowing smile to a crooked gait, not so much a disabled person as a man dancing through his demons, Fox captures all the essences of the real Ray Charles. Ray was a difficult person. He never demanded sympathy and very rarely demonstrated it himself. An astute businessman, he ensured his success at any cost, sometimes at the cost of losing his loved ones. He never apologized for his confusion and always claimed that he loved his family, which, we are convinced, he did. He liked sex; it was so easy! But below all was Ray, who was afraid of the dark. Imagine the horrors of a blind man who was afraid of the dark! His fear was due to his guilt. Ray was convinced that he was the cause of his brotherâ€™s death, and his whole life was spent redeeming himself. Ray was an individualist who merged the gospel with jazz, an unheard of blasphemous practice in the 50s. But his intentions were not provoke. He simply practiced the only way he knew to be closer to God! <br /> <br /> It is difficult to capture such an eventful life as Ray has, and perhaps in this case the film fails. We were never allowed to bond with Ray as a person. We know him only as much as we see him. His relationship, especially with Margie Hendrix (Regina King), has not been studied in detail. And the script barely passes over Della Bee (Kerry Washington), the wife of Ray, who, as everyone knows, was the rock on his side. And the biggest mistake of all is a hasty, almost sudden climax. As if the director suddenly realized that he was out of stock and caused the packaging! However, Ray is definitely recommended for flawless performance by Jamie Foxx and a capable star ensemble. Songs and age create a feeling of nostalgia, and we have a real feeling that the film is made sincerely. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Note. Ray is nominated in six Academy Award nominations this year, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (Jamie Foxx). br /> <br /> Rating- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> 19 place February 2005
