This film is one of my favorite comedies of all time. The dialogue is clear, the pace is fast. This is not only a clever comedy, it is an interesting look at what is happening behind the scenes in the television news business. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny lines ... a couple of my favorites: <br /> Ernie Merriman: (sarcastically) It must be nice to always believe that you know better, always think that You are the smartest person in the room. Jane: (seriously) NO, it's not like that, it's terrible !! <br /> <br /> Aaron: He must be looking good. Jane: How do you know that? Aaron: No one invites a bad-looking idiot to his room! <br /> <br /> The speeches of Holly Hunter, Albert Brooks and William Hert were just great! Even years later, I remember this film well. Often overlooked by the amazingly funny Joan Cusack! I like the scene when the editorial staff is rushing in a short time. There are so many funny scenes that it is difficult to choose a favorite. I highly recommend this movie.
