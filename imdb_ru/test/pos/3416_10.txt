We saw this film in Toronto at a film festival last year. It was a really exciting experience. I heard about the “Truth and Reconciliation” process, but, as others wrote, knew little about the details of this process. This film demonstrated the process and growth that can occur when people can become aware of their past, understand events from the perspective of other participants, and mourn together. Archbishop Tutu and others involved in the development of the T & R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions. Watching this movie gave me hope for the human race. If we can do T & R, we simply cannot destroy ourselves. People will look back at T and R as the first step from adolescence to maturity. <br /> <br /> Like the film, of course, there were flaws. I did not notice any serious problems in acting, directing or writing - but for the first time in many years I completely immersed myself in the film, so maybe I didn’t notice. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. The audience in Toronto will not give up the scene for the next film, we had so many questions and comments for the stars and the director. Tom Hooper, Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor went to the sidewalk to continue the conversation. People came to just shake hands and thank them for the film. It touched us all.
