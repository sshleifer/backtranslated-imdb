At first glance, any teen comedy risks being sophomoric and obvious, and, frankly, most of them. There are some who have risen above the commonplace banality of the source material (Bring It On, Eurotrip), and they give me hope that others can join this depressingly rare crowd of youthful comedies, which are actually funny, and not just a reason to flash some tits starlet or being a vehicle for some never-different Tom Green. <br /> <br /> Enter Accepted, directed by John Cusack, buddy Steve Pink, and led by pretty Justin Long (a smart nerd in Galaxy Quest and more recently he was featured in an Apple computer ad) about a group of children who were not to college and decided, as shown in the trailer, to fake a fake girl in order to tear the parents from the back. When they go too far with the website and other children end up registering, children have a few problems to solve. <br /> <br /> OK, the installation is obviously ridiculous, but most comedic lives or die in performance, and here, Accepted does quite well. Bartleby Gaines Long (mostly abbreviated to “B”) is accompanied by quite benevolent comically acceptable friends to help him share the burden, but probably the best supporting character - “Dean” Lewis (without a doubt, tribute to dean Rodney Dangerfield Martin) , he is Uncle Ben, Lewis Black, who is reasonably limited to short jerks, where he can quickly shoot his unique brand of capricious observant humor. Black is amazing here, he frankly tells the children what life really looks like (his final line is interpreted as hysterical), and provides an adult with a fake face for parents. <br /> <br /> But Long has to carry most of the film with him, and he does it, in spikes; Bartleby is easily identified, and we take it almost immediately. A good twist was provided by Columbus Short Hand character, an athlete who loses a stipend due to injury and eventually becomes a de facto art school in a fake college. It is also noteworthy that Bartleby’s super-intelligent and sarcastic younger sister is Hannah Marx. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film really does seem familiar; there is a duty here which, in all respects, must avenge the nerds. Those who are rejected by everyone else find a home with Bartleby and his companions, and, of course, the villains are reinforced steroids by the conformist race masters who rule the brotherhood (well, evil brothers) and seek to humiliate and bury the eccentrics. for ?? to choke ?? The crime of being different. But besides this, Accepted is entertained with the material and even asks a few decent questions about the expectations of the college children and about the higher education course. Not that it was a puzzle, but Accepted is not just another thoughtless teen comedy (or Owen Wilson's car). These are funny, clever 90 minutes, which, although they are not a significant departure from their genre, are smart enough and creative enough to be very pleasant. <br /> <br /> There is at least one moment of pure brilliance in the film when Bartleby is testing a nearby college in an attempt to collect ideas for his school program. When he sees that in another school all children are under stress (some refuse to even talk to him during class because of fear of missing something), he shakes his head, thinking that there must be a better way. When he moves to leave, he is met by a stream of children going the other way, one person moves against the human current, while in the background are the starting lines of Eleanor Rigby. Perhaps an unplanned moment of brilliance, but brilliance nonetheless.
