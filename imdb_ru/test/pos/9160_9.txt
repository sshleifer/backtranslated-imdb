Fans of American war films may find this film dull, but this boredom is born out of ignorance. Guerrilla suppression operations are always like that. Sit down and wait, take a few prostitutes, get drunk at the base, sit behind the wheel and deal with a businessman, stump captivity around, cover up the murder of a green street vendor. Then, boom, there are two fuel trucks and within 10 minutes a battle with small arms with one high-caliber machine gun. Then wait until the leadership develops a way to destroy their fortress, and then kill several civilians in the process. If reality doesn't work for Western audiences, there is always Top Gun or Rambo (Top Gun realistically? No) <br /> <br /> The best part of the realism of the Afghan Break is how all planes threw rockets like confetti. They had to do it because Carter and Reagan gave the Mujahideen so many missiles. In addition, the wave of Mi-24 was excellent, the best attack on the helicopter, even now, than the Apocalypse. The sight of their missiles falling and firing was the scene of impending "death from above" for those they were aimed at. <br /> <br /> It's funny how the Soviets were able to make an honest Afghan film a year after they left, but it took the USA six years. The Afghan Kink is just as real if applied to the occupation of NATO. Someone will always raise a weapon and shoot at you, because he cares more about the land. This is a film that Westerners should watch. Unfortunately, I don't think anyone ever did English subtitles; I could do some.
