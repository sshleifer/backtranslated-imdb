I can't call it a big movie, but it's interesting. In my case, when this film was released, I was the same age as some of the young tourists in the film. For me, watching this movie brings back memories of my camp years. While some of the jokes that occur in this film, such as taking out the camp director in his bed and leaving him on the side of the road, stretched on trees or on the lake, slightly outweigh some of the other jokes. When I went to the camp, tourists and consultants were putting on similar tricks, such as jogging a flagpole, a canoeing battle and boys who raided a house for girls. As I got older, I realized that these nighttime raids into the girls' cabin, in which I had participated, were carefully organized by the consultants so that we could not find girls in embarrassing situations, but at that time I thought it was real, and It was fun. That's what MEAT BALLS (MB) is. <br /> <br /> MB reflects not only the beauty of the surroundings of the camp, but also youth and carelessness. MB cited an excellent example of how preschoolers, teenagers and young people live in the summer without any worries, except guys who talk to girls and girls who talk to guys and kiosks who get as much pleasure as possible before returning to high school. . high school and college. Opening title song “Are you ready for the summer? ... there are no more homework assignments, no books, no teachers, dirty looks ... ”describes exactly how summer is viewed by schoolchildren. <br /> <br /> I personally liked two tourists: Spaz and Fink. What boy, nerd or jock, hasn't spent the whole camp trying to adjust to some pretty girl who is resting? What kind of guy didn't want other tourists and consultants to accept him? Despite the fact that these two characters are somewhat excellent, I bet that everyone who watches the movie cannot help but like these two guys. These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown from Peanut and Jack Tripper and Larry Dallas from THREE COMPANIES. I can argue that most viewers even get sick at Spaz in an egg-carrying competition and for Fink, who is trying to "beat the belly" in a hot dog-eating contest. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film had normal-looking children and counselors. There are no super models for consultants or holidaymakers who wore trendy clothes. It's funny to just lie back and watch this movie and remember when life was as fun as this movie.
