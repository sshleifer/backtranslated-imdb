Susie Q is one of those rare and sweet movies that make you feel warm. This is bitter-sweet, but useful, and the characters are funny and fascinating. At first I thought that this movie would be a pleasant cliché, which would tire me after five minutes, but I was wrong. It sometimes made me cry, and the plot was tempting, forcing to root for the good guys. I really liked the film, and I still remember it today, 9 years later! I recommend it to everyone, and the film is family oriented, so you don’t have to worry about inappropriate content. Truly, if Disney were showing more films worthy of Susie Q, it would be the most popular family channel in the world. Now, if only Disney will show it only ONE more time! ^ _ ^ Go Susie V. !!
