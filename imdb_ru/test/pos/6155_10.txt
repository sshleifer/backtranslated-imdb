I saw this film in Wales in July. This concerns the courage of Czech pilots who performed numerous missions for the Air Force after their country was occupied by the Nazis. In this film, the action takes place both in the early 1950s, when these pilots were beaten in political prisons in Czechoslovakia, and during World War II in Great Britain. They were imprisoned after their return to their homeland, because the communist regime viewed these soldiers as a threat to their occupation of Czechoslovakia. Pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against the Nazi pilots. This film contains a love story that makes sense because it helps us understand that both civilians and soldiers made great sacrifices in order to preserve democracy. The end of this film indicates that the heroism of these Czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990s after the restoration of democracy in a country then called Czechoslovakia. This powerful and touching film was shot with the financial support of the Czech government. I highly recommend this movie.
