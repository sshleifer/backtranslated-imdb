Oh my god, this is ridiculous. Yes, it is very childish, but also quite witty (“Here is a page with all the wines on it.” “I'm afraid this is a little early for us.”) And the combat sequences are first-class. Despite what you may have heard, laughter * continues * to continue, and with a surprisingly generous pace. Rick Mayall and Adrian Edmondson’s clean comic skills help keep it funny. twisting every drop of comedy from the script. I can only compare it with “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” - you either find this film hysterical everywhere, or it does not exist at all; The same is true here. This is probably the funniest British film since “Withnail and I”, but to say that it’s an acquired taste is something like a gross (sic) understatement.
