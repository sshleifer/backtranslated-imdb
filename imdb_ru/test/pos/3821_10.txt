“Think like a dinosaur” is a well-prepared and performed show from the “External Limits” series. The actor (Enrico Colantoni as Michael Barr) plays the impressively good and convincing role of the protagonist. You can actually identify with him and his “introspective” feelings about what to do with the girl for whom he fell in love (because he was alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until “Kamala” comes to his life with a timid Fear of completing the transportation task. Then he comforts her and lets her know that everything will be all right, which ultimately becomes a deception for both of them. Another bad thing happens, and she (the prototype) returns .... .. and her (clone) is sent to another planet inhabited Lei. Although, Dino and Micheal have yet to figure it out when they do, it’s up to Michael to decide either to kill her or let her live. However, what happened to him before meeting her (kamala), was very closely connected with what happened to his wife, his wife died in the same way. This show professes irregularity and sadness for the most part of it. After the show, you will be left to think ... about what MUST be done and you are stuck with 50/50 of what is right with WR Ong. Therefore, in the equation of "balance" there is no one. <br /> <br /> 10/10 We strongly recommend to watch this show.
