The Walking Dead is not a film about the death penalty, but about the people involved in the death penalty case — the murderer, the families whose children were killed, the nun who becomes his spiritual adviser, and what happens. It tells a story with a little pomp, but great compassion and sensitivity. I have it on DVD, and every time I watch it (not often, the film is never easy to watch), I am more impressed by what Tim Robbins and the entire cast have done here. It is significant that this can be a documentary film, so convincing that you can not look away, so thin and at the same time so powerful ... “The Walking Dead” is nothing but a masterpiece. It does not matter whether you are for or against the death penalty (or even have no opinion), this film will make you think about the problems for sure. It takes a courageous screenwriter and director to look at this material in person, not even flinching, and everyone who participates in the film copes with this - there is not a single scene that sounds out of tune. A masterful film, but do not expect easy viewing ... for some the final scenes may be more visual than anything imaginable, even if no blood or violence is shown. You get into this film and become a participant, and there is a character with whom almost everyone can identify with. 10/10
