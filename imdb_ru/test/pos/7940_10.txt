Awesome artwork. You can watch each image of the film and see the beauty in it. First, I would like to say that "when I saw the helmet of a German soldier," I realized that it was from here that the "star" of War "was inspired. The scene where they kill a child, scares, and when I saw it, I did not like it. But when the film ended, I thought about this scene and changed my mind and thought that in World War II this was exactly what the Germans did. <br /> <br /> The ice battle scene is one of the best war scenes I have seen. (if not the BEST.) So this film combines music and so amazingly stunning visual images of de Really excellent. Then Prokofievâ€™s score is one of the most famous soundtracks in history, and I thought it was one of the best. <br /> <br /> What else can be said than art.Eisenstein created a stunning masterpiece, propaganda film and beautiful artwork. I am very happy because I just got a set of Eisenstein criteria.
