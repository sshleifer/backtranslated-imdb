This film is really unique. This really reflects the spirit of the game, but makes it interesting for the modern generation. The romance between Thromeo and Juliet was plausible and erotic, without many changes. Besides, it's so funny that I almost cried with laughter. <br /> <br /> Like most of “Tromy”, in your faces, under forbidden themes, blood and sex, and at the same time you add a really good game and plot of Shakespeare. You really need to watch this movie to believe it! <br /> <br /> In the credits (the best credits I have seen since “Hot”) there are some funny jokes, a lot of traces in jokes, as well as a common satire and Shakespeare. refs. And Lemmy from the house Motorhead narrates. I lent this movie to a friend, and it was almost impossible to get it back. Troma at its best, this film is truly a gem and is in my top 5 favorite films of all time. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the film that you would watch with your mother and could offend some people. Anyone who is bored running in a regular movie theater with a stupid sense of humor MUST SEE THIS FILM.
