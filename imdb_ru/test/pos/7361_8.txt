I can't believe that I enjoyed it as much as I did. The anthological stories were better than the nominal ones, but the connecting story and its unexpected ending hooked me. Many familiar faces will keep asking you "where have I seen them before?" Forget the time shown on the New Line tape, it's not 103 minutes, according to my VCR timer and IMDB. Space Maggot, in its own way, put out the fire and raised the eight.
