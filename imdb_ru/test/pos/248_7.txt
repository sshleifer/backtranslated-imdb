This is undoubtedly an outstanding musical of 1944 with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of Charles Widor. Rita Hayworth (Rusty Parker), "Charlie Chan in Egypt," sang and danced with Gene Kelly (Danny McGhire), "Anchors Away", Danny McGuire owned a nightclub in Brooklyn, New York, and was in love with Rusty Parker, who was a dancer at his club with Phil Silvers, (Genius), Coney Island, who was a comedian in this film, and also worked and danced with Danny Rusty. Otto Kruger (John Cowdair), "Duel in the Sun", acted as a promoter for the magazine for the girls on the cover and decided that Rusty Parker would be his main model. Jerome Kern's music is heard in the whole picture, and the song "Long Ago & Far Away" is the main theme of this musical. This film was nominated for many awards and was very successful at the box office during World War II, which did not allow people to think about the war that was happening at that time. Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly have been instant hits, and their careers have exploded on a silver screen for years. A great musical and a movie you donâ€™t want to miss, this is a really great classic movie. enjoy
