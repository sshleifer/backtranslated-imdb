Can I ever go to this hospital [or hospice, if I want to be politically correct] [who still came up with this stupid phrase?], For something other than instructions on how to get out of the city. George S. coped well with the role of a burnt, overworked cynic who came to the conclusion that his life was a waste, but helpless to change his environment or conditions, even when he was given an excellent opportunity [which is probably not so golden anyway]. I got a few laughs from this cruel black comedy, but at the same time I was sobering and often chilled to the bone, because I fear that this atmosphere permeates most of the healing houses, even when I write.
