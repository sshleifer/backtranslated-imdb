“Shadow Magic” brings back the joy and surprise of the audience of the first film. It also shows the strength of the film in its ability to bring the world closer, overcome cultural barriers and save itself for future generations. Of course, this film will appeal to all who truly love the art of cinema. This is a great first attempt by screenwriter and director Ann Hu, who, I hope, will have a lot of films.
