Bedrooms and Corridors were one of the funniest films of the 1999 Melbourne Film Festival. From the UK we are talking about a young crowd of flatmates and their various dilemmas in relationships. Most of the humor is centered around the new self-help group for men, where they distribute various tools, such as the “stone of truth”. They also go to the weekend of "hunter-gatherers" with fun results. Believe me, you will laugh.
