I first watched this film at the Istanbul Film Festival back in 1994. It was so great that I took a couple of friends with me and looked again at the same week. The characters are very well played, and the humor is terrific here and there. This is a very powerful gay movie. Some scenes make you feel like you're watching the episode "Friends" with much more complex lines. I suppose I will insert this into my VCR and look again tonight ...
