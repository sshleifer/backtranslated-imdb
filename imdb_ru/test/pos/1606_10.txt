It may be hard to explain how, but this film is a masterpiece. Perhaps because I never imagined that such a plot or film with so many words would convey all this poetry. True poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. Bogarde is amazing, and there is no need to say that Venice is used as an ideal landscape: dark, sinking and dreary, like the soul of Bogard. And classical music is more than just a background that accompanies human feelings. In my opinion, a classic masterpiece of European filmmaking.
