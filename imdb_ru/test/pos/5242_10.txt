I really have nothing to add to all the other comments except this one: for me, the film looked like a silent film, slowly adapting to the sound. I believe that text boards carrying history have reinforced this impression. On the way, the actors were allowed to leave nonsense similar to the theater; Margaret Churchill is very similar to the typical heroine of an early silent film at the beginning of the film, but in the end more subtle expressions are allowed. Gus, a Swede? Reminded me of the comic characters of Shakespeare's plays, and Windy sounded to me like the early Donald Duck. <br /> <br /> It struck me that all of this was filmed outside, in place, and although the dust of all the wagons, horses and cattle obscured the idea that it really should be so for real settlers! It was also clear to me that many of these Indians must have been real, and I did not find any obvious racism towards them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As a man who became a true fan of Wayne in the trilogy of the cavalry of John Ford and believed that the “Stage Trainer” was the first Wayne as a leading star, this film was a revelation. The plot is very simple, again reminds me of a silent film, but the song is really real! An amazing film, which was shot using this technique in these conditions in 1930.
