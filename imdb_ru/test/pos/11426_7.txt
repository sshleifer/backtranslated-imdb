Seeing Laurel without Hardy in the film seems strange, but still interesting. This is a well-made parody of what has become a classic silent film, and it very well demonstrates Stan’s talents. Although his photographs with Oliver Hardy were great, these early solo internships give you an idea of ​​how skilled he is in his craft and how great he could be if he continued the traditions of Keaton and Chaplin as a separate star. The dance sequence with his real wife on stage in a cafe is the best part of the picture, and there are some pretty funny episodes in it with beautiful dance steps Laurel. And the culmination of a bullfight is a gem, because even a bull accepts failure. And I like the irony in the scene where he is buried in hats and fits in his familiar bowler hat Laurel and Hardy. As much as I love Laurel and Hardy's team and I feel that there was never a more funny comedy duo on the screen during their prime time, it's nice to see them from time to time on your own (check out KATUKKIANA'S BATTLE, which Hardy did to the Duke as another great example. ) Dale Roloff
