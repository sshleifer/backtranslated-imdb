I watched this movie as a child and I still enjoy watching it from time to time because of nostalgia. When I was younger, I liked the movie because of the entertaining plot and interesting characters. Today, I still love characters. In addition, I think of the plot with great respect, because now I see morality and symbolism. Rainbow Bright is by no means the worst film in history, and although it is outdated, I’m sure I’ll show it to my children in the future when I have children.
