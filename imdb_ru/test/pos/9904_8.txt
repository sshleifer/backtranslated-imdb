At the 2005 Phoenix Film Festival, it was no secret which film won first place in the general list of viewers. Checking Out (2004) gathered crowds of moviegoers at the Scottsdale cinema "Harkins Sine-Capri". The festival visitors, who stood in a queue for hours, were turned away at the door, despite the possibility of showing in two theaters. <br /> <br /> “Departure” (2004) is a beautifully made movie; inspirational comedy for a wide range of viewers. Director Jeff Hare mixes traditional cinematic techniques with a new twist of creativity, capturing Peter Falk at his greatest and most sentimental moments (usually shown in close-up intimate shots) on a silver screen. <br /> <br /> Checking Out (2004) is an outstanding independent film that deserves your attention, with its inspiring combination of witty humor and plot plot development.
