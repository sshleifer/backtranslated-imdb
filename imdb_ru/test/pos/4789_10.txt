Every time when in the late 70s and early 80s this film was broadcast on night television, I always found time to sit in front of the TV and watch it. To see the beautiful Kate Jackson, the handsome Richard Long, the “great” Polly Bergen, whom I have never seen anywhere else but this television movie, sweet Tom Bosley and another “great” that I have never seen outside this film Celeste Holm. This is really a love boat on a cruise for murder, and chaos, and boy, it was ever good !! And every time I watch it, I always forget who the real killer was. <br /> <br /> As expected, someone here is already criticizing the film, as if it really helps someone a lot. This is a great TV movie that is worth watching every time. I can not say that about half of the films that I saw this month. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the opportunity to watch it on TV, which is unlikely, watch it. In light of the fact that "The Most Mostly To" will be released on DVD this year, there may be hope for the release of the Death Cruise DVD.
