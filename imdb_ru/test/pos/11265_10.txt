This presentation leaves no desires. We saw it in Offenbach, Germany, and it is breathtaking. We received only cheap tickets in the distant past, but still had an idea about everything that happened. If you ever have the opportunity to see it live, then GO! The trip is worth it, and if I were you, I would wait half an hour after the show to “cool down”. The performance is breathtaking, and around the tent colorfully dressed performers who distract, help, smile and generally enliven the entire tent. Music is live music !! - as good as the CD version: great! I bought a DVD later, but there were less colorful costumes on the set. This is an atmosphere in a tent that raises you from your feet. Great trip for old and young, and also a great movie.
