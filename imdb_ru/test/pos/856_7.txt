Stephanie Meyer will be so tagged! Now her book "Breaking Dawn" will not be the first with such a title. Sorry Twilight fans. <br /> <br /> Kelly Overton (“Ring Two”) is a medical student, Eva, who is assigned to interview the psychotic Don (James Haven is Angelina Jolie’s brother). I suspected this turn, and when she found out that they both grew up in the same city, I was sure of it. <br /> <br /> She became deeper and deeper with her patient to such an extent that I felt that there was a common misconception. At times, she even behaved as if she had PTSD. I really thought she was losing it. <br /> <br /> Well, she did not lose it, and when the end came, I was amazed. All my suspicions turned out to be wrong. The turn was even more awesome than I thought. <br /> <br /> Overton was fantastic, and the story is much better than what Stephanie Meyer came up with. Must see.
