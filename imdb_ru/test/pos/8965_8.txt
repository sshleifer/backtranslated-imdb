... with one action. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson, a congressman, is a real character. In the 90s, when communism in the USSR, the Berlin Wall and the war with Afghanistan (with the Soviets) were destroyed. He did it, one failure in money, and everything went down. He must be remembered, so here it is. His memorial. <br /> <br /> Return to movie. Funny, dramatic, snobbish, political or just plain boring. In any case, this is a smart film about political life, how to rule the world, and, above all, a lesson for the whole world. A lesson for all politicians, a critical point of view concerning countries that support war with money, weapons and words. <br /> <br /> Lesson learned: the world is not the best place to live
