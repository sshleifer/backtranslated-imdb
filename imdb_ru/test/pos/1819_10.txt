This gem captures the life of the early 80s. As a student in the 83rd year of study <br /> <br />, I must say that “The Girl from the Valley” (along with the “Fast Times” in the <br /> <br /> “Ridgemont High”) stands out as teenage sex movie br / <br /> genre. Characters are accurate representatives of the era; <br /> <br /> Stupid guys, rebel-pseudo-punks, tidy athletes - everything is presented here <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I've seen it more than ten times. The music in the film was top notch <br /> <br />. Unfortunately, these tunes were never as popular in their era as cockroach arena tunes such as Journey, Styx or Loverboy <br /> <br />. Before the soundtrack appeared, I was looking for recordings <br /> <br /> and tapes (after all, it was the 80s!) Josie Cotton, Sparks, <br /> <br /> Plimsula and modern English. <Br /> <br /> This film deserves respect. This is not just a good 80s movie. This <br /> <br /> is a great movie. Period.
