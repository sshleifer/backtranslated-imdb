Honestly, I shot this film solely for the reason that it was part of the Children's Play series. I was expecting a boring boring 4th part of the series as well, but I was surprised. This film was amazingly good, and I found it quite funny. There was a lot of dark humor, and the idea of ​​having two dolls was a good way to liven things up. Two dolls worked well together and added that Bonnie and Clyde got into the movie. Overall, it was very good for the 4th film in this series, with some horrible scenes of death (just see how Marilyn Manson is killed first, not to mention that John Ritter gets a face full of nails). Applauds the authors for the fact that they have seasoned things, and the end, although I found it a bit strange, leaves room for another OTHER sequel ... perhaps, "son of Chucky" !!!
