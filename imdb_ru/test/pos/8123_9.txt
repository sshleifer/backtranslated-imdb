Acting in this film, it is sometimes difficult NOT to imagine that the actors are those whom they portray themselves. Unbridled passion and acting skills sometimes make this film very enjoyable and exciting. I would not even know about it if it were not for HBO late at night. And the main reason why I like British films is much better than American films, is that the actors are not afraid to play what is needed.
