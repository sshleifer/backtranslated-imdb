This film is VERY long, but it should be divided into several nights. He has a star cast, and if you are a fan of Patrick Swayze, it will make your heart throb! :-) My mother is a civil war lover and a history teacher, and every summer we watched this film (we recorded it on TV) for a few, a few nights, until we got through it all. We remembered every line in the film, lol. Pop popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance. This is a great film for those who love an action movie, war, blood and courage, but also for those who have a soft romantic side. The clothes worn by women were GREAT! Sometimes I think I was born in the wrong era, laughs.
