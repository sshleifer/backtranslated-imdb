I like the show, but make up the script writers, take part in it! Stop pulling it on and on. You have a great concept, and it can be much more. Miles (Jenkins) is great and acts as a child, which age should act in the situation in which he found himself. Hey, be creative with creatures, they may have telepathic abilities or other supernatural powers. Children's actors in the series are very good and convincing. It seems that Miles's parents are too pointless with regard to what is happening, but develop it, come on! you have a great seed, and next season there may be a whole new twist with lots of new characters and creatures, as well as all sorts of interesting sci-fi things. If they could do a witch series, then you would have to do a series about these creatures and children.
