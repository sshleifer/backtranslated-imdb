Call it a manipulation if you like, but I fell in love with it. Of course, there could be more character development. Yes, there could have been a better movie, and less permanent Cinema of the Week scores, but Ed Harris was flawless, Cuba Gooding is charming and touching, and let's face it in people in real life how many of us really know the motivation of others. Little. We took a little look at the coach’s motivation (a very provocative dialogue, in my opinion, will not be soon forgotten), so, in my opinion, it was a great tribute to one person who broke out of his “comfort zone” to reach another person , and at the same time, touched the life of hundreds more. The lesson we all need to remember. Why is it so often the hardest thing to do? I recommend this beautiful little movie to anyone with a heart. You will not be disappointed. And bring your Kleenex. 8/10
