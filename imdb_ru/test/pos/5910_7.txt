Everyone knows that Lindburg excelled in the first transatlantic flight. So how can this movie be some kind of uncertainty or intrigue? Well, there is. Do not ask me how, but there is. Partly due to the fact that the director tells the story, but mainly because of the fascinating work of Jimmy Stewart, we are drawn into the story as if it was unfolding for the first time before our eyes. Although half of the film is shot in a cramped cockpit, it is as dynamic as any action. So if you are afraid to watch this movie because you think you already know the story, do it. I think you will be impressed.
