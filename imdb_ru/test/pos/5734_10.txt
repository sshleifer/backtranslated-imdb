I can not believe that someone gave this movie 1 rating !!! and this is just 3. average ... what's not to love about this movie? It's original, there are a lot of scary scenes in it that actually made me jump from my seat, and he has some great special effects. The story is fresh, there is a nude, and it is very polite. The killer was terribly insane in his own way, and the end was very unexpected. I have to admit that I really love this film, one of Spain's best horror films ever. If you consider yourself a real fan of horror, you need to get out and try to find this movie. You will be pleasantly surprised to do this.
