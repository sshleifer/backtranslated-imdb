This is a film that can be watched on TV, and only once ... I mean, this is good, but it is too long and the plot is so famous, it is not very original, but not boring. The best thing about the movie is action, Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon are great actresses, and in this film they did a great job. I give him 7.
