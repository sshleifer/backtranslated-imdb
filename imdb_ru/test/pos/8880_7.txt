I'm surprised people, after such lousy movies hit the top 250 or just at 7.0, I thought more people would enjoy “Throw your mom out of the train.” It was a great comedy by two amazing comedians, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito. Together they made a great duet of madness and obsession. Billy - a man who just lost his million dollar story to his ex-wife and repeatedly wants her dead, Danny has an insane and senile mother who just abuses him : if he kills his ex-wife, Billy must kill his mother. This is a crazy and funny story, over which you can always laugh. Please relax and enjoy this movie, people! It's good! <br /> <br /> 7/10
