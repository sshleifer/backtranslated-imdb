The successor of the society Susan Fletcher (Hopkins) and her rich father Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson) are unhappy that their young nieces Joan (Betty Filson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) lead a bohemian lifestyle in Greenwich Village with their artist Uncle John (Milland) ) after the death of their parents (Sister Susan and John's brother). Simon stopped trying to convince John to allow him and Susan to take care of the children and to resort to the help of private detectives to catch him in the wrong behavior or on the unemployed, and therefore he cannot properly take care of the children. Susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to Greenwich Village herself, posing as an actress to try to get information and / or convince him to see the reason. However, she discovers that she likes not only the free and creative lifestyle in which John and his friends live, and that the girls are well brought up, but also that she quickly falls in love with John. Inevitably, her true identity is revealed, and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should be with whom. <br /> <br /> I really liked this film, and I found that it was very short Duration (70 minutes) was the perfect duration to unleash this simple but charming story. Miriam Hopkins, one of the great actresses of the 1930s and 1940s, is amazing in this film. Her energy, style and useful beauty really contribute to the creation of a charming character, even if you know that she quickly rushes at people with whom she quickly communicates. This is the earliest film I saw in Ray Milland, and he was actually young and non-patrician looking. (And, apparently, three years younger than his colleague) His energetic and carefree manner in Wise Girl was a refreshing change in behavior that he manifests in his usual, darker films. Honestly, although I usually am not a fan of childish actors, I really liked the two young girls who played Susan's nieces. They were quite early and really were the jewels of the film. Unfortunately, I cannot dig out other films in which any of these films were subsequently shot, and this is a shame, because in both films a large number of natural talents were revealed. <br /> <br /> “Wise Girl” was a film shot three years after the creation of the Hollywood Codex, and to some extent this was perfectly clear thanks to a quick and happy ending and a high and light cake in the sky with which they lived characters The supposed bohemian co-op was in fact a magnificent dead end, where artists lived for free or for trade, and everything is very well connected everywhere. Fortunately, it was a fairly light film, and the characters were charming enough to take into account its fluffiness and flaws, and I could just accept the “Wise Girl” for what it was; a good old-fashioned love story that was as interesting as attractive. Unfortunately, the films of the genre of the romantic comedy / drama today are much less intelligent and interesting, otherwise I would not constantly return to the classics. 7/10
