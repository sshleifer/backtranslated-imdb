Dude, I love it, I can leave a review for this 10-minute romp. I like it. <br /> <br /> Not seeing this for years, I accidentally stumbled upon it and looked again and again. <br /> <br /> “Stop shaking your eyes” and shaking the rock'n'roll band ”and“ stop cutting the table ”is a hell of a classic line. <br /> <br /> Art is deliciously raw. The dialogue is meager and wonderful. Just find it and love it. Can't recommend this. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Mrs. Kogan’s high school art teacher for showing us this over and over again. Thanks to the NFB for allowing this to happen. Thanks to MTS for showing it (at least for the moment, for free). <br /> <br /> I want a Big Snit t-shirt. I would have liked the animation cell, but at 440.00 pop music this will not happen. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and watch it.
