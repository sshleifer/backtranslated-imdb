I just watched this movie at the Pavement Film Festival in Birmingham, Alabama, which was really very funny and was just shocked. It was the best movie I've ever seen all day. A prostitute of school age meets a middle-aged man and tries to do away with deep depression. This is an inner view of the darkest parts of human sexuality. The story stems from real events, torn directly from the headlines. Rude, stupid dialogue and a deadly turn at the end. The film contains graphic sexual dialogue and nudity. Definitely not suitable for children. Too depressing for the taste of some people. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion though.
