The way I spend my vacation closes the series, which was broadcast from 1990 to 1992. I always liked this show. I have never compared the series with the melodies of Luni of past days. The video release was divided into four or five episodes (I do not remember how I write this) for television, and it is included in the list of episodes of the series. What is good about this series is that all the main characters of the series play the main role in the story. We see what they do during the summer holidays in different parts of the world. Elmira and her parents in Safari, Pluki and Hampton cross the country with Hampton's parents, Fifi on some beach, etc. The climax is very good, and at the end all the characters of Tiny Toon are reunited for the beginning of the new year in Looniversity, thus , almost ending the good launch of this TV show.
