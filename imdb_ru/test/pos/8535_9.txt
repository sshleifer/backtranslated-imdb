I honestly did not think at first that this film would make me laugh to hell and admire the wonderful effects of blood, boy, I was wrong! From the very beginning to the very end, the film showed magnificent bloody effects, accompanied by fakes from other names, such as “Evil Dead” and “Gremlins”. This film can be compared to the works of art by Peter Jackson, although this film is not as scary as "The Brain-Dead", but I am sure that these guys will make another film with splashes.
