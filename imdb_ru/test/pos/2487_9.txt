Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary film made by Peter Watkins. The assumption is that dissidents of the nation (hippies, musicians, protesters, pacifists, etc.) gather and appear before the court, and then they are given the choice of a prison or a fleet of punishments. This is the 52-mile grueling path through the desert to the American flag, pursued by the police, the National Guard and other authorities. The idea is that if you get to the flag, you will be released. The tribunal consists of a group of conservative types, all condemn any behavior that is not similar to their own, and there is no result other than imprisonment or the “Park of Punishment” option for any of those under trial. There are a lot of things in this that still ring true, which in itself is rather alarming. People who complete the course are promised water halfway, which is not true, and the pursuing officials are mostly a group of sadists who just want to practice a little. This is not a very graphic film, but it is more shocking with its ideas and themes than anything else. Scary is that this could happen. Not a very optimistic film, but definitely worth seeing. Warning: it can make you angry. 9 out of 10
