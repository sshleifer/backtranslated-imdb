Denis Leary can really be fun and smart at times and always enjoyable, but it requires success! This show showed Liri's genius. <br /> <br /> The work takes place in New York. Leary plays Mike McNeil, a brutal detective who is married, has drug problems and has a girlfriend. McNeil has a serious relationship. So much he drips into it. The site is filled with funny, interesting and cute characters, except for McNeil. Great cast too. All the episodes in this show are really fun and addictive. One liner in this show is everywhere. You will hear them and laugh at them in a few minutes, and then at some. Cases faced by the polling station - this is something else for the nun strippers, the situation with hostages in the bathroom and much more. This show was too good. Could grow legs to last many more seasons. <br /> <br /> Last word: great, fantastic show. I really miss this show. All the episodes of this show are great. You get even belly laughs ... a lot. ABC made a huge mistake by giving it an ax. It is a pity that Leary did not revive the show for cable television. However, I give this show one of my highest recommendations. A truly one-of-a-kind show.
