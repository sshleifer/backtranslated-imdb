... the opportunity he gave me to look at the past of Ireland was invaluable. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to see this with my mother, who hails from Cork, and we watched while watching, and I learned a lot from her about how it was then. <br /> <br /> Sort of like Deasy and Co. was a soft drink company in Cork; how rain can really destroy a crop; as farmers used to harvest; as in the dance halls, women and men really had to stand along opposite walls before the men came forward and asked the woman to dance; about the bellows that supported the fire; how the priests actually called the list of donators of the church and their donations, as well as a little about the currency then (that my dad helped me show a case showing pennies, shillings and crowns that were used then (which were legal England too)). <br /> <br /> I didn’t pay much attention to how good the film was, but I was very grateful that I had the opportunity to look back at that time, which for some is Irish. History, but for others, including some of our parents and grandparents, it’s just their childhood.
