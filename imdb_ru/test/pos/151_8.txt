Korean cinema can turn genres upside down, and the latest film by the famous director Chan-wook Park is a story about a good pious priest who becomes a vampire. Add a seductress who misleads him, and make up an eccentric, and you will have a wonderful recipe. <br /> <br /> Directed partially in a style similar to the “Sympathy” trilogy, it is as luxurious as it is dark. Staying away from the clichés, he offers some new tricks in the oversupply vampire genre. This is an existential film, trying to grasp a moral puzzle about how exactly a person should choose to live according to his conditions, and not enjoy bloodthirstiness. However, the film does not take itself too seriously, and there is limitless humor everywhere. <br /> <br /> Our presenters play their part perfectly, playing with our emotions and enjoying the dark humor. There are moments of reflection on the whole moral puzzles involved in the film, but he never preaches. To some, this may seem too long, and it may subside at some points, but it is worth giving it a chance to end. <br /> <br /> If you like left-field films, there are fewer of them than this one lately. Dark and exciting, it will pull in the crowd. One I would recommend you try.
