I saw several Fred Carpenter films on Showtime, Pay Per View and video / DVD, and I enjoyed most of these films, especially with a little beer, (Carpenter knows how to entertain) "EDDIE MONROE" and "MURDERED INNOCENCE" - my favorites . I recently watched the EDDIE MONROE promo DVD, and everything, from the cast to the plotline and the direction, worked smoothly. (Doug Brown’s music was sensational.) I liked to see Frank Sivero (“Goodfellas”, “New York, New York” and “Wedding Singer”), he is an amazing and very underrated actor. But I especially liked the performance of Paul Vario, who played Uncle Benny, I watched his acting titles on IMDb and found out that this was his first lead role. Where was this guy! Give Fred Carpenter a loan for discovering the Great New Talent, and it's only a matter of time when you meet Pacino and De Niro. As I mentioned, Carpenter knows how to have fun, and when you work with a limited budget, it's amazing what Carpenter can produce. (I read an interview with VENT MAGAZINE, and Carpenter never made a film for more than $ 400,000.) Before I watched Eddie MONROE I saw Rocky Balboa and The Good Shepherd, both excellent films “Eddie Monroe” brought me to an unexpected finale because of a very good script, good performances of the entire cast (Craig Morris is a movie star waiting to be done, and lead actress Jessica Tsunis was hot!) I have already said, I recently saw “Rocky Balboa” and “The Good Shepherd”, if I had written commenting on these two films, I would say that I would say the same about Eddie Monroe, the only thing that two very good films have nothing to do with Eddie Monroe, they were not worth a few hundred thousand. A great film, and I didn't even drink beer.
