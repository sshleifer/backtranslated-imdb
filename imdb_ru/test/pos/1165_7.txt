The beautiful Candace Bergen, as the widow of Perdikaris, was kidnapped and kept for ransom by sheikh Raisuli, played by one dashing Sean Connery. The incident occurred in 1904, when Theodore Roosevelt himself is running for presidency. Needing a good example to demonstrate the muscular foreign policy of the United States, Brian Keith in the role of Roosevelt makes a startling declaration to the Sultan of Morocco: "Perdikaris is alive or Raisuli is dead." <br /> <br /> But in this adaptation of this incident, the well-known declaration is the only truth in this story. Perdikaris in question was actually Ion Perdikaris, who was a Greek immigrant and amateur playboy. In fact, Perdikaris renounced his American citizenship many years ago and returned as a Greek citizen. Never mind that, his predicament was quite operational at that time. <br /> <br /> A maid in distress makes the best screen material, although thus the widow woman and her two children are at risk here. Of course, as presented here, this incident is also used by some of our European powers to gain a foothold in Morocco. Intrigues go far beyond the requirements of a robber for ransom. <br /> <br /> Wind and Leo are hardly history. But it's a nice movie, and Sean Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith also fits my concept of Theodore Roosevelt, and the scenes in the Roosevelt White House really correspond to all the stories told. John Houston plays the ever-patient Secretary of State John Hay, whom Roosevelt inherited from his predecessor William McKinley. <br /> <br /> But children do not use this film to skip the reading of the Theodore Roosevelt eraâ€™s historical assignment.
