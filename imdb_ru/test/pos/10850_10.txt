I love this film. I watched it again and again when I rented it from Netflix. He had a lot of substance and meaning to me. I think many will like it. I have read and seen quite a few lesbian stories over the years, and I am glad to say that they are getting better and better in the way they are presented. They tend to have a more positive sense of lifestyle. and feel gay. It's nice to see that two women find themselves and are happy in this society as well as others. I think it is obvious that more and more films with this theme will adorn our theaters and television screens. Many producers and directors understand that lesbians live a very full and rewarding life and that we have wonderful stories that should and can be seen by individuals and families without hesitation.
