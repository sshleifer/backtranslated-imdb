I don’t know which film or version Jeff saw, but this whole film was awesome, and not just Poitiers and Going. The story was exciting, tense and attractive. And for a guy complaining about historical accuracy, become real. Yes, there were several black deputy marshals in India, but they did not have the right to arrest whites outside of India. As a rule, they did not “patrol”, but used warrants only for criminals. It seemed strange to me that Corby did not seem to have "any" Indian friends. I know that their number has decreased, but it still seems strange to me. Even when Corby returned to his people, his Indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless.
