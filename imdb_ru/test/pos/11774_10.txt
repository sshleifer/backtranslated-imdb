“Hardware Wars” is a fun 12-minute short parody of the original Star Wars film, which was released just a few months after Star Wars in 1977. This film uses home appliances as spacecraft, and Star Wars-like actors send you. roll on the floor in uncontrollable bouts of laughter. This film received many awards at film festivals and was the film that inspired Mel Brooks to write his parody film Star Wars, called Space Balls. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite parody film, and I recommend it to anyone who is familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor. <br /> <br />
