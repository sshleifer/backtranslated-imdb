I'm in the overwhelming minority here. I also didn’t really care about the original caddyshack, except for the scene of the Chase / Murray duet and some Rodney jokes. Well, figure it out: Rodney vs. Jackie are both Jews and have similar humor. Rodney is a bigger and more distinct name. Jackie has a casual and more observant approach to his jokes, and in this sequel he is more “yours”. Jackie’s attitude to everything is unforgettable and, in a sense, inspiring! his fast lines and overconfidence left me wanting to express myself in that way. Rodney was good, but he was not enough, and he was more “in your face” and dismissive. Jackie, in a rare film, makes the perfect sub for Rodney (oh well, a gun in the shape of a gun?! Very good at playing yuppie snobby. Ted Knight, despite his wonderful film and television career, shows his age. But he fulfills snobbish parts, and we want him to fall. Ted looks a little weak and rather annoying, too angry at playing out his anger and frustration, while the stack is more insidious and vindictive; you really hate it and enjoy seeing that it constantly fails . Winning Stacks are with me. <br /> <br /> Murray vs. Aykroyd - well, both had excellent, vintage SNL-like scenes with an ubiquitous and pleasant Chevy hunt (Thai Web). I liked Murray / Chase more. Murray plays his a wonderful, annoying, talkative character with an obvious improvisational skill and pleasant, but annoying, and the same can be said for the ikroyd. part one. These are 2 completely different films. Part one - more drugs / bath / sexual humor with a full set of great names. Part 2 uses golf as a backdrop for a comedy with “reconcile with the rich”, which makes you feel better in the working class. Scenario 80s? Yes. a little far-fetched? yes, but was not the first? an insult for a sport of golf? yes, is this movie a subtle story? Yes, this is a comedy with real humor, not “dancing with wolves” !! besides, part 2 has a much better soundtrack !! PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BE A CONTINUING PART ONE !! He has 98%, and he should not have the name "CADDYSHACK". Nevertheless, I am a big fan of caddyshack 2, and this is an excellent example of 80's downy entertainment with high-quality humor. VIVA JACKIE MASON !!! to all gearboxes - clarified! This is a great comedy. Randy Quaid was great, Jonathan Silverman was great, damn it, everyone was !! All this in the chat, and now I feel that I look! i think i will do
