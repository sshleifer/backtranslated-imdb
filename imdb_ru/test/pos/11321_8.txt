Daniel Percival's Dirty War, a BBC producer for television, was shown recently via cable. The film has a documentary style in how it comes after people who have caused almost a holocaust in one of the largest megacities in the world, London. In fact, this film, made in 2004, is almost a warning story about the events of the next year, when terrorists set explosive devices in public transport that kill innocent people who were not in the right place at the wrong time. /> <br /> The film impresses with the pace that the director and producers gave the project. There are no boring moments in the film when we watch the preparation of terrorists and people who follow their dirty work. Although the inevitable happens, it is simply amazing to think about what the consequences would be if a real “dirty bomb” was laid in such a densely populated area. <br /> <br /> The last frames of the film have a frightening effect. Mafia scenes and how the whole territory is polluted cause fear to tremble, reflecting on how this could happen anywhere.
