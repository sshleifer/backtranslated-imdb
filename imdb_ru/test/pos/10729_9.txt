Usually, films do not fall into the sphere of “home drama”, and there is a good reason for this: who wants to deliberately seek entertainment in the story of what they or loved ones have to face in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all classes, and custody battles are ugly and necessary parts of it. This is not an escape from reality - the number one reason why an ordinary person turns to the cinema is a sad reality. <br /> <br /> Divorce or custody is usually just a part of a big story that influences how we understand it or how we treat its characters. Kramer v. Kramer focuses on this and asks us to understand why we are doing this and why it is so disturbing. This is a challenge for this film and for its audience: to turn something so real into something that can attract our attention, and then make us not feel angry when the mirror is in front of us. Writer / director Robert Benton has definitely achieved both an adaptation and an impressive way of adapting this novel by Avery Corman. <br /> <br /> The story, as one would expect, is quite simple: a big business advertising agent Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) comes home and discovers that his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) leaves him and their 7-year-old son. Billy (Justin Henry). Then Ted must quickly learn to be an active father in the life of the boys, and as soon as he does, Joanna brings a lawsuit to him. <br /> <br /> To film an Oscar-winning drama about something so generic and especially difficult, the dialogue first requires tremendous acting talent. You do not get much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is in his prime in this role: his first Oscar win after three other notable nominations. He creates a solid character whose selfish and quick-tempered image clearly changes when he learns to be the best father and sole trustee. Streep wins her first Oscar only in the second leading role in her career as a woman who doesn’t get much screen time, but must report her inner torment when she decides to leave, and also gain a sense of identity when she returns to take into custody . The strip does it effortlessly. The young man Justin Henry, who at his age was the youngest nominee in the category “Contest” in the history of the Oscar, plays an exceptionally good embodiment of all 7-year-old children. <br /> <br /> The authors and directors of Benton speak at a level where we look deeper into the problems of this family than our own, and thus we reconsider our thoughts about love and raising a family. Benton’s previous conspicuous merit (“Bonnie and Clyde” and “Superman”) would not have indicated a strong team of family drama, but a person can write calmly. Numerous scenes give us strong visual effects that show us a lot more than the typical family scenarios they depict. The first morning, when Joanna left and the French toasts of Billy Ted do, is a classic, which perfectly demonstrates all the talent that goes into this film, in the scene that happens in the kitchen of Americans every morning. <br /> <br /> You will rarely see history as easily as Kramer vs. Kramer. In the end, there are no surprises or turns that will keep us desperately glued to the screen. The film must then rely on its talents, and they are all infallible, providing a new understanding of the subject, which is so familiar.
