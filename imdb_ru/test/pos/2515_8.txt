In 1937, Darryl Zanuck, who recently moved from the position of production manager at Warner Brothers, tried to raise his newly created company, 20th Century Fox, from the ground and on a level playing field with his old bosses at Warners and the glitter palace at MGM. “This is my business” was an attempt to cash in on the current success of historical films shot at the turn of the century (“San Francisco”, “In Old Chicago”), and, looking back, he achieved very significant successes. The plot is exciting. The creator of the problems, but the heroic naval officer (Robert Taylor) receives a secret assignment from President McKinley to reveal the ring of bank robbers who paralyze American finances. He finds a gang, but falls in love with their female mascot (Barbara Stenvik) and must choose between love and duty. <br /> <br /> Not everything in this vintage film works well, but overall this is a good piece of filmmaking studio. The plot of the story would have been borrowed by Kurt Vonnegut for “Mother's Night” (Nick Nolte played a major role in this book) and it seems quite plausible, at least in what they did in the studio. As a fan of old films, I am always delighted when I come across what I have never seen, and “This is my business” was no exception.
