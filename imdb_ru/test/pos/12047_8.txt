It was Bollywood's answer to the fatal appeal, and this is a classic film in itself. Juhi Chawla was as good as Sunny Deol, but it was Shah Rukh Khan who became famous as a stalker. Since then, he has become Chopra's favorite (Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge, Mohhabatein, Dil to pagal hai, Veer Zaara and Chak De India). Shah Rukh first seems like a villain, but then towards the end you begin to sympathize with him. The scenarios were excellent and the songs were hits. My favorites are “Too easy to self” and “Jaadu teri nazar”. <br /> <br /> After the sad failure of the underrated Lamha Yash Chopra, he fought off Darra. The dialogues were memorable, the dialogue k..k..Kiran is often repeated. Since then, Darr Yash Chopra slipped a bit. Dil to pagal hai was bad, but he bought himself a little with Veer Zaara, which was much better. It was the last masterpiece of Yash Chopra.
