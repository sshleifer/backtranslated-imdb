As a child I liked the song “Never smile at a crocodile,” and if I get into a state of affairs that is actually inspired by real events. A smile would be the last thing in my head. From the very beginning, I have never been so entrenched, caught off guard and finally exhausted, as I watched this independent Australian horror film with a limited budget, about three people in the Northern Territory trapped in a mangrove swamp with a very cunning crocodile waiting in the water below them. What really animated the film was how realistic it was to convey the fear and uncertainty of the characters' situation to the audience. Semi-documented camera work with an alarming, creepy background and authentic action will actually take you out of your comfort zone. What we get is the story of the patient's survival, and not just the bloody attack of all creatures. Think of Open Water (2003), where its budget and time limit ensured that it remained restrained, but this minimal barrier improved the impression. <br /> <br /> The story of slow grinding can be black and white, but it never became disposable or yielded to formal patterns. Well, not so much, and the connection between the characters was emotionally attractive, even with a simple and understandable script. Although you can say “less is more”, actions and expressions illuminate the lingering thoughts that plague their minds. The test is terribly scary because the threat is very lively and it never seems to subside. This is what drives the film's chaotic adrenaline, and in which it lasts (even when it is buried) to the very end. <br /> <br /> Script writers / directors Andrew Trauki and David Nerlich’s economic leadership push and deftly engage the viewer with his tight career and agonizing psychological traits. In certain areas, the incision rises, with stress caused by stress and striking images. The way to perform the night sequence is extremely frightening and frightening. Threatening manipulative toys of the crocodile with its fresh meat in a painfully tense approach. Of course, some moments seemed unlikely, but this never hinders or distracts. Sound FX is the key, and sometimes the lack of it all eats you up. The musical score of Rafeal May is modest and doesn’t really bring much into the mix, but when it does, it creates an organic sound quality. John Biggins' cinematography is beautifully designed and quickly aggressive when mood changes. It has always been in motion and claustrophobia, but none of these sudden movements. Editing was carefully crafted and the effects were professionally served, perfectly combining live crocodile footage. <br /> <br /> Something similar to this play would also have to rely on its composition in order to plausibly sell the story, and they do. Diana Glenn, Andy Rodored and especially Maeve Dermody are very good. Most of the responsibility falls on Dermody, and she decisively copes with an inspirational turn. Now this subject can be compared with another crocodile killer film “The Rogue (2007)”, but these two concepts can not differ from each other by who they want to be and how they end up. Although, if I had to choose, I'm more inclined to this exit to get his attention. <br /> <br /> A remarkable effort on all fronts, where everyone involved demonstrates the potential that is worth paying attention to.
