<br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez makes a wonderful HOMEFRONT play and turns it into an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> In the movie “War in the House,” an exceptionally strong cast — everyone seems to be deeply slammed into their characters. Acting is here - TOP NIGHT! <br /> <br /> Credit must also be given to director Emilio Esteves. The visual transitions between past and present were very smooth. The sound effects during the battle scenes were frightening and effectively added tension. <br /> <br /> Remove all elements from Vietnam from history, and still there would be interesting characters fighting good and bad from the full range of family dynamics. (The viewer could have seen this point more clearly, referring to “finding an old photo” from the very beginning, while the rest of the film is being watched). <br /> <br /> Like a film, I found WAR IN A HOUSE to be more direct and specific than I was born on July 4th. Excellent effort - almost 10. <br /> <br />
