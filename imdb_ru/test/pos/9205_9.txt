I read the comments about Las Vegas and agree with some of them, this is not television with brain surgery, but again I got the impression that television was mainly for escape, especially with what happens in the modern world. Let's face it, the Vegas show (which is not a reality-based program) does not go to a reality-based show, because for me Vegas is pure fantasy! This is the place where we can go and pretty much do what we want, whenever we want (obviously, taking into account the means!). <br /> <br /> Therefore, the fact that Las Vegas is beautiful, sexy and cliché with characters that reflect all this seems to be money in my eyes. If you don’t like it, don’t watch it, that's why we have a million channels! <br /> <br /> We are approaching the third episode here in the UK, and I know that I will be making Beeline to watch it again. I only hope that this is not canceled, which seems to often happen with most shows that arrive in the UK, which are half decent! (Firefly and Jake 2.0, anyone? !!). <br /> <br /> This is harmless, looks great fun, and every time I watch it, I want to return to the real occasion :)
