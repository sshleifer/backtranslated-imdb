Went to the premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York, and I really liked the movie !!! I am Diana's biggest fan and, of course, as always, she gave a great performance !! I have seen all of her films and I must say that this is one of my new favorites. Diana was cheerful and touching, and I caught my breath. Donald Sutherland was surprisingly humorous, but at the same time serious. Anton Yelchin - just a wonderful young actor and gave an amazing presentation. In general, I recommend this movie to anyone who can rate a great movie. 10 not bad !!! I would definitely see this again and again and again. This is the best film of the year !!!
