I doubt that the real history of the development of Western Union would ever get a real audience. Instead of talking about the construction of the telegraph system in the west, it was a story about meeting rooms, which was dominated by one of the most interesting (and not liked) great “robber barons”: Jay Gould. Gould picked up a struggling company and turned it into a communications giant — and part of his attempt to create a national railway system to compete with Vanderbilt. But this, although interesting, is not as exciting as the history of laying the telegraph lines themselves. At least that's what the audience will see. Jay Gould died in 1892. If he lived in the modern age and invested in Hollywood, he would probably agree with this assessment. <br /> <br /> The film tells how dangerous laying a telegraph system. Indians, abetted by one Jack Slade (Barton Maclaine). Desperate, Slade is unhappy with the development of the communications system, which will undoubtedly limit his ability to evade the police in the territories. He is confronted by the person responsible for laying the telegraph wires, Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger), Assistant Creighton Richard Blake (Robert Young) and quasi-lawyer Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott), brother Slade. Blake, a native of the East, a little understanding of the West, an affair with Creighton's sister Sue (Virginia Gilmore), but it is difficult for him to get used to his new environment. But he does become a close friend of Shaw, especially in attempts to resist Slade. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, Slade was a real Western criminal and the subject of the Mark Twain Scam section. He was hanged in the 1870s. But he had nothing to do with the incitement of Indians against railroads or telegraph companies. However, MacLaine makes him an unforgettably evil and utterly vicious type. His murder of one of the main characters occurs suddenly and from behind - and he examines the corpse, as if he had just got rid of irritation. But Lang is responsible for this, as well as other touches. Look at the sequence with Chill Wills, where he is on the telegraph pole, repairing it. He spits out tobacco juice several times, talking to Young, who sprinkles a little. Then comes the attack of the Indians, which we observe from the ground level. In the end, Young suddenly splashes again, but it is covered not with brown, but with red. He looks to the top of the pole, and there passes Wills with an Indian arrow. <br /> <br /> This is an exciting movie worth seeing.
