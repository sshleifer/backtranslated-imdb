SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertainment mess. The plot is forgotten, satire is easy, and action films, although well thought out, are not as exciting. But I was laughing. Lot. The loan goes to the inspirational mix of De Niro and Murphy. They have excellent chemistry. Murphy delivers one-liners, De Niro excites us with a look or a grimace. This film will receive criticism in the style of RUSH HOUR. Do not listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you'll love this movie.
