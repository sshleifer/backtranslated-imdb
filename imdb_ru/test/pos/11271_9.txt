Born black and white distorted image. It seems that he could have come from the nineteenth century. However, the sound is crystal clear, except for synchronization and the addition of soothing sounds of nature. <br /> <br /> This film is very critical of the struggle of life. It depicts a single mother and a child in a cruel world that thrives on the innocent. Mother does not notice her surroundings. This leads to a lot of torture, pain and death. You can watch it many times and see various characters, plot tricks and, basically, “what does it mean?”. <br /> <br /> If you value art in the movie, then you will like it. Otherwise, do not worry.
