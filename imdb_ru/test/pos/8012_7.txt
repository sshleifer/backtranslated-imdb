I and a few friends from the university — Alberto Lopez, Dave Hall, Selina Alcock (we graduated from the UEA, Norwich, UK in 1997) still get together and watch bi-films once a month. <br /> <br /> We are unsurpassed experts in the art of making bad films, and this film was quickly included in the top 10 horrible / brilliant films. <br /> <br /> so if you just got beer and weed, and you need a movie you can laugh at like exhaustion, DROID GUNNER aka PHOENIX 2 is the movie for you! Mark Singer is fully aware that he is in the movie here, and he is milking everything he can! Mattius Hughes is exalted in his wooden game and muscular debility (this word ??) when he grumbles: “But I want my 20 thousand!” Pure gold of Sloka! If you liked it, see also: TRAINERS, RUNSTUN, DOLMAN, and anything else from Charles Band or Fred Olen Ray ... (but keep in mind: some of their films are completely and completely unfounded, and you will scream about your lost watch life !!!?!).
