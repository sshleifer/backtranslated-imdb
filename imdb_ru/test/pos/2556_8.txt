My friend brought me this film, and at first I hesitated, the pace of the film was so slow that at first it was boring. But the scenes of life were attractive, it was like watching, not watching. <br /> <br /> It turned out that throughout the entire film it was just amazing, the way the director worked on life scenes to reflect the reality was confusing but at the same time overwhelming. It is like understanding the real life of a living person than watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Mr. Alejandro Polanco and Miss Isamar González performed their roles so well that it’s more like telling us your own stories. Indeed, they used their real names in the film.
