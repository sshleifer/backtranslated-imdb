This is a cherished film from my childhood! I can still hum the theme of the song without delay !! I remember going to bed late to watch this movie with my father, usually two or three times a year. We always called him "giant robot." Although the effects in this film are rough compared to today's standards, they are ideal for the genre of this film. I am also a BIG fan of Japanese Monster films, so this film was in one place with the other. Many years have passed since I watched this film, and I would like to receive a copy of it to share with my 8-year-old daughter.
