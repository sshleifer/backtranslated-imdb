I really enjoyed watching how Hell Pays. I was a fan of westerns for as long as I can remember, and this one reminded me of many westerns of the 1960s (although I was too young to see them in their first run). The only thing that bothered me about the film was the constant music. It distracted from time to time. One thing I noticed, and I wonder how many other Gunsmoke fans have noticed, is the name of the character Buck Taylor. It was a play on behalf of Doc Adams from Gunsmoke. Instead of Gaylan Adams, Buck Taylor used Adam Galen. I wonder if it was his choice or the choice of Chris McIntyre? In any case, I would recommend this movie to Westerners. Do not expect anything too "deep." Just old entertainment.
