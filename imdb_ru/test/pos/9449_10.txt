This is a classic American film combined with comedy, romance and a dream. You can say: “There have already been many such films. but just trust me, you will find it good, because he is a good director, the script and played. Amanda Bynes is just crazy! She is humorous, cute and charming both inside and outside the screen. she really is a man !!! the message I get from this should pursue your own fairy tale. I mean that “milk fairy tale” means not “prince and princess”, but “faith”. namely, it tells us that we must keep your faith, dreams and things that make you regret your whole life if you do not do one of those films that you cannot miss in your life.
