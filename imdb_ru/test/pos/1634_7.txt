Before watching the preview of Angels and Demons, I cleared my mind of any doubts that might prevent me from enjoying this; a huge amount of hate for Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because the name of Dan Brown is applied to all posters. I entered with an open mind and expected the worst, but instead I got 2 and a half hours of Roman cat-and-mouse games with Forrest Gump, and this is definitely a good entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The film hangs weakly on the novel itself. The Harvard symbolist Robert Langdon (Hanks) goes to Rome after the sudden death of the pope and re-election through the papal conclave. All this suits Carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (MacGregor). However, he soon learns about the new threat, which includes a secret brotherhood, announcing his presence, a time bomb against the matter, which the Vatican now targets, and the abduction of four cardinals. Langdon, who uses his intellect (and believe me, you will hear MUCH from him), is given the task of finding and saving them using the mysterious Path of Illumination. The scientist CERN Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also one of the creators of antimatter, helps him in the quest. <br /> <br /> The film itself moves at an uneven speed. In one minute, Langdon and the Swiss Guard are speeding up to save the corporate cardinal, and the next minute he tires you with meaningless information about every random object he misses, obviously slowing down the expected book / thriller sequences. It makes for interesting reading on paper, but on the screen it can go either way. <br /> <br /> Characters are decently written on the big screen. Ewan McGregor plays a convincing role in the role of the quiet but knowing Patrick McKenn, including the famous accent. Tom Hanks is a bit more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither he nor Aelet Zurer's speech is worth it, and instead of playing their part in this story, they are simply thrown away as assets. <br /> <br /> However, Angels and Demons achieve what DVC could never do; an exciting, fast-paced film filled with satisfactory explosions, wonderful entertainment of St. Peter’s Square and the Basilica (including many churches) and a pulsating bomb counting down at midnight. Ron Howard not bad copes with the second adventure of Langdon, this time having been subjected to great criticism and almost completely replacing the boring dialogue with the intense pursuit (almost). <br /> <br /> While newcomers may call this “National Treasure 3” with a much greater threat, there is still enough infectious candy waiting / thriller and brilliant pictures of Rome to breathe. Fans of the book It may seem that the films are radical changes in different ways, but given the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracies that it generates, A & D holds the viewer very well on the screen this time, and not on a sleeping paddle. <br /> <br /> Good adaptation of the book to the film, which will be attractive and interesting. <br /> <br /> 7.4 / 10
