To experience Khed, you really need to understand where the Monkeys were when they shot it. <br /> <br /> Their series was drawing to a close, and the group was almost bursting. Their inventive and comedy series (a kind of American idol of its time) took four unknown actors and formed around themselves a contrived supergroup. <br /> <br /> This is their view of their “artificial image” and the status of the second layer of the Beatles. They always felt that they were in a box, were trapped and could not find authority, despite their talents. <br /> <br /> This is also a hell of a musical, inventive (I have a soundtrack) and full of surprises. <br /> <br /> Look with an open heart.
