Cantoni is right that this little short man is just an excuse to hear how very young Judy Garland (fourteen years old!) Sings from a little older (by a year) Deanna Durbin. But I have to disagree with everything else that he or she said, including the playing time â€” which is only about ten minutes, not twenty (single video). <br /> <br /> The song is not the best, obviously; but it's nice and definitely worth ten minutes to look at Turner. The duet with Durbin is quite interesting: two contradictory styles, which, nevertheless, completely correspond to each other. <br /> <br /> A short circuit is just a drop, but it's far from as bad as another reviewer did. Honestly, I liked it. <br /> <br /> Dafidd Hugh
