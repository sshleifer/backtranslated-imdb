But rather outdated today. Otto Preminger made this film without a certificate of approval, which was necessary then. It was incredibly courageous and risky, because he could lose his investments and future. <br /> <br /> The film does not fit the beautiful book and, unfortunately, is Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra (and I have never been a fan), playing the Frankie Machine, amazes with its performance. Someone forgets that this is Frank, the level of realism that he brings to the role of a drug addict, a drug addict, must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak, always gorgeous and talented, does not disappoint in the role of a faithful outsider, always next to Frankie. <br /> <br /> The supporting roles, especially the young, handsome and talented Darrin Mac Gavin, are impeccable. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker plays Frankie's wife, hopelessly inept. She goes from annoying to melodramatic and too overwhelmed. Unforgettable presentation. <br /> <br /> Stage, cheap settings are terrible, as if a strong gust of wind will carry all sticky colored cardboard beyond the horizon. Almost funny at times because of their tasteless cheapness. <br /> <br /> The music was annoying and sometimes painful. As if every nuance of the script (example: when Louis gets Frankie, his repair from the box) should be emphasized at a high decibel level. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. Sinatra really deserved his Oscar nomination. Worth seeing.
