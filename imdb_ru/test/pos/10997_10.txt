This film is not your typical Hollywood fare, although the fees are so bad that I often try to stay away from films and not be disappointed. However, this small low-cost gem is completely enjoyable and enjoyable and definitely a keeper. The actors are as diverse as the characters they portray, the setting in Buffalo is charming (what a beautiful city), and the story shines. The absence of unreasonable violence, sex and the word "f" in no way diminishes! Take the children, take the grandmother, take a break from Hollywood! I give him 11 out of 10!
