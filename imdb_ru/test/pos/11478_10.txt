Despite its ultra-low budget, Sorte Nula is the most successful Portuguese film of 2004. And, I must say, deserved success. What I like most about Sorte Nula are the complex details that Fernando Fragata took care of about what is happening and what will happen next. This is a very detailed and wonderfully advanced love story for a seemingly simple thriller. Even more pleasant and ironic in this is the fact that the characters are in the same position, none of them knows the whole story and is left to their own assumptions, which makes Sorte Nula a cut above the rest. This is definitely not the movie you want to break in the bathroom, as you will surely miss something important. I feel that one of the main attributes of the film should be the environment that it creates. It's creepy but fun at the same time. I read somewhere that someone quotes this film, saying: "... it was like watching Hitchcock ...", and I could not agree with that !! I like such films where you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING to fully understand what is happening. 9/10
