Nowadays, you rarely come to children's shows that don’t participate 1) the teen / teen pop star who’s just as fun as watching the paint dry 2) get involved in finding the perfect date with another guy / girl 3 ) revolves around random shouting and incomprehensible humor. About 95% of shows on Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network meet the criteria listed. Simply put, they all lack a good game, originality and good stories. As if the producers and writers think that children are not smart enough to understand the development of the characters and the details of the plot. They could not be more ignorant. Of course, children enjoy good laughter and erratic behavior (if this is done at a conservative level and everything is done correctly), but they also want to enjoy the story, watch the drama and see the people who are challenged. They do not want to see people living in an immaculate world where they get everything they want. They know that in this world not everything is fun and games, they know that it is not perfect. Everyone has problems, and we all have to learn how to bypass them. This show revolves around this kind of stuff. Alex Mack is an ordinary teenage girl who seems to have everything for her brilliant sister, Annie. Her mother works in an office, but sometimes she remains at home as a parent. Her father, George, is a leading scientist at a plant, a chemical corporation that uses most of the city in which they live, Paradise Valley. Alex is not popular with most of his peers. Her only friend is Ray (but with the show she has more friends). On his first day of primary school age, Alex goes home not too happy with the school, but a truck that delivers chemicals from the factory crashes into a fire hydrant, trying to avoid moving, dropping a strange chemical known as GC-161, where chemical in him. Soon after, she begins to develop strange abilities, such as turning into a puddle, firing lasers from her hands and moving things in her mind. She also glows constantly when she is nervous (although we will never see this in the future). In addition to his sister Annie and girlfriend Ray, Alex decides to keep these powers secret from everyone, even from his parents, for fear of being kidnapped by the Plant, whose corrupt owner, Daniel Atron, has his security chief Vince, who is looking for the mysterious GC161 kid. Then in each episode, Alex tries to live a normal life as a child, and at the same time learns to live with his strange abilities. The show may seem like a show for girls, but it’s not. As a child I liked to watch this show because of its amazing effects and drama. The producers successfully complement the elements of science fiction with elements of teenage drama. In fact, some episodes were quiet, violent and a bit creepy. The unreasonable managers of the factory Atron and Vince become good antagonists for the series, because the writers really consider them a threat and give you this terrible feeling every time they appear on the screen. In addition, the smart move adds David, the truck driver who spilled the GC-161, as a clumsy assistant to Vince in the hunt for the comedy effect, but also you will love him towards the end. It was interesting to see how little Alex tries to live like a normal child, but struggles to improve his abilities. Sometimes you forget that these are children who are fighting a giant adult institution because you are involved in history. The show shows a good relationship with children, showing Alex that she may have supernormal abilities, but she is still a child and should be careful. Even any episode, you will be distraught by Alex’s distress. My favorite episode, in which Alex wants her to never be born, really demonstrates most of these elements. As I said, the producers are not shy about adding a bit of laughter, regardless of whether they come from one Ray liner or from George's strange habits or from the fact that David is trying to be a good guy. Of course, you are faced with banal moments and the whole episode, which actually has nothing to do with the plot, but what good is there in the series? In general, a great show. 9/10
