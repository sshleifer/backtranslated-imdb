I am completely adapting this book by Anne Rice. Although most of the film is shot here in Australia, it offers many landscapes and fantastic places to shoot. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) recently woke up from a long period of sleep and decided to betray his vow of the vampire revealing himself to the group. When he becomes a popular icon of the film, his fellow vampires, for obvious reasons, go crazy and prepare his death. Meanwhile, Jesse (Margarita Moreau), orphaned in supernatural research, having an ancient vampire family tree, is deeply obsessed with Lestat. Her boss David (Paul McGann) understands her obsession and reveals his obsession with the vampire Marius (Vincent Perez), who is an ancient vampire and a man who also made Lestat a vampire. Jesse is given Lestat's diary and tells about his first murder and meeting with the Queen of the Damned-Akasha (Aalia). When Lestat holds a concert in Death Valley, he receives news that not only evil vampires will be there, but Akasha may come. Meanwhile, Akasha has other plans. She goes to the vampire community, to the bar, and kills everyone in her path. With Lestat, seduced by Akasha with royal love and care, ancient vampires consisting of Marius and Jess Aunt Maharet (Lena Olin) are plotting against them. Are you joining her or dying? <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was fantastic, it had great battle scenes, great music and great locations. Aliya, unfortunately, died in a plane crash shortly before the premiere of the film, but she looked amazing on the set and beyond. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10/10, because it was a fantastic film, and I encourage you to see it!
