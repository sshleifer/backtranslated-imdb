I have enjoyed this film since I first saw it in the theater. In some films there is a set of characters and a script that are ideally combined with each other, and this is one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about how to get the most out of people, work together harmoniously, create a team and achieve goals, even without preaching morality. The situations are well thought out and correspond to the original premise of the film. The tension increases, and the humor is clean and constant. The film manages to attract me to the talkers for the heroes and laugh well to the end. This is a good movie that seems good and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> What surprises me is that a movie that seems so simple can be very interesting. Music is a perfect copy of music in typical serious films about the post-war navy, which helps create humor and emphasize that greatness is in the eyes of the viewer. Scenes in the credits - this is an excellent music video "In the Navy", which deserves a special full-screen feature. The scenes and episodes are well thought out, and the actors and actors are great. <br /> <br /> This classic film is great, like any other, without any pretensions. In fact, the absence of claims is what makes it so interesting. I love these guys and girls. <br /> <br /> The other day I thought about the film and wondered if it would be available on DVD. Good luck came to us, and the DVD was released in May 2004. I went to the store and bought a copy. Then my wife and I spent another fun night in front of the big screen. I rated this film as 10, because it combines all levels, much better than many high-budget films and Oscar winners. This is entertainment. <br /> <br /> Listen to Fox's home videos: you have a great movie in your vaults, and itâ€™s embarrassing to find a cheap shot DVD with badly degraded shades in just 8 years from the date of release. So why not restore the colors and present the film as it should have been shown? I would love to pay a few more bucks to get the right picture. I am grateful that I have my own copy. Now talk about what the film deserves and how to recreate the credit sequence as a full-screen music video.
