Film noir at its best. Established immediately after World War II (1946), the Crossfire depicts the good, the bad, and the ugly of the time. Monty Montgomery kills Sam because Sam is a Jew, and therefore, thanks to Monty's narrow gaze, automatically becomes a slacker who has come out of the war. Monty doesn't like such people. The truth is that Sam was also a soldier, but the truth is that disappears when you feel right about the ideologies of hatred in which you are immersed, and the world is full of dirty it and now, very much in need of your Mark "Cleansing". <br /> <br /> Monty is a sadist in the conquest of military clothing. The losers in the Second World War had more than their share, as well as prejudiced leaders and soldiers filled with hate. Some of them were hanged for war crimes, such as the start of the “war of aggression”. <br /> <br /> This film put its creators in trouble when that other sadistic cleaner of America, Joe McCarthy, began his hearings in the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> See “Crossfire” to find out how good actor Robert Ryan is. The real Robert Ryan was not Monty. He was a great, albeit underrated, actor who was not used. <br /> <br /> See “Crossfire” and feel the dark side of America after World War II. Look at this to get a taste of the good side of America of the late 40s. Robert Mitchim and Robert Young also play major roles. Mitchim could have played the part of Ryan, in fact, he played when he played the psychopath at Cape Fear.
