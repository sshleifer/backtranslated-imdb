Some time ago I bought a Chinese box set, Fist of the Polar Star, which included Fist of the Polar Star, Fist of the Polar Star 2, New Fist of the Polar Star, and the film Fist of the Polar Star. Although there is an American version and several European versions, they end up halfway with the Fist of the North Star, about as far as the movie. <br /> <br /> The series about the successor of the ancient martial art called Hokuto Shin Ken (Polar Star Fist) named Kenshiro, or Ken for short. Each generation has only one successor. This happens in a post-apocalyptic future, where martial arts are the most powerful weapon. My two strongest arts are Hokuto Shin Ken and Nanto Divine Ken, as my version calls it. Nanto is actually a few styles, but they are all the same, as they allow a person to split someone into pieces. There are six Nanto masters in the game, and each has its own star. Hokuto is an art that allows someone to damage / kill or heal someone by striking a point on their body. Every art has its own constellation. Hokuto - Big Dipper, Nanto - Twins. Kenshiro saves the world from evil by pursuing his two brothers and three masters of Nanto and their army. Each army captain has his own way of fighting, which distinguishes each episode and the number of bloody soldiers. Kenshiro is also looking for his girlfriend Yuri, who was stolen by master Nanto Shin. Along the journey, Kenshiro is joined by his brother Toki, who saved him from Rao's brother, who calls himself Ken or the King of Boxing. He is also joined by the two masters, Nanto Rey, who is looking for his sister, who was taken by the brother of Ken Yagi and Shu. They both and the Toki die along the way. Other characters who join Ken are the two children Rin and Butto, who do little. This is about as much as I can tell for a story, as it is so long and full of details. The series is also divided into four parts. <br /> <br /> What makes this show great is the fighting. Ken usually confronts a group of people who think they are strong and then killed with one blow. What is funny and cool, but makes for quick fights. Another great part is comedy / hooliganism. Ken hits someone, and they think it's nothing. Ken says they are already dead. Then they die. Other parts when he hits them and tells them that they have a few seconds to live. Then the counter will appear. Or when he tells them that they are not worthy to know his name. Then it happens when he makes a quick punch or punch, and leaves, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and so on. Finally, you may find yourself doing this with him. One big part was when the bad guy thought he knew Hokuto. He walked over to Ken and hit him. Ken stood there, said he was dead after a few seconds. The bad guy counted out and died. This is not limited to Ken, everyone else is killing just as quickly. There has never been such a stunning character as Ken, and probably never will be. <br /> <br /> Although there are a few problems. One of them is a repetitive character. Some memories, mostly those in which Yuri is shot, are played too often, and there are also too many repeated episodes, especially in the fourth part of the series. In fact, the last episode is a summary of all this. Another problem is the ending. The final battle with Rao was not so impressive. Ken and Rao fought, then talked, and so on, until Rao came to some kind of awareness and killed himself, and Ken killed him. But this is better than the American and European versions, which are simply cut off halfway through. <br /> <br /> Who would I recommend it to? This is for older teens and adults who love action. Because styles make people explode or cut into pieces, the violence is very clear, and a lot of it, but it doesn’t show a lot of blood, because it usually makes death just a silhouette that still looks like a person, but less colorful. It probably was made to avoid censorship. If you do not like action, rent an American version. Although if you like the action, I will say that you need to go for import, as you can see all the series, but they do not have a better translation into English, as they are equipped with Chinese subtitles. Note: my import came with everything I said at the beginning, some imported versions do not, but you still need to get the import to see all the series and fist of the North Star 2. If you don’t think you can handle the subtitles for any reason and then get the American version. Another note: in the version I received, there were no subtitles on the last disc for the New Fist of the North Star; although “The New Fist of the Polar Star” is not very good to begin with. <br /> <br /> I give the series 8/10 for its large amount of action, good story and amazing Kenshiro. <br /> **** UPDATE **** <br /> <br /> Toei Animation has released an English version with subtitles. You can download the episodes, as well as Hokuto no Ken 2 from I2G Direct2Drive or watch them for free on the FUNimation website.
