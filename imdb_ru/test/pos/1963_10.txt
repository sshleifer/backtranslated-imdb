I just saw this movie a second time. I first saw it in the mid-90s as a choice of Vanguard Video. He retained his strength. <br /> <br /> This is interesting from several sides. One of them is that it is based on a true story. Two is the launching pad for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And third, he has Dennis Hopper in one of his best social roles / psychotic roles. <br /> <br /> The film also explores how people act in different situations. You have one-on-one characters, a family, a peer group, a school, a community environment, etc. The story well demonstrates how a person will act in each setting. <br /> <br /> I would like to find the details of the actual murder in order to compare with the film. I saw a short snippet that indicated that it happened in California, and that several classmates were taken to inspect the corpse. <br /> <br /> This is a good choice for renting videos on a rainy night. Be prepared to feel indecisive at the end.
