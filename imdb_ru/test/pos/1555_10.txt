Great story, great game, awesome production quality and cool, action packed with a perfect turn in the end. What a great short film! <br /> <br /> I saw this film in Vale or Aspen at a film festival and was amazed by it. Then I saw it again at another festival (where he won again), and I was even more impressed because the subtle touches become apparent a second time â€” for a short film, it gathers a lot of smart layers in a short time. <Br /> <br /> AWOL is not for the faint of heart, but it is very well done and quite impressive for a short film - in fact for any film. This is an interesting story, told very well, and each scene is driven by a story that shows that good cinematographic instincts went into making this film. The film looks great, and David Morse is also awesome, with a dynamic presentation in every scene. Watching how his character tries to defeat curved balls, life throws him, and he makes the impression of viewing. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that when the torture of war gets into the headlines every day, the line between reality, good and evil can become very gray, while the rhetoric becomes loud and tries to make things black and white . AWOL allows the audience to decide for themselves what they think about what is the message, what is real and what is not, what adds to the secret. <br /> <br /> Both times I saw it, the audience was WAY more to this film than others play with it, which says a lot. There are a lot of shorts right now, but only a few of them demonstrate everything around the superiority and complexity of the theme that AWOL makes. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the previous reviewer is not in his rocker or has some kind of personal agenda, because this is a really great example of short independent filmmaking. I see a lot of short films, and I have to say that if ALL the shorts doing the festival tours were so good, THEN the short business would have serious legs.
