It worked! Director Christian Duguy has created a very clever thriller / spy thriller. Actors Donald Sutherland and especially Aidan Quinn performed at the highest level. What a pity that we could not see Aidan Quinn in other films like this until now. He was simply the best in the role of Ramirez / Carlos for what he was supposed to get an Oscar. The picture was very good. Scenes change quickly from start to finish, and the story does not let you get bored. The film is too underestimated, and I recommend it to everyone, otherwise you will miss something great. Believe me, you will not be disappointed. That's why I give it 9/10.
