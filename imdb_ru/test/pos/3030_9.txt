The last film, which gave a bright and anxious look at what, probably, madness seemed to be, was "In Dreams". In this film you did not see madness, you were THERE. Now "The Cell" is accompanied by an updated and much more disturbing image of the mental killer from the inside. The opening scene immerses you in the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy, and the things that Catherine Dean (Jennifer Lopez) sees see first fascinate and then frighten. The things she later sees in the minds of Vincent Starger (Vincent D'Onofrio) are strikingly creative and exciting, most of these things have never been seen in the film before. <br /> <br /> The story of The Cell is not exactly what is truly revolutionary. In fact, this is basically the same story as in Silence of the Lambs. You have a murderer in custody, and these people must enter his mind to find a female victim who is at the risk of losing his life. The only real difference between the story plots is that in “Silence of the Lambs” you must enter the mind of the killer to find another killer, as well as his current victim, and in Cage you must enter the mind of the killer to find your victim . However, despite the unfortunately weak history, The Cell completely revolutionizes the psychological thriller genre. Nothing that was done came close to it. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film had a good direction and it was very well played. Vince Vaughn demonstrates one more characteristic performance (he was even good in the role of Norman Bates in the pathetic reinterpretation of Psycho in 1998, and even Jennifer Lopez advances a second successful job in her career (the other is Out of sight)) Nothing can be said about cinema in The Cage to give it enough credit, it was inventive and fascinating, and has no analogues in the history of cinematography. The Cell is an incredibly well-made film, and it deserves recognition.
