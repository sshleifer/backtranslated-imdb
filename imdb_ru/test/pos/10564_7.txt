I'm not quite sure why I ordered Fingersmith from Netflix — perhaps because I like the BBC dramas, it was on the list of recommendations. I had no idea what I was going to see. The plot, which I will only describe as a whole, in order not to spoil it for those who see it after reading my review, has more turns than the mountain road in the Rocky Mountains, of the type that usually appears in "capers" films. They are very unusual in historical drama. Not reading the novel (and I'm not going to do it), I was completely unprepared for the surprise, which ends with the first segment on the DVD, and is equally surprised by the subsequent turns. However, two young principals (in particular, Sally Hawkins, in particular, Sue, and Elaine Cassidy, as Maude), and Imelda Staunton in key supporting roles, as the main figure in the house of thieves and Charles Dance like a rich uncle who collects pornographic materials, and who saves young Fashion from the insane asylum where her mother lived to be his secretary. The lesbian story between Maud and Sue is “big news” in the film, but in fact it is not central. The central element is a conspiracy to kidnap the fortune that Maude expects on his 21st birthday. The twists and turns of the plot add to the tension, albeit a slight trust, in the film. However, no viewer is likely to doubt that Maude and Sue will somehow be together - incredibly - as the captions begin. Although one was raised as an otove, and serves as a pornography collector, and another pickpocket portraying a female maid, the author obviously means for them to live together, after all. It is a little hard to swallow, as each conspired to deceive the other. Despite these reservations, I liked the film quite well. It is not entirely commendable that others have fallen for it. The most terrible and interesting scenes take place in a lunatic asylum, where one of the two young women was imprisoned until she could escape and return to London to bring the story to its unexpected end. Sally Hawkins (Sue) is a very impressive young actress who is able to convey the cascading and changing emotions of her character with the help of her face and eyes. No doubt we will see more of her. I certainly hope so.
