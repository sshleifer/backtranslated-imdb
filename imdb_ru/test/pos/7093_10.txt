Not surprisingly, the majority of the votes with higher ratings were represented by women aged 45+. This is a time frame in the life of women, when they become the guardians of elderly and sick parents. In June, I lost my mother due to cancer complications and experienced most of the same emotions that Zellweger portrays in this film. Yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the characters were real, and the storyline was extremely accurate. Glory to all the cast and film crew for the beautiful depiction of life and death and the promise of tomorrow.
