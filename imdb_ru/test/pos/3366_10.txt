In this masterpiece of Perry and Croft, nothing was left - as well as in any of the best episodes, fortunately, he was still filmed on time, before the late James Beck passed away to be included in it to show his talent. <br /> From the very beginning, it shows how a platoon is formed from a state of emergency in the country, showing that the boys were inept with Captain Mainwing (Arthur Lowe) and Sergeant Wilson (John Le Mesourie), as they usually are in the series. <br /> <br /> In passing, Mainvering is trying to show its power, but the guys cannot fail to fail it at every turn, during war games and suspecting an invasion. In the film, they have a chance to justify themselves when they actually capture Nazi pilots who take hostages in the church. <br /> <br /> It was a good ending, especially since Mainwaring was able to prove himself to the general, getting the last chance to get together. A great movie, a lot of good lines and laughter, this is another one for the DVD cabinet - I'm glad that the BBC is repeating it - and on this day, 2.8.08, they deservedly held “Dad's Army Night”. Do not miss!
