This is one great show that makes me wonder why it was aired so many times. But I believe that now is here to stay! This show can not be compared with any other, Before the Simpsons was pretty "on the edge", and then came the Family Guy, and they stretch it to get away from the "edge". What this show is about is incredible. Fully working hours! If you like the Simpsons, you'll LOVE a family guy!
