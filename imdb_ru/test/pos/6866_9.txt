This movie will make you chill even if you donâ€™t understand German. I first saw it in my high school German class and found it for $ 5 at my local Wal-Mart. I have seen it at least 20 more times since it was just a couple of years ago, and it's great to watch a movie. Plasticized bodies are mostly real, used in Body Worlds. This film was a blow to this. A German doctor * nicknamed Doctor Death * began to plasticize human bodies for a demonstration, and now Body Worlds is on tour now in Chicago, Illinois. Many were against it, and therefore a great German horror film was shot. I personally love this film and recommend it to anyone who loves a thriller-slasher.
