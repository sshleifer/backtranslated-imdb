Commenting on this film, you need to understand that it is based on a true story, and, therefore, should be considered in terms of the quality and accuracy of its image of events, as well as its entertainment value. It is possible that Jack Shepard will surrender to Jack Wild twice because Wild captured Edgeworth Bess. However, it happened. It should also be noted that the director was young and inexperienced, which explains why he relied on tried and tested methods. There were cases when Clavell did not have the confidence to follow the script as written. The film would be better if he had. And yes, I had a copy of the script (a copy of Stanley Baker â€” one in five) that I recently returned to my father, Rafe Newhouse, a writer.
