I watched this movie on the big screen a few months ago. I did not know what to expect, and for the first ten minutes I was afraid that I would not like this film. It began very slowly, in silence and almost banality, which was all the less exciting because the sound was rather bad and the subtitles were sometimes impossible to read. <br /> <br /> But I definitely do not regret that I continued watching it. This is one of the most beautiful films of Bergman that I have ever seen, at the same time human, ruthless and psychologically convincing. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw actors playing so wonderful, with such intensity on their faces: Liv Ullmanâ€™s interpretation is unforgettable, and Sidov is also excellent. <br /> <br /> In the films of Bergman there is always psychological violence, and this one can be the most cruel of all. Tensions between a man and a woman develop in parallel with the physical violence surrounding them ... <br /> <br /> Finally, this sober, brutal and powerful film contains amazingly amazing human depth. Great Bergman. <br /> <br />
