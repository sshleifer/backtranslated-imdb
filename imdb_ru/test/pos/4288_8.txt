If we could have “Separate tables”, why not “Separate lies”. <br /> <br /> This is somewhat complicated. The housewife's husband dies when a car knocks him on a bicycle. The culprit is the woman she cleans. The latter had an affair with a friend, and at the moment when the accident occurred, he was driving in a car with a lover. To complicate matters, the housekeeper once worked for the guy's parents, and he put her in jail for theft. Therefore, people will be ashamed to believe that it was his car that caused the accident. Looks like she wants revenge. <br /> <br /> It all gets confusing. When our housekeeper discovers that her boss was driving the car, she scolds her testimony to the dismay of the officer who is working on the case. <br /> <br /> As if this is not enough, several months later, our lover (Rupert Everett) becomes incurably sick, and our lady (Emily Watson) leaves her husband (Tom Wilkinson) to take care of him. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty good game, despite the endless "Peyton Place likes the theme. Tom Wilkinson, a lawyer, is trying to protect his wife. <br /> <br /> The film is good, but we could do without deadly disease. Oh well, the marriage is still over.
