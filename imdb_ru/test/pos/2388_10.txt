I watched the movie for the second time on September 30, 2006 and thought that it was even better than the first time I saw it. I really liked the game, especially Uncle Benny. I thought Fred Carpenter did a great job writing and producing this film. The storyline has definitely kept your interest, and I hope this movie makes all the way to the top. I felt that it moves very smoothly between scenes and an unexpected turn at the end, well, let's say, I did not expect this to happen. I also thought that Craig, the actor who played Eddie Monroe, did an excellent job, and I hope that this film will help him move further in his acting career. From start to finish, I thoroughly enjoyed it.
