I think that the consensus on the recent television miniseries is pretty unanimous: everything is in order, but this is far from the Lonely Pigeon. This is compared with the latter simply because it is a prequel to this famous story. <br /> <br /> “Commanche Moon” is definitely worth it to love any fan of westerns. Just do not expect it to be as intense as the "Lone Pigeon". Steve Zahn and Carl Urban are not Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play are not as strong as Duval and Jones, depicting the same two guys. Some say that it’s not fair to criticize this film because of the comparison, but you have to compare it - this is the story of the same two leading characters of the Texas Ranger: "Woodrow Call" and "Gus McCray." <br /> <br /> The main difference, as I discovered, was that this prequel is sometimes much slower and more relational (two rangers and their women). However, I did not object to this, because the two main women were pretty ladies and generally pleasant and enjoyable people. They were well played by Linda Kardelini ("Clara Forsythe") and Elizabeth Banks ("Maggie"). They helped make this long movie acceptable. If you've seen photos of women in the Old West, however, none of them looked half as beautiful as Cardeleen and Banks. They were a joy for those male eyes to gawk. Maggie's son "Newt" was also a wonderful child — the kind of boy that all parents would want. <br /> <br /> The most interesting character, as it seemed to me, was “Inish Skall” performed by Val. Kilmer. As in the Western movie “The Tombstone”, Kilmer almost steals the co-star show. "Scull" - this is really the original, if I've ever seen: a really strange dude. <br /> <br /> In fact, all the supporting actors here did an excellent job, from Keith Robinson's “Deets” to Wes Studi as “Buffalo Hump”. I always find Studi interesting, no matter what role it plays. I would like him to play a big role in this mini-series. <br /> <br /> This film has something in common with the Lonely Pigeon and other good westerns: scenery and photography. It's just beautiful at times and a joy to watch. We also have a great director of this film: Simon Winser, who shot The Lonely Pigeon, and another outstanding western television film, Crossfire Trail. He also starred in two of my other favorite feature films, both of which were shot in his native Australia: “Phar Lap” and “Quigley Down Under”. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I liked Commanche Moon. nothing is as good as the aforementioned films. However, I still watched it all and regretted that it ended, if it made any sense. It made me want to look at Woodrow and Gus again, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. <br /> <br /> Note: on the title page it says that it is 360 minutes. This was supposed to include commercials. The DVD version with two discs that I saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes.
