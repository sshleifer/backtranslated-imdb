I first saw this film by chance when I visited my uncle in Arizona about 3 and a half years ago. The VHS print looked a little faded, but I was very haunted by what I was watching. Did it all make sense? Well, honestly, no, it is not. However, this is a film that requires more than one viewing in order to understand all its aspects. A wonderful tragic score haunted me, and strange pictures made a quiet impression. <br /> <br /> When I found out that Anchor Bay had released this oddity on DVD, I immediately picked it up. I was very pleased with the transfer, although I felt that the additions were quite lacking. Although the film concerns the characters “O” and Sir Stephen, it really has nothing to do with the original novel by Pauline Ridge or the 1974 film “The Story of O.”. However, the film focuses on artistic details and symbolism of an almost mystical type. "O" decides to go into prostitution by Sir Stephen in the cruel Hong Kong of the 1920s. Her mission is to prove her infinite loyalty and love for her master by transferring her body to other men. Naturally, Sir Stephen loves to watch her during her unpleasant sexual antics and even turns out to be his mistress. However, the tables are turned over when “O” really finds a kind of love with a young male fan. Suddenly, Sir Stephen feels threatened ... <br /> <br /> I feel that the deep meaning of the film (including the tragic evaluation and artistic leadership) really make this film a classic. The viewer is acquainted not only with life and past comrades in the brothel “O”, but also with the riots of the 1920s in Hong Kong. As in a political setting, all prostitutes need affiliation. No one is happy in the film, even if they believe that they are. (However, "O" finds a feeling of happiness with his young fan). One prostitute, with tears in her eyes, recalls how her father behaved like a dog when she was drunk, which naturally led to a fetish because her clients behaved like a dog. Another senior prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. She cannot let go of this vision. She treats her clients like co-stars and even swears she hears a piano in a river. <br /> <br /> As for “O,” she recalls how her father left her in the chalk circle. When he leaves, she feels a sense of abandonment. Of course, in the same memory, Kinski suddenly becomes her father. I was very, very concerned about this image. I really felt "Oh" at this moment in the film. She almost never smiles, and this scene really explains why. Her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees Sir Stephen as her father and satisfies all his indecent demands in the hope of proving his love. <br /> <br /> Another curious aspect of the film is a small child (which ends at the end) who sells good luck in the box. This is a very random character, but somehow it only adds a sense of loss and emptiness in the film. At some point, the director even uses drawn cardboard figures to depict people. Now, if this is not a symbolism for you! (Laughter) <br /> <br /> In general, I really like this movie. I feel that this is a very deep and somewhat exciting experience. He has erotic scenes, but the scenes really shouldn't trigger. As in the life of the characters, sexual acts are empty. These are movements, but they lack feelings and tenderness. (Once again, the only tender scene is between “O” and the young man). “O” thinks that she is in love and that it is an honor to lower herself, but in the end she finds that she has a choice. She, too, can be her own personality and strive for her own happiness, but she also has the opportunity to stay in the circle that her father has drawn. The director leaves many questions unanswered, however, some things do not need answers. The viewer will make a decision that works for them. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I would like to release a special edition of this DVD with the comments of the director. I think it would be interesting to hear his opinion about the film and its message over the years. It's a shame that the soundtrack never came out. This film has a really haunting and heartbreaking account. There is something in the lingering vocals that causes chills in my spine. I really feel lonely in a movie just by listening to music.
