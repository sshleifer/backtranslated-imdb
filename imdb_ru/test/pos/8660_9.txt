What a wonderful movie it was. It is a paradise? hell? or something mean? I disagree with many of the reviews about this film, saying that this is an image of hell. It is not even clear whether the opening scene of the film begins or is a memory from the end. In addition, it is not clear that the main character goes to hell, but perhaps somewhere in the middle. The review I read on IMDb says that it is hell, but I sincerely disagree. Bear in mind that perhaps good people who commit suicide cannot be condemned to hell ... this is only one religious faith. This is really a thinker, and I recommend it to anyone who loves this type of film. Definitely worth it!
