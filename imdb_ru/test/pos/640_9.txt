Billy Hughes is a dumb young lady working on make-up on a cheap horror movie, which is being shot in Moscow by an American director. One night, Billy locked himself in a film studio. Later that night she hears that someone might be in the building and goes to check it out. That's when she stumbles upon a woman brutally murdered during filming. After Billy escapes from the clutches of the murderers, Billy informs the authorities that he will turn red when men show that this was an act. Billy knows what she saw, and soon her life is again confused by underground figures who believe that she has something important. <br /> <br /> I donâ€™t know how this heartbreaking sleeper passed by me, but I thought it was a much older movie. Although there is one thing, it must be one of the most terrible and intense thrillers that I have seen for a long time. This is just a great builder, and basically everything falls into place! The first half of this function surprisingly captures tight sequences that hold your heart in your throat and overshadow us with an atmospheric-dark environment of alienation. Stresses that it is with humor an evil black stripe. Mistakes come up in the story, as she loses her fierce grip, which she held so early, and the stupid humor (or the best comic relief) between the characters Fay Ripley and Evan Richard is a matter of hit and slip due to its excessive strength. Ultimately, this could probably do without. Despite some unpleasant moments, this aspect did not prevent me from enjoying it. For me, the soft end that they decided to go with was just not the right one. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the mysterious premise was creepy to the bone and packed some disturbing goods. So the versatility was the context and his excitement, there was something fresh in how it all played out, and the nervous jolts and intolerable tension intertwined in a series of sudden turns and plot twists. Indeed, they took great advantage of the new idea about this disability and prevented the situation by putting it in a strange place, where not too many people spoke English, and therefore we were also confused. Tender Marina Zudina portrayed the heart-breaking American dumb girl Billy. The way she could display erratic emotions with her eyes and actions made her rude and believable. Director Anthony Waller shoots the film in a rather stylish, timely and skillful manner, without losing the gloomy look that emanates from his hard surroundings and powerful aerial music that constantly catches up with you. The only real name that came into being is the small cameo role of Alec Guinness. All performances were magnificent, especially the gnawing nails of Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov in the role of Russian murderers. <br /> <br /> This exciting feature, which consists mostly of unknowns, is much better than your usual dark thriller. Highly recommended.
