This is the greatest show ever made near the South Park. I love this show! it's so funny, and Peter's laughter is hilarious. You should watch this show right away for those few who have never seen this show before. One of my favorite shows of all time. <br /> <br /> If you can, try watching some of the later episodes, such as “I Dream of Jesus” or “Tales of the Third Class.” But there was never an episode that I didn’t like. All episodes are absolutely funny. It has a great satire to it as well. You can find many clips on your tube. If you are somewhere near a computer or TV, watch it right now, but you can.
