I am shocked and alarmed that the Network has canceled Talk Show with Spike Fresten! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with the Fox Network Television, Canceling Talk Shows with Spike Peresten and replacing them with Wanda Sykes? For those on the Net with a small amount of attention, Wanda At Large was canceled because the public was tired of its nasty insults that would cause the audience to cringe, and Wanda Sykes, spewing her own vengeful vengeful joke about dirty jokes, is not humor, it's disgusting and repulsive. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Fox has confirmed the Wanda Sikes award for acquiring a very important appearance to President Barack Obama. There is no doubt that Wanda’s recent discontent with the President of the United States is not funny, and the audience’s laughter should only patronize and delight Barack Obama. <br /> <br /> Talk show with Spike Peresten causes sincere discontent. sense of humor and never consciously and vindictively insulted a single guest or performer. Spike's well-rounded personality has always been delighted, making fun of himself and his bits and pieces during the first two seasons with AFTRA actress Mary May Atville, since 21st century Mae West was completely hysterical with Spike Feresten's parodies: Judge Joe Brown Trade spouses and episode of James Keeson Lee last season, where Spike communicates with Erica through a show on the Internet. <br /> <br /> Despite the budgetary limitations of the Network for elaborate fieldwork and WGA Strike in the second season, Spike Feresten did not give up his sense of humor and did not demonstrate honesty. Talk show with Spike Peresten always caused new talents, and his parody of the comedy for the Nanny 911 and Idiot Paparazzi comedies was considered to be advanced and had excellent production value. <br /> <br /> At the professional level, Spike Peresten was the best executive producer, and set producer Brett Webster, along with his amazing film crew, was one of the best production groups I have worked for in my AFTRA career. It would be very stupid and sad shame to cancel the Talk Show with Spike Fresten. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, his success could have been suggested in Comedy Central or another network, and, financially speaking, this would be a valuable loss of income for FOX Television. <br /> <br /> On behalf of Late Saturday evening, Fox Television viewers, supporters of the talk show with Spike Peresten, including all the actors and the film crew, ask the Network to keep the talk show with the Spike Feresten franchise and give the film crew a second opportunity to become successful fox show.
