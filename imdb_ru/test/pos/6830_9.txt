The film was good. Indeed, the only reason I watched it was Alan Rickman. But he did not cope with the southern accent, but he coped with it very well. But Emma Thompson did a great job, she definitely made a southern accent. I like all the characters, in my opinion, none of them did badly, another thing I noticed. I have read all these comments, and not a single person has comments on Alan 5 0'clock shadow. What made him look even better, and he had almost everything during the entire movie. I would give the film 9 out of 10. Another my opinion is that the film would be better if it were not for sex. Nevertheless, it was good. I love this scene, where he says “Oh, damn!” When he gets into his car and sees them in his mirror.
