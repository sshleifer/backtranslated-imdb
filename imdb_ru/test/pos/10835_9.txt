I make a thesis about erasing borders: a women's cross-dresser and use the book “Tipping velvet” as the main text, any comments about gender and sexual identity, sex and sexual confusion, sex as a presentation, sex as fiction, gender images, dressing up in erotic fantasy and revolution, the effect of a men's suit, etc., etc. But a little out of topic. Has anyone seen the 1987 film of the Faith Sergio Toledo? This is a young lesbian, possibly with a transsexual cross-dresser. I can't wait to see this, because I think it will be very useful ... Does anyone know where I can get a copy of it? I tried Amazon and several other sites, but no luck ...
