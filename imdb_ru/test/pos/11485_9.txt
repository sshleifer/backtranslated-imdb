Do not hate Heather Graham, because she is beautiful, hate her, because she is fun to watch in this film. Like fashionable clothes, and cool atmosphere, the actors in this film work well together. Casey Affleck is hysterical and Heather Graham literally lights up on the screen. The secondary characters - Goran Vishnich {sigh and Patricia Velasquez are as talented as they are magnificent. Congratulations to Miramax and Director Lisa Kruger!
