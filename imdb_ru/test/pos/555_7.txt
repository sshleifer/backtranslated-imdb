This film has become a new destination for Natalie Portman. A much more adult role, although she comes to her from the traces of the child in the film itself. Ann (Portman) and Susan Sarandon, who plays her newly divorced mother, Adele, travel from a small town in the middle of the desert to Beverly Hills. There, these tortured souls are trying to come to terms with their new life and new relationships when the character of Portman grows up. At first, not knowing this, Adele, she grows up and becomes for her the best mother. <br /> <br /> Ann sees how her mother tells her that she wants to become an actress, or so she thinks. Adele uses this crutch every time problems arise in their lives. We see their struggle when the mother and daughter come to an agreement between themselves and those who remain alone, leaving their former lives. <br /> <br /> The game is at the highest level from both of them. Apparently, they become mother and daughter in front of your eyes. You can almost feel that there is a connection not only with the film itself. <br /> <br /> Although this film does not really give us new foundations in these types of films, the fact that acting is well done and the story is not too evil, let me recommend it. <br /> <br /> I’ll say, however, that she’s probably leaving soon, I don’t believe she can have the strength needed for a huge Christmas movie season begins in a week or so. Take a look now before this happens if you like any of these actresses.
