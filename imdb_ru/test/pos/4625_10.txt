I had the pleasure of watching this brilliant film on the preview in Sydney. Although it was nice to see it. Pleasure is not an emotion that you experience when rolling captions. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a film in which not one stigma that young people experience is seen, but all of them. The main one is insulation. It is not easy to put the final scene of electroplating films on a pedestal above the rest, but it is important to see this as the climax. Based on this, it is important to realize that it represents both for you, both for the viewer and for the people directly affected by it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is not a soft picture, but a manner in which Mr. Talluri treats this subject with deep dignity, and his unacceptable approach acts as a merit in his message. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that films, such as 2:37, should be scaled with votes for support. Rather, it should be recommended to those who are looking for a goal when viewing. <br /> <br /> The brilliantly created portrait of innocence is lost. And the main touch for not yet mastered talent. <br /> <br /> Don't miss.
