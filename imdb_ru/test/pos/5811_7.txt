As a big fan of Hammer Studios and an enthusiastic viewer of their Gothic Horror films, I wonder what made me take so long to watch their horror series, which lasted only one season in 1980. Now that I have seen the first four episodes of the series, I can say that it still easily meets my expectations. Although this first episode of The Time of the Witches is perhaps not the most creative horror story ever told, and not quite an amazing gothic atmosphere for which I like Hammer’s films from the 50s to the 70s, it is undoubtedly able to tell a surprisingly terrible tale and creating a genuine eeriness in fifty minutes. The composer of the score David Winter (John Finch) suffers from the 17th century witch Lucinda (Patricia Quinn) ... Although his story can be simple, but for less than an hour, it is effective and delivers many creepy moments. , Northern Irish actress Patricia Quinn, who is probably best known for her role in The Rocky Horror Show (1975), as well as Monty Python's fantastic comedy The Meaning of Monty Python’s Life (1983), is surprisingly evil in a role that suits her like a glove. John Finch is also good in the role of David, and although Prunella Gee, who plays his wife, an adulterous actress, may not be the best actress, she is definitely a pleasure to watch. The episode is accompanied by a good score that blends well with the atmosphere. In general, “Witching Time” is a very interesting episode with a few truly creepy moments and a decent newcomer to the series.
