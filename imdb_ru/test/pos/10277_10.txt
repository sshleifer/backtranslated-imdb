This is a wonderful thriller, which I watched many times and can never get enough. It's all about the obsessive love that 5 people have for each other in Paris, (not) happy coincidences, false identities. The music makes it really exciting. Deficiencies in the characters, only the end is not very plausible, but a certain "must-see" is still.
