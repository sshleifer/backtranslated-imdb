The Dead are truly works of art. Obviously, John Houston wanted to show that he was still “in all the glory of some kind of passion,” creating him, even when his body failed him. This film is strongly influenced and remains in the mind for a long time after its completion. Reading Joy's story certainly adds more depth to the characters, especially Gabriel’s internal turmoil, but the point is in this film. As the artist’s statement about his love for life and his craft, the “Dead” stand alone.
