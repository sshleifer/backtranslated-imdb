I have not seen this film for 30 years, so I do not know if I would like it as much as when I was 12 years old. However, at that time I loved this movie. This is a great starter for young teenage girls. Be careful with the ending though. There are tears and harsh emotions. <br /> <br /> Looking at it from the point of view of 2008 (with much more knowledge of child psychology, politics, and political correctness), I think it would be interesting to look again. Patty's imprudent, abusive father, indifferent mother and beloved sister all contributed to making her vulnerable and hungry for intercourse. Patty was sad when Anton left. She was heartbroken when he was killed. The fury that was directed at her afterwards was shocking. After all, she was only 12 years old. <br /> <br /> Most of all, I remembered how this film taught me that even “enemy” soldiers are people too. Not all German soldiers were hated Nazis. When I was older, I saw television shows, such as Hogan's Heroes and Rat Patrol, which also emphasized that the "ordinary" German soldiers were not like the Gestapo. <br /> <br /> “Ordinary” soldiers were called in, the Gestapo was selected among volunteers for their particular hatred. I believe that one of the privileges of the Nazis was that they had special assignments and, therefore, they did not engage in combat. Their specialties were interrogation and torture. <br /> <br /> Later, during the Cold War, I remembered Russian soldiers and remembered the SOMGS. We were taught that the Soviet Union was "evil." But the reality was that the Russian soldiers were not going to destroy America. They had a job. Their government probably told them that our government is seeking to destroy their way of life. That, in a sense, was true, because the United States struggled to put an end to communism. <br /> <br /> The lesson is still applicable today. The German soldiers were not the same as the Nazis, just like the Muslims were not the same as al Qaeda.
