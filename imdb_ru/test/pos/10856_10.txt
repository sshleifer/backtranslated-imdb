Of the 24 best lesbian films in my library, I have to rate this movie as the number one movie ever. This film will go down in history as the best in its genre. This is a story about a girl (Rachel Sterling), who goes from wealth to rags and from rags to wealth, and her first love (Keely Howes) appears and disappears from her life. It is set against the background of the Victorian era in the 1890s, making it the perfect place for some of the best entertainment in the industry. This film did not spare money for music and costumes, and the makeup that Rachel and Keely wore on stage in the Halls only increased the variety of the film. <br /> <br /> No matter what kind of films you prefer, I can guarantee that this film will not only amaze you, but also will keep your attention in all three episodes. This film will play and enjoy for decades. A version without a DVD compilation is required for any library. Rachel Sterling and Kealy Hawes were the best choice for the actors in these two roles, and they played them very well.
