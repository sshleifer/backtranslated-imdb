I say, remember where and when you saw this show, because I believe that if Fox gives Talk Show a chance, Spike will be right there with Conan in a few years, because, like Conan, he is incredibly funny and seems , just grateful that he has his own show. which adds humor. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous thing Spike had until now was “The Idiot Paparazzi” and “The Comedy for the Stoner”, and if you have a low level, you will receive a CFS, what does that say about you? <br /> <br /> In the end, this show is more fun in 25 minutes than SNL in an hour, so let's hope that the talk show gets the attention it deserves, for example, an extra half hour, more money and a band.
