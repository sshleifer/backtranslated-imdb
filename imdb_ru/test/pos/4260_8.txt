This film shows that the free enterprise system and the search for an almighty dollar overcome all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately, the market determines the message that is sent to the public. This film dramatizes this moment. A conservative white-collar advertising company has moved to a group of African-American street people headed by a black man who wants to make money and thinks he can sell goods by telling the truth. But the film shows that no matter how hard he tries to do something different, the market and the political system require its conformity, which makes it no different from its predecessors. An interesting, extraordinary film.
