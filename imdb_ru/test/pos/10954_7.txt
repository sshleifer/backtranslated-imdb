12/17/01 All I can do with this film is to improvise on my impressions. I wasn’t given any “changes”, I don’t know “points” and I don’t study in the genre. I always had problems after chord changes (trumpeter, you know), so I was pretty limited in making the basic “remember the melody” and doing the advertising. What struck me in this incredibly naughty black and white blues piece was the knot that he gave me in my head and heart, trying to figure out whether to go with the ensemble or choose the path along the melody (story). I think I went with the melody as usual; I continued to get lost in the changes - too deep, extensive, probably above my head. However, it was gas to try to keep up. I admired the play of actors in the theme and storyline. I didn’t see some things or heard what seems to others: I didn’t feel that the fair-skinned girl “tried to get through” as much as she either didn’t pay attention to the color problem, or tried to ignore her - first: later she returned to the battle . The pensive young man with fair skin (his ridiculous masonka with pipes) was ambiguous, ambivalent and — perhaps his best feature — removed. What, I thought after the shadow veil closed on this provocative piece, is this the basis of such a thing? Is this a way to find “reality” by creating a scene, populating it with expressive characters and giving them a tune and a theme? Is this more real or true than a well-thought out scenario — without the benefit of editing and revising? Is improvisation heroic, "artistic"? Where is there a greater or clearer truth: in retrospective art / craft or fabrication and reformation? Well, I'm still lost in this matter. I loved the movie; it lost me on a cool blue misty evening when I just needed to go home and get my horn. Guess what? I burst into a blues riff of twelve bars, trying and truthfully - could not bring myself to deviate from the melody. Reality is just too scary. Jaime says give them 7 or more. I'm on a break.
