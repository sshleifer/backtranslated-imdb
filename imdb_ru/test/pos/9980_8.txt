Shea LaBouf struck me before with his acting ability, but I can honestly say that I look forward to his next effort ... his image of 20-year-old Caddy Francis Uymet, who ignores his fatherâ€™s insistence that golf is not his place in life participation in the US Open tournament in 1913 in his hometown ... the beginning of the film is a bit addictive, but you need to set up an auxiliary story for outsiders so that the Shiites work so well ... the whole cast is chosen correctly and they work very well together in history, to otoroy, based on the actual event, there is an end that anyone can detect before watching a movie ... but even knowing that the information does not spoil the fun ... Josh Flitter is amazing, like Eddie Lowry, Francis caddy, who keeps him at ease and free , and at the same time it proves that it is an invaluable part of Francis's efforts ... Stephen Delaine is outstanding, like Harry Vardon, the legendary British golfer, whom the idolater of Folisys is not afraid of. ..and who knows the story of Francis as he also had a humble beginning ... Bill Paxton makes a sample film and makes it worthy of attention ... bravo Mr. Paxton and bravo to the actors ... from snapshots to telling people who enliven him this movie that you can get, enjoy and enjoy ... it's nice to have such films so that we can feel good while watching ...
