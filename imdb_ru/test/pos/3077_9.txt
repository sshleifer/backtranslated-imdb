This movie was awesome, if you want a movie with a continuous pun and a laugh, then this is just for you. This film was great because he took the serious Robin Hood and made him what the whole family can enjoy and what he can laugh at. I first watched this film when I was about 10 years old, and I got most of it. This film is also great because it makes fun of everything that happens: “By order of the king, financial secretary H and R Blockhead?” <br /> <br /> Everyone needs a little Carey Elvis (Robin Hood) in life, no matter his liar, liar with "claw" or saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing.
