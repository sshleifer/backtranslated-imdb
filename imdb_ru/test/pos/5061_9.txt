“RENDITION” is a film not to be missed, with solid texts by Kelly Sane and director Gavin Hood, who tells us a story about a man’s journey through hell. Once again, Meryl Streep in the convincing role of the CIA today and excellent performances from actors of excellent roles in Reese Witherspoon, Jake Gyllenhall and Alan Arkin, as well as actors of Middle Eastern origin, who add reality. /> <br /> In “RENDITION” you see how “terrorism can beget terrorism”, and as the film progresses, the link between history and what is unfolding in the Middle East becomes a reality. External cadres increase the intensity of the story, and Peter Sarsgaard brilliantly copes with the role of an assistant in how American politics are conducted. It is a pity that this film didn’t have a wider audience, because along with Al's Valley and Lions for Lambs, RENDITION plays an important role in showing the audience how the struggle and defense of democracy can seriously go astray.
