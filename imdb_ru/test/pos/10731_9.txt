Kramer vs. Kramer is a gratifying drama about shocking, sharp additions to two objects of an unsuccessful married couple. Meryl Streep, in the throes of maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy mother who sits at home and feels limited to such a role, and in the first five minutes of the film she leaves her inconsiderate husband in Dustin Hoffmanâ€™s fantastic performance to find another role for herself. Hoffman is stunned, completely unaware of what to do with himself, and so taken for granted that he does not know what to do in the morning with his son at school. <br /> <br /> Flawlessly characterizes Hoffman. this husband is like such a juicy load of failures. He is restless, tireless, and impatient, but although the positive side of these three adjectives must include just the opposite, he invariably fixates on what he refers to. He focused on his career in advertising, and when he was left alone to raise his son Billy, chaos immediately entered the battle. He is one of those who throws tantrums and angrily leaves the game halfway. After some time, when he became friends with his neighbor and former girlfriend Joanna, who was played by sexy Jane Alexander, Hoffman cooled his planes enough to understand why his wife had left. At the same time, his limitless energy is redirected to the education of Billy, and he loses his job. <br /> <br /> The battle for the title is a very gray circumstance. Even if the finale is a little unmotivated, subjectivized for the audience, in the last line and the last frame there is still that ingenious touch to the screen, which seemed to diminish after the magical 1970s.
