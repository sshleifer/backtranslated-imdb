In Crystal City, a Mormon group hires horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Cary Jr.) as owners of wagons to bring their caravan to the San Juan River. Along the journey, they meet at first a broken cart without water for the charlatan Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitutes of Denver (Joan Drew) and Fleretti Fiff (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic criminals Clegg guys decided to join the Mormon Caravan to disguise a patrol led by the sheriff of the Crystal City, pursuing them. When Navajo cross their path, they are invited to visit their village for a dance party. As the car approaches its destination, Clegg’s boys threaten the settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to take a stand. <br /> <br /> “The Master of Carriages” is another great westerner of John Ford. The sequence with the car crossing the desert and the hills is impressive. The adventure of the Mormon group is fun and very interesting, and the songs fit well into the plot, even though they are dated. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): “Caravan dos Bravos” (“Caravan of the Brave”)
