I first saw Alice in Wonderland, a X-rated musical comedy, in the early 80s at a cinema in New York with a few friends. I remember that we really liked it very much, although we had to wonder why all the “goodies” were covered with colorful spots of different shapes and why the film suddenly jumped from one scene to another, making us guess what we had just missed. Obviously, this was an edited (chopped off) version with a soft core, and I had a desire to watch it again soon, but in the original version. Well, more than 20 years have passed, during which I forgot everything about this film, and just a few days ago, by chance, I stumbled upon a widely used copy of VHS (which saw better times: slightly blurry colors, a squeaky sound and a few flaws) but guess what? This is the original uncut version, and this time I really had a ball! Humor, musicals and Porn may seem like an awkward combination, but in this case, it really works, and it is unlikely that most of the boring porn movies nowadays invade our screens, it’s really funny and entertaining sex fantasies that will not disappoint you, Direction clever, quick editing makes the film fly like a bird, all familiar characters are cute or just funny, all the actors seem to have a good time, catchy songs (mentioning “growing up”) Sung by Alice at the beginning of the movie and funny “What a nice de vushka, like you, play Knight like this ”), dance numbers are well put and put on (surprisingly energetic Terry Hall proves that she can also“ dance ”and dance with enthusiasm from her courage ... Don't worry, she also does what she knows best is ...), acting, singing, scenery, costumes is at the level of quality, and then ... there is Christina “Blue Eyes” Debell, in the leading role in her career and (oh boy !) She does have a few HC sequences! Personally, I think that they are absolutely not disgusting, on the contrary, they are spontaneous and quite exciting. She is young and (ooo!) Very beautiful; With the help of her new friends in Wonderland, she discovers her body and her sexuality, so she sings, she dances and ... what do you expect? She, too, is experimenting with sex! The final sequence, when she finally makes love to her boyfriend, is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the film. I think that her “physical role” (innocent blue eyes and charming smile) and her acting ability make these apparent sequences more acceptable and really very pleasant. In (this) Wonderland, there is a lot of sex going on, and everyone seems to be eager to “get engaged” with the first available boy (s) or girl (s), which means a lot of tough actions that can be seen. On the other hand, some close-up shots, clearly “spliced ​​in”, just to make “porn dogs” really happy, a bit redundant for my personal taste. In general, however, sex action is not offensive, as it is processed with a lot of humor and almost perfectly blends with music, dance and comedy. If you think that you and your partner can have graphic sex, watch this together. Take my word, you will have an hour and a half of a very good time (perhaps also an additional action after the show ...) This is “Fun for adults”, so be careful not to leave this video next to other children. video. If your 10-year-old can lay hands on it, he can entertain himself, but you will have to give awkward explanations about the reasons why "this" Alice behaves in a completely different way than the one he told in Lewis Carroll’s novel or watched on the Disney video. I bet you won't forget this "one of a kind" very soon. This is a real shame that they no longer do this ...! I give him 9 out of 10.
