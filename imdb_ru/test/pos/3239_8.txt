I can not comment on the accuracy of this work, historical or literary, but I can say that I liked it. If there is a God, the soundtrack will be released, the work of Ilona Sekach is really stable. Twenty years later, I am still touched by the haunting themes of this performance and often return to it. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds the entry into the society of Catherine Moreland. A somewhat awkward and unhealthy interest in gothic stories (early fantasy?), Katherine descends to Bath in the company of Mrs. Allen, where she meets Henry Tilney. She is invited to visit Tilni in Northanger Abbey, where there is a formidable (and somewhat problematic from a financial point of view) General Tilni, who has the unfortunate delusion that there is wealth in the movement. <br /> <br /> Where mutual attraction mixes with family finances, dispute is inevitable. This, combined with Catherine’s bright imagination, makes her fear for her safety. Her possible withdrawal is overshadowed by accusations and counterclaims of deception and connivance. <br /> <br /> But Katherine and Henry’s attraction endures these challenges. He returns to provide a happy ending. This final scene is especially convincing, given the random music of Ilona Sekach. <br /> <br /> This may be a “bad” performance in terms of purists, tasteless costumes and shaky performances that cannot stand, but for me it’s 88 minutes of bliss
