Witches, or Witchcraft, as they are commonly called in Europe, creatures with Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) wake up from a witch's nightmare. Jane's mother, Papa Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying, renovating and opening an old abandoned hotel on the island 50 miles from Boston. Together with Jane and their young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), Rose and Freddie plan to go to the island with an architect named Linda Sullivan (Katherine Hickland) to check the amount of work that needs to be done, they will also meet with the estate of Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) and hire a local fisherman named Sam (George Stevens) to take them to the island. Once there, they enter the hotel and begin to inspect the property, returning to the boat. Sam is killed and the boat is released to sail away. They discover two unexpected guests in the form of a photographer named Gary (David Hasselhoff) and his virgin fiance Leslie (Leslie Cumming), who explores a book that she writes about the terrible legends and superstitions surrounding the infamous island and hotel. As night approaches the raging storm outside, they isolate them from the mainland, as the mysterious “lady in black” (Hildegard Knef) continues to appear as the ancient evil living in the hotel is looking for new victims for demon obsession, human sacrifice and satanic rites .. . <br /> <br /> The director of this American Italian film is somewhat mysterious, because IMDb calls Fabrizio Lorenti Martin Newlin, but rumor has it that Joe D'Amato was honored in any way. Honestly, despite the fact that it has a bad reputation, I found Witchery in a rather amusing, so foolish way. The script attributed to Harry Spalding and Daniele Stropp on IMDb is misleading again, because the real merit in the film itself is Daniel Davies, whoever wrote this thing did a decent job, please stop laughing. At heart, this is a terrible haunted house, but it adds terrible deaths and surreal sensations to everything. Different sets of characters have reasonable motives and don't get on my nerves as much as I thought they could, it’s not very well thought out, it doesn’t make much sense, and the dialogue is not exactly the upper box stuff, but overall Witchery entertained me, because it's more than 95 minutes of duration, simple and clear. It's a pretty good pace, a bit slow to start, maybe, but there are a lot of surreal, bizarre events and horrible deaths to entertain one. One part of the Witchery that destroys part of its credibility is the so-called storm, no storm is foreseen, and the sea is probably calm enough to swim, the intended end of the Witchery spin didn’t work for me either, and just look at Cummings’s blunt face on last snapshot. The hotel provides a good private location and adds to the film a certain atmosphere, in which there is a characteristic indefinite feeling of "horror", and cheap horror. Technically, Witchery is not so bad at all, it was clearly filmed on the spot, so it looks good in everything, and although it’s not quite the pinnacle of filmmaking, its overall performance is a little better than expected. Violence and blood are typical for the euro: the woman closed her lips and hung them in the fireplace, so she cannot scream when others light it, someone is crucified and then burned alive, pierced by a swordfish, someone has veins widened & pop & woman raped by a man without lips. The Witchers are filmed in English, so there is no duplication, since the acting is going on in the same film with David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, what else can I say ?! Yes, ladies Hasselhoff takes off his shirt, and for guys Cummings takes it off. Both Hasselhoff and Blair scream to watch this thing, but the little child is very annoying and really cannot act at all. I am sure that most sensible viewers will not agree with my opinion, but I still support the fact that I liked it and would love to watch it again, The Witcher is pretty good fun and definitely worth seeing if you are into “bad” movies or a horror fan in general.
