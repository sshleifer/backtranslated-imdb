In this film I liked the landscapes of Corfu most of all, being a Greek, I adore my country, and I liked the point of view of the flattering director. Based on the real events of those years when Greece struggled to get on its feet in the conditions of war, Nazis and deprivation. The Italian soldier and the Greek woman fall in love, but the times are hard and they have to sacrifice a lot. Nicolas Cage, perfectly looking in shape, passionately talks about this failed (at the beginning) love. I adored Christian Bale playing Mandru, the heroine's future husband, he looks very, very good, like a Greek, his personality matches the personality of a Greek patriot! There is a real fighter, or what! One of the films that I would like to buy and save in my collection ... forever!
