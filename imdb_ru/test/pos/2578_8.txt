In Mississippi, former bluesman Lazar (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife, who has just left him. He finds a city slut and a nymphomaniac Rae (Critin Ricci), dumped on the road next to his little farm, pumped up with drugs, beaten and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, gives her medicine, cares for her and feeds her like a father, holding her in chains to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is fired from the army due to anxiety problems, he misunderstands the relationship between Lazarus and Rey and tries to kill him. <br /> <br /> “Black Snake Moan” - a strange Tale of faith, hope, love and blues. The gifted Christina Ricci has an impressive role in the role of a young tramp, whom her father had insulted since childhood and had sex with the whole city where she lives. The versatility of this actress is amazing, and perhaps this is the most mature work I've ever seen performed by Christina Ricci. Samuel L. Jackson also played fantastically in the role of Lazarus. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard in a movie, with beautiful blues. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Entre o Céu e o Inferno" ("Between heaven and hell")
