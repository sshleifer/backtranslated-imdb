Fata Morgana, a 1971 documentary by the outstanding German director Werner Herzog, shot over several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be heard with commentary included. This is a visual feast of images of North Africa (mainly the Sahara), which is timeless. You simply could not say that it was done more than thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack for the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel) and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also lend it timeless quality. The narration of three different German storytellers (German film historian Lotte Eisner, Eugen Des Montané and Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg) is solid, and Herzog continues and continues to attach importance to Eisner for this project, to himself and the history of cinema, but the English Translation Speaker, James William Gledhill has a voice that seems completely divine, which is much better suited for this project, although most text in any language is rather superfluous. Yes, the fake biblical sounds of the creation myth of the Mayan people Popul Vuh in the first part of the film, “Creation,” are interesting, but the text that the Duke wrote for the remaining two parts (Paradise and the Golden Age), along with quotes from a German poet Duke names, like Manfred Eygendorf, almost seem to be the satire of the dark tone of the first part ?? It seems that the film was put together during the filming of several other Herzog projects: the fictional “Even the Dwarfs started small”, the documentaries “The Land of Silence and Darkness” and “Flying Doctors of East Africa”, but the rejected material of these projects only adds to the beauty of this film. such as aerial scenes of lake mating flamingos from afar, which give an eerie unearthly feeling that Herzog shouts in his commentary. This unearthly feeling is present from the very beginning of a film about several planes landing on a desert runway when their images become more blurred as heat from the ground rises and increases distorting waves that spoil the images. The fact that this film had an impact on the Quatsi Godfrey Reggio films is an understatement. But, while Reggio is content with just throwing images at you, Herzog has the ability that only American director Terrence Malick has: create a completely autonomous dictionary from matching images and words, and one depends on emotions. First hit. Analysis may fail if it leads to such an effort. The duke often does not even understand why his art is great. The best he often does is completely unconscious and hypnotic. That is why his contempt for the lowest common denominator in Hollywood is openly stated in the commentary. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best illustration of this is manifested in the scene in which, according to Herzog, a cruel drought in Cameroon follows us in the comments. It depicts jerked corpses of cattle, and Herzog describes an unbearable stench. However, the viewer can feel it all from the images, the darkness of the sun-dried parts of animals and the whitened bones. However, even in this commentary, the Duke focuses on the stench rather than some deeper meaning. He is pleased that he allows you to penetrate and interpret what you want and his work, for example, almost erotically feminized forms of sand dunes that resemble the scene from Ingmar Bergman's The Hour of the Wolf where Max von Sydow holds his hand. The bends of a beautiful naked body Ingrid Tulin. But the archetypal image in this film, which symbolizes much of Herzog’s career, is a mirage from a distant car, traveling back and forth across the surface of what seems to be a lake. He is deep, hypnotic, ghostly, elusive, supernatural, but at the same time real, like the Duke, a believer from a family of militant atheists. But then, like everything else, it ends.
