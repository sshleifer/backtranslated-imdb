This film overthrew Dr. Jiggles as the best horror movie I've ever seen. The plot was great, the plot twists were even better, and the cast was great. It is hard to believe that they gathered the most unknown people 8 years ago, and today they will be big names! <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. 4 teenagers break their car off the beaten path. They stumble upon this camp and do what everyone who has had an accident should do. Make a fire and tell scary stories. <br /> <br /> 1. "Hook." Great knife. Anyone who is in high school, heard the variation of this story at the prom. But they do it very well in this film. <br /> <br /> 2. Honeymoon. Well, it was not the best of 4. It was pretty good, and you can see some tits. Underline the word "some." It's just your main creature in forest history. <br /> <br /> 3. “People can lick too”. This is a warning story of what is happening in online chat rooms across the country. This segment should be viewed only for parents whose children have access to the Internet. <br /> <br /> 4. "Medallion". Now this is the best story in the whole movie. A guy on a motorcycle breaks down and goes to this dumb girl's house. Very good plot twist. <br /> <br /> The main plot of the film “By the Fire” is the biggest and best turn in the whole film. I will not say what it is, because I do not want to destroy it. I have never been so shocked during the movie in my life! <br /> <br /> Plot: A + <br /> <br /> Acting: A + <br /> <br /> Writing: A + <br /> Director: A + <br /> <br /> Music: A + <br /> <br /> In general: A + <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone over 13, except for “People can lik too. "Any parent whose child has access to the Internet should watch this with their child.
