I first saw this when it was first shown, so I am not too objective in this. I did manage to scare me, partly because it was so late at night, but partly because of this whole feeling from the videotape of an unknown story (the same thing that helped the Dark Shadows themselves). And the casting was so correct. I hardly know Shane Bryant because of anything else, so it might be wrong to call him “well abandoned,” but for me he is Dorian Gray. As for the other male actors, then, who suited his role so well, was Nigel Davenport (who is so good in “more than life” characters), like Sir Henry. And John Carlen, a kind of Dan Curtis, is a “repertory player” at the time because of Dark Shadows. As one of the authors points out, this version quite subtly includes relationships with men. The scene where Dorian lists a list of male names for John Karlen's character as a way to blackmail him, and the expression on Karlen’s face, was very well done. (If this scene were done now, it would probably have been done TOO TOOLY, and compared to it would have been bad.) I saw it when “Dorian Gray” was almost a name for me, not to mention already about the larger, even more famous version of 1945 (which is rightly known), this is the version for me.
