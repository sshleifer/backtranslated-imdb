this performance is the best, it is full of laughter, and Kevin James is the best, so if you want a good show, I recommend to the king of queens and disappointment that they canceled it, so that this show will make you forget about your worries you have a cast with kevin james and jerry steel, you can't go wrong. so I don't know why the show was canceled, if anyone knows, please tell me. Now are the days when you cannot find many shows that suit your needs as an audience. After Sainfeld and the king of queens, the only show worth seeing is a prison to break, and if this stops, I donâ€™t know what to do. in the end, if I had to recommend the show, it would be the king of queens.
