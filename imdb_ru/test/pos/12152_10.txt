I became a big fan of the work of Barbet Schroeder, so maybe I’m biased a little already, but I think this film is great, although there may be several lengths. This is a romantic, unromantic view of the Great Liberation in the late sixties, stylistically surprisingly polished (a magnificent stage design!) And, in my opinion, still very watchable. <br /> <br /> In essence, this is an ironic retelling of the story of Adam and Eve, who were expelled from paradise after they tried the “forbidden fruit”, which turned from an apple into a subcutaneous injection, filled with heroin. A woman seduces a man to use him, thus accelerating his death. The guy seems to be doomed to a long life and an early grave, starting with a magnificent sequence of titles. There is no place for hope. <br /> <br /> Although the story is rather sad, I was captured by the beauty and beautiful location of Ibiza and Mimsy Farmer. I found that her character was at the same time superficial, mysterious, sweet, annoying, interesting and boring. Somehow she represents what men see in women in a simple, untouchable way. in general are put very use? which seems to be a kind of Schroeder trademark. <br /> <br /> There is even some kind of humor, mainly from Stefan, the main character of Germany and his accent. His main sworn enemy is not a serpent, but an elderly German with a dubious reputation. and the supplier of the heroine is named Wolf. Although this is a German name, and Stefan is German, he literally speaks it in English and regularly spits out the name of his girlfriend in bouts of jealousy ?? becoming a boy who cries ... Sometimes Stefan has to work to earn celery. At one time, the guy goes in for scuba diving, and then clumsily climbs the rock with his rubber flippers - there has never been a male frontal nudity in the history of cinema.
