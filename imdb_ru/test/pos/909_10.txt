Transcendental, subtle, sharp, emotional, powerful ... I could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence, and yet I would feel that they are not enough. All I can really say is that I am passionate about this film. Applause for Krzysztof Keslowski, Zbigniew Preisner, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintianto. Let "Rouge" live forever.
