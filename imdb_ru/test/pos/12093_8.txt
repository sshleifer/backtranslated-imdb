Turkish-German director Faith Akın ("Head-On" and "The Edge of Heaven") follows the German musician and composer "Head-On" soundtrack Alexander Hakke from Einstürzende Neubauten to Istanbul for this documentary that goes deeper into the modern music scene the city ranged from arabesque to indie rock and was withdrawn from the 2005 Cannes Film Festival competition. <br /> <br /> Alexander Hakke is a friendly guide, traveling around Istanbul with a mobile recording studio and a microphone in his hand. He encounters and records such musicians as classical rocker Erkin Koray, rapper Seza, Kurdish singer Aynur Dogan, Arab singer Orhan Gensbey and pop star Sezen Aksu, as well as rock bands Baba Zula, Duman and Replicas. <br /> <br /> The director assembled a diverse collection of popular artists and innovative acts from what was at that time a very competitive short list to give an eclectic record of contemporary Turkish music seen on the streets of its cultural capital, which I will enchant and entertain, even if sometimes it seems a bit in a hurry and not focused. <br /> <br /> "Music can reveal to you all about the place."
