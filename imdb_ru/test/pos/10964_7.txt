In many ways, the cinematic career of the independent filmmaking legend John Cassavetes is the complete opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock, the studio's unsurpassed director. Where Hitchcock shamefully treated his actors as cattle, Cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally. Where every element in Hitchcock’s frame is immaculately composed, Cassavetes cared less about how the scene was figuratively composed than about how he felt, or what he conveyed, emotionally. Hitchcock's stories have always been narratives with the human element in the background. Cassavethis puts human experience at the forefront in each of his films. If some things do not have much logical sense, let it be. <br /> <br /> This can even be seen in his very first film, The Shadows of 1959, shot with a 16 mm portable camera, with a budget for shoelaces. about $ 40,000 in Manhattan with the repertoire company of the Cassavetes Acting Studio and was advertised as an improvisational film. The story is quite simple, as it tells about the lives of three black Manhattan brothers and sisters - Benny (Ben Carruthers) - a trumpet player and no account, Hugh (Hugh Heard) - a washed singer and Lelia (Leliya Goldoni) - the younger sister of both. The three main arches of the film relate to Hugh's failures as a pop singer in a nightclub and his friendship with his manager Rupert (Rupert Crosse); Benny’s strollers about Manhattan with two friends without an account; and the love life of Lelia — first with the white boy Tony (Anthony Ray), who is not aware of the race of the fair skin of Lelia, even after putting her to bed; then with the hard and right Davey (Davy Jones), who can be a woman hater. <br /> <br /> In the first arc, nothing special happens except black Hugh, who pontifies how humiliating he feels to sing in low-class nightclubs and open shows for girly performances. He wants to succeed in New York or even in Paris, but it can be said that he is one of those people who will continue to deceive themselves because of his meager workmanship, because that time when we really hear him singing, he shows that he is an extreme talent, at best. The fact that Rupert continues to cheer him up gives us an idea of ​​how destructive friendships work. But this is the least important of the three arcs. Although this film is generally better than, say, Martin Scorsese's first film, a decade later, "Who's knocking on my door?" and in the cinema. - what this film has. It is also not naturalistic, because naturalism in art is very difficult to achieve, especially in the cinema, although the exteriors of the Manhattan era of the 1950s at ground level are a pearl that needs to be experienced. Although Shadows may indeed be an important film regarding the history of the independent cinematic cycle, it is by no means the best film. Parts of this are preaching, bad acting, the scenes end up willy-nilly, almost like darkening sketches, and are sometimes cropped, apparently in the middle. Overall, this is a very messy work, especially the atrocious jazz score, which often does not coincide with the rest of the film, because Cassavetes proved that as a director, at least in his first film, he was a good actor. The only reason anyone can see Shadows is that Cassavetis ultimately got better with later films, and that gives the key to understanding his later work style. <br /> <br /> The National Film Registry has rightly declared this film worth saving. as "culturally significant". All this corresponds to the credo of art that Cassavetes has long defended, as evidenced by this quote: “I have never seen an exploding helicopter. I have never seen anyone go and cut off someone's head. So why should I make films about them? But I saw people destroy themselves in the smallest ways. I saw people leaving. I saw people hiding behind political ideas, behind drugs, after the sexual revolution, behind fascism, behind hypocrisy, and I myself did all this. So I can understand them. What we say is so gentle. This is softness. We have problems, terrible problems, but our problems are human problems. ” That this film is “culturally significant” is true, but this truth is not synonymous with its “artistic significance”. It is in the difference between these two definitions that great art really flourishes.
