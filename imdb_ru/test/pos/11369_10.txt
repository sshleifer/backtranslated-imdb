This series was recently excavated, and excerpts can be seen, at least within Britain, at http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html. Presumably, there is some hope that this series may eventually become available more widely. The problem is that this series was followed by the “War of the Roses” series, which had the same star tint and was available for cable television or, at least, filled the market. <br /> <br /> Two series are completely different in drama; WARS unite plays by extensive rewriting and scene change; The era of kings follows Shakespeare closer. Both series benefit from composite casting.
