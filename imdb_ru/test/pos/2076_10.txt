Absolutely the most thoughtful, spiritually deep, intense Hamlet ever created - no other version comes close. Jacobi understands the role of all the actors who played him the best. Claudius Patrick Stewart is furious and still cute - I especially like the two crazy people playing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Very helpless and yet sinister. Someone may argue about the need for a strong Ophelia - she is not a strong person, that's the point, and Lalla Ward finds the right nuances. Amazing. It's amazing - each of more than two dozen times when I watched it.
