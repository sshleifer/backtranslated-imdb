I watched this cartoon like a child, father, and now grandfather. This is my favorite cartoon. I love characters, great little melodies and very nice drawings. I really like the main song that appears in the cartoon. I think this is a beautiful little cartoon. Everybody I showed it to, just love it. Too bad it opened on such a bad day (Pearl Harbor bombardment). If it were not for a bad time, it would be a great success. I hope I can find a DVD with it, because all VHS tapes do not do this fairly. <br /> <br /> I think that if someone shows this to his child, he will get the same result. They just like it. <br /> <br />
