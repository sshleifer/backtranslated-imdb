This is one of my favorite dramatic television films, in many respects beautiful, but sad, warming and thought-provoking, this is an excellent dramatization of several years in the life of SS Lewis and his relationship with Joy Davidman. I found this to be incredibly exciting with excellent and “realistic” dialogue and situations. It all seemed very "real", but there were also "magic" moments that almost made you gasp with delight. Ackland and Bloom as the main characters were superb, as was the supporting cast. This is one of those dramas that I find difficult to criticize, simply because I don’t need to criticize anything, it just works very well on many levels. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
