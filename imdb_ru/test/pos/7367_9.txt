Fairy tales by the fire (1997) <br /> <br /> Great calm at work. Everything in this movie is just great. <br /> <br /> The film has a great cast, as you can see from IMDb. The reason I brought the film was because of Christina Taylor and the love of horror films. let's go to the main parts. <br /> <br /> 1. In this film there are 4 teenagers. After they crashed their car, they decided to tell some creepy stories 2. There are 3 plots and the main plot (4 teenagers - the main plot) 3. The best story - “people can lick too” in my opinion. the least scary story, perhaps honeymoon or 2nd story (I can't remember the name “<br /> <br /> 4.“ People can lick too ”) about a person pretending to be a 13-year-old girl (via the Internet) . he begins to communicate with a girl named Amanda, and then enters her home. Very creepy thing, this story makes you think twice about chat rooms with someone online. Basically, a pervert enters her house, and everything gets scary. <br /> <br /> 5. The main story is nice and simple, teenagers crash, tell stories, try to scare each other. But in the end there is a very sharp turn. <br /> <br /> the only bad part In this film, teens slam their car into another pair, but the children don't see if the pair is ok. They just talk about the couple they hit. <br /> <br /> The men and women who made this film did this to scare people, not to make money. Unlike Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, this film was created to scare you. “Scream” and “I know that you made the last amount. This was done to make a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film was not as public as a scream, it is still 10 times better than a scream and “I know what you did last summer.” <br /> <br /> the characters of this film are great and have realistic characteristics. The actors who play these characters are great. Christina Taylor does an amazing job with Lauren, without replaying the acting. The dude who plays Eric (Lauren's younger brother) also shows well that men or teenage boys can also be shocked. “Screams” is like a parody of a film, a killer is a joke, but children are stupid. <br /> <br /> Unlike shouting and “I know what you did last summer,” there are realistic people in this movie, and not a dull movie should have been more visible.
