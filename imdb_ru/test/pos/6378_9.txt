I saw Teen Devian in 1993, which was broadcast on Doordarshan on Friday night, and I could hardly believe that such a wonderful film had ever been made in Bollywood. Was it stunning ?? a film with a “modern” storyline, great music, three lovely ladies and my favorite superstar Dev Anand. In this unusual storyline, the Dev falls in love with three women ?? the simple Nanda, the delightful Kalpana and the tempted Simi. They are also in love with him and want to marry him. This puts the Dev in a dilemma (which is the essence of the storyline) - whom to marry? He consults with the hypnotist, who asks the Virgin to look in a crystal ball. Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda. Beautifully managed (most likely by the Dev Saheb himself, and not by Amarjit, the official director), does the B & W classic have evergreen music ?? some of the best compositions of S. D. Burman (RD Burman generously helped). “Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth” is probably the sexiest song ever written in Hindi movies. We should also pay tribute to Majrooh Sultanpuri for writing the memorable lyrics of Teen Devian, a fresh musical that fully complies with the style of Dev Anand, and he fully appreciates this role. Unfortunately, the teen Devian never received the recognition and popularity that he so deserved. <br /> <br /> Be sure to take a look at any Hindi movie lover.
