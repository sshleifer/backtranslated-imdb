What is nice about watching a random movie at a random time is that no one knows what to expect or where the next great movie will appear. Recently, my viewing took the form of a stitched classic, such as Raging Bull or Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this time my VCR took me away from modern comforts and slapped me right in front of Lionel Jeffreys Railway. Children ". This is a skillfully made film about three young children, a mysterious event with their father, moving to the open fields of England and, ultimately, awards inherited from simple waving in trains. At first glance, this seemingly simple children's film It does not seem so encouraging, because for some time it was lost due to the rarity of VHS, but during the first fifteen minutes of this film you realize that this is more than just a regular children's movie. ?? "Children of the Railway" were created in that time when purity was greater than saying no when the family meant everything and where the adventures were ready for you around every bend of the railroad track. and gives three perfect companions to accompany on this 110-minute journey. “Railway Kids” is a lost treasure that families and movie lovers need to see. <br /> <br /> In the “Railway Children” there are several moments that make it from mediocrity to perfection ?? it happens that these are our three children; Bobby, Phyllis and Peter. Modern cinema assures us that these three children cannot give enough darkness, laughter and understanding of the world around them, but Jeffreys' children prove the opposite. From intelligently pronounced lines (from acting skills as well as from the script) to sincere kindness and devotion to this small village, right up to the final meeting at this train stop; These children are more than just childish stars promoting a story; they lead us with emotions, conviction and realism, the invisible modern children. This little VHS has more imagination than many years. Favorite scene that could be handled with the community, which I saw in other films, was the scene of the birthday of Bobby. The way Jeffreys missed her guests and presents was exciting and refreshing, making our eyes rejoice at every scene as well as our mind. Another scene that caught my attention was when the children worked on gifts for Perks, when Jeffreys asked one person to give him a gift, he simply said, “No, I will not. I don't like Perks. ” Children reaction fun ?? providing moments for children and adults to enjoy everywhere. Filmed in the 1970s, this tiny feature gives you a real laugh than most modern comedies. This is a creative film combined with excellent choreography and directing. <br /> <br /> That is, no matter how much I loved this film, it was not perfect. Jeffreys is doing a great job, making us guess what happened to his father, but it seemed like it happened, the children were kept in the dark, and it was suddenly resolved by the end. More details for the father, not much more, would strengthen his character and give us the opportunity to see more of the reaction of the children. In addition, there is one scene in this film, one of those grandiose widescreen shots of the English countryside, which is simply breathtaking, but if you take a closer look, you can see the cars in the background. It made me laugh, but not too distracted from the overall picture. Such a movie today is not enough, and, oddly enough, it seems that only the British have the desire to produce it. Such films as Love in fact or Vicar Dibley demonstrate strength and excitement for public cities, places where everyone knows everyone, and we are not afraid to be neighbors. This is more a topic that an American audience can have more ?? more understanding of what is happening outside, instead of remaining isolated from their own events. <br /> <br /> In general, I loved Railway Children. I didn’t know what to expect when I first put it in a VHS player, but from the initial scene, to the exploding train, to the birthday of Perkov, Jeffries proved that he can easily cope with the most child-friendly story. His ability to make child actors feel like real characters, attract less adults and involve children as adults was outstanding. This film should be considered as a strong alternative to everything that Disney produces. Constantly emerging topics of friendship, kindness to strangers and forgiveness permeate on television with grace and strength. “Railway Children” is more than just a children's film; This is a feature that should be the basis for a modern audience. He not only gives an excellent visual picture of the English countryside, but also teaches (and shows) how life will be better with an emphasis on imagination and courage, instead of fighting the CGI bad guys. <br /> <br /> Rating: **** ½ out *****
