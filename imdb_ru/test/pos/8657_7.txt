The Bothersome Man is a smart surrealist film that makes you rethink what you do with your life and what makes you tick. When you see these people in zombies, like trances doing everyday events, and realize that this is what we do and what we want in real life, it really strikes close to home. This is an amazingly effective film that at the end makes you ask questions about your direction, not about the film. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the main character whose life we ​​see in the third person when he tries to adapt to a new life after moving. In the beginning, he seems to be the most popular guy in the city, as everyone at work serves him, he is invited to dinner, etc. A good example of this is the scene with his new boss, who offers him an envelope with an unspecified amount of cash saying “ what to get you started. " Andreas even shoots a girlfriend after 20 minutes in the film, with which he eventually moves. This seems to be the ideal life situation, as his girlfriend is a recognized interior designer, attractive and never finding fault with what he is doing. But Andreas is not happy with his relationship, like everyone else in this world. He then begins an affair with a colleague named Ingeborg, whom he eventually leaves Ann and claims that he is in love. After telling Ingeborg how he feels, she tells him that she also meets with other colleagues and says that all relationships are “good.” Soon after we see Andreas at the train station, where he is trying to put an end to his suffering, he does not come to the dismay of the public. Still looking for salvation, Andreas meets Hugo, who has found a hole from which to hear music. So they embark on a mission to change sides, will it be better or worse? <br /> <br /> “The Bothersome Man” shows us the obsession of society with its appearance and its materialistic thinking. He perfectly knows how to scoff at us, filling the houses with IKEA products, which the heroes spend every dinner choosing. I think he basically makes fun of boring Scandinavian society and its high suicide rate. For example, in the film there is a scene where Andreas meets a man who jumped out of a building onto a spiked fence. In addition, Andreas, fed up with this world, chops off his finger and then jumps in front of the train; This is one of the strangest / most outrageous scenes I've ever seen. This world, created by Lien, is equivalent to purgatory, where there is no punishment or reward. In this world, drink after drink Andreas never got drunk, sex was unsatisfactory, and no matter how many times he tried, he could not kill himself. This film reminded me of “Fight Club” and that both main characters were somehow out of sync with the outside world. In Fight Club, Tyler Durden creates a second person who does everything he doesn’t want, and in this film, the awakened Andreas is the same as Tyler Durden. After some time, he wakes up and tries to escape from worldly life, from which he is now separated, escaping through a hole in the wall. <br /> <br /> In this film, Lien copes with continuity, that is, when a character has a half cup in his hand and they are cut off and then returned, they have a glass in one hand and it is not full or empty , showing that the shot was made the other day. Currently, directors are more concerned about sound effects and lose sight of such trifles as if this character wore a bracelet in the same hand as yesterday's shooting? Since I studied for three years in TV Production in high school, it is difficult for me not to look for continuity or voice acting that makes me crazy. Lien does the little things well, he has great lighting in every frame, he never leaves you thinking about why something happens in the frame and causes an interesting topic. This film really worked for me, because he not only mocks the Scandinavians, but also Western society and what is wrong with him. The only real problem I encountered is a person who commits suicide by jumping onto a spiked fence. Because you eventually discover that there is no death in this world, but he lay still, causing you to assume that he is dead, and in my opinion, he will never be answered. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the only protagonist, as others come and go and never do anything except support him. His first girlfriend, Ann Britt, is an interior designer who at first glance seems ideal to him, but in the end it turns out to be boring. This leads him to Ingeborg, with whom he begins a love affair and falls in love. He soon learns that she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not real. In the end, Andreas meets Hugo in the bathroom of the bar, complaining that nothing tastes good and how he can no longer even get drunk. He follows Hugo home to find a hole in the wall, filled with children's laughter and the chirping of birds. <br /> <br /> Lien doesn't have many summaries, but “The Bothersome Man” is not just the beginning of a successful career, but a preview of a novice director. If this demonstrates his talent and the potential of a storyteller, then Lien has a bright future, and we can only hope that his future films will not take long to make him abroad for our viewing pleasure. So sit down and enjoy the trip, as director Jens Lien takes you from the comfort of your home to the fairy-tale world called The Bothersome Man.
