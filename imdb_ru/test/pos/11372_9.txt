I believe that more than 40 years have passed since I saw this series, but the memory of this has not faded a little. It would be natural for DVD reissue, I think. Many of the performers achieved greater fame (Robert Hardy, Sean Connery, to name a couple); although it was a small role, I still remember Judi Dench, who was then 20 years old, like Catherine from France (Henry V). She was very sweet then, as now. <br /> <br /> On this site there is a clue that the series was filmed in color - is that so? Who among us would know - there is practically no color TV at that time. More pity, no VCR; if so, some might write it down. As a way of teaching the history of the English language, this series has revived it in ways that few teachers in the classroom can handle. <br /> <br /> No matter how great a reprint it was!
