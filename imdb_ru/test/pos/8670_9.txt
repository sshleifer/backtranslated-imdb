I saw this movie yesterday and can't stop thinking about it. I moved to Norway four months ago and since then I tried to find the cause of the strange void that I felt. When I saw this film, I was struck by a brilliant snapshot of this society. Yes, it's all true !!! I also found a great job with a great salary and live with my Norwegian boyfriend in a nice apartment in the city center. But so far everyone I met left me with that tasteless, empty feeling that I had never had before - this is what this film is about. Parties for which there is nothing to say to each other, except impassive comments, long silence, absence of stress, terrible calmness and frozen smiles of mercy. This Scandinavian nightmare reproduces beautifully in Den Brysomme mannen. Watch this movie !!!
