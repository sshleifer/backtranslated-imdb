The best compliments to another commentator are here, in IMDb, who asked himself why this series was not “stuck” at one time and would last much longer than many other TV shows in the 80s. <br /> <br /> It’s not true that the series would worsen if it continued on. <br /> <br /> At the end of this commentary, I will post some thoughts about other realizations of films, namely, attempts by the legend of Robin Hood. <br /> <br /> First of all, Robert Addy (Gisborne), you are among us all, you live forever. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more fun than two whole, if you will, three seasons of this absolutely unique series. And at the same time, I absolutely agree with Terry Jones’s mostly new and revolutionary finds of historical documents about Egypt, Greece, Rome, Constantinople, Goths and Barbarians, as well as about the Middle Ages and the Crusades (... yes, THE Monthly Python) Terry Jones): <br /> <br /> If you've seen these brilliant and funny Jones Papers, you better, much better understand all the historical roots of Carpenter, the writer of the series Robin Sherwood (who happens to be John Carpenter's brother, who created “The Thing ", their third brother writes music), intended to tell n am <br /> <br /> Author of “Dick Turpin,” “Catweazle,” and the first two seasons of “Robin Sherwood,” called “Kip,” Carpenter, my movie director. He is the best of all those who criticize his element of “sword and witchcraft” or “inferiority” (taken from “Robin Sherwood Webring”) of this series (which I don’t see) or have other unreasonable criticism in which there was much then and now. <br /> <br /> So when you get to know this “Robin from Sherwood” better, you will become harsh. You will first hate the third season. And not only that: I myself went through it, and to top it off, I took only the first two seasons into my deepest heart - despite the fact that Prade, the actor Robin, left this series because after the series he had a huge success, he was offered, probably, a better-paid role in the completely ridiculous Canadian series called “New Adventures of Jules Verne” - the title already reveals the emptiness of the whole project. Praed went for the sake of money, not for the sake of fame, he did not stick to his gang and relatives, I mean: as actors. <br /> <br /> Actors who personally represent subsequently “really”, in our time, famous and legendary faces and characters of Robin-Legend. The potential of this series could and should have flourished much more without any humiliating content, historical message and rebellious accuracy regarding current political issues. <br /> <br /> Again, it’s necessary to say that the change of the main role was caused by Preud’s stupid decision to leave Robin from Sherwood for a silly series of remakes of The Vernian Fairy Tales and brilliantly woven into the shooting of the story. However, in some aspects it is a disaster. <br /> <br /> In any case: if someone finds out about this, and that Connery may have really advertised his father, but that young Connery is NOT PERFECT "chased Pride," As I first of all biased thought then you can absolutely enjoy the season 3. It’s sad that the script was no longer written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we no longer have such critical and free thinking of the historical background, like, for example, in “The Witch of Elsdone” or in “The Fool King ", In two episodes from the first series, which is A) funny, B) historically informative and c) brilliantly acted. === <br /> <br /> “Do not believe Leo!” <br /> <br /> Unlike many other characters who wished him dead for their own power, Richard the Lionheart, as shown in RoS and in real history, was more prestigious than John or others, but used him only for his evil idea of ​​a crusade and war against Normandy in France. He killed and killed far more than tens of thousands Christians, Muslims and Jews in the course of “clean” crusades, and his soldiers even devoured children, the cat They were killed because of hunger or poverty. In addition, after its capture by the Saracens (Muslims) in the crusades, Britain was ousted for its ransom, 100,000 marks (at that time, the 11th century, comparable to about 30 billion - 30,000,000,000,000 .- Dollars present value ) to return him safe and sound, and then he just visited England for a month to return to Normandy (to France, where the Norman invaders first went) for crusades (they will learn about this in the episode “The King is a Fool”) In this new crusade, perhaps as revenge for his capture, Richard the Lion Serre “Again depletes the country of money” (quoted from Clive Mantle when he lectures Robin, criticizing even the king himself.) Robin criticizes this military non-social decision of Richard, he appeals to Richard himself, telling him: “The poor have given everything to free you, how can you ask for more of them? ”- Richard:“ ... Give me your courage and strength, not your words! ”... Later, in private, Richard orders me to kill Robin ... <br /> <br /> So, the crusaders were real "barbarians". <br /> <br /> PS: Already when I looked at Costner in '91, I was upset because after school I learned in history lessons at school that Richard was not such a good person, as Sean Connery showed in his appearance in the end of the "Prince of Thieves". Well, as Terry Jones would say: "This is a lie, an insidious lie!" Sean plays a comedian and charismatic, and his son is better than expected in the third season of "Robin Sherwood." <br /> Again: Praed, according to my information so far, the one who left Sherwood for the silly Verne series that no one with brains will ever remember or want to remember.
