My friends went through a period of time when we made films that none of us had ever heard of. The only thing that came out of it was the film “Limit it.” From the very beginning of the film we could say that a real classic awaits us. The music is probably made by rural white guys from Colorado, but it sounds just like the rap of the early 90s. The star of the series, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad guy so well, especially in the big movie, the whole movie. This film is based on climbing, and I'm not a climber, but even I think it's fun when they have a climber trying to climb, and in the background is a guy who mostly climbs the "rock". You do not want to miss this movie, you will see the same clips over and over again. You will receive surprises at every turn. You will find yourself quoting unforgettable lines. I highly recommend this film to everyone. Take the snow. Disclaimer: this film is badly made, but this is what makes it great
