Although this film does not stand out among the audience, it is still a very good film to sit down and watch, lifting legs! Perhaps you will catch one or two strange mistakes, and the cinematic film is a bit frying, the film itself is very pleasant and has a wonderful atmosphere. Music contributes a lot to the mood of the movie. <br /> <br /> No less impressive is the acting skills (especially the dog he has!) when John Travolta heads up amusingly troublesome Michael. Other characters feel very sincere and play very well in the film. <br /> <br /> So after a long working day, insert “Michael” in the evening with ice cream and enjoy a very high-quality film. own the right :)
