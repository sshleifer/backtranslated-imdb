Coolie Hai was actually a drama with comedic moments. It was a reflection of school life in those times. I studied at Coolidge High in Washington, DC, from 1976 to 1979, and much of what was in Cooley High was a daily affair in Coolidge. In fact, after the release of the film, everyone began to call Coolidge "Coolie High." Becoming highly, shooting bones, chasing girls, parties in the basement and fighting, which sums up many years of school life in the District of Columbia. I can't forget Motown because Motown music started and ended many days ago in the 70s. The hits just went on. However, Quli Khai adds a layer of humanity to madness, because when everything was said and done, as in Quli Khai, my classmates and I loved each other very much. Like the characters, "Coolie High," after high school, there was life, but there was nothing better than waking up every morning and experiencing every day to the full extent from the classroom to the seventh period. Thirty years later, we are preparing to celebrate those good times. Coolie Hai is definitely a historical play that is getting better over time, because, like it or not, the only thing left from those days is memories, something good and something bad.
