I liked this movie, it could have been much better. I expected more action than what I received ... what was more comedy than anything else. Of course, it was serious piecemeal, and he had a good fight scene here and there, for the most part, it was more romance and comedy with some action and no horror at all. What is difficult to do with a movie about vampires. The vampire hunter loses his partner and has to train another, his sister is going through a difficult break, but she is being pursued by the vampire of all things. Of course, this vampire is pretty cute and does not suck blood. So that's all there really is, except for the conspiracy of another vampire after certain royal vampires, so that he can get maximum power. Some of the problems with this film are that its plot went back and forth, and the film had a very uneven stream that seemed to change genres too. One minute of action, the next pure comedy. However, the girls were cute, there was good acting, the comedy was worth a laugh or two, and Jackie Chan looks pretty energetic or two. This film probably just needs some work in some areas, such as the villain, who has not been studied at all. So for a movie with a few good fights and one or two chuckles is pretty good ... although why was it rated as R? I saw the stuff we did, this is PG-13, which is much worse than this.
