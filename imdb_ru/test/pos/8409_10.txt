First of all, nothing compares to the original film, but damn, they are not trying. This is just one personâ€™s opinion about what could have happened after Rhett left Scarlett at Tara. For example, I thought it was a terrific movie, and I would like to add it to my GWTW collection. Landscape alone would make me want to watch a movie. Just treat this movie as a continuation of the original and do not think that they are trying to replace Vivian Lee and Clark Cable, and you will like it very much. They really caught Scarlett's spoiled egoism in many scenes, and Rett's melancholy shows that he clearly still loves Scarlett. The fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the film is another plus, although some of them were seen only on television. I always wanted them to have other children after Bonnie Blue died in the film, and this completely satisfied my need. <br /> <br /> Lore60
