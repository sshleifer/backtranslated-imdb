It's a simple fact that many of us from the 80s grew up loving these funny comedies by John Cusack made by Savvy Steve Holland, and although I prefer the more bizarre movie “Better Off Dead” there, it's hard for me not to like “One crazy Summer, a film that I loved from my heart when I was a teenager. OCS was a sequel to the Better Off Dead, returning Cusack and Curtis Armstrong from this film. <br /> <br /> Cusack - Hoops, after graduation friend Joel Murray (George) to Nantucket for the summer, so that everyone has fun on the beach. Hoopes is embroiled in a feud with a blonde, amateur punk named Teddy Beckersted, whose dissolute father builds bulldozers around the houses to build a giant condominium. One of the houses in need of mortgage repayment is owned by Demi Moore (Cassandra). There are sailboat races that may be their only hope of saving Kassandra’s grandfather’s home (... he recently passed), but Teddy has won it over the past many years, and Hoops is deadly afraid of boats over the water. But, with the help and motivation of newly made friends of Nantucket (such as Bobkat Goldwatet and Tom Willard as twin auto mechanics!), George and the promising love interest of Cassandra, perhaps Hoops will be able to put up with his fears and win the race to save the surroundings . Armstrong plays a supporting role in the role of General Raymond’s strange man’s seller of manicure weapons (Joe Flaherty from SCTV is enthusiastically participating in the casting), Ak, who uses his father’s training to help Hoops and the company win their race. <br /> <br /> Memorable scenes include what Bobcat gets stuck in a Godzilla costume (!), walking around the whole Aguilla Beckersted model (Mark Metcalf, barely recognizable as Teddy's rather frustrated pop), crazy hoes are chasing crazy kids, wishing to give first aid, George is a victim of poisonous meteorism, the growing insanity of madman Uncle Frank Bruce Wagner every time he tries to improve his chances of winning $ 1 million from a radio show, and the wonderful Billy Byrd as George Kee billed by the group after the meal! Jeremy Piven is (as you guessed it) a cruel jerk who contacts Teddy and makes Hoops and his father delicious Kimberly Foster like Cookies (.. Teddy’s girl who tries to make out Hoops) and is the only one a kind of William Hickey in the role of the old man Beckersted, who does not reward his son and grandson with a legacy, if they lose the race in a sailing boat. Demi Moore is cute, but this is Cusack's car, although Bobcat and Willard steal most of their scenes. Again, the film wakes up a delightful animation from Holland (Hoops is an artist, respectively). If you like his films, I highly recommend the undervalued as I went to college.
