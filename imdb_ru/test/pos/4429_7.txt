I think the title of the film describes it well. If you are looking for a documentary about Louis Cane and his work, you will have to look for something else. although some of this is covered in this film. <br /> <br /> Of course, I eat almost everything that feeds me, and I don’t know a lot of family history revolving around this event. so I believed what I was told about Nathaniel, his father, and so on. <br /> <br /> What kind of film is this, I thought it was pretty good. A bit slow and eye-catching at the time, I would like Nathaniel to focus a little more on his father’s work than on his family drama (although most of the story was interesting, Louis was a bit of a player). <br /> <br /> This is truly a journey through someone's life, and I was glad to join the experience. learning experience for me, and it seems for the director. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the shots with the works of Kahn are simply amazing.
