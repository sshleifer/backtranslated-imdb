I saw this movie purely by chance. It was shown very late, or rather, very early in the morning on TV. I woke up, and I had trouble falling asleep, and this film appeared. <br /> <br /> It touches on a topic that has been touched many times in other places (this, of course, is not as good as “Teaching Rita”, despite several additional turns) and has a very predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, I liked the film, and this was due to the game of some of its players, and not the story or part as a whole. <br /> <br /> I’m a big fan of Sam Neil and have seen him in many different films, including: Dead Calm; Piano; Sirens; Children of the revolution; Event horizon; Bicentennial man and the ubiquitous Jurassic Park. He was very good, but he could play this role with his eyes closed. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors were, in my opinion, a terrible Rose Byrne, for example, and some of the deviations were quite heavy (for example, a woman from the board in empty lives, fully dressed in white). <br /> <br /> However, the two actors (whom I hadn’t seen or remembered before) made a big impression on me because Sinéad Cusackn Francis (Frank) Kennedy, and especially Matthew Newton, like her son David. He, in particular, was very convincing, and I would like to see him more.
