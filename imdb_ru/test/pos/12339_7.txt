A bunch of female girls makes a new promise to spend the night in a creepy mausoleum. Of course, the recently deceased will not remain dead for long, and all hell will fall apart. “One Dark Night” is the pleasant horror of the 80s, when some terrible dead bodies are floating around, controlled by the spirit of the dead psychic Raymar. there is no blood and nakedness, but the atmosphere of the mausoleum is very creepy. The acting game is solid, but the script takes too long to develop the characters, until the last 20 minutes choose Raymar from his grave. The cinematography is impressive and the Mausoleum is a great place for climate events. The film takes a long time to get started, and this is its main drawback. 7 out of 10.
