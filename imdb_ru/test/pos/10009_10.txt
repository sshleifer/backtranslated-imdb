I loved this movie from start to finish. I am a musician, and I let drugs interfere with some of my things that I loved (skateboarding, drawing), but my friends were always with me. Music was like my rehab, life support and my drug. It changed my life. I can fully relate to this film, and I would like it to be more that I could say. This film left me in a daze, to be honest. I just saw him on the Ifc channel. I usually Hate having a satellite, but it was an advantage to have a satellite. The IFC channel shows some really good movies, and without it I would never have found this movie. I'm not a big fan of international films, because I believe that many of me do a very good job of translating lines. I mean the obvious language barrier that makes you just believe in what they say, but this is not such a big problem, I think. I almost never managed to see this AMAZING movie. stayed for this instead of going to bed .. much earlier than usual. Lol I hope you all enjoy the hell of this film. I love this movie as much as I do. I wish I could type it all in capital letters, but this is again the rule, I think itâ€™s a cry, but it would really demonstrate my excitement about the film. br /> <br /> This movie blew me away!
