I first saw this film in the theater. I was 10. I just watched it the second time, and I have to say it was amazing. Music, dance, acting. This is a great story, told very well. I fell in love with Trit Williams when I was a kid, when I saw him in this film. One of my favorite parts was when his mother kept shouting at him to give her pants to her, and then finally said: “How much do you need”? (Money). It was a classic. ; ). <br /> <br /> Moms are the best. If you have not seen this movie since it came out, I say, watch it again. It is timeless. It will do what all great films do; make laugh, cry and think.
