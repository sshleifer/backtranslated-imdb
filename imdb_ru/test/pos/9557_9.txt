"Best in Show", of course, the most ridiculous and deepest film by Christopher Guest. The characters are beautifully depicted, and the pet's connection with the owner adds a new level of comedy to the film. I have been a “Guest” fan since “Spinal Tap”, but in this film he really achieved what he intended to do in the “mocking” genre that he invented and now perfected.
