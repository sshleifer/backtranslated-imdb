Young Warriors (1983) <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this is a deeply erroneous (and in some respects idiotic) film, the way he constantly defies expectations makes him a worthy look for the adventurer. <br /> <br /> Meet college student yuppie Kevin and his team of buddies and buddies. In what begins as a particularly egregious teenage comedy about sex, we follow this bunch of scum and their antics, which, among other things, include a promise to tie bricks to their genitals. The film suddenly shifts gears when freshman's sister Kevin in high school is brutally raped and beaten in a coma by a gang of bikers who obviously have nothing better. When she dies in the hospital, Kevin vows revenge, much to the chagrin of her detective father. <br /> <br /> So far, we have moved from Porky's lite through the territory of Last House On The Left to what appears to be your typical urban vengeful film. However, the image of Kevin and his gang goes from vaguely sympathizers until they turn into insane madmen. To the credit of the film, this does not embellish fascist anti-crime rhetoric, which Kevin constantly pours out, and at the same time makes it clear that he will feel the same thing as he. <br /> <br /> The mood changes from carefree to dirty and depressing very quickly, and in the end they are so excessive and exploitative that they leave you incredulous. And this is the power of this movie. You never know what to expect next. <br /> <br /> Over 100 minutes is a little long for this type of fare, but you donâ€™t get bored. He acted badly for the most part, with cardboard cutouts for characters and some particularly ridiculous situations and a rather silly dialogue, this would not be the first list of forgotten classics in the near future. I enjoyed it, though, and I'm sure anyone who reads this knows if they are ready for it.
