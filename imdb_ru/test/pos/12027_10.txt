I laughed at my ass for an hour. I had no idea who Dan Finniti was. Why haven't I heard of Dan Finnerty before? He is hysterical, like his backup singers. They make all these feminine songs that we will never hear. They blow these songs away. It was on Bravo last night. Why doesn't this Dan guy look like "ultra famous"? Beautiful voice! Charisma burn! He blew me away with this show! I just read on the Internet that he was once a member of Stomp, I think he can do nothing. I saw Stomp at the UCLA theater many years ago, and these guys were amazing. This show last night was done by Dreamworks! Does this mean that Spielberg did it? Why aren't they filming Dan Finnerty's movie? At the end of this show, there was standing ovation, and every time the camera was filmed in front of an audience, everyone was so addicted to it, singing or dancing. The whole show had this amazing energy. My only complaint was that it was no longer, and looking back, when you see how much energy these guys give out, I think that no one person will be able to speak with such pleasure for an hour. Man, I loved this show!
