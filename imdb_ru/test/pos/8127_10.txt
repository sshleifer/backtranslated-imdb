I really enjoyed watching this film for the first time a few years ago, and whenever it goes on the air somewhere again (which, fortunately, happens on European cable television from time to time), I experience the same thing, I move, have fun and ultimately want there were more films like this. <br /> <br /> This is all about Leo (Kevin McKidd) and his group of friends living in the urban areas of London, Leo as a gay guy who follows a friend to the cheerful men's group New Age. and falls in love with Brandon's straight guy, played by the dashing James Purefoy, who, in the end, turns out to be less straightforward. As side heroes are the equally great Tom Hollander and Hugo Weaving, whose side story is worth watching the film, Simon Callow, as the leader of the male group, turns into a gorgeous, more than ever, performance. But it's really hard to choose some people here, because every character, a female character like Jennifer Ehl, Julie Graham and Harriet Walter, acts exquisitely. Maybe even Kevin McKidd looks a little pale compared to his colleagues, but this benefits his slightly muffled character. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this film is simple: never just black and white, classification This is difficult and may not always stand the test of time. <br /> <br /> Leo considers himself gay, but ends up falling in love with a woman who turns out to be his teenage beloved and old friend of Brandon. Brandon begins with a clean slate, but learns that gay may not be just an option for him, but being bisexual in the end is not that bad. Darren and Jeremy (Hollander and Weaving) - gay people love it, and even direct people in the film, such as Angie, roommate Leo, get their share of love and fun moments right through the end of the movie. Comedies (especially Tom Hollander, which is just funny) are funny and accurate, and emotions are believable, however strange they may seem when reading this summary. <br /> <br /> What I like about this film is its really positive concept. Whether you are gay, straight, bisexual, or just not sure, this film leaves you feeling that everything is in order, NOT to be sure, and that “not to be sure” can be something worth enduring! In this film, sexuality is portrayed as smooth, and it seems that none of the main characters have a real problem with it, except for all the gay street fights that you sometimes get in other gay-themed movies. I can only sincerely agree with the implication of the film that what you feel for sure on one day, when you think that you identify yourself as gay, straightforward, whatever, may look very different in another. I have never seen (how should I call it?) Bisexuality or, maybe, just the absence of a separating need for sexual classification, portrayed in such a touching and true to life way. <br /> <br /> This film dares to go where few films, gay films or direct films go, because it does not play on labels and does not adhere to stereotypical assumptions about sex and relies on it. This goes further and suggests that after the well-known classifications there can be life in sex, and I think that the times are more than ready for this, and other films exploring postmodern themes like this one! <br /> <br /> And for everyone else who doesn't care, damn it, it's just a funny comedy that is worth seeing on a rainy Saturday night with popcorn in your hands. Try it! <br /> <br /> Loved it!
