It would be embarrassing if you were still watching the speed racer, whether it was dubbed or subone (I prefer the dubbed version (which is rare), because it was funny ... in a good way) you are never too old to watch it. red and yellow! I first saw it when I was about seven years old, and I was pleased to hear the catchy discovery. He disappeared for a while, then I saw him a couple of months ago (I'm 19). Imagine the feeling of nostalgia, singing “here he is, that's the speed racer! He is on wheels again and again ”- again and again. in any case, the concept of the car 5 gave rise to so many "ultra-multifunctional special cars", but none of them could surpass his genius in construction. other cars seemed too big. and it was not just racing or fighting with various bosses that made it interesting for me. it was the mysterious identity of the rider's and how the world of the “speed racer” pretty much “accidentally” revolved around him. they tweaked the manga storylines a bit, but it turned out pretty well. although I can't remember if the show actually showed what a racer looked like, in the manga they did it.
