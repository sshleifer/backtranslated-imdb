“Sex is a comedy”, although not driven by a fantastically original plot, it effectively concentrates on the relationship between the director and the film crew in the filmmaking process, while at the same time successfully solving the dynamics of human relationships and, in particular, the problems and problems encountered actors involved in filming sex scenes. The director “Zhanna” occupies a prominent place everywhere, because it is she who moves the plot forward, instead of the narrator, and gives us lots of little pearls of wisdom for thought. She is a social commentator, talking about her assistant and other problems that she discovers in her new male leadership, linking him to the male stereotype. Do their ambiguous relationships typify something about human nature ?? propensity for changeability. On the one hand, both seem close; when he is not visible, she claims to hate him. Jeanne also appeals to her male pride, perhaps in a feminist view of things. <br /> <br /> A taboo about what constitutes obscenity is raised: the content of sex scenes is considered not obscene, but beautiful, because this is a fake, which is obscenity is the director’s excuse. This, however, is doubly ironic, since the film that we are watching is in itself a construct within the construction. <br /> <br /> There is more to this movie than a relationship, of course. Watching this film is not just analyzing it in order to extract some meaning. You can enjoy the natural light that permeates the film. This makes it realistic and believable. Sometimes a static camera is used, which removes a heavy composition, and sometimes the camera seems shaky, like a home movie. If you are looking for something interesting to watch on Sunday afternoon, which is not too heavy, but still makes you wonder: here it is.
