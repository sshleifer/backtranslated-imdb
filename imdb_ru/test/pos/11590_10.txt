Being four-legged, he depends on the kindness of strangers for everything. After the accident, Ramon thinks only about one thing: how to end his life! This is a moral issue at the center of the story, based on the life of the real Ramón Sampedro. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar tells the story from the point of view of Ramón. There is nothing false or manipulating on his part. In the end, he relies on facts that were well known in his country, since this case became a “holiday” in favor of euthanasia - a topic that no one in this country wanted to deal with in Spain. <br /> <br /> Given that Spain is a predominantly Catholic country, it has become one of the most democratic societies in Europe, and this difference is especially noticeable due to the fact that the dictator has been dominant for many years. Nevertheless, despite the successes in this society, the idea of ​​taking a life is something that is not completely understood by the majority of its citizens, who still considered this subject to be something that could not be done in their country. <Br /> <br /> Ramon Sampedro was a man who loved life. He lived a tense life in his youth, when he entered the seaman to discover the world. Without money, for him it was the only way to see other lands, to meet other cultures. Ramona’s love for the sea is what people in Galicia learn to love since childhood. Imagine how this most friendly sea takes the life of Ramon as he knew him! In a second, Ramon turns from an energetic young man into a vegetable! <br /> <br /> The Ramona family is overwhelmed by this experience. Suddenly they have to leave everything aside to take care of him at home. His brother and daughter-in-law are stoic people who deal with the situation in reality. Their life becomes a bit of an afterthought, because Ramon’s life comes first. They are prone to the sick person, not protesting or blaming Ramon for the sacrifices they have to make to support him. <br /> <br /> That is why, in their opinion, Sampedros cannot understand Ramon’s desire to put an end to him. everything. Didn't they give up their normal life to take care of him? This moral problem has a hard effect on these simple and simple people, because, in their opinion, they are doing what happened naturally. <br /> <br /> The second theme of the film is the legal problem of euthanasia and well-meaning people, suddenly entering the life of Ramon in their desire to help him put an end to his suffering. There is Julia, a lawyer who is herself disabled and suffers from a rare illness. There is Rosa, an employee of a fish cannery, who is keen on Ramon. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem makes a great Ramona Sampedro. His transformation is complete. We do not doubt that from that moment on he is none other than the paralyzed man on this bed. Mr. Bardem can only use his face to convey all the emotions trapped in Ramona. Mr. Bardem makes this man real. This is perhaps the best role of Javier Bardem in his career. He surpasses his own award-winning reynaldo Arenas, a late Cuban poet whom he portrayed in Before Night Falls. <br /> <br /> In the background role, Belen Rueda looks impressive, like Julia, a woman struggling with her physical problems. Lola Duenas is also effective as Rosa, a soul mate who loves Ramona deeply. Celso Bugallo, as Brother Ramona shows a man at the crossroads of his life. Mabel Rivera makes a compassionate Manuel, a daughter-in-law who never asks anything about life, but seeks Ramon without even asking why she should do it. <br /> <br /> Mr. Amenabar also wrote the music for the film.
