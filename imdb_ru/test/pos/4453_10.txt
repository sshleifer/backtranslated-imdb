The cult director Lucio Fulci is probably best known for his bloody zombie films from the 1980s, which earned him the legitimate reputation of The Godfather of the Mountain. Fulci’s absolutely best film, however, dates back to 1972, and although it’s definitely cruel and cruel, it’s not as terrible as many of his other films. "Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino" aka. “Do not try the duckling” of 1972 is not only the greatest film of Fulci, this tantalizing and completely brilliant Jallo is one of the highlights of the genre. Awesome atmosphere and teasing tensions, magnificent Sizilian setting, intriguing history, brilliant performances or tense moments of pure shock - I don’t know what to praise the most about this brilliant Jallo! “Don't Try the Duckling” truly provides cinematic perfection in all aspects, making it the absolute masterpiece of Italian horror cinema. <br /> <br /> Unlike other Gialli, not seductive beauty queens are killed. one but little boys who are the victims of the killer at large. The bodies of little boys are found in rural Sicily. While the police are desperately searching for the killer, the small town is mostly full of strange people, and the townspeople are screaming at the culprit ... <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, the film is incredibly tense and uncompromising. with a sandy, dark and constantly tense atmosphere that has not yet found equal. Actor's performances are among the best in Italian horror cinema. Thomas Milian (one of my favorite actors of all time) is playing a leading role as a journalist Andrea Martinelli, who investigates crimes. Sexy Barbara Bouchet delivers both the joy of the eyes and the brilliant performance. No less outstanding performances come from Irina Pappas and Florinda Balkan, who is gorgeous in her role. The great score of Riza Ortolani brilliantly increases tension and atmosphere, and the film is brilliantly filmed in breathtaking Sicilian landscapes. Although this film is not as terrible as in many other Fulci films, it is definitely sandy and uncompromising in its violence, with several shockingly violent scenes. <br /> <br /> In the film “Don't try to duck” there is everything that a brilliant horror demands. It's not as simple as most other Fulci films, but I assure you that his search will pay off. Any horror fan MUST see my personal favorite, and I highly recommend to any true film buff not to miss it at all. Masterpiece!
