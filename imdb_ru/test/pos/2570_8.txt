I actually thought that "Black Snake Moan" was a great movie that takes place in the south. The story tells about a man named Lazar, whose wife throws him behind his brother and finds Rae to be abandoned and beaten on the side of the road. Lazar learns that Rei is a sexual addict, and as a child she was insulted, so he decided to take matters into his own hands, tying Rei with a chain to cure her of evil. Samuel L Jackson and Cristina Ricci have excellent chemistry, and their performances make you believe that thanks to their struggle and the search for redemption, Lazarus and Rei become best friends. I was also amazed at Samâ€™s ability to play the electric guitar and sing. S Epata Merrksensen is gorgeous as the love interest of Lazarus, Angela, Justin Timberlake plays the guy Ray Ronnie, who is not used enough in the film, but he tries his best to achieve a wonderful performance.
