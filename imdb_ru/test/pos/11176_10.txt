What can I say? The curse of monkey island is fantastic. The story is good and solid, but, accordingly, stupid, joking jokes, mysterious puzzles ... in the adventure game you can not ask for more. The “You don’t need to see my identification” bit is in itself worth buying a game, not to mention Murray, who has become a hot topic among many of my friends (only some of whom played the game). You will love this game. And if not, then too bad!
