This solid black and white comedy with a grim (but hopelessly contrived) plot is a real joy for the crowd, which will make you howl with laughter (and also roll your eyes from disbelief). <br /> <br /> This is the old Psychopath in the history of the train, but it doesn’t matter much, since the thriller part of the film seems to be just a counterweight to the antics of the great comedian Robert Gustafsson. His miserable, almost incurably optimistic soldier evokes compassion and gloating in a way that almost competes with Chevy Chase. <br /> <br /> As for the film that I liked the most, it’s that he squeezed in between the incredible and funny, exactly depicted everyday joys and troubles of traveling by train. They add the most desirable sense of realism and recognition. <br /> <br /> This thriller comedy, admittedly, borrowed most of its “expectations” from Hitchcock, and, in my opinion, should be watched only for its comedy value (which is really high) Besides Gustafsson, solid work Lars Ambla as a delightfully cynical woman-hater costs one price to enter. <br /> <br /> I wholeheartedly recommend.
