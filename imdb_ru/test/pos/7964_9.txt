Cheers korean cinema! Last year I saw “Chungyang” and “Nowhere to Hide”, now I'm catching up with Hur Jin-ho’s “Christmas in August” directorial debut. The variety of topics and the level of achievement speak of a national cinema that has matured for discovery. The main themes of this film are death and love. The elegant and thoughtful way that Jung Won (Khan Suk-ku) copes with his impending death and the sublimation of his desires for Darima (Shim Eun-Ha) out of true love for her. I was deeply touched by his careful management of behavior and emotions, protecting Darima from unnecessary pain, not rejecting her. <br /> <br /> The success of this type of film depends on the skill of the actors. Khan and Shim succeed, being rather expressive, but naturalistic. A number of secondary characters, relatives, friends, and Jung Vaughn’s clients, are quickly delineated to enrich the story without distracting it from the main focus. To live is to love, but everything must pass. The pain subsides. Life is going.
