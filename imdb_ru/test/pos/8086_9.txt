Klatret © ªsen (“Catch That Girl”) is a really great movie! This is a “happy” movie. I watched this film at the “Pufon International Film Festival (PiFan)” on July 12, 2003. There is an action + adventure + comedy + thrill + happy + romance (love triangle of cute children)! You should see this movie. :)
