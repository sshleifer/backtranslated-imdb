In the movie “All Illuminated,” Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, a Jewish American who is looking for a woman who saved his grandfather during World War II. In a sense, the woman who saved his entire family. <br /> <br /> This is a heartfelt tale about someone who is on a hopeless journey. A stranger in a foreign country, so to speak. Jonathan is not quite ready for this adventure, he sticks out like a sore thumb in Ukraine (he will probably stick out like a sore thumb anywhere). But he discovers much more than he expected. This movie will make you laugh and cry. Elijah Wood is really good in this film based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. <br /> <br /> From someone I spoke to, this film is somewhat different from a book. The book I compile is really good. Nevertheless, this is a good film, there is something for everyone, and I really liked it. Can someone say Oscar?
