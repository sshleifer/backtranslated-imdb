North and South is a mini-series from the “golden age” of television mini-series in the 1980s, which was the time for long, broad epics with high production values ​​and lots of star cameos. For the most part, this is excellent, although I personally prefer the elements of history and the general sense of history that are less soap-like operas. <br /> <br /> James Reed and Patrick Swayze are great performances - especially Reed, whose George Hazard serves as a kind of emotional anchor in the midst of a often melodramatic story. The series also contains top-notch work from Kirstie Alley, Wendy Kilborn, Hal Holbrook, Lewis Smith, Jean Francis, George Stanford Brown, and others. Costumes, shooting, scenery and music are also first-class. <br /> <br /> Don't take it as a history lesson, but accept it for what it is - a well-made, exciting epic. from a bygone era. Book 2, published a year later, is also excellent, but I would advise viewers to skip Book 3, which came out 8 years after Book 2 and was not as good as the first two parts. Books 1 and 2 are classics, albeit with more soapy elements, and they are worth seeing.
