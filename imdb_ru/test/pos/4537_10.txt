For having starred in several films of his life, the late great Chris Farley. Farley died at the end of 1997, and for the most part he will be missed by his actor in the Tommy Boy David Spade film. From the lame police academy, 4 Spade really excelled in his film career. Tommy Boy is a classic, and we will always remember Chris Farley when we watch him. From Saturday night's appearance to working with Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Ninja Beverly Hills, Almost Heroes, Billy Madison, and Dirty Job I think Chris Farley had a short and successful career. Tommy Boy was the best in my case, and I looked again and again and every time I laughed at the same part. Thanks Chris Farley.
