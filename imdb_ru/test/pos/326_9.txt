I saw this film when it was released, and no doubt it is touching. I liked the point of view of a child who learned that what she thinks of her is in fact not true. This is an insult to this little child. And her search to find out who she is. Both before and after she learns about her, about the relationship between her and her adoptive mother. This is a good view. A. R. Rahman adds his stress by good rewriting and songs. In this film, Mani Ratnam does not exaggerate and does not give advice (as in Vuyire), but simply tells the characters as they are. And because of this, the film definitely hits the public. The scene with chakkarvarti and nandhitadami in the bath at the pool did not quite show what it is intended for. Mani Ratnam has surprisingly improved.
