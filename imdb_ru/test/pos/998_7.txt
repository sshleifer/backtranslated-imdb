With his ww2 times, in love and dislike, and easy on Kira's eyes, this is a new Atonement. <br /> <br /> This is a story of relationships with concentrated protagonists, developing a balance between first and fast love in the rear of the Second World War. Poet Dylan Thomas deals with his wife in a dark and smoky London blitz, and then in windy Wales. <br /> <br /> The former and the next Faith kindle each other when the poet and the soldier become third-party, and the girls connect and share. Lightweight watches that work well in an era, jumping along with a few dips at a pace. It would be nice to work with French subtitles, but lately I may have watched art house films too much.
