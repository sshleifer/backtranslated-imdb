Jimmy Stewart enlivens the story of Charles Lindberg, almost telling the entire movie, crossing the Atlantic. It is well edited with memories of Lindeberg's life. The score of Franz Waxman brilliantly shifts and really gives the picture a heroic look. One of the best roles of Stewarts, and this film can deliver time after time. Look for Murray Hamilton (mayor in the JAWS film) as Bud Gurney. It is released on DVD 8-15-06 with the release of several more classic films of Stewarts. I consider Jimmy Stewart to be Americaâ€™s greatest actor and never get tired of seeing him in any film I see, watch this picture and you will agree.
