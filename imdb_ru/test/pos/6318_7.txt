One of the most significant quotes from the entire film was uttered halfway through the main character, the mafia mediator Titta Di Girolamo, a physically indescribable middle-aged man, originally from Salerno in southern Italy. When we met him at the beginning of the film, for the last 10 years he lived in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking canton of Switzerland, which did not live in life, but did business, with which we gradually become acquainted. While this key, but seemingly unremarkable scene occurs, employees of a Swiss bank, who usually count Di Girolamo's cash, tell him that out of his usual suitcase, filled with tightly folded notes, there are not enough 10,000 dollars. In the news, he is quiet, but icy threatens his bank manager to want to close his account. In the meantime, he tells us viewers that when you are bluffing, you must bluff to the end, not being afraid of being caught or appearing ridiculous. He says: you can not bluff for a while, and then halfway to tell the truth. In the end, by doing this — bluffing only halfway and telling the truth, and accepting the consequences of life and, ultimately, love — that was what caused Titta Di Girolamo problems. <br /> <br /> This initially non-sympathetic character, a gloomy, silent, curly man on the verge of 50 years of age, a man who does not even respond to the same kindly maids and waitresses who greet and say goodbye, becomes one fine moment someone who cares about the viewer. At some point in his non-life, Titta decides to feel anxious about what seems “ridiculous.” The first half of the film can be described as "slow" by some. It really shows the days and nights of Di Girolamo in this hotel at a strangely spaced, deliberate pace, exposing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary show how important they are, as this masterfully created and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titty Di Girolamo - a person without imagination, individuality or life, an unsympathetic character that you suddenly love and feel, when you least think it is happening - is also transmitted with elegantly edited episodes and very interesting use of music (theme of the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out). <br /> <br /> There has never been a difference between how Hollywood and Italy treat gangsters more than after the release of films such as “Le Conseguenze dell'Amore” or “L'Imbalsamatore”. Another interesting element was how the film used the main character's insomnia. Unlike The Machinist (and in a much more explicit form, Al Pacino's Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolize a deeper emotional malaise, so deeply buried in the darkness of the unconscious, to pinpoint it the reason (if it really is). <br /> <br /> A young and responsive waitress at the hotel Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, granddaughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta’s best friend, a man he hasn’t seen for 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window into the life that Titta eventually (albeit uncertainly) agrees to look again. Although it is clearly not spelled out, the viewer KNOWS that, for a person like Titt, accepting the Effects of Love will have unthinkable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in due time and in no way inferior to the expectations of the viewer, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is an excellent representative of that small, quiet, restrained Renaissance, which took place in Italian cinema since the times of the decline of Cinecittà in the second half 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-style fares, more La Vita and Bella-style films ... neglecting such beautiful creations as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, peace.
