I didnâ€™t particularly concentrate on the larger aspects of the Genocide in history (although the terrible images in the beginning are very powerful). I was really fascinated by a human story about a girl and her family. Imagine that you live your life without knowing if you have a time bomb inside you. I was very excited when I saw that Yasuko was rejected by the bomb as "infected". The image that remains with me the most is when Yasuko stands in front of a mirror brushing her hair, silently watching her go into bunches.
