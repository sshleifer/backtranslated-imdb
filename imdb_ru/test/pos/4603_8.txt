Good x evil movie with the tastes of "James Bond", "Romeo and Juliet" and, maybe, even "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> Evil Count von Bruno takes the English gentleman as a guest for the very dangerous hunt. Elga, a beautiful simple and friendly lady who was forced to marry the count, provides a love triangle. Counting missing eyes points to a horrible past. The Englishman is not what the count thinks, and this is a terrible pleasure for him. There is also a terrible hunchback, crocodiles and even a side view of some torture instruments. <br /> <br /> Boris Karlloff, who plays the role of support here, has a strong but somewhat tough presence. Other actors (and directing) are a symbol of the era of strong representations of black and white films. From the very beginning there is no doubt who the evil guy is and who is good. Even traitors and scum can be easily identified.
