I have a strong feeling that what you think about this film will depend a lot on your frame of reference. If you've never seen a movie about Miyazaki before, then it will probably confuse you. If you’ve already seen a movie about Miyazaki, it’s still likely to confuse you ... but you don’t care! This is because I discovered that when I first saw one of his animated films, I tried too hard to understand what was happening and why, and it affected my enjoyment of the movie. Now that I've watched almost every Miyazaki film, I see quirkiness and just take it all in, enjoying the beauty of it all. In many respects, these films (at least for Western audiences) are like drugs - a lot of strange and beautiful pictures that are not always initially meaningful, but, of course, good to see !! Of all the films about Miyazaki, this may be the most unusual and incomprehensible storyline - even more than that of “SPIRITED AWAY” and “PRINCESS MONONOKE” or “My Neighbor TOTORO”. But, like these and many other Gibli films, if you just sit and watch, you are rewarded with a fabulous story. But since it’s so hard to describe (and others have already done so), I won’t even go there. <br /> <br /> In terms of artwork, they are very typical of one of these Japanese films, although there was one noticeable change. What looked like colored pencils for the background was widely used. It was not bad at all - a beautiful pastel look was very pleasant and unique. In a sense, it looked like a tiny piece of Bill Plympton’s artistic style was embodied in the typical Miyazaki film. With a high frame rate, exceptional character animation (which fills them with tons of personality) and a great wow factor, this is an exceptional movie for all ages. Although it is clearly intended for a younger audience (especially for TOTORO fans), it is a bit intimidating here and there (during storm segments), but there are a lot of great things for adults. As an adult (at least chronologically), I loved cute things and applauded the otherworldly film. <br /> <br /> A great movie is one of the best in Miyazaki. I don’t give him 10 because I’m not hesitant to ever do that, plus I liked some of the other studio films more (especially TOTORO). But this does NOT mean that you should not hurry now and look at it - do it and do yourself a favor.
