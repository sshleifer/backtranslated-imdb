When Precious Bane was broadcast in America, I was stunned by this beautiful story. All the actors were great; Clive Owen really understood the character he was playing. I immediately went to the bookstore and ordered the original novel, which became even more beautiful and went out of print immediately after I bought the book, although I saw it several times on the Internet. I also hoped that with Oscar, won by Janet McTire, and Clive Owen's immense popularity, the BBC would naturally get this excellent DVD production ... I can't believe that all these years later we still have no DVD . It should be the only production ever created by the BBC that is NOT for sale. Come on BBC - you have the money to make us fans here. Get it on DVD, please!
