I expected it to be just like the others, trying to be scary to look stupid. Somewhere along the line, the authors must have understood this and took the film in a completely different direction, largely ignoring other films. This is similar to another movie, and not to the fourth entry in the series "Children's Game". A new idea works, making it the best in the series to date.
