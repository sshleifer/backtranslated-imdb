I saw this film at the Sandans Film Festival, and I was also surprised that it did not attract more attention because it was not only powerful and beautifully crafted, but also very original. The audience was fully involved, and most of the film viewing at the festival is an opportunity to talk with the director and play Q & A later. They literally had to kick us out of the room for the next movie - we could have lasted much longer. The film is considered provocative and fun at the same time. It will be a shame if this film is not selected for wider distribution - I hope that it will at least become available on DVD, because I want to see it again and share with everyone I know.
