Although this may not be the best work of Cassavetis, Minnie and Moskowitz are almost perfect in all their endeavors. The plot is quaint and charming, and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotions - much more dramatic than comedy, contrary to the IMDb profile. Yes, the story is whimsical, but not arbitrary; it succeeds as a believable, albeit a bit forced — to which I return. All artistic aspects have the true form of Cassavetes: cinematography and cinematography are admirable, and the soundtrack is, albeit hardly free. In addition, I think I noticed some nods to Godard and the like in the editing process - as I did in several other Cassavetes films - (namely, cutting the song in one scene) that are interesting. <br /> <br /> I feel that the plot is well built, and the first half is especially pleasant. For example, Seymour’s talk with Morgan Morgan (Timothy Carey) at a diner is amazingly fun and exciting and sets the tone for philosophical comments made throughout the film. This philosophizing is a tradition in the films of Cassavetes - this is what made the film for me. Funny and deep monologues of Seymour instantly eliminate the first impressions of him as a simple hippie - although his character is curiously similar to his character in Faces (1968). This, however, made me (at the second viewing) come to the conclusion that it was opposed to the best work of Cassavetes. I got affection for this film, which I missed when I first watched it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are several aspects that make this film imperfect. I believe that the plot is not balanced. As I have already said, it is growing well, but in some places it is decreasing, especially towards the end. Because of the spontaneous style in which Cassavetis worked, and, in particular, because of the freedom with which he allowed his actors to improvise, the quality of his product can easily go in any direction. In this case, it is contradictory. I estimate that most of this film was improvised, and most of them are beautiful. But one or two scenes, unfortunately, just do not work. In particular, the scene after the bouts of Seymour with Minnie's work colleagues near her house. During what was supposed to be the most intense scene of the film, Cassavetes allowed his actors to freely run through the dialogue, suggesting that some of them were planned in advance. This, I believe, was a mistake. It seems that Cassel does not quite know what to do, as he repeatedly fiddles with his speech, often without meaning, and replays; all this is detrimental to the scene and character development. I understand that Seymour intends to be a cheeky fool, but Kassel’s attempts here are inappropriate. Why did he cut off his mustache? These shortcomings are due to: the lack of direction from Cassavetis; lack of understanding and forethought on the part of Kassel; lack of rehearsal and training; etc. Obviously, Cassavetes did not learn from his mistakes, because he allowed the same thing to happen in his next film Woman Under the Influence (1974) - the scene of the commission and the end. <br /> <br /> The flaws I mention are not minor, but they do not destroy the film. They simply make some scenes horrible and unrealistic, spoil the flow of the film and jeopardize its potential. However, I really, really love Cassavetes and all of his actors, especially Kassel, despite the flaws I mentioned. This is a very nice movie, although it proves the unreliability of the Cassavetes style.
