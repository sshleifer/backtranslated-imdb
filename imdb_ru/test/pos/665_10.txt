It's the 1980s, and teens are ready to have a party in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of McGee's murder. After the erroneous witchcraft of the dead in an unfinished conversation on the Wadji blackboard, the children are forced to fight to the death, fighting a vengeful ghost that defeats and kills all their friends one by one. Sounds familiar? It must. It is obvious that he should pay tribute to the classic slasher of the 80s with the slogan: â€œExcessive violence. Causeless nudity Zero budget. <br /> <br /> I can not get enough; This is pure entertainment! I enjoyed the humor and the way he ridiculed all the horror cliches, but at the same time embraced what was funny in the films of that time. There is something that you get with this movie that you never got with the old 80s slasher movies: a good game. The whole cast was very talented, and you will not see it in any low-budget film, recent or otherwise. There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. I was very entertained throughout the entire film, and I am fully convinced that the writer / director and actors will make a big difference in their particular career. The script was very well written, and the dialogue flowed naturally. <br /> <br /> The effects were a little amateur and the scenes were not well lit, but the fact that this film is recognized on the cover was practically NO BUDGET. I already know what's going on. This film makes it easy to politely ignore your flaws and just sit back and enjoy. Although it is not an Oscar-winning opus, he never claims it and supports it. It's very funny. If you like slashers, you really appreciate this movie. If you like blood and boobies, you will appreciate it too.
