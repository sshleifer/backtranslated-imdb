This is definitely the most intimate and thought-provoking part of Nolan. It’s not that Memento or Insomnia are bad, but they definitely met more Hollywood standards ... while “Follow” is more like an indie film. The story is very brilliant and very well developed. In general ... watch out for this, if you are a fan of any of Nolan's work, I am sure that you will appreciate it more.
