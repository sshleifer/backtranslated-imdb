Yes, I watch this show. Because my girlfriend is watching this, of course. Well, at least that's what I tell my friends. But since no one here ever knew me, I can say that; I like it! This is a great trash TV. <br /> <br /> First, there is a panel; Tyra herself, who does not miss a single opportunity to tell about herself, but should be taken seriously, as she is a pretty business woman. Then there is Jay Manuel, a sober gay, very serious and amazingly professional, and Miss Jay, an extraverted “queen” of the catwalk and a damn funny guy, and Nigel, self-appointed as the only person on the panel. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the show is an in-depth look at the small-scale industry, and we have to give it to producers for showing us a view from the inside, which can be informative as well as interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, the edition is excellent; there is only the right combination of everything; The girls living together in the ego-house, their impressions of filming, the competitions themselves and the judging. All this moves smoothly with the right rhythm. There are no lengths. <br /> <br /> Of course there must be other factors that led to exceptions that we don’t see in the show; The panel consists of naughty divas, extroverted and quick on a bitch; woe to those who offend them! But this, as they say, until one of the participants steps on their feet, their judgment, as a rule, is fair - I think. <br /> <br /> So give your brain a break; If you can't beat them, join them and have a good time watching this reality show with your loved ones. It somehow makes you crave more.
