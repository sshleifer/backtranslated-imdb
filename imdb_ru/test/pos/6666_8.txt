Kevin Spacey again chooses a winner with K-PAX, an enchanting film that expresses deep revelations about human existence through the naive, but at the same time wise point of view of Prot's character. <br /> <br /> This is a pleasant attempt to work out “if it is or not,” as the plot expands, and the character of Robert Porter becomes more understandable. However, some may find the final a little unsatisfactory, but in reality it could not be otherwise. <br /> <br /> My several problems with the film are connected with a rather caricature and overly simplistic depiction of the mentally ill. I was surprised, because the plot of the films shows a lot of intelligence, and I don’t think it would lose something if it were more honest about how people with mental health problems behave. <br /> <br /> However, I understand that it was a film, not a documentary, and the film itself was elegantly shot, and the story unfolds at a pleasant speed. <br /> <br /> “Bridges” is great, and “Spacey” shows a sluggish and relaxed performance, more like a fight than an alien. <br /> <br /> A good movie that helps you talk to your friends.
