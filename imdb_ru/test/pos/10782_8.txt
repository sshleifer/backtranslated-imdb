Oliver Stone, always ready to make political films, is shooting another one here. Talk Radio is loosely based on the career of Alan Berg, a talk show host in Denver, killed by white supremacists. In this case, the character is Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosyan), a frank talk show host in Dallas who loves nothing but annoying people who call. In fact, most of the people who call are a bunch of crazy racists. And things can heat up more than anyone understands. <br /> <br /> Bogosyanâ€™s game brings a light, comic tone to a serious movie. I really liked the scene where he stabs at the redneck that is ringing. Of course, I would not call this film the greatest ever created by Oliver Stone, but this is a good example in an era when the media is becoming more and more concentrated. Good performances by Ellen Green and Alec Baldwin also help.
