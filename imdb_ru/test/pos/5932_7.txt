This Royal Buzz basically had the news of the struggle these days. Gimmick and image are more popular than the ability to fight. <br /> <br /> HBK vs Edge. Pretty good match. Huge heat for Edge, who was just starting to play like a heel, and what could be better in a match with KBC. It is a little slower than usual. In general, this match gets 6/10. The Undertaker vs. Hedinreich. Not a good match. The Undertaker had to lead Hedinreich through this match, which seemed to be really lost and spoiled his moves. It was really interesting to see Rose Jean Snitsky, and a little later, Kane entered this match. Overall, the fans seemed more interested when this match ended. 2/10 Kurt Angle vs. JBL vs. Big Show. At first this match was slow, but in the end it turned out quite successful when Engle managed to speed up the match. Kurt Angle made some really good moves in the fight and proved that he is the best wrestler in the match. JBL and Big Show are holding a slow match. The ending of this match was bad. For this whole match 5-5, mainly because of Kurt Angle. Randy Orton vs. XXX. Good match, amazing heat for Randy Orton, who was the face of this match. Randy proved that he could go to the limit with any major star. This match also marked the first match in which HHH fought, where someone did not run away and saved him from loss. Throughout this match was about 6/10. <br /> <br /> Royal Rumble match was fine. Some surprises. Some are not very good surprises. I was upset that Kurt Angle was not given enough time in this match. But throughout this match I had a boyfriend whom I never thought he would be pushed so soon. I will not tell you who will win. I give this match 8/10
