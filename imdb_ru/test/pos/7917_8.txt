"Alexander Nevsky" marked the return of director Sergei Eisenstein to the film industry after a period of exile, and he created a bald propaganda film, proclaiming Russia's superiority over Germany. <br /> <br /> Very little plot: Russians unite to fight the Germans; Russia is winning. The film is really an expanded montage of mostly battle scenes mixed with some moments of German cruelty (for example, a rather shocking scene in which German soldiers throw Russian children into violent fire). This was Eisenstein’s first sound film, and it is clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium. Indeed, this movie really looks more like a silent movie with added sound. There are several dialogue scenes, but they sit on the screen rather lifelessly, and the tempo is completely off, as if the actors were not on the set at the same time when they were filmed. Eisenstein basically uses sound as an excuse to block Prokofiev’s inspirational assessment of the process, and, indeed, this is one of the greatest merits of the film. <br /> <br /> Tell me what you want about Eisenstein’s ability (or lack) to direct actors or tell his film in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect, and “Alexander Nevsky "shines in all its flaws. <br /> <br /> Rating: A
