While Boris (Alexei Batalov) goes to war against the Germans for his mother Russia, his beloved Veronika (Tatyana Samoilova) marries his cunning cousin Mark (Alexander Shvorin) at the moment of weakness soon after her parents died in the air. on Moscow. Through various trials and betrayals, Veronika will wait for a word or letter from Boris, no matter how long it takes, hoping that he will return to her. cinematographer Sergey Urusevsky. Some of the many great frames, moving frames include the scene where the camera follows Veronica through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other, when she rushes through a crowd of bodies to say goodbye to Boris ... and does not reach him. even as we watch Boris look impatiently at the swarm without luck. The sequence after the air raid, where Veronica climbs the standing ladder, heading up the ruined building that she once called home, and the scene where Mark makes her lustful movement on Veronica when another air raid continues right outside the building, when the wind is noisy from the curtains and flashes of the light emanating from the inside - these are only two of many examples of how Sergei Urusevsky shows his genius in creating images that will last forever in the film. But without power and the tragedy of the story of how war can forever shape the fate of a couple that deeply and deeply loves each other, this film would not withstand the beauty of only visual. Together, however, we are staying with an amazing film ... just a haunting masterpiece from the Soviet Union after Stalin breathed his last breath. It is a great honor for me to see such a wonderful film.
