“Here on Earth” is an amazing beautiful romantic tale about Samantha, who has problems both with the boy and with her health. When her love for her current boyfriend, Jasper, fades away, her love for Kelly blossoms like a new spring flower. <br /> <br /> I found this film very touching, very warm, very romantic and touching. I liked every piece of this movie ... and this is quite rare! I highly recommend this movie to all movie lovers! This is one movie you don’t want to miss !!! : D <br /> <br /> By the way ... if you are a very sentimental person who cries easily while watching movies, bring fabric !!! On the other hand, it was a really very good movie !!! Very romantic ... and surprisingly good !!! : D <br /> <br />
