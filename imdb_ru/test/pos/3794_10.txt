Very few Barnance reviews I could find on the Internet do not really do this fairly. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I almost immediately regretted it, but the order had already passed, so I could not cancel it. I am very glad that I could not. This is an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> I will not give a brief overview of the plot, because other reviewers have already done so. But I will say that I do not understand the comments, that it is dark, shocking, strange, clinical, oppressive or pornographic. This, of course, is very unusual, which, I believe, may seem strange to some people, but other critical comments should reflect the reviewers' own problems, because I have not seen anything like this in the film that I just watched. I do not attract a boy, so nudity does not seem pornographic to me at all - it’s just a child trying to understand who he is without help from irresponsible adults in his life. And this is Sweden, not Utah, so women, naked to the waist, do not matter much. <br /> <br /> But what surprised me the most was how positively the film demonstrates this fearless lost child, who passes a kind of Odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences, search — and, ultimately, search — himself. It is fascinating, completely original and deeply satisfying. <br /> <br /> I’m not at all surprised that Barnes won the three major Güldbagge awards for best film, director and actor, but I’m completely surprised that the Actor who won was not Thomas Frick, the guy whose fearless performance in the role of the Rhine should be one of the most remarkable ever shot, but Ingvar Hirduall in the relatively minor role of the Stig, the mean boy of the mother of Rhine. I don’t understand at all, but it doesn’t change the fact that this is a great movie.
