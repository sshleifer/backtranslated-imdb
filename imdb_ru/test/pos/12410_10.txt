My wife and I loved this movie. Smart communication, great characters, thoughtful plot construction. The tempo in this movie is non-stop. Even the kitchen could not get to the kitchen. We have never seen Corey Feldman so funny. Taylor Nichols plays a good Fed ... my wife loves him on this HBO's "Married Man" show. All the actors were strong. A turn at the end made us welcome. That's why we give this film "Standing O".
