Uncle Frank is the uncle of all. This documentary covered all aspects of aging in America, loneliness, humor, irony. Uncle Frank and Aunt Tilly extremely generously shared their life experiences with the audience. The director did an incredible job of capturing the small and large parts that made up their lives. Thanks to everyone who helped make this movie!
