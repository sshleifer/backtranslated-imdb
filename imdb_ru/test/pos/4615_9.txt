I saw 2:37 at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and was shocked by this! A panic scene opens this film at 2:37 pm in Adelaide High School. This scene remains unresolved, as we return to the start of the day, and introduce teenagers preparing to go to school. The audience becomes close to each of the main characters and explores the everyday problems that adolescents face, including drugs, licentiousness, homosexuality, bullying and violence. Each scene is played over and over from the point of view of different teenagers, and resembles the elephant Gus Van Santa. This is a wonderful film by new director Murali K. Talluri. This was done with non-professional student actors, and the work went through an unprecedented 76 drafts of the script. This shows the staggering performances of many student actors, especially Theresa Palmer in the role of Melody. This film of adulthood is both intimate and thought-provoking with an unexpected and disturbing ending.
