Another great performance by Tom Wilkinson emphasizes “Separate Lies”, a 2005 film, which also starred Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Director Julian Fellows tells the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manings, where the husband (Wilkinson) thinks that he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their home on the night when they are having a party leads the police. It was a hit and run that killed the husband of their servant Maggie Bassett. James begins to suspect a neighbor, Bill Bjul (Everett), when he sees some damage in his car. He confronts Bule, who admits that he did it, and promises to go to the police the next day. When James comes home, Ann gets angry, which makes such a big deal out of this and declares that she was traveling by car. Of course, then James does not really want to rush to the police. She offers to call Bula and let him know her decision. “Oh, damn it,” says James. “Well, that's it,” says Ann. "I'm damn bule." The devastation of James is only the beginning of this well-thought drama. Without revealing the plot, this is a good example of how sex changes change history. An example of what I mean: Susan Smith drives her car into the lake, and her children drown. She gets life in prison. What if father did it? Chair. You will be surprised how often the result will be different. Same thing here - if James had a novel and was involved in subsequent actions, the audience could have a different attitude to this story. If Ann were in place of James, that would be awesome. Actually, it's terribly sad. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson is heartbreaking because the man, stunned by the woman he adores, and Emily Watson, do an excellent job with Ann, who, as soon as she is freed from her lies, her participation in the accident and a happy marriage - knows what she needs to do. Rupert Everett in the role of Buhle is very effective - lazy, arrogant and ultimately in need. Everyone here is very civilized in their relationships with each other, and no one has anything good or bad. <br /> <br /> There is a separate lie — James, that his marriage is happy, Ann, as stated above — and there is One unifying lie — an accident about which all participants are silent. For Ann, it’s enough that Maggie knows. In the end, everyone must deal with a separate lie, which the only lie revealed. <br /> <br /> Brilliant movie.
