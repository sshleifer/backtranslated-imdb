First of all, I must say that I am a big fan of Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento. Although I have not seen absolutely all of their films, I really enjoyed almost everyone I saw. I really love giallos, and I thought that Argento was a master of this genre, after watching films like Tenebre and Phenomena. But after I saw Fulci's New York Ripper, I found that he could do pretty good hyallo, besides his graphic films about zombies, and even surpass Argento at a certain level. <br /> <br /> I like the style of Fulci, and yes, I love Horus, but this film, I think, although it has a more developed plot and characters than his other films, is not his best. What I don’t like is that sometimes it can be confusing, especially at the end. And the fact that we are moving from one suspect to another, and then to another, until we even suspect the backward little girl for a moment, I think it goes too far. I know that Giallos must hold you to the end, and the killer must be very difficult to find, but this film plays too much for us. However, I really liked the scene when the witch was killed, I think it was very well done and gave me a chill. The acting is also pretty good, and the photo is great. <br /> <br /> Although this is a good film, I think that Lucio Fulci made the best films than this one, and I think that his best film is “Beyond the Boundary”, a completely different film, but more atmospheric and visual. <br /> <br /> I give "Do not torture the duckling" 7 out of 10. <br /> <br />
