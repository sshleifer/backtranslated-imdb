For years, I had a distant memory of watching this film, I searched the net to find it somewhere and could not find it somewhere, so I thought that it must have disappeared. <br /> <br /> BEFORE ... my grandmother showed me a set of boxes, which she sent to the Daily Mail, and although there is nothing decent there, but to my great surprise, among other precious stones were "Water babies "! I have not been so excited for a long time! This is a great frivolous film, the songs are not remembered, probably if I were a child at the time when it appeared, I would remember more. Unfortunately, it was just a film that I watched on my filming 10 years ago, when I was a little bit drunk. And looking back, the animation is terrible! and the re-recorded voices they make to get the richness of sound in movies are completely off! But who cares when you're a child, you never think about these things, even if they lead a boy for about 10 years and sound like a boy in the middle of puberty. <br /> <br /> Great classic kids movie!
