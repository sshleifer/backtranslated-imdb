In order to do a job like this in Rififi, for example, “Kapersu” (for example, “Score” and his opinions), you need to have nerves of steel. This one obviously demands and commands them. Jules Dassin is the master. <br /> <br /> I was on the edge of my place. It deserves to be more famous, although it was not at the time of its release in 1954, due, it is believed, to the blacklisted director in the hypocritical Hollywood of that time. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this film to those who do not have the pleasure of seeing it. <br /> <br /> I can't give him enough stars.
