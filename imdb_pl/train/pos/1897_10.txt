Again, it seems to me completely illogical, at least for me, that "Arthur" deserves only 6.4 out of 10 possible. Steve Gordon's one-time masterpiece is a completely "unlikely" if not completely "impossible" combination of wildly different elements. The fact that he managed to make alcoholism more laughter-friendly than a trumpet, is great in itself. The fact that he gave Dudley Moore his best role and every other film element here, his optimal influence, including the score, seems to me patent and scandalous. I challenge EVERYONE to sit in this movie and not laugh out loud. But apparently almost one third of its recipients have done it. Well, I found, for example, Gordon's effort to be both ridiculous and sympathetic, and to be a cousin of Aunt Geraldine Fitzgerald and the murderous, absolute jewels in the background of Stephen Elliott. Even the black chauffeur managed to avoid condescension, and the late, smelling Sir John Gielgud was right in accepting his fee, but he was wrong about his role. "Arthur" makes no effort to "Underztand", much less rationalize, the scourge of "alcoholism" (hey, iFit is not alcohol, it's other drugs of choice, including methamphetamine, and addictions are just symptoms, not goals). he's just watching in his own, quiz way.
