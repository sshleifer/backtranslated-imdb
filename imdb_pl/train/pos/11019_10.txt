Cliffhanger is what seems to be the last Slyvester Stallone action movie before becoming such an underrated actor. He is a mountaineer who must help his friend after being taken hostage by mercenaries who want them to find three suitcases carrying money over $ 100 million. He has great action sequences, good fun by the armchair and a great time in movies.
