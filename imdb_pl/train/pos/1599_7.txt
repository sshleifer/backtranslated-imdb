"Moonstruck" is a beautiful, small film directed by the great story-teller, Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof, Hurricane). The film is great on many levels. It shows a good piece of Italian culture, has a moving romance and (best of all) is a comic comedy. <br /> <br /> I liked the relative unconventional view of the actors the most. Nicolas Cage looks positive for most of the movie, and Cher ... well, Cher always looks a bit strange. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a funny movie and it is easy to recommend it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
