This movie surprised me in a good way. From the box I got the impression that it was an action thriller, but it was too fun to be a thriller, although it was a bit exciting. <br /> <br /> There are many nice individual links and funny situations in this movie and James Belushi were born to make Bill Manucci, doing a great job. The rest of the cast is also not half-bad, and especially Timothy Dalton is a treat. <br /> <br /> History can sometimes get confused when new characters appear in the movie. Things get more complicated because nobody rarely tells the truth about things. If you do not pay attention to it, in the end everything can go a bit bad, but I really liked it. <br /> <br /> Louis Morneau is not that well known, but he did his job well with it and I never got impatient when watching a movie. <br /> <br /> Done men are worth checking.
