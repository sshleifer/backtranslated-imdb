This is one of those movies - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - which still interests the viewer. Light films rarely win Oscars, but anyone who did cast in Soapdish deserves one. Even after watching the movie and finding out what's coming, it's still nice to see how different aspects of the story unfold. It is true that the whole drama is a melodrama; but it totally fits the movie with the background of a soap opera. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Why can not I write this now?" I think it is unfortunate that TV and internet censorship insist on all unnecessary sanitary conditions.
