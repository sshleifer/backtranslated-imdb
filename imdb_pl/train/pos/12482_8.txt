I only read good things about this film and in the end I had the opportunity to watch it late at night and that was all I expected it to be and so on. That's what the right horror should look like. terrifying because it was so realistic. The very sounding result was perfect for setting the dark mood. I liked the dramatic opening scene and liked the rest of the movie. It was very easy to understand and understand, unlike some movies that are too complicated. very good. I'd like to see more horror movies like this one. This is certainly one of my favorites. Realistic thunder and thunderstorm would create a nice atmosphere for this film. Besides, he had all the elements of a good horror movie I highly recommend. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that does not make blows. I will add it to my collection. The DVD has some interesting special functions.
