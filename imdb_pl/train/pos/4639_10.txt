I have it a few weeks ago and I love it! It is modern, light, but full of real complexity of life. These are questions and answers, just like other films by Eytan Fox. This is my favorite, along with Jossi and Jagger. It illustrates a lot more than just bubbles in which we can live. You do not have to be a Jew or homosexual to enjoy it - I'm not, but the film goes directly to my ten best films. At first it seems like pure entertainment, but it makes you think further. The relationships with which we must live are superficial, meaningful, deep, deadly, as you call it. You do not know what's going on, and you certainly do not know where this story is going when you first watch it. It's worth seeing it several times. Fox's films contain great bonus material - here a great music video and "creation" (including an explanation of the title, an interview with Lorem Ashknenazi, who plays in the film and the Arabs with doubts about the Israeli way of life).
