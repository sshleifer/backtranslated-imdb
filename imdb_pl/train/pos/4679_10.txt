A great movie with a slow start - it gives you a chance to cook. History develops in the interest and complexity. Characters and storyline disprove expectations and clich√©s in all the right moments. Great locations in New York - grit, real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of "Sex in the City" - in fact, the whole movie is an antidote to the concept of New York, sex and HBO / Hollywood relationship. This is a rare film that treats its heroes so honestly and compassionately. I LOVED IT! A great cast with great performances by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson and her love interest (I forgot his name!).
