Running Man fiercely scratches in today's American media complex and hits its customs center. It can be an easy target, but they still download it. RM effortlessly undertakes pro-wrestling (with the participation of some wrestlers as Hunters), network television, Nielsen's assessment, the US government (suggesting that it is still geared towards entertainment), crime and punishment, and half a dozen other things along the way. This is far from the original novel by Stephen King, and Arnold is not Ben Richards from the novel. But who cares? It's essentially Arnie's flick, with all the well-planned sequences of actions and units required by such a venture.
