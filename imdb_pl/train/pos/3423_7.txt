Do not expect the presentation of "truth." However, the relations of these veterans of Iraqi and Afghan wars require careful consideration. <br /> <br /> The main strength of the film is that it vividly depicts the words and war wounds of these veterinarians, and their post-war struggles are aimed at recreating a certain degree of normality and functionality in their lives. <br /> <br /> My main critic is twofold: she is one-sided and advocates anti-war activism, but there is nothing more to fix serious shortcomings in military and veteran services to help those who have suffered and continue to suffer trauma of war. These are NOT disastrous faults of the film. <br /> <br /> As a veteran I know that the horrific consequences of the war are real, and these young men and women express it very well. These vets vividly describe the physical and psychological pain and anguish experienced by most veterans and ordinary people must understand because the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
