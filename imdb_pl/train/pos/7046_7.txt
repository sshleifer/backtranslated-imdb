In War, Inc. we find a logical extension of the current outsourcing of all military operations that we are currently conducting in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you know Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater overseas, you're halfway home to fully appreciate the latest Cusack satire. Cusack is playing a corporate maniac named Brand Hauser who is in Turiquistan organizing a trade fair in the newly liberated country as his cover, waiting for access to his latest goal. While he is intrigued by the anti-establishment reporter played by Marisa Tomei and chased by the over-sexualized pop star played by Hilary Duff. We have been acquainted with Hauser's past, which includes the tragedy that has haunted him since then, and a corporate assistant named Marsha Dillon, who actually conducts the entire operation for him (and played with fun through Joan Cusack). While some of the moments are played out properly, these are not always the moments you expect, and the small accents often surprise you. All directors turn to solid performances. Duff's accent comes and goes, but otherwise he does a very good job and goes a long way to dispel her Disney image. Tomei is funny but underestimated, while Cusack has almost every scene in which they are. To be honest, they get good material. Writers are turning in a good script with enough twists and turns of gags to act like a giggle all the way to a predictable end. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that prevents me from judging it as higher because history changes and changes the way to the expected ending. <br /> <br /> If you like your wide and physical comedy, there probably is not enough here to interest you with the whole movie. On the other hand, if you like a sly comedy and a wide satire, this is for you.
