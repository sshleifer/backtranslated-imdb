Of the three remakes of W. Somerset Maughan's novel, this one is the best, and not because John Cromwell brought her to the movie. The film is worth noting because of the groundbreaking performance of Bette Davis, who as Mildred Rogers showed the film industry that he is a star. Finally, her struggles with Jacek Warner and his studio paid off in a royal manner. <br /> <br /> The film is dominated by Mildred from the beginning. From the beginning, we realize that Mildred does not care about Philip and he will never do it. He does not hide his contempt for this nice soul who fell in love with the wrong woman. He will again be humiliated by Mildred and again, because he does nothing about who he really is. <br /> <br /> Poor Philip Carey, apart from being handicapped, is a weak man. When he tries to stick to Mildred, he rejects him. When Mildred returns to him when she is weak and defeated, she rises from the occasion, defeating her dependence on the terrible woman who stole his will and manhood. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis gives a fantastic performance of Mildred. It was one of her best roles and she ran away with it. Her repugnance to the genus Philip is obvious from the beginning of their relationship. When he tells him that he is brushing his lips after kissing her, he is one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Leslie Howard weakened Philip and makes him seem even weaker than he. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen are seen in smaller roles. <br /> <br /> This is Bette Davis show and do not forget about it!
