The night listener drew my attention, and Robin Williams shone as a radio host in New York who is delighted with his friendship with a 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin), who is very sick. Williams never met the boy personally, because they only contacted by phone. However, former Williams boyfriend (good job from Bobby Cannavale) raises doubts about the boy, which prompts Williams to organize a meeting with him personally. What follows is having a lasting impact on Williams in a way he does not expect. I will leave it. Toni Collette is also playing. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, and Toni Collette gave the memorable character of Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also played as a friend of Williams. The Night Listener is inspired by real events and has a grim, almost frightening silence all the time. Sometimes it is predictable, not thanks to some of the opinions I read before watching the movie and only thanks to logic, but I liked it anyway. I like roles like Williams, more than his comedian characters, so it was an extra bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10
