49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) Patient in bed with fever 11 year old Anna (Charlotte Burke) has only her drawings to keep company. Her health gradually deteriorates when she is accompanied by a series of mysterious "black shades". In each of these episodes he dreams of a house in the wilderness, where only a sick-looking boy named Marc (Elliot Spiers) lives. When the dark, unknown danger threatens her idyllic "paper mill", Marc's life is threatened. Her life is also in danger, because these dreams reflect her own state of health. <br /> <br /> Criticism: Haunted first debut of British director Bernard Rose. Made of a fairy tale ("Marianne Dreams") by Catherine Storr, it leaves many other "original" works of fantasy. When the story tells about dreams and nightmares, it is difficult to give it a mix of fairy tales and reality to work in film form. Director Rose successfully gives children the fantasy world along with the darkness that tries to usurp them. <br /> <br /> Feverishly captured by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how to use music with professional sense of time to "jump out of the seat" moments. Most of the thrillers are very scruffy in this most important aspect of scaring the audience, not knowing what the next scene will bring. I also like the way he captures the tension and never lets him pass or sluggish in the next sequence of events. Also, his mastering the placement of objects in the frame (as in his photographs P.O.V.) gives the cinematography an additional dimension that would otherwise seem to be missing. Only in Europe you will find such sinister-looking places as those presented here: a lonely house, fields, coastal towns, a watch tower etc. <br /> <br /> Rose would follow this movie from "Candyman" (1992), the real horror of "thinking" people 'and favorite cult horror.
