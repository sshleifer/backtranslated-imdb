A good movie, not only for children. John Thaw is brilliant as always (without Morse's trace of him). The boy playing William did a good job, although he was not convincing in every scene. I loved the whole sense of a small village and slower pace of life in those days. I also felt scenes in London in which historically accurate, as far as I could tell. <br /> <br /> It strongly reminded me of a Scandinavian movie that I saw a few years ago under the name Mother of Mine. In the film there was a boy evacuated from Finland to Sweden during World War II. The wife of the family who took him asked for the girl, because (as it turns out) she lost her daughter. He ignores him instead of the boy. The fact that the boy speaks Finnish makes it even more complicated. I highly recommend this film to everyone who enjoyed Good Night, Mr. Tom, he has the same feeling.
