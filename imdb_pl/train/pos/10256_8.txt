The first part of this notorious series of horrors is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by producers and set up like an amateur camera tape, with a digital clock at the bottom of the frame. It presents a woman who has been kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for a few days before finally killing her. The unfortunate victim is brutally beaten and covered with raw meat before her nails are pulled out with tongs, her hand shattered by a hammer, her eye pierced with a needle, and so on. <br /> <br /> In the most nauseous scene, woman abductees burn her with hot water and drop live bugs into burns. The series met with great interest when American actor Charlie Sheen, believing that the series contained actual murder, tried to prohibit its distribution in the United States. The FBI investigation revealed that the films were just what they seemed to be for most viewers - sick re-creations using nasty but obvious special effects. This film, issued by the acclaimed Japanese comic writer Hideshi Hino, who also directed the third and fourth episodes, is a sure way to remove all but the most tolerant rooms. But gorehounds probably will not find anything special.
