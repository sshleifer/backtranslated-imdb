"California" is a great movie that makes us look at ourselves. The film has a great cast, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, A River Runs Through It) as Early Grayce, David Duchovny (The X Files) as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Homicide: Life On The Street and Escape From LA) as Carrie Loughlin, girlfriend Brian and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear and What's Eating Gilbert Grape) as Adele Corners, Early girl. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler is a writer who is a liberal, he is preparing to write a book about serial killers. Brian and his girlfriend, Carrie, decide they want to move to California, so Brian posts an ad in college for some who want to go to California to share expenses on the trip. <br /> <br /> Early Grayce is an ex-con and sociopath on parole, who recently lost his job in the mirror factory in the city is indebted, owes money to the owner. An earlier parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about work. Lege and sees the ad, then tells Adele, his girlfriend about going to California. Earlier and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave the city. Brian and Carrie do not know he's the killer who just killed him. For a while, Brian and Carrie thought about Early and Adele, but they met and became friends, Carrie and Adele became real good friends. <br /> <br /> Their journey is very scientific. Although Brain and Carrie do not know before, he's a killer until later. The question that Brian asks in this movie about the difference between the killers and us is a very good question. Earlier, Grayce is a sociopath who does not see his mistake, come down later and pay the price. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie, I give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up. I love the songs in the movie, especially at the end of the movie, the song "Look Up To The Sky" by Indians.
