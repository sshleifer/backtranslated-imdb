This peculiarity of Roman Polanski clearly shows where his origin was at the moment he did it. Polański himself plays a shy man who rents a Paris apartment in which the previous tenant committed suicide. He is obsessed with discovering what led to it, to the extent that he dresses up to drag and play events in a way that they can develop. The film is disturbing to some extent and has this atmosphere of frightening anxiety in which Polański excels, but it comes out too much as the rebirth of "Baby Rosemary" and "Disgust", two other better Polanski films that deal with amazing events in moody apartments. <br /> <br /> But when it comes to preoccupation ... unless I read too much in the film, I have to believe that it was Polankii's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt marked as a sexual deviant and exiled from America. I do not judge him in one way or another, but it is difficult to deny it in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Level: B +
