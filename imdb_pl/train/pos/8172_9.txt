I remember how terrified I was when I was younger, and gradually became less and less, until I became tired enough, as I am sure that many other viewers have become so damned that the barrage of bloody films made in the last few years has given me pleasure but I did not get scared or sprained. The "dentist" turned it around. <br /> <br /> It seems that the configuration is simple: a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc in the inside of the mouth, and perhaps also the body. The clever phrase, however, is that the dentist is the protagonist of the film, so instead of being a one-dimensional bad guy with no obvious motivation, his development is the widest of all characters, and he is very human and credible. In this way, the viewer feels sympathy for both him and his victims, and instead of hoping that justice will come to him, I found myself hoping to somehow find a way to hide the traces and return to a normal life. <br /> <br /> What really "creates" a horror is violence. And "Dentist" does it better than any other movie I can come up with. First of all, the movie has a lot of tension, which is missing from modern gore movies. In one scene () the dentist is emotionally distraught and for the first time must see a patient with a small child. When it reaches the child's mouth, you hope that for the good of the dentist and the child the meeting will end without injury. I will not spoil what will happen. Second, when it comes up, it hits the worst, squirmy nerves. I will not give anything again. <br /> <br /> Of course, being a movie you've never heard of, it has disadvantages. Most importantly, it is intended only for horror fans. In addition, as another reviewer mentioned, taking place in just a few days, we do not really have any backgrounds on the characters. The voltage drops slightly at the very end. But really, the fact that we'd like to know even about heroes is proof of how good this movie is, and most of the movie is solid enough to be forgiven for minor tensions. <br /> <br /> It is strange that after years of getting used to film cinema, he suddenly wants to cover his eyes when he sees blood. The "dentist" made me scared and completely uncomfortable, and for that I get full acceptance.
