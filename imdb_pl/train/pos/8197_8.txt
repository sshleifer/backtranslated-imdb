**** Excellent <br /> <br /> *** Good <br /> <br /> ** Fair <br /> <br /> * Poor <br /> <br /> `Go ahead, make my day! <br /> <br /> The fourth photo from the series is directed by Eastwood himself (who was supposedly the director of most Magnum Force) and restores the brutal society of the first two films. However, the film still lacks impact and credibility. This film appeared in the early 1980s, in the days of Regan and the young Republicans. The premise of a raped woman revenge on her rapist does not speak to this time frame. This plot would be better for Enforcer, who in reality would be a good movie. What Sudden Impact needed was a plot similar to Wall Street, but with Dirty Harry inside. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3 STARS
