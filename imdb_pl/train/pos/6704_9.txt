For the first three seasons Sabrina was a hidden gem in TGIF (and later in the replays of the early afternoon). Each episode had maniacal, lively energy and a fast pace of fire that overcame the sporadic joke. Melissa Joan Hart radiated her astute talent for physical comedy, especially in facial expressions. Her two aunts, playing "simple men" or as simple as two witches, had great comical timing and general chemistry with Hart. Salem, as a talking cat, could play freely in any crazy plan he was interested in, and you could laugh and take it all by the pace, because he was a talking cat. Sabrina's friends complemented the social experience at the school, which also housed the typical "evil cheerleader" and "totalitarian director." Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the program was the ability to combine pop culture (eg, Bands of the era, Jerry Springer), archetypal human condition / morality (eg Meaning of friendship, the Christmas spirit) and a literal representation of such related metaphors in the Magic Kingdom. Unfortunately, like many other television programs, the series peaked in the first three years, coinciding with Sabrina in high school. Beginning with the fourth season, going to college meant there would be a sharp drop in the overall quality of the show, especially when writers decided to introduce Josh as Harvey's rival and come up with thin excuses for Aunt Hilda and Zelda to remain on the screen as key players. The last season in which Sabrina works in the pop culture magazine was unexpectedly disappointing. Finally, Sabrina (especially high school) remains a unique entrance as a hybrid situational comedy with magical elements that raises it above the tiring tariff that is produced in this genre every year.
