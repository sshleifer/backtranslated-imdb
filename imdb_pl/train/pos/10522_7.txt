This is a good adaptation of the Austen novel. Good, but not brilliant. <br /> <br /> Pictures are clever, sometimes cross the border with a trick, but they certainly avoid the trap that makes it look like boring soap in costumes, given that the whole story is controlled by dialogues. <br /> <br /> The acting person is competent. Mrs. Paltrow is distant, as her character requires, but the required distance from other heroes is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions. In other words, it seems that he does not care enough about the results of his efforts to match. Part of the support cast is guilty of excessive action - very much in style that is appreciated on the stage, but not on the spot in the movies. Personally, I had problems accepting Alan Cumming as Mr. Elton - without his fault, except to leave such an impression as a gay pram in "The High Life", that now it is difficult to accept him playing any serious role. Acting honors are due to Toni Collette, who manages to radiate warmth, and Jeremy Northam, who sets his character at the appropriate level.
