Considering the nature and origin of the 11 filmmakers, it is not surprising that this film is neutral at best in relation to America. Probably the most "anti" segment comes from Ken Loach, who definitely does not tow the line of the British New Labor party. Although events from a year ago are shocking and painful for most Americans and the majority of viewers who have seen them develop live through CNN etc. Most writers and directors decide to show that tragedy is not an American monopoly. Should anyone be surprised that these 3,000 deaths have the same weight elsewhere, as the West gives thousands of Tutsi, Tamil, Bosnian, Chilean, Kurdish (we need further). If it was a call to "wake up" for the states, it is equally tragic that in the next 12 months the stalemate of Israel / Palestine is further from the solution when George Bush Jnr. he would rather take revenge than make the world a safer place. I think that many authors wonder where the idealism of the Founding Fathers went and why America built up as a bastion of freedom, justice and tolerance now sees its own superior interest, while the Third World wonders where the next drink, meal or sphere comes from.
