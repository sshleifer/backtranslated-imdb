Lost is one of a kind ... so charming and full of tension, emotion and excitement at the same time. I've never seen any such TV series before. It is full of emotions in the jungle and has a good scenario. Actors in such a natural way caused life on the island, that during watching I feel lost on the island. This is an excellent song told in a very intelligent form. The series is like a movie showing the lives of survivors lost on a desert island. I am tempted to watch one episode after another and I highly recommend this series to all fans of television programs. Watch it to see the magic of getting lost out of nowhere.
