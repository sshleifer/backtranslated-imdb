It's a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when it appeared. I recently saw this movie again and I still like it. Many of the films we watched when we were younger do not seem to hold out when we watch them later in life. The film is in fact a great example of the 80s of this type of films. Keaton is in the best shape, all the actors did a really good job, and Ron Howard was very good, letting stories push the movie, instead of forcing him. The pace of the movie is fast with a few free places, and watching cars from the 80's is too funny. Being from the '80s, I loved seeing an ugly pacer again. The film is a great movie for lovers of comedies and movie lovers from the 80's.
