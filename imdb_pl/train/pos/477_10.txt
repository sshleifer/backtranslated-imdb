Hello, I am a chess enthusiast since the age of about 6 years. I suppose I'm obsessed with chess, but I hope not as much as the main character in this movie. <br /> <br /> In this video, the central character reflects a real chess player named Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. He is known for the game he plays against Steinitz, where Steinitz played a beautiful combination. Instead of giving up, he just left the tournament hall, never coming back. <br /> <br /> The social ineptitude of the main character is unfortunately a feast for some of the more important grandmasters that you sometimes take in chess tournaments. Chess, I suppose, is a very big sacrifice, and sometimes you can end up imbalance in other areas of your life. The main example of this is the legend of chess Bobby Fischer. Although he was a genius, he was also very disturbed in many ways. <br /> <br /> In the film a match for the world championship is presented, as between the Italian grandmaster and Luzhin. The format is a knockout, which in fact the world governing body Fide sometimes used as the format itself - switching from 128 players to just 2 in the final. But it was a group knockout - which also presents a realistic format in which the winners of each group play against each other. <br /> <br /> The position before postponement is itself a fascinating chess puzzle. In fact, I made a YouTube video on this topic so you can get to know the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best wishes Tryfon
