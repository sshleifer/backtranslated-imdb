First; I am a devoted fan of Modesty's and have read comic books since I was a child, and I found earlier films about our unsatisfying heroine, but wherever they go, this ROCKS! <br /> <br /> So, let's go: Mrs. Blaise works in a casino, a gang of robbers appears and starts playing for her friends. If the robber wins one round, she will have to tell him about herself. If he wins twice in a row, one of the staff members will be fired. (Sounds stupid, yes, well, I'm not very good at explaining ...);) <br /> <br /> He tells him about growing up in a war zone, without parents and friends, about her help an old man in a refugee camp and as they run away, living according to their own rules. They hunt for food, and he teaches her to read and fight. When they approach civilization, they are drawn into a war, and because they are taken into rebellion, they are shot and the old man dies, leaving him to meet the city itself. <br /> <br /> Then he meets the man for whom he now works in the casino, and the story ends. <br /> <br /> What you need to follow is an amazing fight, and the line is completely cool. Alexandra Staden is TERRIFIC Modesty Blaise! Just as modest and powerful, graceful and intellectual as a comic. <br /> <br /> I feel awkward, but also hear Modesty speak with a slightly broken accent, but it does not matter, because the comic can not speak loudly, but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent. (Not to mention it's weird that everybody speaks English in the Balkans ...) <br /> <br /> Acting is really good, even the child that impersonates the young Blaise must applaud! <br /> <br /> My favorite part must be the place where she rips her dress to kick the ass of a stupid robber! Fantastic! : D I can not wait for the real adventure to start in the next movie! <br /> <br /> Watch out, you will not be disappointed!
