This is what I call the growth film. Each character is different and better at the end - and this is all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a "bath of love". Josie Lawrence, best known as a comedian, really shines like a woman who makes all these changes. Even the men in this movie go from being self-centered to better men. The book remained very loyal to the novel, which is a plus in my book because I am a librarian. Breathtaking views and true love.
