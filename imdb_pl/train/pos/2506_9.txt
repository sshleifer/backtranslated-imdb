Moon Child was one of the more symbolic films I've seen. What I really liked is an illustration of immorality / mortality and obstacles and tips in life. The film presents a large part of the vampire Kei, who has the power of immorality and benefits. Regardless of whether he has supernormal abilities or eternal life, people usually want it. Moon Child shows the pain and disadvantages of being immortal, because feelings of loss affect almost all characters, especially the main characters Sho and Kei. The meaning of the title "Moon Child" is revealed when the film is approaching the end, where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon that illuminates the way to other people, giving directions. I am a personality quite similar to the moral one on which the film is presented. Film weaknesses lie in some parts of special effects and special effects because they made the movie less authentic. The scene in which Toshi dies, could be more powerful and more realistic if more authentic emotions were involved. Some scenes with special effects, such as pistol shots, could also be more authentic without seeming too similar to the action video game. The sparks coming out of the pistols seemed too fake and I think that they could be eliminated or repaired. Nevertheless, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should consider. Symbolic ideas and images that the film reveals will be easily accepted by everyone and may interest many viewers. It's a well-thought-out movie, as well as entertainment for watching.
