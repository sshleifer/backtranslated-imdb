We watched it in "The Wonderful World of Disney" at ABC last night and came to the conclusion that in "Mouse" things must be more tense than usual. <br /> <br /> Because this movie only lasts 74 minutes and they had to record it for 2 hours of broadcast TV time, they had and do not invent it, advertising breaks lasting from 6 to 7 minutes. And during these commercial breaks they had another commercial in the guise of a "TV series" run by such an annoying Kelly Ripp, who loudly announced the magical wonders of "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True." <br /> <br /> Time after time, break after the break, Disney has spent time with a real movie to tell us loyal viewers that we need to get a copy of the sequel. Thank you, Disney, for making us the service of creating the continuation of your beloved movie jewel. <br /> <br /> In any case, this commercialism and the cash-desk call made it difficult to get into the real movie "Cinderella," because before the commercials were over, I forgot where the story ended. <br /> <br /> But of course, "Cinderella" still retains its magic, and the story is still good, although we've all seen it countless times. It is a pity that they had to lower the price for all marketing for what looks like a bad continuation.
