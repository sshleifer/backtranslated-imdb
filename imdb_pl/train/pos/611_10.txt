I am saying that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating / approving the trailer of this movie completely made a mistake. I know for a fact that I wanted to see this movie based on the announcement, and EVERYONE, who saw it (I know) absolutely adored him ... Kampania reklamowa jest haniebna / katastrofa / mistania. <br /> <br /> Opened at # 4 for ... <br /> <br /> # 1-hour of the peak I have not seen, average IMDb score 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2 - Bourna Ultimatum, which I saw, an amazing movie, but the third week, the average rating IMDb 8.7 (I deserve to say). <br /> <br /> # 3 - The Simpsons Movie, which I saw, fine movie, but 4th week, average IMDb Score 8.1 (in my opinion a bit high). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, average IMDb score 8.4 (lower than Bourn, but this was ours for 3 weeks). <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether it was a poor schedule or poor advertising, I think that the powers behind this movie have screwed up the time! This should be advertised as an amazing movie that is a fantasy / fairy tale and is not advertised as another fairy tale? It's a pity :( Anyway - Now, when I started to talk very senselessly ... Great movie, go see it!
