A masterful elaboration of James Caine's "The Postman Always Rings Twice", in which the first Luchino Visconti film was shot mainly around Ferrara in the soulless war-torn Italy. The original negative was considered destroyed, but Visconti recorded the printout and fortunately we can see this early neorealistic work today. Rugged handsome Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who recently revealed her breasts at La Cena delle beffe "(1941), they play the role of sensually charged and unfortunate lovers who intend to kill their husband, it does not pay, pays in a way that is not directly related to the crime, excellent director, screenplay, acting and photography, apparently not as good as the French "Le Dernier tournant" (1939), but probably better than the American version (1946) starring Lana Turner and John Garfield.
