I am rather a walking person, with slightly low tastes. However, from time to time I try to raise the bar of my cultural awareness. This movie was one of my attempts. Throughout the movie I was delighted. I liked it so much that I got my own tape so I could see it again. It's a very thoughtful and exciting movie. I saw this as a huge question for the viewer: What is the depth of sacrifice so that you can accept it, can you accept it or accept it? As a military member, this is obviously an important question for me. This question weighs heavily on the viewer of this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
