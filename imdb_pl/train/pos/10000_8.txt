Homelessness (or homelessness, as George Carlin said) has been a problem for years, but it is never a plan to help people on the street who were once thought to be people who did everything from going to school, working or voting on the matter. Most people think of the homeless as a losing case, worrying about things like racism, the war against Iraq, putting pressure on children to succeed, technology, choices, inflation or worrying if they are on the street. . <br /> <br /> But what if you were supposed to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from home, entertainment sets, bathrooms, pictures on the wall, computer, and everything you once valued to see what it's like to be homeless? This is Goddard Bolt's lesson. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks (who directs) who plays Bolt, plays a rich man who has everything in the world until he decides to place a bet with sissy rival (Jeffery Tambor) to see if he can live on the streets for thirty days without luxuries; if Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants in a future project to create more buildings. A bet on where Bolt is tossed to the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every movement in which he can not get off the sidewalk. He gave the nickname Pepto by tramp after he was written on his forehead, where Bolt meets other characters, including a woman named Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), a former dancer who divorces before she lost her home and her friends Sailor ( Howard Morris) and Fumes (Teddy Wilson), who are already used to the streets. Those who survived. Bolt is not. He is not accustomed to reaching mutual agreements as he once did when he was rich, where he fights or runs away, kills or is killed. <br /> <br /> While the relationship between Molly and Bolt was not necessary for the plot, I found "Life Stinks" is one of the interesting films of Mel Brooks, in which before being a comedy shows a delicate side compared to his work in slapstick, like Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein or Spaceballs to show what it's like to have something valuable before losing it the next day or, on the other hand, making a stupid bet, just like all rich people do when they do not know what to do with their money. Maybe they should give this to the homeless instead of using them like Monopoly money. <br /> <br /> And maybe this movie will inspire you to help others.
