A great movie from the 90s! Parker Posey is fantastic in this story of Manhattan nightlife that requires so much cash. Posey gives an amazing performance as a librarian and night robot. It's a good, light film on Saturday night before leaving. Rock soundtrack, costumes are out of this world, the script is funny, and the actors do a great job. An exciting value: you can do it in this world, if you try, just find your niche. I believe that Parker Posey is PERFECT actress for this kind of character: young, wonderful and broke. (You must look at the movie "Clock Clocks"). If you're watching Party Girl, you'll have fun. Enjoy!
