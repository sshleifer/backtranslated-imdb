What will you get if you go through The Matrix with The Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you've seen the Matrix. The creators of the Matrix say that it is "inspired by the anime". From watching the trailer to this classic, you can see where they took the story. <br /> <br /> The movie is in a sense embedded in Japan in the 1980s and really shows up. Costumes, music and words (in the latest English version of AD Vision) are similar to those that were removed directly from the era. I believe that it was also done at this time, but due to some plot lines, this is not the date of the movie! <br /> <br /> As you probably guessed in my references to the Matrix, the world is not real. This is not actually the 80's. In fact, it is something more than 2480's. After the nuclear war, the Earth's ecosystem (or the "Prime Biosphere") was destroyed. Survivors are forced to flee into space, where the conflict persisted. Once all planets (or "biospheres") were abandoned, people began to live in megagons - cities inside spacecraft, where, using hypnosis and illusion techniques with the Truman Show, they were forced to believe that we are back on earth, in the most peaceful time in the last memory ... Eighties. When the young Shogo obtains a mysterious motorcycle with an advanced appearance, it leads him to learn more than he should know ... Garland (a bike that becomes a mech), a weapon from 2400, helps Shogo in escaping the military prosecution. As more and more about megagone is discovered, war is approaching home, and because of the conflict between the army and the computer, the war also comes to the megad≈ºonu ... I'm sorry if these points are seen as spoilers, but the plot is drawn in principle in this method. You really believe that the war is going on, and Shogo really gets quite maimed with what he discovers. What begins with the merry, cool 80s becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality. These characters are real people, not the cardboard cut-outs that we saw in the Matrix sphere. There really is a sense that suffering people can go through such a conspiracy and war. It can just strangle you ... I know I did it. <br /> <br /> The animation is impressive for the whole day, and the image quality on DVD ADVision is unbelievable in its age. The graphics style is beautiful and resembles traditional anime, very cultural. Be prepared for a lot of violence and blood, there is also an erotic sex scene. <br /> <br /> The ending can be seen as "there can be no end", just like in the Matrix, or supposedly maybe the next part that I have not had the pleasure to see. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is one of the best animes I have seen, one of the best movies I've seen and considered by many to be one of the greatest animes of all time. <br /> <br /> I need to recommend an ADVision DVD because their English skills are amazing and the film is doing justice, and you can buy it from artbox to store two sequels when released, which will have the same vocals. <br /> <br /> In summary, MegaZone 23 is an amazing movie and deserves to stick to it high and it should be indispensable in every anime fan collection. Heck, even my mother liked it.
