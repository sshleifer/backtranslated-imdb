Theory Of Flight is an engaging study of an artist (Branagh) who wants to free himself from boredom and mediocrity, and a terminally ill patient (Bonham-Carter) in the last stages of ASL, limited to a wheelchair who wants to make love to a man before he died. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham-Carter emanates wit, rebellion and independence as a patient with ASL, who is practically dependent on people around her to look after her. <br/> <br/> Kenneth Branagh, convicted by the community to take part in her care, complements Helena's charm with a pathetic melancholy, creating a sentimental, fascinating love story in which two people try to help each other in finding a way to happiness, before time runs out.
