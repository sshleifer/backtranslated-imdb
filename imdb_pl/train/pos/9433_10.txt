The impressive film about four urban slicers during the crisis in Appalachia became a synonym for depravity of the village. Each of the four businessmen struggles with the worst fears when facing a challenging water trip on the river to be replaced by a dam. When the locals decide to "defeat the road" with intruders along the way, it leads to several deaths and many traumatic experiences for the survivors. Each traveler is excellent, although Voight gives you the advantage and the strongest results. Rural scenery and culture are well captured, including a breathtaking sequence of duels. I saw it the day it appeared, not exactly in the movie with the perfect date (although we both liked it). I remember it as a groundbreaking dramatic performance by Burt, Voight has already been established. This is not a movie that can be watched every week, but has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed.
