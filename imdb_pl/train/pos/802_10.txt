I know that I know it was a good ending, but honestly it was amazing. I love it when the movie ends with an amazing dark nature, but this time I was impressed by Darth Vader turning against the Emperor, I was really amazed. The sequence of anguish in this movie took place when Luke was tortured and defeated by the Emperor / Darth Sidious. It will soon be destroyed when Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master. A nice victim. The photos of this movie are impressive. I was surprised by all the ships of the Rebel fighting ships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race, which showed Mon Calomari, ewok, sullesteian (pilot Lando) and many more ... Most of my favorite scenes are in this video: 1-When Vader destroys the emperor and is mortally wounded. 2- When Luke sees the ghosts of Obi-Wan and Yoda, then Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) appears (the most magnificent scene in Star Wars). 3- When LEIA kills Jabba, smothering the ruler of the Hutt crime. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like the scenario and the Battle of Endor, presenting the combat on the ground and space, as well as the best Star Wars duel between Darth Vader Vs Luke Skywalker and the Death Star. Post-script: Scenes with Leia in a bikini of slaves are unforgettable. 9/10.
