It is a racist movie, but worth learning and joy. For the first time, the natural tendency is to focus on Erbe and Dad. They relax, do something peaceful, and she is still at home to finish high school, and he retired and waits for inspiration to do something. The second time you realize how terribly your sister's husband is thrown out by friends from the blues bar. He takes it, it is a thing to do these days, and the critical moment passes, as if talking about the weather. In the same scene, the sister's blues song is a real tear, if you are the least sensitive and you like music like that. Her performance is like the peak of history; the history of blues with good guys being "people of color" in their elements, SC. Meanwhile, all white people in the film lead what seems shallow, meaningless to life, suitable only for children. That's cool, if you recognize it as fiction.
