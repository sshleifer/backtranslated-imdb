One day, I accidentally came across this movie on television. It was broadcast in the middle of the day on a channel not very well known for broadcasting good movies. This one was no less good though. <br /> <br /> October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the launch in Sputnick, who became a rocket scientist. He and his friends are starting to build rockets. His father is not happy that his sons found a new hobby, and he would prefer him to become a miner as himself or go to college on a football scholarship like his brother. <br /> <br /> The story is well written. Maybe a little too predictable, but it's okay because it does not focus too much on those parts of the story. This is an important part, but where it is obvious, the inner action, the action between the characters is focused. The story is good. He has a few stereotypes, but that's fine. It's based on actual events, so you can not just give up these stereotypes. The characters are really good. Where the story goes down, the characters are taken out and manage to maintain the action and quality of the film at a high level. You recognize these characters and gain sympathy for them. They are well-written and reliable. <br /> <br /> This is a good looking movie. The sets and style of the '50s are accurate and the photos are well composed and well-lit. All this greatly improves the mood of the film. <br /> <br /> Acting is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal makes a great performance because Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper are good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast, they are good too. All this together gives quite a strong cast. <br /> <br /> In total, I'm happy that I caught this movie. I saw for the first time that I had learned that it was based on actual events. If I knew that when I saw him, he would probably be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie that I believe that everyone can enjoy. It's kind of a good movie. That's how good it is!
