This program is amazing. I thought that the two episodes in which Paul died were so sad; Actually, I was crying. But other programs were amazing; Kerry was my favorite character because she was in the "dark side". I also thought that Bridget was funny because it was a whole lot. I also thought that the guy who played Kyle was really, very sweet. I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything. The guy who played Rory was cute, and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really funny. The entire television program is fun and I would like it to continue showing it on TV. when they showed it on TV, I watched it every time it was switched on. The next time I show it, I will watch it over and over again.
