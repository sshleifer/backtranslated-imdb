I really like what I've seen in this cartoon so far. Of course, the animation is not the best, but to be honest, I would prefer this type of cardboard style to be fast and cheap than the old style, which is fast and cheap (which more and more often happened - it's just a style that looks good when put in a lot of time and effort). There is nothing wrong with angular lines and small black dots - in fact, I think it's really sweet. As a child, I never thought that the Scooby-Doo project was particularly admirable, but I think I would like to get to know it better. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Shaggy has always been my favorite character and believe it or not, but I think he has the greatest potential for some depth. Sure, the program does not focus on the original theme "Mystery-solving", but it was an old, tired pattern anyway. Do not get me wrong - I'm sure there are writers who would be able to arouse much more interest in traditional Mystery Inc. activities. (which was missing so late), but in the meantime this show is a funny departure from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are still fun, but not only comical relief. They are still cowardly, but in the end they have the opportunity to use what seems to be (shock!) Intelligence. They are the same old gobies as always, but now they seem to be living with their uncle Albert's heritage. <br /> <br /> I used to find most of the original Scooby-Doo jokes to be pure cheese and at best inadvertently fun, but this show really gives a sense of real humor. Besides, I never really like Casey Kasem as Shaggy, so the new actor does not bother me as much as other people do. (I still think Billy West was the best, though) <br /> <br /> In general, this is not a great cartoon in the history of cartoons, still an achievement among other Scooby incarnations.
