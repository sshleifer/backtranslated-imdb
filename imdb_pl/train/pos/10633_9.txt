This movie is as unique as it is omitted ... Another story is simply that it shows you how to survive or maintain, you can find the ability to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind. I saw it on the cable for the first time in the late 1970s and really presented the limitations of the gay community at the time. I believe that this film has overtaken its time by presenting a small piece of obscure lifestyle. It is really a classic in the sense that it was the precursor of what is now presented as a distant family. This movie should be available on DVD / VHS so that you can confirm not only the extraordinary performances of Meg Foster and Perry King, but also show how far we have come and we still have to go where the relationship is.
