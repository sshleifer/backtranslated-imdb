I have watched this film so many times thanks to my children's hood that even today I can almost see the whole dialogue. And when I watch it now, I'm just happy and surprisingly still laughing. I think it's amazing how they managed to train animals, especially cats, to such an extent that they are able to play the main role in the feature film. However, watching this now, I can unfortunately notice that this is not a masterpiece that I once considered to be such. But I prefer to remember how I felt when I was younger, watching it on VHS on my first TV that obscured the picture in yellow. And whereas this is a movie for children, I would definitely give it a 10/10.
