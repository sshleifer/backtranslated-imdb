I know there are some purists who buy everything that is not exactly like the original, but sometimes spin-offs can stand on their own merits. I like the new Iron Chef because it is similar enough to the Japanese version, but at the same time satisfies the American spirit. I love Alton Brown as a commentator because he explains it with talent. Sami Iron Chefs are very interesting. I know that the originals were probably the best chefs in the world, but Bobby Flay is the only American chef who defeated them. Mario Batali seems to have the most fun while cooking, commenting and being brilliant while creating. I watched the series and found that all players work well together. Judges are not always the best choice. There are a few exceptions, such as a lawyer who has become a foodie, but most judges have doubts about whether to deal with what is served. I like watching the clamor of chefs, and the rivals are surprising. The food at the end always looks amazing and sometimes inspires me in the kitchen. Perhaps this is all that anyone can ask for, to truly eat what is served. The only thing that I really would change in the show is to ask people on the show to get a little brighter. Sometimes the mood becomes a bit too tight, and watching it is not always pleasant. I liked the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA), because it was as top-quality as the original, but I can say that it was a fairly expensive proposition. I would like him to stay with this version and be the host - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, which would make me smile for an hour. Until you expect the original Japanese version and you can accept this series on your own, it may turn out to be a nice time.
