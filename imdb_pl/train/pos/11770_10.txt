I was hoping it would be good as James Timothy Dalton's bond fan, and although it was not his well-deserved 'third trip', it was laughter. Belushi brought him some good humor, and Dalton did a good job, but he probably was not used. its part was similar to the camp version of nicholson in a few good men. the other Briton in it was a bit shocking, but exaggerated was the laughter.
