This movie surprised me completely. I watched it 2 or 3 times. I really liked this movie. There are many truths in this video. I also love all characters from this movie. This film makes a lot of sense because the society "becomes more advanced". What is losing culture? Not to sound preaching. I can really refer to this movie from my hood and lose a life that will never come back or have never been the same. This movie is on my top 5 movies I've ever watched. There is such a harsh truth that I feel when I watch a movie and it is not true that one must kick to the right in front of the face. The creators of this film did a great job and I really liked this movie. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you will love it.
