One word can describe this movie and it's weird. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animated film and it was old, so I thought it would be interesting. Well, the movie is about a young boy who travels around the universe to get a metal body to get revenge. Along the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide whether he wants a body or not. Very strange, if you're an animation / science-fiction fan, you can check it out.
