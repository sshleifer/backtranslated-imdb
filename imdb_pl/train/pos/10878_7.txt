Personally, I liked Cutting. It was the first time I saw the theatrical release of an Australian slass. Genre normally limited to mainstream Hollywood films. <br /> <br /> With all the usual comedies and dramas from Australia, I loved being able to see a native horror that was nothing else. I did not even think it was really the trick of other movies. It was a supernatural themed horror, like Nightmare on Elm Street, not Scream, or I know what you did last summer and that's why there was more suspense in disbelief. I think the time has come for the Australian films to try to get more into the mainstream species. <br /> <br /> The cut was original, scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun. I would give it seven to ten and I would not treat it as serious. He did what I expected him to do, play and scare me enough to be satisfying. I liked.
