A scientist working feverishly in isolation finds a way to find a meteor impact crater carrying a new radioactive element. All (pseudo) scientific and groundbreaking technological talks from the thirties are there, including the idea that radioactivity can heal any disease if it is properly used. When he calls his rivals - who threw him out of the scientific community and mocked him - to witness his discovery, they propose a "joint" trip to Africa ... of course, they finish the theft of many dr. The original Rukh discovery, giving him only a residual loan. In addition, the effeminate weakling who looks like a supportive comedian from the worst Abbot and Costello (Lawton) is literally stealing dr. The young trophy of Rukh (Drake), who falls on his head for this piece of human being. Growing horns like deer did not make dr. Rukh (Karloff) is more friendly, so he sets off on a secret revenge mission ... killing 2 of his enemies and a friendly dr. Benet (Lugosi), the only one who helped him ... finally succumbing to lethal rays that allowed him to take revenge at the beginning, but (to my highest dissatisfaction) saving the adulterer and this weak pronunciation for a man being a wife. Acting is mostly good, and Karloff and Lugosi are very good. Check the maid's hysterical scene ... Other characters are not worth mentioning ... Recommended, like ALL old universal horrors ...
