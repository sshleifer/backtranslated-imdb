The advantages of this movie are amazing battle scenes - absolutely amazing demonstrations of sword movements and martial arts. A true masterpiece of John Woo. The story seems to be a bit week-old, but never obscures the overwhelming show of acrobatic martial art. If you like martial arts movies, you love this movie!
