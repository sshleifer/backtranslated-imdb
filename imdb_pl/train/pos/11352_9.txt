This is a fascinating description of the hunt for the first known serial killer of the Soviet Union. I stood up, expecting half a decent television movie, but I was convinced that he was attracted by a convincing way of telling. As others have said, there is a lot to admire here, which unfortunately lacks in many editions on the big screen. <br /> <br /> A significant part of the merit must pass Chris Gerolmo, whose intelligent script and direction attract the viewer, until you can not not feel emotionally involved. The acting of the entire cast is also excellent, especially in the case of two leaders, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their convincing portraits give their characters a lot of credibility, and the scene in which they have their first Perestroika meeting is really moving. <br /> <br /> If you prefer your crime movies with a bit more depth and a little less gloss, I definitely recommend you watch out for "Citizen X". <br /> <br />
