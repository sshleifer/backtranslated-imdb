This is a very strange HK movie in many ways. First of all, many action sequences are really not so much fun. The first battle for the weapon that occurred in the film was simply stupid. Not cool stupid or even funny stupid, but just stupid. It does not mean that there are no big action scenes, but most simply do not reach the level of some of the other movies that I've seen. The opposite side is that this movie really has CHARACTERS, not just people. All the main characters are interesting (except for the bad guy who is flat like a billiard table) and most of them are pretty well preserved. All the characters in this movie are simply fun to watch. The dialogue is quite witty and does not seem to waste much on translating. This movie is worth seeing, but I hope that the uninitiated American audience does not think that this is the best HK it has to offer.
