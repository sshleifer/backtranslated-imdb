I have "Things to Come" on D.V.D. and it is very clear compared to my version of VHS. The sound is just, but sometimes it is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie so much that I was looking for a copy of the book and found it. He gave details of why some things happened. The best things in the movie are small things that I did not notice at first. Just like John Cabal playing with a toy airplane at a Christmas party, as he was a dive bomber, dating the sea power, calling the battleship Dinosuar. Ships submerged by air forces, an undeclared enemy smuggle a plane attack. Swept flying aircraft. Strong rolls for women throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There is more, see the movie to enjoy them.
