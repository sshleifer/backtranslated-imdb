Young beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) marries an elderly man (Zvonimir Rogoza). Unfortunately, she can not satisfy her sexually and ignores her. Frustrated, she goes home and plans a divorce. One day she is skinny in the lake in the middle of the forest. Her horse gallops with her clothes ... and she runs after him! He meets a young and very handsome Adam (Aribert Mog). They love each other and realize that this is the man he wants. <br /> <br /> FINAL SPOILER !!!! Naturally, since he was born in 1933, he must be punished for his sin, which leads to a tragic finale. THE END OF THE FINAL SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> It frightened people in 1933, but according to today's standards is quite tame. Naked swimming Lamarr does not show anything, and when he runs behind the horse completely naked, is either shown in extreme long shots, or is covered with branches and such. There are only a few small shots of her breasts. Also, when he's having sex with Mog, nothing is shown, but her face, but you see that he achieves orgasm. These scenes were considered quite extreme in their time and were completely cut from the American edition. Today they are back. This movie will now be easily available from PG-13. <br /> <br /> The shock segments are just fine. It is beautifully filmed and there is no dialogue. With the exception of the score, it can be a quiet picture. Fortunately, all actors are good - especially Lamarr and Mog and they are so attractive that they are breathtaking. Also the sequence in which they love each other is one of the most beautiful shots and sequences I've ever seen in a movie. Scenes with sexual symbolism (there are many of them) are unfortunately quite obvious today. I started giggling during one! <br /> <br /> So, great direction, beautiful pictures, attractive actors, good acting around - but I was not exactly enchanted by it. I consider the film to be slow moving (beautiful pictures do not make a photo for me), slightly boring, obvious, static and having a negative ending. I can live with the ending, but that does not justify other problems that I had with it. The last sequence is REALLY strange - and not right. So I admire this movie more than anything else. It was well done and I recommend it, but be careful. Many people love this movie, so I'm in the minority. Use your own judgment.
