"SÃ¥ som i himmelen" ... as above, so below ... this special point where Divine and Human meet. I WILL RECEIVE this movie! Gem. YES amazing grace! <br /> <br /> I was so deeply moved by HUMAN QUALITY. I laughed and cried throughout the entire register, and even a few octaves of emotion. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist is BRILLIANT as Daniel, a first-class, passionate performance, charismatic and powerful. His inner light and unique talent pierce through every scene, every interaction, every meeting. I was completely hypnotized, enchanted and absorbed in a story that is our collective history, the story of life itself. <br /> <br /> The film was also so full of many archetypes, a messiah, a wounded child, a magic child, an artist, a teacher, a priest, the perpetrator, a victim, a tyrant, a divine fool - ALL figures so true and faithful to life - all they aroused great sympathy and compassion in me. <br /> <br /> It's a real treat when you can see such a provocative and at the same time very pleasant entertainment film. Oh ... do not forget about the heavenly choir of angels and breathtakingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> THANK YOU FOR ALL - this Swedish film will surely enchant people all over the world. EXCELLENT!
