1985 was a good year for movies - maybe even great - but this lack of gong has come a long way to convince fans that ol 'Oscar is little more than a hood ornament for good party members. <br /> <br /> 11 nominations, not one title: this was the contempt of the Academy for one of their greatest directors; and the one who had to wait another 8 years before any prejudice that prevented him from handing him a statue before he was allowed to give him 7 on the Schindler's List, which is probably not so good (and I'm na wpół polskiej) br /> <br / > Do not get me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And he does not knock "Out of Africa" ​​(who won this year); but in my head there was a class behind it: an epic story of suffering and hope that led me to tears - and I'm not a big scream. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was music (excellent), or cinematography (sumptuous), but most probably just acting: Whoopi, who proved to us all that she is something more than just a comedian; Danny Glover, I've never heard of before; and of course Oprah. <br /> <br /> The rest is history; but at that time: who knew?
