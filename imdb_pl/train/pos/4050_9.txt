Anyone who considers this movie boring is a hopeless fool who should stick to chase films and romantic comedies. This film is riveting and there is no boring moment. Why? Because it consists largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a crisis and describes in detail their efforts to survive this crisis. I repeat - intelligent dialogue! This is what characterizes almost all of Rohmer's films and that's why many people do not like them. They prefer action. Well, let them spend the rest of their life watching action movies while those with taste and discrimination will continue to look for such films. <br /> <br /> Rohmera has always been accused of being "talkative." Well, he is, but it's a compliment to me, not criticism. Shakespeare was also talkative. Is there a better game than "Hamlet"? Whenever the theme or subject of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts of value, it must necessarily be a discussion about these ideas and values, and this is largely about everything. Aristocracy and noble birth and egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends who is put to the final test when this friend takes what we consider the wrong path; the value of human life and responsibility for help in saving this life, even if the person who has this life is not so nice or even wicked. (Has anyone ever heard of Dostoevsky or "Crime and Punishment?") Here's what's going on in this movie. <br /> <br /> Both roles in this movie are impeccable, as if they were born to play these roles. Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as a second language, is especially brilliant. Do yourself a favor and see this riveting movie. It can be the last movie of this Screen Master.
