More directors, such as Nacho Vigalondo, need more opportunities for their talents. 7:35 De la ma√±ana is an absolute genius. What Nacho can do in 8 minutes requires Hollywood movie directors. I looked at it with a smile, but I felt a little dirty and not in a sexual way. You sit and wonder how you feel after seeing this 8 min. nugget. I was entertained, but at the same time I was disturbing. Few people can do it in just 8 minutes. It starts quite simply. A young woman comes to her usual place for breakfast. He sits down and someone starts singing. From there, the film will take you into many different emotions at once, it is difficult to describe. It is in black and white, but it helps in the feeling of the movie. This movie makes you want to know more about heroes, their previous interactions and how the ending influenced their lives. I suppose that, like the old saying "Leave them wanting more," Nacho Vigalondo can do it. Watch it when you can. Show it to your friends and think about how 8 minutes can be fun without taking off your clothes.
