I loved this movie. It was so well done! Great acting and drama and historically accurate. I love Romy Schneider's films. This rock, not as big as Sissi, but still rocks! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, commented and said French dubbing. Well, this is originally a German movie not French. Yes Yes. Second, there was a plot, maybe you do not know the story. And her mother played the role of a governess, not her teacher. And the story was not actually Cinderella, but Queen Victoria, maybe you missed this detail. <br /> <br /> But still ... yes, the story in this film is great, I love historical films, and Queen Victoria is very fascinating! I love all the historical things. Like the guy who tried to manipulate his mother. And when she escaped and met her future husband, he showed her rolling a "new kind of dance". When the rolling was new, they were considered scandalous because the couples are dancing so close. Yes, her governess was like my God! <br /> <br /> And also clothes, I love clothes. The styles are great, the skirts are amazing. And of course, Romy always looks very nice.
