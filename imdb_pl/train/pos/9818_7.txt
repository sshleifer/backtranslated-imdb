Robert Culp (they call his character a "doctor" ... I think he is a vet or something), and the family moves to a prosperous, low-tax, zero legal order. Lanter-jaw Culp and his dog are almost killed when a local idiot from the neighborhood gets drunk and "circulates" through his yard at a speed of 60 miles per hour. He presses accusations that arouse the anger of children, and suddenly he and his family fall victim to a brutal and disturbing campaign of jokes. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Manson, or rather Marlyn Mason, plays his pissed off, cooked-to-be wife, who urges him not to use violence against his scornful nemes, and who really wants to move somewhere with decent public services. But The System gets Culpa nowhere and does not intend to leave his home because of punk children and their crazy rock and roll music. And we all know what people are doing when the System fails ... (but it's based on a real story that makes it even better). <br /> <br /> It should be noted that while villain hooligans do to have funk-o-matic "teenage" thematic music from the 70s that warns us when they are not good, this movie ends with the treatment of age ranges in equally (really!). He does not do a great thing of this generation. Kudos for that. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you like dogs (or at least believe in protecting their civil rights, like me), and you like justice and you like fire, and you like justice for dogs by a fire way, and you think that people who nervously come out of difficult communities are "too damn soft", the ethos of this flick are in your alley. No, this is not really "good", at least not in any commonly recognized sense of the word. There is nothing subtle, understated or smart about it, it's just a kind of PSA with full functionality for vigilance. This, however, captured the feeling of some unforgettable scenes in other, beloved works. Do you remember the Return of Dark Knight Frank Miller when Batman leads the Mutants on a horse to recover Gotham City? Do you remember the scene from A Christmas Story, in which the kid sticks his face in the bully? Do you remember how cool it was? Or maybe you just hate being ridiculously treated by neighbors? Yes, mon. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was a 1973 movie that I just caught at 4am in my local WB branch and it's probably not for the DVD. But after inspiring this movie, do you think that I will just sit down and take it!
