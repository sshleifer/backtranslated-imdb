What I like about you is one of those series that you have to see, but you are not sure if you would see it, the beginning is cool and is addictive in the series just for fun, the second part and the 2-3 season, which are more outdated, come and go in what you want. what happens with many series is that they do not end with something special, because the second part of the series always goes down to the drain, this also to some extent doing so, the third part is the one that spoils and destroys the whole series, usually, but no, the ending is perfect for the series, it fits perfectly, I was actually very angry with all these guys in Val's life, actually I wanted to finish with Jeff finally, but later it changed, they decided to take Vic to the series after almost 3 seasons without him, and it was the biggest surprise, as well as what made the series go up. <br /> <br /> many times I see that the series is really cool, just do not expect that the second part will be so good that it is not, but the third part does what was needed, and it made that the series has become worth the whole, I'm glad that I enjoyed and enjoyed this series and now I will go to see two guys, a girl and a pizzeria, when I see the whole series I will be back ...
