When the film opened in 1976, the legend says that he was met with tremendous derision and contempt - he was widely regarded as a failure. I perfectly remember Ebert giving him one star and allegedly booed at Cannes. <br /> <br /> Apparently these people did not understand the film, which is not difficult to understand because it is very esoteric, dark and layered in a way that still amazes me. Reading many reviews, I found (even after 7-8 reviews over the years) many elements of the film that I reviewed earlier. But even without much understanding of the psychological basis of this story, it's still cracking ... even if you take escalating paranoia and persecution that will overtake the Polanski's protagonist, like a tsunami in his two hours of running. br /> <br /> Exploration of the source material --- perfect novel of the underestimated novelist Roland Topor - discovers more intriguing layers. Trekowskisky Polanski is the milquetoast of the highest rank. Though initially appearing to be the next gentle daily soul, he gradually realizes that he is one of those people who seemingly aim to drift through life, letting him lead him. It seems that he has little strong feelings about his preferences and dislikes. It is believed that it is gently pushed in this way, but it never seems too bent in shape. This vague kind of intent is more apparent in the novel than in the film, but there are also hints at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> A game for a woman's apartment, one Mademouiselle Choule, who recovers from a recent suicide attempt in the hospital, seems to be the most daring thing he has tried (even effectively bargaining for the deposit on occasions). Soon, however, he discovers that he pays for his "good thing" in many ways than he cares about himself because he is in the center of a whirlwind created by a building full of neurotic, controlling freaks who are hypersensitive even to the smallest sign of human life, such like the sound of footsteps at night or a knock at the door. <br /> <br /> Instead of taking a stand, Trelkowski becomes more and more alienated by the situation and overcome with paranoia and a sense of persecution. He is obsessed with Choule, imagining that she is like her, dressing like her, etc., because his own personality is quickly erased by his own madness. <br /> <br /> If anyone ever doubted Pola≈Ñski's fearlessness as an artist, it would be good to see this movie. His characteristic black humor is visible (and sometimes embarrassing) and - God bless him - makes him a butt. This is a tour de force performance in one of the richest, most risky, most gothic horrors in history. The fact that more people have not seen is a real crime.
