Thank you VCD / DVD distributors from Hong Kong that I paid only 1.4 USD and I could enjoy such a surprisingly pleasant pleasure. <br /> <br /> Adultery? As common in our modern times. Eva caught two children and kidnapped Nick to hunt Luis and Charlotte to Italy. He wants revenge, but finally he commits the same crime of Luisa: she had sex with Nick. <br /> <br /> In this small production, indie Vivian Naefe coped with the initial problems in today's marriage with a light heart. How can you dare to treat your marriage seriously during this time of fast-food, in which people now have greater mobility in the physical, mental and technological areas? A marriage obligation requires too high a price that most people would decide to submit to the circumstances. Nick once trusted Charlotte, but Eva fell on him after this kidnapping trip that forced him to grow significantly. <br /> <br /> Most viewers may be satisfied with the ending, because Eva and Nick meet, this should be the biggest payment for the unfaithful act of their spouses. However, I want a sequel, I want to see how these four will develop after this exchange. Perhaps they can exchange back, how you can be sure about a shaky love relationship. <br /> <br /> Good game and good scenery. Two small actors should not be neglected, especially the boy, when he cries at the hotel reception in Venice. And of course, how can we forget about the scenery of the city "bella, bella".
