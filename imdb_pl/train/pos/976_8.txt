Takashi Miike's entry into children's territory won me almost immediately, because he demonstrates courage and courage in dealing with fantasy elements. It's a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Already as a child, I thought that in most fairy tales there is something ominous; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic stories are a bit more frightening (and more disturbing) than what they seem at first glance. The director takes the archetypal story of a child on a wonderful trip from kindergarten. He emphasizes the real fears of a world filled with endless dangerous missions. Westerners like to belittle the importance of bedtime stories written especially for children. I appreciate the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He approaches neck history, but also shows signs of restraint. But composed Miike is even stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a great movie. Highly recommended.
