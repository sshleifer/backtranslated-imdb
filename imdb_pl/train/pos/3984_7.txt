As part of the celebration of the premiere, Casino Royale was shown a film with a new Bond directed by Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost turned it off because I was a bit boring, but I'm glad I got stuck with it. In fact, May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones), who almost does not see anyone and has no boyfriend for years. Her daughter says she could get married with her new boyfriend, Darren (of course, Daniel Craig). After knowing each other for only a few days, May and Darren have a secret affair. And her age, with a 30-year-old and a new Bond ?! In any case, they want to keep it secret, of course, but May regrets and wonders if Helen will find out. When he does, Darren becomes less embarrassing than May. In fact, Helen asks her for permission to strike. The stars starred as Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell as Rosie and Johnny English Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very good!
