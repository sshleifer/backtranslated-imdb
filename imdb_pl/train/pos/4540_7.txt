This movie is Jay Leno as a Detroit policeman, Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo police officer sent to Detroit to recover the stolen prototype of a car engine. A Japanese man went to Detroit in the hope that he would sell it to another car company run by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately, for him, the people who were to negotiate the contract, killed him and took the prototype. Furious Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras, who led the men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has nothing of this and threatens Jarryd that he is forcing him to continue cooperation. Meanwhile, in the same yard where the Japanese was killed, the same man also killed friend Tony Costas. Tony's friend was watching the scrap yard. <br /> <br /> Tony sets out to search for the killer despite the orders of the superior. Tony is on a robbery, while of course the murder should investigate. While Tony investigates the crime, he encounters a Japanese policeman and misjudges him. Ultimately, they work together on the matter. They make an odd pair and are really fun parts, as well as some funny scenes, such as Pat Morita jumping and kicking through the windshield of a moving car and kicking Madras in the head. But in the end it's a nice buddy movie, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he is nice in this role, and Pat Morita is also good. Still, they form one of the most unlikely cop duets in the action movie. If you liked the movies of a friend buddy, bad movies from the 80s or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor, then I recommend this movie.
