This story is a bit stiff, with the sudden reversals of the main character's fortune, but portraits of Philip Carey, the lover of the naive Leslie Howard and Bette Davis, the naive lover and Mildred Rogers, unworthy of his feelings, raise this film well above the standard melodrama. <br /> <br /> A sensitive, cultured Filip, who is captivated for the first time for the first time, and then his compassion for Mildred is no different than the character that Howard was supposed to play a few years later - Ashley Wilkes, South gentleman he is too sophisticated and decent to lead him in the difficult era of reconstruction. Indeed, Philip seems reluctant to give up even before Mildred steps on the stage? He does not even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him that he will never become a painter. Perhaps this passivity, these lowered expectations, make him tolerate Cockney's selfish waitress for as long as he does. <br /> <br /> Although Leslie Howard is memorable, today's "Of Human Bondage" is mainly conceived as a picture of Bette Davis, perhaps due to the well-known story of how she had to fight Jack Warner to win the role of Mildred and maybe because film audiences prefer characters with its kind of energy. Mildred may have a biting voice, but he also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel, making it somewhat understandable why Philip let himself float as long as he did. Although a man eating Mildred may sometimes seem one-dimensional, from time to time he arouses sympathy for the viewer, as when he is ill and delays he realizes that Philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her. One can also think that he has something to say when he accuses Philip of looking at her in advance that he is not "good enough". (The scene in which Philip and Norah reject romance magazines as trash for kitchen maids seems to confirm this). <br /> <br /> Most secondary characters are also effective, especially Norah, a sensible love writer who loves Philip, but she knows she can never compete with Mildred and Sally, who has Mildred's beauty and Norah's propriety, and it turns out that deserved woman, in the end Filip, is rewarded. The only character I found was the eccentric, but slurping, aristocratic father Sally, who seems to be a character from the old era. <br /> <br /> A classic that deserves a reputation.
