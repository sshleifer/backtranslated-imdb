When you are in a gloomy or depressed mood, watch this movie. It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday environment and is very encouraging, especially from a feminist and humanistic perspective. <br /> <br /> When you know both Turkish and Danish or in German, watch the video in each case. Half of the dialog box is Danish in the original, synchronized with the German in the translated version, the other half Turkish, with subtitles in Danish or German respectively. When I saw him in Mannheim, Germany, the reaction of the Turkish-speaking public proved that there must be a lot of humor in Turkish dialogue, which, for most mourning, escaped me, being imperfect only in the subtitles. Even so, the movie is interesting, even if you lack the knowledge of the Turkish language. <br /> <br /> From an aesthetic point of view, the movie plays a lot about speed and slowness. At first glance, there is a lot of bodily movements like lightning, which makes it a fast, rough movie. In particular, although it's a Kung Fu movie, watch out for running scenes that beautifully express the richness of emotions. But there are also some very slow, emotionally intense scenes. First of all, characters are developing at a much slower pace than one could expect in the drama of maturation; there is still a certain movement in the characters to: Carefully observe the villain Omar, whose part and action I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> The contrast of speed and stillness nicely contributes to the presentation of human rage and dignity - displayed simultaneously, in the same signs, at the same time.
