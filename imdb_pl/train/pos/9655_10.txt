Maybe "Presque Rien" is not the best movie ever made ... But it's better than many of you said. I still have not seen a homo movie better than this one. <br /> <br /> You Americans are used to watching very narrative films with a clear beginning, development and result. But European films are less narrative, but they make you think a lot and feel. <br /> <br /> Many of you did not understand the meaning of the movie. The aim of this film is not to show us a simple "summer" loving movie ", with commercial characters who" fall in love and live happy forever ". Summer Holidays and the beach are just a background, and this movie is aimed at every young boy who can feel identified with these boys. <br /> <br /> Maybe some of you did not understand this film well, because of its 3 parts, shown as flashbacks. These 3 moments are: - Summer in Pornichet, when they meet and love. - After a year and a half of life together in Nantes, Mathieu does not go to a psychiatrist. He's trying to commit suicide, and Cedric takes him to the hospital. Later, he talks to a psychiatrist to find the reason he did it. - The last part is the moment in which Mathieu returns to Pornichet in the winter, alone ... to think about how his life has changed, how his life happened and trying to find himself. <br /> <br /> It is possible that some people can not understand all of this well because all the scenes are mixed together. But in any case, as I said before ... this is not a funny movie. If what someone wants to see is meat, we have Belami movies. <br /> <br /> Presque Rien, what he wants to show us is how cruel life can be, for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and I do not know what to do in life. Mathieu just wants to leave the house and try to live a life that he thought he could bring him happiness ... But what seemed perfect at first ... later is not as good as it seemed to him, and he started to worry, and feel that he has lost the way of his life. He is lost and does not know what he really wants to do or what makes him happy. In the end he got depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So funny? This is not a funny movie. Very hot scenes? just a few .. but this is not a movie for entertainment. Is it about feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like many others, feel identified with the life and problems of Mathieu, and that's what the director wanted to do ... a film that shows us the cruel reality of the boy's life. <br /> <br /> For me, the best homo movie.
