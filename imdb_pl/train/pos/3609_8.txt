I went to Wal-Mart and found this movie on DVD and had no idea if I made a bad purchase or a good one. This is the later result of watching the whole movie from beginning to end. Michelle Rodriquez, (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne", "05", gave a great performance, and her appearance is beautiful, sexy, and at the same time a real learning about the art of acting. Diana did not like her family life, especially her own father for the abuse he gave his mother. He decides to do boxing training at a local gym in Brooklyn and is not so well accepted by male boxers. In her high school there is a lot of friction between her friends and classmates. In the women's bathroom there is a lot of action and references to private parts of the boys. If you like to box and see a hot sexy gala that does wonders in the ring and knock down the boys for their knowledge, this is a movie for you.
