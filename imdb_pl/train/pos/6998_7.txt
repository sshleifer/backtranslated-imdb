Entering the Seven Pounds, I was not quite sure what to think, because the announcements left much to understand what the film really is about. So in the first 20 minutes you're completely lost in the story, you have no idea what's going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. All this ends when the "turn", so to speak, is unraveled in the last minute of the movie. Basically, Tim (or the blacksmith) was worried and haunted by the big accident that caused the end of seven people's lives. In this way, he decides to embrace seven new people who need help very much, and he in turn gives his life. <br /> <br /> Acting in this movie is great because I feel that there will be a blacksmith no matter what part seems to be impressive. Rosario Dawson, for me, this is one of her better movies, except for the eagle I think about. She was in a bad mood, but delivers a movie. Other actors like Woody Harrelson have very small roles and are not big enough to capture the character. Although the cast of the film was still good. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely not what I expected and certainly a much slower pace in which I hoped. However, the film was still quite good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 minutes of the film and everything goes on the spot. Until then, it seems to be a senseless love story. The final thought is seven pounds = seven stars.
