I must say that although I despise this kind of shows, shocking terror, I'm a girl, I feel I have to express my opinion. I saw Dirty Sanchez before I saw Jackass and I think it's Jackass's over in terms of programming. The fictional lines and interviews are combined to create an interesting spectacle. One night I saw a few minutes of Jackass's film and I could not believe how bad it was, everything just joked about jokes with no relation between anything. It must have been the fastest, easiest to edit program, shockingly amateur. While drinking vomiting is not really my business when it comes to a substantial entertainment program, Dirty Sanchez emerges from the Jackass league.
