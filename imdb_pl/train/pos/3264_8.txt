What a loss, the director Emile Ardolino passed! He could have taken a light script and, with the right cast and editing, put a flash in it and make it glow like a star. This particular star may not be the brightest in the sky when wonderful romances are going, but it is certainly the one that keeps you to the end. You really want to know how things will go. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect for Cybill Shepherd, who at that time had to use her success "Moonlighting" for the new generation, which was (fortunately for her) probably unaware of how many big screen Misfits had a very promising beginning. In this film, he returns to form as a still living widow, living vicariously through his daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson at the top of fame, which two years later will reach the top of "Fried green tomatoes"). She could look too young for this role, but it works well in the way history unfolds. This is her film, but she does not exceed her limits as a guide. <br /> <br /> SHepherd kindly lets Robert Downey Jr. wear a large part of the movie and show more mature comic talent than in your previous movies to this point. And there's a lot of support from Ryan O'Neal (in his best role for years) and Christopher MacDonald. Masterson's natural charm is itself a coast, or it has a way to make her look like a breath of fresh air with every word. <br /> <br /> Ardolino makes good use of his cast sex as it is in the case of "Dirty Dancing", but this movie is not so sizzling that you can still watch it with your parents if they were in the room. (Try to get the best judgment, that's what your parents are.) I gave this film a high rating because it is very user-friendly, romantic comedians consider it sublime, and those who only watch it should find a lot of humor too enjoys. <br /> <br /> Again, the merit of Emil Ardolino for using the charming scenario by Randy and Perry Howze. (Where are they now?) Ardolino's next movie would be the sequel to "Three Men and A Baby", but his latest cinema premiere (Sister Act) finally gave him a nine-dimensional hit he deserved. Mr Ardolino, your film touch is missing!
