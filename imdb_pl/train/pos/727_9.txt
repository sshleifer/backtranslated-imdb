One of the best rock'n'roll movies, if not the best. And not just mindless fun. There were many clever jokes in it. Of course I love Ramones. But with all the "anarchy" and the motives "I hate high school" the film does not take too seriously, which is great. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie for the first time in the spring of 1980 and saw it recently. Since I went to high school in the late seventies, I felt nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is not taken so seriously and is not pretentious like many other teenagers' fees from the seventies, eighties and nineties. And not to mention this, it is not really dirty or disgusting. Only PG rating. This is a rarity in the case of a film in this category. A great cult classic and a truly amazing time capsule.
