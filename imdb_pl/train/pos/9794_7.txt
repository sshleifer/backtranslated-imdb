I thought that the film could be a bit more complex, perhaps in a psychological sense, but the action and voice were at the highest level. Animation was hard in many scenes, but very good. This is one of the Batman Returns / Forever movies that includes Wayne's romance and conflicts and dating motifs. Fans of 007 will love, like women, a great theme song! Wayne was very well portrayed in this movie, and Penquin returned to his true form, this time without a mutation! I liked the fact that Robin was not much used, Tim Drake was just a good computer nerd, a bit indigo or the mind of the future. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast consisted of telenovela stars, decent talents and characters were designed to look like actors. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this movie. <br /> <br /> I rate this below Phantasm, Return of the Joker and Batman vs. Dracula, but I liked the more intelligent script than Subzero. 7/10
