To stop her homosexual friend Albert (Perry King) from deportation to Belgium, Stella (Meg Foster) decides to marry him. The only other problem is that Stella herself is a lesbian. They both have a separate life when one night after Albert's birthday party, they fall into bed and then fall in love. Later in the film after falling in love, Stella suspects Albert of fraud and comes to him one night late after closing. What he finds will leave the viewer dazed. It's a great movie, very original. Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in their roles that it's amazing that they were not better recognized because of their work here. Very controversial after the release in 1978, the film "R" is now "PG" in a much more liberal time. <br /> <br /> The recently released DVD contains a segment of "Making Of" special features that state that the movie is based on a true story, so viewers who say the movie is not "real" are confused . Everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons - these are the issues raised in this great movie for anyone who has ever loved!
