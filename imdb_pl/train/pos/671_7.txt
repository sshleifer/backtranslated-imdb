I remember seeing it when it was released, at the theater in Palo Alto, and I did not expect much. I mean - an Australian movie? But finally it reached me. Here is the scene. Richard Chamberlain sits cross-legged on the floor of a dingy apartment in Sidney, opposite an Australian elderly Aboriginal named Charlie. <br /> <br /> Chamberlain: "You were at my house yesterday. You scared my wife. you? "And Charlie says:" Who are you? "Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you ... Are you a fish? Are you a snake? Are you a man? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? This is a stunning scene, shot close up, with the gentle handsome face of Chamberlain filling the screen in opposition to the black, bearded face of Charlie. <br /> <br /> The two guys could not be more different and this movie is a story about how Chamberlain accidentally stumbles with his of ancient legal existence in the inexplicable, almost unspeakable, secrets of the Charlie world. <br /> <br /> I do not think I would continue much about the story, it's kind of an apocalyptic story, but I must say that whoever conducted the research on Australian aboriginal belief systems, should get a plus. Everything here is, from bones to sleep, a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real. Extremely frightening film without any musical stings or great special effects. Charly's world is just beginning to enter Chamberlain's dreams, for reasons that have never been completely clear. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the script, this is it. Nothing is ever completely clear. Does Chamberlain, who seems to have an extraordinary relationship with the natives, die in the last wave? Are Aborigines? Is that all Sidney? The basic premise is also difficult to accept, although it has been admitted that it is a fantasy. Aborigines are equipped with the kind of spiritual power that Americans give to American Indians, while mythology is mythology and although one can be more complex or satisfying - more elegant and beautiful, if you like - mythology is still trying to exceed the usual, demanding, and sometimes disappointing physical existence. Charlie's mysticism is more convincing that the miracles of Moses in Cecil B. DeMille's "Ten Commandments" are brothers under the skin. <br /> <br /> But I do not care. Made as a film, this one is pretty good and it is especially important to mark the director's fame, Peter Weir and the Australian film industry. It was the first of a great wave of movies from the antipodes, some of them noisy, like "Mad Max", and some of them subtle and dramatic, like "Lantana". I like Weir's things that remind you that Nicholas Roeg is pregnant with subliminal anxiety. Try "Picnic under the hanging rock" to see how to make a really chilling movie without a drop of blood.
