I really like this movie because in Australia such Chinese films are never shown at the time of the highest viewing. I must say that this is one of the best serious films in history that outlines the difference between people from Hong Kong and mainland China. It really shows that there is discomfort between them, but it can be better when HK learns Mandarin. He also showed me how the indie rock scene exists in mainland China, and the Chinese know how to strum the guitar and make the house amuse! Whoever said that China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely wonderful, with his clear and crisp voice, honest action and a total magic chick. I recommend this movie to those who do not know much about Asian people, to cleanse themselves of typical Western stereotypes, and people who just love Chinese / Asian cinema, such as myself. Check it out!
