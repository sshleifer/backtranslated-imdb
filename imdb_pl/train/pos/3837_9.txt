In the 1940s, when films addressed issues that were still unacceptable in a "polite" society, they resorted to codes that allegedly floated over the heads of most recipients, while alerting believers to what was happening. Probably no film from this decade was such a poignant insinuation as the strangely vague Desert Fury, set in a small oasis of gambling called Chuckawalla somewhere in the California desert. The owner of the Purple Sage saloon and casino is the amazing Mary Astor in trousers and cigarette holders; only a handful of daughters ride to town, Lizabeth Scott, looking at Technicolor like 20 million dollars. But listen to the dialogue between them, which suggests an older Lesbian and her young, restless companion (you can only wonder if the original scenario of A.I. Bezzeridesa made this relationship clear). Even more glaring is John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his insanely jealous torpedo. Add Burt Lancaster as a city sheriff, stir and sit comfortably. Both Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak belong to Scott. It seems, however, that Hodiak not only has a past with Astor, but has a wife who died in suspicious circumstances. The desert sun heats these ingredients up to a sharp boil, with numerous blows to the face and blurred exchanges. Do not miss this greenhouse melodrama, full of frighteningly exotic flowers, if you succeed; it's an amazing movie.
