This is a private campsite in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which has existed since 1959. My grandparents were among its founders, my parents had a side since 1965, and my two brothers already have sides. <br /> <br /> (This has nothing to do with the movie, do it with me.) <br /> <br /> I spent years at Blueberry Hill when I was five when I was eighteen and that's for people like me to whom this film speaks: those for whom the group camp in the woods was, as my fiancée says, "a good and happy place". If you have never experienced a lifestyle, Indian Summer will probably die; do not worry. It is not fast, there are no quick cuts, the plot is not the least complicated, there are no explosions, the dramatic tension that exists is mild, there are no actors on the list, there are no quick gluttony just to show how clever writers (beyond, perhaps, the deadly line of Kimberley Williams about how her fiancée should not "cut his toys." more than The Godfather is a slasher flick just because he has a lot of gore on the screen. <br /> <br /> But Indian Summer is the polar opposite of the Godfather, if you've experienced a lifestyle, see this movie. Read more, just do it. <br /> <br /> For me it's a 9/10 movie.
