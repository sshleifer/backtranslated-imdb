As a great Prince of the last three to four years, I really can not believe that I have just seen "Purple Rain". The brand new 2-disc Special Edition anniversary led me to purchase. Wow, I really could not wait to see him, but I was not prepared for how electric it really was. Prince's musical performances throughout the film are amazing - REALLY he has moves in this movie. I'm very familiar (from repeated listening) with the classic album "Purple Rain" and all of his songs, but seeing them in the context of the movie completely changes your perception of melodies and lyrics - like COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES, WHEN THE CRY AND PURPLE WILL FACE RAIN. There is something indescribably mesmerizing in the scenes in which Prince and The Revolution perform. The final tracks of BABY I'M A STAR and I WOULD DIE FOR U show how much energy and talent Prince had in his mid-20s (he spills over!), It disappeared. It even makes Michael Jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years. <br /> <br /> The prince shows how to win a girl from your dreams - drive her to the lake, jump in and then drive away - absolutely funny things in retrospect. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are very 80's and involuntarily fun, but it adds to the overall charm of the movie. Morris Day is the coolest cat in the block (and hilarious), and when his band The Time performs THE BIRD, you can see Morris Day and Jerome Benton, which illuminates the Minneapolis funk style - I love their dance in this style and how Benton provides Morris with average performance in mirror. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to watch it again, I really can not! The extras are great - especially watching young Eddie Murphy in front of Beverly Hills Cop, he admits he is the "Prince Group".
