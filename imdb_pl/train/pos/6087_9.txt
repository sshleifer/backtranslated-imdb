I saw this movie in the first few weeks it ended (I do not remember exactly when.) I thought it was fine, for the movie Ben Stiller. This movie is not for a person without a sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's jokes, you have to think about them. Or as I said, you have a sense of humor. I have seen from a few people on this site that people did not have anything good to say about it and did not get a very good grade, but I would give it a bigger one. good and should have been better rated. Maybe this is not a movie for you. I only give you the opinion of another person.
