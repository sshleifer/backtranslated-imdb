I thought that this movie was wonderfully crossed out, which made me confused and my cousin who watched him with me. To tell the truth, I think that the younger kevin dillon was hot. the policeman and that was bad, what he told her before he died, "I was in you." I think that's what she gets for what she did to him and how he will tell her that he is too young, when he never cared how many years he had other girls. I do not think I could ever trust such a cop. But, to be honest, it was pretty obvious that it was him, even if he wanted to be a cop, I would still be suspicious anyway. and it was funny when she splashed it in the shop. hahahahaha. she was still stupid to go back to the warehouse, just like the cop who died HELLO !! this is called back-up. Sometimes these movies drive me crazy when people act stupid and do stupid things. But I think about the movie.
