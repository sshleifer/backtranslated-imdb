I'm not a big fan of Tim Mathew, but I have to admit that I liked the movie. It was dark and a little disturbing in some nervous scenes, I do not know whether to classify this movie as a bit of SF and some horror slash thriller. I saw it around 2.00 in the morning on my local channel. There was nothing else, so I decided to watch it. If you have not seen this movie, I recommend it not so bad, the characters are interesting enough, but I did not really discover their full potential, which could make the movie even better. I do not know if this movie went to the cinema, but it seemed that it was made for TV or went straight to the video, and I would buy it if it is on DVD, it fits my film well and has a small part of the X-FILES story attached to him. Government enterprises or variable corporations involved in suspicious dark interests. Generally a good movie.
