Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as a TV hostess of nighttime horror movies, and when the character turned out to be unexpectedly popular, she suddenly started doing everything from beer ads to spots in The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. It gained its popularity at the end of the 80s, and the result was the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK. <br /> <br /> The plot is hard. Elvira, the TV horror host, dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her great aunt dies, she leaves for New England in the hope that the estate will provide enough money to lead the stage show; she is disappointed that she inherited a destroyed house, a poodle and an old book. It happens that the city is puritanically beyond description and provokes just indignation everywhere it goes. It also happens that her great uncle is a secretly evil wizard and she really wants to put her hands on the "old book". Put a few teens, a bun to the stud, and a hateful woman with fakes. But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates an enormous talent from start to finish: squirmy, sexy and mixing low-level humor with flashes of acute comedy, dancing in a movie like a ringmaster in a circus of coarse, often joking jokes. From the FLASHDANCE crash to spell madness, it's never less than fun. This is a huge amount of fun, and the conclusion of the film even generates considerable tension. Will Elvira get her evil uncle and save the day? Well, I do not want to reveal anything, so let's say you'll have a lot of fun discovering. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVD is fine, and the bonus material is small, but if you want something stupid, this one will definitely answer that need. And if you've never seen tassle-twirling, feel like a treat. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
