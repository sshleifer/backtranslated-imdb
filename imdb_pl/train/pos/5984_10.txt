This is a great movie if you watch it in the right context - it was supposed to be a parody of movies about horror-teenagers-devils (and the 80's saw them a lot)! I saw the movie when it first appeared, and I liked it right away. Being a big fan of KISS, it was great to see Gene in the movie. And everything from OZZY as a hatred metal preacher can not be bad! Fastway was already my favorite, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The original VHS cover (it was a pre-DVD) for Trick Or Treat contained an illustration of kneeling Sammi, playing the guitar in the ring of fire with the "demon" watching. It was a special order, and the price of a VHS copy at that time (around 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted this movie, but not at this funny price. The cover OZZY-Gene was created only for the reissue of 5 $. The launching company probably assumed that Gene and OZZY were the only recognizable people in the film, so they had better put them on the cover! The same with the original "Little Shop Of Horrors" - Jack Nicholson was in it for five minutes, but now they have it on the cover, as if he was the main star. <br /> <br /> I have a website "Trick Or Treat" and surprising how many people believe that Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway helped to capture this myth by sacrificing his album with the soundtrack "Sammi Curr". <br /> <br /> All in all, it was just a good time, a rock-n-roll movie. You definitely should not be taken too seriously, but you just liked it!
