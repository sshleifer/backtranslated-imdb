Neil Simon's Sunshine Boys with Walter Matthau and George Burns is a funny comedy about a strange relationship with life and its shortness, but laughter always bitter. Seeing Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns), two great comedians who are now limited to the foolishness of hard and persistent old age, you can feel only anger and blue. Willy never gives up and stops working while Al is tired of players and is retired in the country at his daughter's home. The couple in the old days was really funny and harmonious, but on the stage there was a quarrel and an argument, and for eleven years they did not talk to each other after their breakup. Now, if they work, they must come back together once again to make one of their best old sketches for the comedy series. Meetings are explosive and liberating for old questions. Neil Simon's script gives the spirit of a certain corrosive tale, and melancholy and blue overwhelming many gags and laughter managed to generate a good mix also thanks to the wonderful pair Walter Matthu (Nomination Academy Award as Best Actor) and George Burns Oscar in the category of the best supporting actor). Both actors are very credible and true, and their harmony seems almost like they really work together all this time and the property they do not have among themselves. The film is also very touching for its absorbing reality, because history is a story, and the report "Love-warmth", which connects the two actors, is completely real to strange but also simply understandable things in life. My rate is 7.
