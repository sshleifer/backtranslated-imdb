I do not agree with the previous comment about this video. I think it was cute and fun, and it was good news for young girls like my daughter. You do not have to dress like a cheap slut to be cool. You can be smart, cute and elegant at the same time. <br /> <br /> I think the cast was good and the story was good for the target group. All in all, my wife, daughter (10 years old) and I thought it was a good movie. I certainly recommend it. It also encouraged my daughter to read the original secrets of Nancy Drew, which I am sure will love as much as I loved the Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> It was a difficult attempt to sleep her today because she wanted to start reading right away. I can not think of a better result for this film than to resume interest in this classic series.
