Without being one of my favorites, it's good for changing the pace ... even if only for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a great fight between Tom, Jerry and Spike (who is changed here to "Butch." Everyone is fighting each other, but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision: stop the fight and It suggests that everyone should be friends, so everyone signs a peace treaty and they become friends ... which will not last long. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the three of them become cordial, patient and kind. when one of them is threatened with life, the relationship is perfect until a very large steak appears and everyone is greedy. The three are guilty of returning to ordinary fights and rivalry. <br /> <br /> But still ... see Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is really great and grateful experience, even if only for a moment. <br /> <br /> And by the way, as a strange fact, two songs from "The Wizard of Oz" are played here in inst the rational versions: "We are on the spot to see the wizard" and "Somewhere above the rainbow."
