I nominate it and BABYLON 5 as the best television science-fiction series. Both stand out in my head because, unlike the early STAR TREK series, there is a continuous evolution of threads and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG, these were good programs, but there was no general motif or plot that would connect all episodes. In many respects, you can usually watch programs completely out of the sequence without difficulty understanding what is happening. This was not the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its gigantic battles that took the entire last season) and other TREK shows, because there was a larger part of the story that united them. This coherence seems to develop as a concept in BABYLON 5 and we have seen it even more in the case of SG-1. The bottom line is that in many respects this series was like watching a family or a long novel is slowly taking shape. Sure, there were several "one-off" episodes that were not related to the rest, but they were very few and were usually quite fun. <br /> <br /> And talking about fun, I loved SG -1, kept the mood light from time to time and it was not so terribly serious. That's how I really liked it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love for Homer Simpson - it's really a pity that he slowly disappears from the series in later seasons. <br /> <br /> To really appreciate SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intriguing the plot works. This consistency gives the exhibition exceptional durability. And if you do not like the SG-1 after granting him a fair chance, then sci-fi is probably NOT a genre for you.
