"Mother" is about a widowed mother of two adult children (Reid) who, after her husband's death, wakes up from sleep in a dream when she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also a married daughter's lover. The film is about a quiet passive mother, her poor relationship with her adult son and daughter, quiet needs, which she tries to calm down in bed with a young lover, and about the resulting convulsions. In a somewhat antiseptic drama with psychodramatic overtones, "Matka" copes perfectly with uncomfortable problems realistically, while avoiding unreasonable sensations. It will play best with a more mature audience, perhaps women who can better get into the central character, its needs and problems. (B +)
