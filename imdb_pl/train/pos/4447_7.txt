Barbara Stanwyck gives this early work of Douglas Sirk, produced by Universal soap, just the kick he needs. Not as memorable as Sirk's later melodramas, it's easy to see them watching "All I Desire", where Sirk is heading artistically over the next few years. Stanwyck is a dancer who returns to her family in a small town, USA, after leaving it ten years earlier. Her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking back. Some of the photos are amazing, and Stanwyck is hard as nails and really gives the film a boost of energy. Generally quite good performance.
