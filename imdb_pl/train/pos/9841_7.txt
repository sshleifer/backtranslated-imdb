I love fairy tales. They can show things that films with "real" actors and sceneries can not - although computer effects are changing more and more. They can push the borders of satire ("The Simpsons"), good taste ("South Park"), play ("Aladdin") or reality ("Toy Story"). There are some good examples of this in the Ice Age, for example, when we see a motley flock of extinct mammals migrating through the countryside, talking like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch, because we also feel familiarity and strangeness, usually in a way that makes us laugh. The ice age is not as good as the best animated films of all time, but it is a really funny movie. Sit comfortably, enjoy deliberate anachronisms, a charming background and belly laughter. <br /> <br /> This story follows Manfred, a grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiotic sloth and Diego, stroking a tiger, when they take a human child back to their tribe - for very different reasons. There are of course many problems along the way. During the journey there is also a Scrat, an unlucky rodent who desperately tries to bury the acorn for the winter: in glaciers, on dead trees, in ice caves. His initial scene is classical. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a medium that is just a series of funny incidents with a few moments of character building, but some scenes, such as changing diapers or dodos, are fun, the animals are nice and look good . There is also one touching moment when the mammoth cave paintings come alive in front of Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> You do not have to do it, but it's good to have fun. <br /> <br /> 7/10
