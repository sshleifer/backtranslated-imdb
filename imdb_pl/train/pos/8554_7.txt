Wow, that was another good spin in the original American cake, not as good as in the camp, but definitely better on the naked mile. Dwight and Erik stifler lead a comedy in it, but I really preferred dialogue in this one of my naked miles. The script was written much better, and the comedy was flowing smoother, but most of the comedy came from sex, but that's good because we're watching the movies anyway, right? <br /> <br /> Dwarf Rock also had a really good episode, taking into account the intense effort that gave him a naked kilometer, his suppressed scene was amazing and made me laugh when I saw it. /> <br /> In my opinion, the movie was a definite improvement compared to the naked mile, if you liked previous American Pie films, you should like the beta version, unless you watch all the American spin-offs, which are a waste of money.
