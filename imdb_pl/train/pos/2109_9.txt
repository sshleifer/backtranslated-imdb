I realized this a few times because I came to the conclusion that this is a stupid, worn-out, outdated romantic comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy and maybe a bit outdated. However, it is not overly sentimental, moving, as on topics related to office politics, adultery and loneliness. You think that you know exactly where they are going, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turns out as you expected. But there is enough wit and charm to touch the most unbearable cynic. If you meet someone who does not like this movie, seriously think about how you want to get to know him.
