I dug out a few old musicals from the garage and this is another of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli. He won two Academy Awards for the best film from 1951 and the best screenplay. The story of an American painter in Paris who is trying to make him great. Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of resources and is very interested in helping, but soon discovers that she loves this guy. Meanwhile, Gene Kelly falls in love with a beautiful lady, Leslie Caron. His main partner to dance and I must say that they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise. The famous French singer Georges Guietara also sings. So if you like good, smooth dances and full of fun scenes of Oscar Levant's nimble piano fingers, George Gershwyn's songs will live forever in this colorful jewel. 8/10
