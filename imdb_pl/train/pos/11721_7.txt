Magnetism radiated from Elvira, attracting legions of dedicated devotees, has the original quality. Thanks to the long, well-toned figure, large bust, innocent malicious attitude and the reckless slang of the generation in the valley, the character of Elvira has universal and timeless charm. As an aspiring folklorist and a person deeply interested in the structure of the story, it is evident that the personality of Elvira has some archetypal elements that help make the character more than the sum of its old-fashioned and large boxes. Starting from the way children react to her, she represents a deep, youthful fantasy for an experienced woman who can connect with them on her own level: a strange mix of one-dimensional romantic longing, boyish sexual desire and a desire for carefree fun. It symbolizes the undeveloped ideal of femininity perfected for boys and a source of strength for girls in the city. Other adults have problems with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film can not move, passing more camp components. The end result is that although Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak her talent presentation is. Almost everything is adapted to the way of thinking of teenagers, and although it is a simple comedy, only those who are still able to process information in the mind of a young man will be able to enjoy nonsense. Fortunately, I have such a skill and considered the film as a delightful conjurer. <br /> <br /> Best quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I did not have any complaints.
