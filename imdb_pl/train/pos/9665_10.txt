Bette Midler is indescribable at this concert. She gives her everything every time she is on stage. Regardless of whether we laugh at her jokes and tomfoolery, or dust off her eyes because of the tensions of one of her amazing ballads, Bette Midler moves the audience. If you can not see him live (which is the best way to see Bette), this is the next best thing. The interesting thing is how amazing her voice has changed and matured over the years, but he has never lost his power. Her more "correct vocal" version of "Stay With Me" never loses anything in the spirit of ROSE or GOD'S MISSION. Here it is simply cleaner and as honest as ever. I will value this concert for a very long time.
