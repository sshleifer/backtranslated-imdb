I do not know anything about baseball, I'm not even a fan of the sport, but that did not stop me from enjoying the latest Farrelly brothers Fever Pitch, a charmingly irresistible romantic comedy. The movie is not really about baseball; it's more about relationships and emotional discrepancies that can often take place. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fallen ?? giving the best results so far? he plays Ben, a lightweight, reckless teacher. Ben is a kind of boy-boy who, unfortunately, never grew up and supports an almost fanatic addiction to the Red Sox baseball team. Ben sacrificed his life to Sox and does everything from pilgrimage to Florida for spring training, to decorating every centimeter of his flat in team accessories. <br /> <br /> One day, taking part in his geometry class on a trip to his office, Ben meets with a stunning Lindsey (a wonderful Drew Barrymore). Lindsey is a career-oriented career-oriented girl, but she has something that Ben is endearing. At first he hesitated to ask her, thinking he was leaving his "class", and Lindsey did not see her potential partner in Ben immediately. <br /> <br /> Their first date starts catastrophically. when Lindsey is affected by a severe case of food poisoning? and her resonant reflex gives the first hint that we're actually watching the Farrelly brothers' movie. Instead of accepting - rather urgent - Lindsey's request to change the date, Ben sticks to play the nurse, paramedic and janitor. So Ben scrubs the dog's toilet and teeth while his love interest disappears with a bucket next to her bed. <br /> <br /> When Lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him sleeping on the couch, he begins a long, passionate process of dismantling the network of anxiety and ambition that she thought of as her standards. They fall in love soon, and Lindsey blithely accepts Ben's fanatical attachment to his sport. <br /> <br /> After inheriting selected seasonal tickets from his beloved uncle, Ben organized his life this season? he never left the match. But their relationship, which developed unhindered throughout the winter, hits at the beginning of the season. <br /> <br /> Lindsey wants Ben to do other things, like vacationing with his parents and partying with friends, but Ben is starting to have trouble modulating his interest to meet Lindsey halfway. Can Lindsey agree to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer for their relationship to work? Can he really settle for Ben's infatuation with sport? Can a die-hard and nervous Red Sox fan find true love? Of course, Lindsey and Ben come with a colorful assortment of friends who share their opinions. The closest buddy Lindsey, the thin, rich and blond Robin (KaDee Strickland), says there must be something wrong with this guy if he's still lonely at the age of 30. Skye) provides a more optimistic and positive view of Ben. <br /> <br /> Ben's eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan, while Lindsay's frustration can be representative of any woman's mobile career. Fallon is as amazing as Ben, showing the real potential of the big screen, overcoming the unimportant challenge of stopping Ben from being unpleasant. Meanwhile, Barrymore is as lovely as Lindsey's workaholic, especially since she's trying to accept Ben for who he is without losing sight of his own needs. <br /> <br /> Fever Pitch really works and despite the fact that there are many inspiring moments of comedy, the film also refers to the serious problem of sport addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate this sensitive territory. <br /> <br /> Much of the film was shot in Boston's Fenway Park, which adds a sense of authenticity to the proceedings, as well as the atmosphere of the games, although full appreciation of what happened to the band is likely to be limited to baseball enthusiasts. Nevertheless, Fever Pitch is endowed with such a beautifully curly and intelligently funny script that even novice baseball fans will find many that they can connect to. Mike Leonard September 5.
