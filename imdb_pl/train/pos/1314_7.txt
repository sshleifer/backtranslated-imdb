When a small town is threatened by a child killer, a policewoman follows him pretending to be his friend. As she becomes more and more emotionally involved in the murderer, her psyche begins to beat, which causes her to lose her concentration on getting a criminal. Not a movie about the excitement of high tension, but solid police work and a good representation of a defective mind lost psychotically.
