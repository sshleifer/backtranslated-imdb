"Such a long journey" is a well made film, a good session and a presentation of good performances. However, this story is such a mixture of threads and peculiar characters that it becomes a kind of Jack of all threads and a master of none. Also Western audiences will probably find the esoteric of the rather vague Parsee culture to look a little around 1.7 hours. Recommended for people interested in India.
