Fantastic, twisted story of Terry Gilliam about the virus destroying all people from all over the Earth and forcing them to go underground, and the man sent in time to collect information about him, is a fantastic, stunning and highly stylized movie that prides itself on Bruce the Best Willis' performance in history. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes 12 Monkeys from most science-fiction movies while traveling is the fact that Bruce Willis's character deals with the psychological effects of travel in time, i.e. without knowing what reality is a reality: a place from which the traveler comes from in time. In addition, the film recognizes that things that have taken place in the past can not be changed and that the prevention of cataclysm, in this case the release of this virus, can not be stopped or altered. According to Willis: "It has already happened" while he is in a psychiatric hospital, the main dilemma in which the film enters is not a trivial, exaggerated plot to save the world; instead, Willis' inner struggle for survival. It is a fresh, innovative concept and works beautifully thanks to the strained Peoples script and the unique brand of Gilliam dementia. <br /> <br /> In addition, the 12 stories of Monkey is completely non-linear and instead decides to distort and bend the way it is spoken skillfully, containing a series of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, present, past, future and even a scene taken out of Hitchcock's dizziness. They all serve to embrace the viewer in his disturbing cacophony of madness and futility. <br /> <br /> Visually, Gilliam is a master of deserted moderation and shadow competing with Tim Burton in his strikingly depressed scenery and paintings. With cold, wide and captivating cinematography, Gilliam immerses herself in the colorless surroundings and darkness of her characters. Scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead white color and help to defy raging characters. <br /> <br /> In terms of performance, Brad Pitt steals most of the scenes, filling them with a patented, bizarre, unannounced performance that deserves to be nominated for an Oscar. As I mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best results of his career, not returning to his heroic clich√©s and cardboard hero, and instead presenting Cole as a simple, moving, tragic everyman. Madeline Stowe as a psychologist at Willis is equally good. He keeps himself, injecting his character with both wild energy and strength, when he falls under the weight of what he believes to be a false "religion". <br /> <br /> Gilliam's expert, overwhelming and complex service of what could have been a routine action / science fiction movie, makes 12 Monkeys a fascinating vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape. The rich, thoughtful, complicated plot together with the daring performances from the entire cast and gloomy, gloomy photos make it a masterpiece of madness. Taking the place in the top ten of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly rich spectacle of a film full of light. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
