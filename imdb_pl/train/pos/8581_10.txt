This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Anyone who considers this movie ruthless is not intelligent enough to understand the subtle humor that this movie has to offer. It shows us that real life and "fictional" action can create a winning combination. In addition, as a romantic comedy, he has one of the most clever ways to find himself by two people. Call me another movie in which you'll see all of this, as well as Donald Sutherland singing the song "They're going to look for an anus on top on Mars."
