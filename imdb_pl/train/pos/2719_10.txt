I saw this movie after seeing Capote and Infamous. It is simply unbelievable how the homosexual relationship between the author and the characters is sublime in the film. Reporter is simple, protagonists are more beatnik than gays. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, but after re-viewing it, we get various interesting information from the comparisons that the author / director Brooks creates. <br /> <br /> Note the amazing cut at the beginning, where killers and kills are related to each other. The cutter on the phone is matched to Perry on the phone. The face-cleaning cutter is matched to Perry's face-cleansing face. Only Perry looks in the mirror and sees his erotic male body that makes him fantasize about playing guitar in Las Vegas on empty chairs. This failure / fantasy fits the fantasy of failures that Perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska just to find him eternally empty. <br /> <br /> Dick talks about shooting pheasants and about the fact that pheasants do not know that they will die. we prune Clutters. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about his dream about the yellow bird "Higher than Jesus", who attacks nuns who persecuted them. "The nuns begged for mercy," he tells us, "But the bird killed them anyway." The bird lifted Perry to paradise. Surprisingly, Perry says he has a dislike of nuns, God and religion. It echoes in his last words when he wants to apologize, but he does not know who. <br /> <br /> The director puts in a variety of what-ifs and only-ifs. <br /> <br /> Nancy Cutter gets a sleeping offer at a friend's house. She is holding a horse. Perry will comment on her picture and house later. Nancy can not sleep at her friends' house because her boyfriend comes to dinner. The decision seals her fate. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about Bogart in "Treasure of Sierra Madre". But this is another picture of Bogart, "Beat the Devil", which he wrote Truman Capote, where the fictional quest for the treasure is McGuffin. But Dick knows that the heroes of the movie ended up with nothing. Dick wants hard cash, $ 10,000, which he thinks are in Clutter's safe (which ironically turns out to be just as fantastic as Perry's Mexican treasure.) Cut to Herb Clutter by signing insurance for Life worth 40,000 USD Ironically, its mortality is due to end in a few hours The insurance agent, on behalf of the company, wishes him a long life, again ironic, when we know what will happen in a few hours. br /> <br /> Dick he said that they do not want witnesses, so no one would remember them. Later they actually eliminated all the witnesses they remembered. <br /> <br /> "There was one witness - the detective repeats to Dick later, but is he a prison prisoner friend, Dick, Perry, Truman Capote or God? The spectator becomes a witness after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Fascinating movie.
