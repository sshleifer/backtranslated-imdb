Probably they would miss some of the beginnings - I'm not sure why it starts in the Asian part of Turkey. If it were because starting from the Mediterranean, they could get closer to today's Lebanon. <br /> <br /> One of the cameras and crews has reached the Bakhtyari tribe, this is the beginning of an amazing 48-day journey. 50,000 people from around 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses make this amazing journey across the Karun River. They use rafts that are held on the surface by pumping goatskins - you can see where your head and legs have been removed. The second "bank" of the river was very steep - I guess it increased by 60 degrees. <br /> <br /> Just watching was amazing, but there were even more. To get to the pastures, they had to go through a large mountain, which was about 4 feet of snow, if not more. The ability to climb this mountain was amazing in itself, but they (and all animals) climbed that mountain barefoot! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> The only disadvantage of this document were some titles with poor humor attempts. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary from the silent era, or the amazing challenges that this tribe not only puts in front of you, but also raises. It's just an amazing document of a little-known group of people facing all kinds of challenges.
