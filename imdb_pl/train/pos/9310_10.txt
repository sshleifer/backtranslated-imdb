wow, how can I even discuss this movie without tears in my eyes? Certainly it was the culmination of my year - no - of my life. As if the raptor graphics were not amazing enough, the award-winning editors continued to use exactly the same shot throughout the movie, even if the background did not fit the scene. Wow, what a genius. And while the movie is full of holes in the story (for example, several clips of a t-Rex animal, which should be a bird of prey and one key moment in which Pappy finds a torture chamber, yells "Colin is a girl!" And runs out) Never I will forget the splendor of Raptor Planet. Thank you Sci-Fi for another classic.
