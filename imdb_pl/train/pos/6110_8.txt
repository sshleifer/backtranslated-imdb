Like "My Sassy Girl", this movie is based on a true story published on the Internet, but that's where the similarities end. The story is about this rebellious man named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo), who is still trying to graduate from high school, whose parents employ a teacher named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman from a poor environment, but sometimes he is the same age as him. Add to this some obstacles, martial arts (bandits are always for revenge Ji-Hoon), a despised, bandit, sick love girl who is chasing him, his tendency to abandon the lesson and generally you can guess the whole story. Did I mention that it is a romantic comedy? This movie has some good fight scenes, great visual humor and a lot of courage, thanks to good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which brings a lot of energy to history. For this reason, there are also romantic elements. And I must say that I would like a girl more like Kim Ha Nuel than the girl from "My Sassy Girl" (at least in terms of personality). She has some courage, but she is more adorable, sweet, good-natured. The characters are mostly nice (so you could say that they had a smaller top than "My Sassy Girl" - an obstacle that worked in this movie), and the movie is quite clever and interesting most of the time. The story is like a sunken, about two-thirds of the way (where in a sense it's circling a well-known, standard tariff, where nothing really happens), but at the end it rises a bit. Generally a funny, charming movie. 8/10
