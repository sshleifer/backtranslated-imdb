Wonderfully sophisticated Ronald Coleman is shown here, as in several of his other films. It's literally in every scene and this comic movie stays fresh thanks to him, not in spite of him. He is handsome, witty and very clever because he is one step ahead of his wandering, charming wife - Anna Lee plays perfectly. The film is based on French art and brings all the best features of this farce. Most of the cast is well known, at least when it comes to the face, if not the name ... and they are absolutely perfect for this very funny movie. Fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable, who is ahead of other heroes. His multi-talents can be appreciated in the classic "Lost Horizon", which every film lover must see.
