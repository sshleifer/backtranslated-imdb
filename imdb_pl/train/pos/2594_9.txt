This film took Jerry Springer's approach to the superpower. "Wilder Napalm" is a kind of thematic film that I love, referring to the idea that wonderful children in America are defined either by their gifts or by attempting to hide them. At the same time, the film shows that every miracle child is only a human being and that one can not be afraid of him or worship more than any other human being. It was a great comedy, funny and human with this light satirical edge.
