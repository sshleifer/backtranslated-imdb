"Holes" is a GREAT movie. Disney made the right choice. Every person I talked to said that she LOVES her. Each cast was appropriate for the role they had, and Shia Labeouf really has a future with acting. Sigourney Weaver was perfect for the Guardian, she was just as I imagined her. to all who have not seen him, I recommend and guarantee that "Dig It".
