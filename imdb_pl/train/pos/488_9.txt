Part of the pleasure that I derived from this movie stemmed from the fact that I knew nothing more about the fact that John Turturro played in it, and Emily Watson (2 reasons to watch), he was a piece of the time and engaged in chess. Everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected. That's why I will not give away more. Suffice it to say that Turturro is wonderful as an eccentric, obsessive and deeply sensitive chess genius, and Em fits him step forward as a strong woman who is drawn to him. It's about love and obsession, not about the honored board game, and after getting me in the first half hour, it has become completely captivating. And I am opposed to anyone who will guess the end.
