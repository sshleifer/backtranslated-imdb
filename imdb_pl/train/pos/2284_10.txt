It's very chilling in the veins, and mostly a well thought out drama. I am impressed by the film, not only because of the plot and great acting, but because such a unique film was made. Most of the films in which a spy or war is involved are filled with skillful British speaking or a mighty battle, but not that. This is not about such a war, about a war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany who is an advocate of evil that no one will ever forget. When the war is over, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his heroic attitude must remain a government secret. Returning to America, Campell meets Nazi supporters as well as Nazi hatred, providing interesting conflicts, both internal and external. Nolte is more than just a role and fits the story quite well to what she's asking for.
