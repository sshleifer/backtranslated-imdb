If you like movies about animals, this movie will be liked. My wife likes animals and films about animals, she especially likes the parrot in this movie. It's geared towards children, but I was laughing at most of the humor. The French fashion character made me laugh and added balance to the script. This is a Disney movie, with its cheerful, happy family appeal, but I like to leave the theater with a positive feeling.
