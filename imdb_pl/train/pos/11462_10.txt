SPOILER ALARM! This movie, "Zero Day", gives life to two students, Andre and Calvin, who feel resentment and hatred for everyone and everything related to that school. Thoughtful "Missions" All leading to a huge mission, which is a zero day. The content of zero days is not determined until the end of the movie. The viewer knows his serious and full of hatred, but he is never sure until the end. <br /> <br /> Now we all know, if the film is based on the Columbine massacre, the end is quite obvious. And the end is no different than any other movie about the attack, they go and kill many of their colleagues in the end. <br /> <br /> I have seen many movies on this attack and this movie Far is my favorite and the most respected. It gives the viewer and the inside a look at the lives of these two teenagers who hate life, and sincerely gives the viewer something about understanding and closing down a terrible event. <br /> <br /> Being only 7 events that took place, I never knew about the seriousness of the shootings until my English class was assigned to an essay or a story about the defining moment in our generation. Well, I knew everyone would choose twin towers, but I wanted to be different, of course, that the twin towers were tragic and very defining, but I did not think it was the right choice for me because there really was no way to go about this, because I was only in third grade and I had no idea what it all meant. But The Shootings Did I Effect. I remember interviews, The Sky Views Of The School, and The Hurt and Terror in the eyes of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This film is fascinating, to earth and a terrifying masterpiece, and I would recommend it to everyone.
