It's a good movie, but it's not recommended if you do not like smart movies. It's about two guys who want the world to go away, and that's what they get. Acting is great, the ending was not predictable and actually had a good story unlike most movies nowadays. People complain that the film is too simple or too boring. I think they should just stick to movies like The Toxic Avenger (I like movies B) or The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. One note: if you notice it, it has exactly the same actors from Cube, with the exception of four actors. Make two notes: Wait for the subtitles (Trust me on this). Enjoy the movie.
