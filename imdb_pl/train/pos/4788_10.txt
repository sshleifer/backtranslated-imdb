This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen: I was shining throughout the movie. Music and photos kept the charm when nothing happened on the screen. The slow pace was determined by the travel mode (riding mower with a large trailer) and was sustained by the views and sounds of the background and the slow life of other characters. <br /> <br /> The story actually happened; Alvin Straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no acting; everything was completely real, as if the actors did indeed change in form. Sissy Spacek has presented a moving performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who suffered a lot but she forged at the front, always wanting to act properly. Richard Farnsworth was perfectly manned and beautifully became Alvin Straight, a stubborn but loving elderly man who wanders through Iowa to visit his distant brother, Lyle, who suffered a stroke. Alvin had learned a lot of wisdom in his life and seemed to bring out the best of the people he met along the way. <br /> <br /> The film emphasizes the importance of family for this man and, hopefully, for all of us. I look forward to seeing him again and again. Films directed by David Lynch prove his directing skills. Farnsworth was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor; At the age of 79, he was the oldest candidate for this award.
