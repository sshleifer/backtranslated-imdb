A great movie that shows how people are connected to ordinary, ordinary beads exchanged during Mardi Gras. Film is more than a commentary on globalization. In fact, he is humanizing workers in China, a factory owner, a bead distributor in New Orleans, and even revelers in New Orleans. What stands out the most is the director's ability to tell a complicated story with complex details in such a simple and seductive way. His amazing access to the factory is another aspect that is intriguing and I would just like to know how he came inside. It is a beautiful story without sentimentality and a sense of guilt connected with it, and the conclusion gives hope without leaving alienated people.
