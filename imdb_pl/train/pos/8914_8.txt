I grew up in Royersford, Pa. The city where Jerry's market was located. I remember all my family who watched the filming. I remember a guy showing me "Blob" and my brothers in a bucket. I would also like to share that my mother was in the movie. Her hairstyle was the same as that of Aneta Corsaut, and one evening she was ill and saw my mother and asked her to sit in the car with Steve McQueen for a few pictures from the back. They paid her $ 25.00 and gave her a story to tell until she dies in August. My mother was not a teenager and she was several months after the birth of my younger sister.
