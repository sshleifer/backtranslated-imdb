If you want to watch a movie and watch it well, Tigerland is a movie for you. I love this film from top to bottom. Scenes perfect for this movie look so real; it's almost like a documentary about something that happened in real life, but with drama. Boy, I'm telling you ... A real drama in which they really fought in one of the scenes (make DVD listen to the commentary, it's not obvious). I see this film as a group of desperate young people trying to escape from a terrible destiny, after watching Saving Private Ryan I am aware of what "fatal destiny" is and I know exactly how the men in the movie feel. I see this movie as a mix of "Stand By Me" and "Saving Private Ryan". What do men do when they are in a situation that is "difficult" in real life? Some men go mad, some men cry, some men fists, other drugs, some sleep randomly with whores who absolutely try to eradicate the meaning of love from their lives, some try to drink pain, some jump from buildings or bridges, some feel guilty, and others feel agony that makes them so sick that they break down physically. This movie has all these desperate emotions in one ball. But do not get me wrong, that it is not a depressing movie, its realistic, very humorous film, conceited and funny Bozz (Collin's character) brightens all this, and in addition there are about 5 actresses in the film; I'll let you find out why they're there! In dialogue, war / action sequences, perfect scenes with appropriate music; this movie has everything, as I said: from top to bottom. I do not know why Tigerland is badly underrated. The best thing about having a movie is that the cover is written in the bold "Best Film of the Year" and that's absolutely nothing more than that. Keep rare jewels upcoming Hollywood, 10/10.
