I loved the series when it was on Kids WB, I did not believe that Batman appeared, because the original program ended in 1995 and this series appeared in 1997. solve the crime on your own. It was an interesting prospect for their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series and once again, like the predecessor, he had great stories, great animation (better than the original), fantastic voice work and of course genius writing. The only thing I did not like was that it was in the USA, he often ran episodes in the 15-minute plot. I just want some episodes to be longer. My favorite episode of all Batman cartoons comes from this series and is called "Over the Edge", in my opinion as good, if not better than "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's reckoning". Generally a nice complement, along with Superman, this show made my childhood very happy.
