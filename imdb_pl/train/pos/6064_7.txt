I have to start by telling me how I came across this movie. It was winter time in Alaska around 1990. My friend from Australia stayed with me and my friend in a shoe box in the apartment. Winter in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay at home, drink heavily and watch everything that appears on TV. I discovered that this movie, except for a savings magazine lying in snowdrift, was immediately a treasure. the best worst movie ever. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish. We watched it so many times that sometimes we turned the TV on its side or upside down to get a fuller filling effect. A real gem. Laughter will come without interruption, and the memories will last forever. If you see this movie for rental in a video store, steal it. You will not regret!
