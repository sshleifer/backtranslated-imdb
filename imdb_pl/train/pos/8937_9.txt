This was a great example of how an interesting movie can be made without the use of big stars and great effects. Just tell a real story about the struggles of two African Americans in a turbulent age. <br /> <br /> This video calls us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black etc. <br /> <br /> A good movie with good news .
