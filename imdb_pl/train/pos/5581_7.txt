This photo was banned in the homes of American films in 1930 due to the nudity of Hedy Lamarr (Eva Hermann), which caused various problems among women in the thirties, but not so much for the male population. This story concerns a young woman named Eva Hermann, who marries an elderly man and is carried above the threshold on her wedding night, and her husband never consumes marriage and is worried about many minor things, such as his shoes and killing worms. Eva leaves her husband's home and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot summer day Eva rides a horse and decides to go naked in a lake in the forest. Her horse escapes, and she runs after him and is watched by a young man who finds her clothes and returns them to Eva. These two people become very familiar and an affair begins to blossom. There are many more interesting problems that appear when you watch this movie to the end. Enjoy the great movie Classic, which was Shocker Film in 1933. Be happy.
