This is one military drama that I really like! Tom Berenger playing the killer of the military Thomas Beckett. This Marine is pointless in your face and without questions asked to people who do work. There you have Billy Zane ("The Phantom" and others), who plays Richard Miller, a former SWAT from D.C., works for the government and accepts only orders from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do not! When these two are paired, sparks should fly. And how. However, Beckett teaches young bureaucrats how it works. When other snipers get it, it's a spit vs. smartness, cat vs. mouse, shooter versus shooter. And when an experienced sniper is caught, Miller has to put the policy aside and save him. Who needs politics when you are a professional like Beckett, accepts orders from anyone but himself, plays according to rules, not books, and mutual respect is exercised despite politics. The film was a direct hit. Watch it. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
