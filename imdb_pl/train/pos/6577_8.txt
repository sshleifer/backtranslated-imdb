With a few exceptions, most of the performances of George Bernard Shaw virtually disappeared from the theater. Too bow, too talkative seems to be a general verdict. This BBC version of one of Shaw's coolest plays does not disprove this verdict. He is certainly arched and talkative, but he is also wonderful. And because of the quality of the British theater, it is perfectly populated with actors who - with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter - most of us probably never heard. Carter is wonderful as a Bulgarian girl who protects a professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and later falls in love with him. You can argue with a particularly funny interpretation of Sergiusz (Patrick Ryecart), a Bulgarian cavalry officer who led the charge on the enemy lines and succeed only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for his machine guns. However, the role encourages excessive acting, and Ryecart was clearly told to care. The other players are perfect. Carter as a self-proclaimed Bulgarian "aristocrat" and Torrens as a Swiss soldier of fortune are of course in the center of art and are wonderful. Yes, "Arms and the Man" appears as a filmed art. But you'll probably never see a Shaw movie that would not reveal its origin. Plots are generally clever. However, Shaw applies to the entire dialog. The action is minimal (even in St. Joan), and the sets are irrelevant. Enjoy what it is.
