Everything I can remember was excellent ... a great cast with Sam Waterston and George Innez (before he became more known to the American audience) .... excellent scripts, if only English can do it - Edwardian Sherlock Holmes / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert. Campion secrets, but with the accent of Jules Verne. As if MacGyver would be in England 80 years earlier ... at the very beginning of the 20th century scientific / technological revolution. <br /> <br /> I've often wondered if the creator of MacGyver saw these programs. MacGyver first broadcast about three years later. <br /> <br /> I still have 1 episode on a badly damaged tape.
