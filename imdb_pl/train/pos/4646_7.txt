I did not know what to do with this movie. I think that's what it really meant. I have never seen such a movie and I doubt if I will ever really. Glover puts together something that is unique to him. I think I appreciate it, you need to read some of his poetry, maybe see one of his slideshows. I really like this guy, he's so weird that I can not help it. Note: I saw this movie before its final editing, so maybe what I saw and what others saw was different. I think I will know if I decide to watch the movie again. I think I will have to have a good influence on drugs ...
