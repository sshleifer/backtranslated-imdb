The document presents the original theory about "Guns, Germs and Steel". The series graphically illustrates several episodes that strongly support theory and defend theories against widespread criticism. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised when I found users' comments complaining about the lack of new information in these series. They say that the document presents information that is taught in middle school. It is indeed so. In fact, I really liked the original view of the information that I knew from the gymnasium and unexpected analysis. <br /> <br /> So if you like to know why things work, if you split your phone trying to determine how it works, if you went to the farm to see how the farm works and how cows are milked, you'll love this series . Strong recommendation.
