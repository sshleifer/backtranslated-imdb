I've never seen a show as good as Full House. Full House will shame all new performances! Anyone who has never seen it, and which I do not see as possible, should see it. This is a great show for everyone of all ages. Full House will make you laugh, make you cry, bewilder you. True, some people think that there are some "tacky" aspects of the program, but the positive aspects weigh all "tacky" aspects. Full House ran his first episode on September 22, 1987, titled "Our Very First Show", and was the last episode of May 23, 1995 titled "Michelle Rides Again Part II". <br /> <br /> The plot of the series is very credible. Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) loses his wife, Pam, in the case of a drunk driver. Danny has her brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), who is the younger brother of Pam, and Danny also brings her best friend Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier) to help him raise his three daughters. Danny's daughters are called DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Joey and Jesse plan to move in to Danny and his three girls for a few months to help and finish them for eight years; the performance lasted so many years. <br /> <br /> Below is a short description of some of the characters and the actor / actress who played it: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a great actor. He is playing Jesse. Jesse is a rock star who is waiting for his great break. In Full House, John Stamos does a great job of presenting his character. He looked and played music like his idol, Elvis Presley. <br /> <br /> Bob Saget (Danny): Bob Saget is also a great actor. He loses his wife in a car accident involving a drunk driver. She must raise three girls without a girl's mother. Bob Saget does a great job of presenting a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girlfriends. <br /> <br /> Dave Coulier (Joey): One word can describe Dave Coulier, funny. He is great. Playing Joey's character was perfect for him. He's doing a great job playing a comedian waiting for his big break. <br /> <br /> Candice Cameron-Bure (DJ): She's an amazing actress. He plays the oldest sister, DJ, who is short for Donna Jo. She is one of the best actresses I have ever seen. Her acting skills at Full House were very credible. <br /> <br /> Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie): Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweetin, incredibly amazing! I would like to say everything I would like to say about Jodie, but I would use a maximum of 1000 words on it. She began her career in a children's series called Mother Goose Stories, and when she came to Full House, she broke the mind of the audience and the creator. Her great looks and absolutely incredible acting skills have made the show a success. According to Dave Coulier, Jodie was supposed to be the star of the show. She was supposed to be where she was going to take a great break. Jodie, who was five years old when the show was broadcast for the first time, could perfectly fit into every line. She showed great enthusiasm. Most small children can not do this. As you probably guess, Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in Full House. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): A great actress. Full House is the place where they started. They got the role of Michelle because they were the only children who did not cry in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> There are many other cast members to be recognized. These are original characters from the time when the show first appeared in the air in 1987. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I can say is how the Full House became the Michelle Show at the end. I think it was focusing on her at the end. Especially when I think that Jodie and Candice were much better in acting. <br /> <br /> Full House is a great performance for everyone. He can teach you a lot. One of the biggest things he can teach you is that everyone can live a great life, even if a tragedy occurs, such as the loss of a family member. Full House continues to attract new fans. After all, there are only a few things to say; Full House will never die and, thank you, the cast of Full House, for letting everyone show you who they can enjoy.
