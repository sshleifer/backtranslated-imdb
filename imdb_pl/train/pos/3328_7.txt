Nowadays, it is rare to find a romantic comedy that is not unbelievably disgusting in short doses throughout the film (eg the Great Greek wedding, me, Irene and myself). There were only a few playfully joking jokes in this movie, nothing inexorable or blasphemous. Around was a nice movie with nice characters. I thought the ending was a bit sudden. It seems that they should finish it in the world series to get a real final. Acting left something to be desired, but the pace of the story made up for it. If I knew it was a Farrelly brothers' movie, I would think it was a stomach changing garbage and not watching it, but it looks like even they can accidentally make a good movie. Good for them, I hope they will pull their heads to the end and start to make good films consistently.
