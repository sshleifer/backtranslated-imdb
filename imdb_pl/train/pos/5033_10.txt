This is one of those movies that after watching it you will meditate and come back to even months after watching. Acting is spectacular with the participation of two children (usually I hate films with childish acting). Bill Paxton is amazing, his directorial debut is even better than I expected from an actor whose most memorable line is "The game is over, man! (from the film "Aliens"). <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is the dichotomy between the scenes in which the actors play the family and when they perform their "work". It really makes the film credible and unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Hold on, Bill. I will be waiting for more movies that I will certainly love!
