OK, normally I would not watch the Farrelly brothers' movie. I do not remember ever watching him. I also do not remember watching Jimmy Fallon's movie. Well, I watched a taxi, but I said penance and I was forgiven for this error. But this movie had Drew Barrymore and I think it is the sweetest thing. I do not know what's in it, but I smile all the time I watch her. It just makes me so charming. I mean, I even watched Adam Sandler to see her in the first 50 dates. How sad is that? It was not the best baseball movie - it should not be. It was a love story about a sad puppy who was holding on to the one thing that never failed him until he found something to give up. It had a predictable ending, but there were so many things that made it worth it.
