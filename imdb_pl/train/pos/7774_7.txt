"Written on the Wind" was an extremely successful universal image. It can only be done by Douglas Sirk, the man who saw the possibilities in the material he received. Based on Robert Wilder's popular novel and adaptation of George Zuckerman, it included all the elements that make up the perfect melodrama: nymphomania, a large oil fortune, alcoholism, incest and a gentle touch of homosexuality. Mr. Sirk has laid the path to what will happen later in the soap opera genre, mainly "Dallas" and "Dynasty", to mention only two. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this movie was shot entirely inside Studio. Most of the decorations are artificial. Like many of those pictures from the 1950s, "Written on the Wind" was shot entirely in the studio. Just look at the scenes that are to take place in Manhattan, in Miami, and even in the lake, you can see how the scenery is painted background. Mr. Sirk did not care about realism until he could tell his story in his own way. <br /> <br /> We recently caught a show that was part of Mr. Sirk's renaissance, in which people laughed at some of the most dramatic moments, especially during the scenes where Rock Hudson appears who plays good Mitch Wayne. There is also something graphic in the way in which Robert Keith, who plays the patriarch Jasper Hadley, and later his own daughter, the evil Marylee, caresses an oil keg that adorns the desk of an elderly man, a kind of phallic d'art object. <br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk probably wanted his cast to give the best performances, which makes sense in the way Dorothy Malone portraits Nymphomaniac Marylee and to some extent Robert Stack who behaves like Kyle, the tormented heir to the story. It would probably be an easy explanation of what appears on the screen. The only thing that seems normal is Lauren Bacall, who has not been asked to make her character Lucy Moore turn out to be someone else, like an earthed person caught meeting the wrong crowd. <br /> <br /> Together with other Hollywood movies, "Written on the Wind" shows the genius of a talented director who gave the audience what they wanted to see: stories bigger than life that could only be seen on the big screen
