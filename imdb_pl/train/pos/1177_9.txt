I've seen a lot of PPV in the past, but it's the most fun, intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. DVD accessories are worth it, because they give a different view of how the wrestlers behave after the concert (eg Interview with chris benoit / interview with the edge). gold and some promotional chatter. In addition, there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Tag Team Table match: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerro and Chris benoit 7/10 It was quite a good intense match to start the show. Not much is kept and pure physicality. Spike can keep his own matches at the tables, and Guerro and Benoit gave good wrestling skills on the mat. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusierweight championship: Jamie Noble w / Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd really did not care about the wrestler or did not get interested in him. Kidman made a press star. Usually, people expect a lot of flights in the cruiser championships, but that's not much. In fact, it was so bad that when Noble hit his finisher, no one even cared or knew about it (you can tell from the absence of a flashing camera). However, the ending was fast. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy v William Regal 5/10 I've never liked regal as a wrestler, lacking in intensity and style. Hardy was impressive, but he really did not have the opportunity to show off his high performance, although he continued to make good counters and added that he needed a fast pace in the match. It ended quickly, which was perfect for this match. <br/> <br /> 4. John Cena vs. Chris Jericho 6/10 It's funny when you look at the first PPV Price, how he behaved, how he dressed and what he looked like (see his interview, it's pretty fun). It was a good intense match with the Price showing a nice variety of holds, suplexics, counters and some antennas. Jericho was below the norm, but definitely helped Price to start a career. The price wins. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontent championship: RVD against Brock Lesnar 8/10 It was a very intense and good match. Both styles of wrestlers really fit together on the screen, with Brockami pure power and raw energy, and RVD skills full of movement and speed. RVD looked great in this match (better than his later matches with the edge and price), and the whole match was quick. The ending worked perfectly, because it still kept Brock's unbeatable streak, giving RVD its only desserts in its home state. <br /> <br /> 6. No disqualifying match: Booker T against Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that lacked some intensity, like an RVD match, but still a good result. Although it started a bit slow (which is always the case with a large show), Booker T was impressive and made a sick move on the announcer's table. Finisher was amazing, the ending was a big worry and a big move for Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance storm 5/10 It was an average match. Hogan comes out of huge pop as usual, but in its diversity of movements there is a lack of this intensity and energy. On the other hand, Christian does not really have the greatest sports skills. It ended with the best match at best, but it was still OK for PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat Match for Undisputed Championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Easy to match the year. This is by far the best triple match I've ever seen. He had close downs, lots of exhausting, stolen players, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. No one could have predicted who would come out of it. If you're going to buy a DVD, I'd buy it for this match only. (ending? widzaj sam!) <br /> <br /> In general, it was a solid PPV with a lot of additional gadgets that will allow you to watch all the time. Although it is difficult to find (I had to pay a little more than usual for this DVD), it is definitely worth your money.
