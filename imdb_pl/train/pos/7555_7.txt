Gender Bender a bit of sex for x files. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but the end you want. Gender Bender is also a debut in the X format for actor Nicholas Lei, better known as Alex Krycek. In this episode, he plays Michael, a man attacked by one of the "Kindred". You must see this episode to see less than the spectacular start of Nic Lea. Interesting thing about the "power of seduction" of the Kindred. When Marty does this to his victims, they become him. But when Andrew seduces Scully, she's just because she is confused and bewildered, and Andrew does not attract him. Maybe because Marty has more experience than Andrew. This episode reminds me why filming in British Columbia can be unfortunate. In the entire episode it is so wet, soaked and muddy that it could not be so funny. Despite disappointing ending, Gender Bender is still a decent episode to watch.
