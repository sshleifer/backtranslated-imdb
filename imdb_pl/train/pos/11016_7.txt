A good show of action, but nothing new. This one took place high in the mountains, which showed nice landscapes. One man takes a group of mercenaries, lead flies, and he kicks the ass. This could be called "Rambo Goes to the Rockies". He had one very effective scene in the first movie that made me feel terrified. This is not a bad picture, but the same ol, the same ol.
