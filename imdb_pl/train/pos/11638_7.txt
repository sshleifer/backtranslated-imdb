I had a good time watching "Red eyes". This is not a masterpiece, but it is well-targeted and organized. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect for this role. Yes, it's the same old story with a different setting, but Wes Craven gave it a good pace. At least not another Scream with an ordinary college killer. It's nice when you see a clean, consistent thriller, even when originality does not stand out as the main character. Especially from a filmmaker such as Craven who has brought so many innovative ideas to the genre of thrillers and horrors in the past, and which is now suitable for moving home, which could have been a good TV movie if it had not been released theatrically. Good job!
