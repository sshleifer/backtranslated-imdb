I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago. At the time, I was definitely not interested in the opera, but changed my views. I really liked this movie and since then I really like the opera. I even bought a few of his CDs. Who cares what his acting skills were, he just played alone, which was cute. He was so charming, so charismatic; I really wanted to hug him. I am very sad that so many criticize him so harshly. It was so simple, I did not accept people pushing him around or judging for his actions. He deserves respect and admiration for his talent. For sure it will be missed !!!
