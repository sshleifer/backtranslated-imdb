I do not understand that so much rubbish from Norway has been remastered to release a DVD, and such jewels do not give a chance to regain their former glory. I give it 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few SciFi movies made for Norwegian television. This film is nothing more than a film-historical jewel that in many ways heralds the first Alien movie. And, my word, Blindpassasjer was first! Did Ridley Scott or someone from the crew see the mini-series? However, it is unlikely that the scenes are very similar. Okay, the budget is much lower in the Norwegian film, but given that it is a really well done work from an abandoned Norwegian cinema age that accidentally lasted until the 1990s.
