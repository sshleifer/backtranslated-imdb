I really liked this movie. I have always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this film only emphasizes this. She plays the housewife in an African American family who is moving up the social chain because of the success of her husband (Danny Glover) as a lawyer. It moves to a white neighborhood where people are friendly and yet awkward. Various events that appear during the movie make SOME laugh, but mainly refer to other emotions. This film is not so much comedy as drama. I give him a strong 8/10. I highly recommend catching it on TV or renting it soon.
