One of the underestimated jewels of the 80s, Scenes ... is characterized by a sharp satire and excellent performances by Arnetia Walker (how did it happen that she did not get a lot of roles after that?) And Wallace Shawn. It is an excellent sending of class wars and people from these classes. Writing is fun, and characters, though not subtle, are refined. And, sorry, but Asian gangs (if you can call one Japanese forcing one of the other heroes a "gang") were not introduced into the "sociological value", as another review suggests, should be. The value here is what the movie is funny about and the brilliant way it does it. I find it creative, fun and idiosyncratic.
