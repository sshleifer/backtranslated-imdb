This animated feature (co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) concerns what is certainly one of the strangest themes in film history: the creation of the famous manuscript in the ninth century, the book of Kells. In this fantastic story of this story, young boy Brendan, living in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a raw Abbot who is worried about preparing the abbey's defense against the impending attack of terrified vikings, must get into the forbidden forest environment to find materials that the master of enlightenment named Aidan needs to finish the book. To perform this task, in the forest unexpectedly finds help from a friendly fairy named Aisling. Beautifully and delicately drawn by hand (there is a computer animation in a few key fragments) in a way that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional Celtic art, and with very creative use of color and various types of geometric shapes, this movie is inexpressibly strange, but it is good strange, not denying variety, but a kind of eye opening. If anyone would have tracked - apart from some anachronisms, like an African monk in Ireland from the ninth century? one would have to say that the combination of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this film never really merges. A comic relief is sometimes too wide. That's why I can not give them the highest ranking. But these are minor problems with a differently delightful and extremely ingenious movie.
