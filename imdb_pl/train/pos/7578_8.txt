Shintar√¥ Katsu, who played the blind fencer "Zatoichi" in 27 films, ends the Hanzo trilogy with this amazing film, in which he loves with spirit, Mako Midori (Blind Beast). <br /> <br /> A big stick, often used in the pursuit of justice, is forever being withdrawn. <br /> <br /> Katsu was his usual insolent myself when he pursued those who steal the treasury to borrow usury sums to those who could not afford to pay. <br /> <br /> The usual fencing and the skills of the big guy were present along with the blood. <br /> <br /> I will miss him.
