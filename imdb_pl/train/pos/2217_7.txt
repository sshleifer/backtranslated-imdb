I'm usually skeptical about watching movies or mini series based on novels, because the script is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (I think it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer, what?) <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding. I can not describe how much I liked watching so many actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> Setting the location ... I expected to see the houses and houses I imagined: what I saw on the screen was slightly different. However, it was not enough for me not to like the mini-series. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have one. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
