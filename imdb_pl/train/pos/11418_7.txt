I saw the film for the first time during the course and international film studios. I am a "non-traditional" student and perhaps due to the reasons of my years of life or the accumulation of wisdom I appreciated the slow, reflective pace of the film's narrative. The story of heat and dust of dry climate is deeply psychological, full of multi-layered symbolism and articulated reversal of the theme of being "Other" in a country that you do not understand. the understanding that arises is fraught with unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider. Made almost 20 years ago, it is also a precursor to a genre of many other international films that study colonial themes in colonized spaces, without knowing the nuances of the cultures they came to. Much more richly filmed - and heavily funded - works made since then reflect the same topics: Indochina, Nowhere in Africa there are two that in comparison may be pale and boring. There is no adrenaline or violent violence. The fights are mental, emotional and subtle. But let's say it is a great movie worth watching.
