RKO enjoyed the reputation of the creator of folk, homespun Americana pieces. <br /> <br /> Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) has been playing in movies since she was a child. In 1933 she was suspended - playing Ann Dvorak as a child in "Three on a Match" (1932) and "flower girl" in "This Side of Heaven" and "The Key" in 1934. she remembered Anne's work from the previous movie and that's how she got the part. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her pseudonym. There are memorable stories - Lady of Shallot in a leaky boat, "stolen" brooch, incident "Red hair". Anne was right in the role of a talkative, impetuous orphan. She was painful in her intensity, her enthusiasm for contentment, as well as her fiery temperament. O.P. Heggie was great because understanding Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley was fine as Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger, who was also in the film as a small child, was fine as Diana Barry. Sara Haden has proven that she can play someone other than Aunt Millie in the series of Andy Hardy, she was Mrs. Barry.
