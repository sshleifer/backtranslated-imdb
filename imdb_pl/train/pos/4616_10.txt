The title of this film comes from the party game "Seven Minutes in Heaven". The game was popular with my husband's friends when he was in junior high school in Brooklyn, New York, and describes it as something like "Spin-the-Bottle", "Lifesaver Relay" and other preteen kissing games. According to the rules, the name of the boy and girl will be drawn, and the chosen ones will have to enter the dark wardrobe together and stay there for seven minutes. In the meantime, there would be speculation among party guests whether they both have the courage to hold hands, embrace and / or kiss each other in the privacy of the closet. At the end of the seven minutes the game leader said: "Time is over" or knocked on the wardrobe door, and the couple will come out of the closet. After being interviewed by other guests, the couple had to admit what they had done during "Seven Minutes in Heaven". Then other couples would be selected to enter the closet until all guests were attending. The winner of the game will be a couple who confessed to doing the most. <br /> <br /> Such games served as "ice breakers" for children and teenagers, but they can be embarrassing and intimidating for shy people. The film received this title because it concerns the first experiences of adolescents with depressions and romantic love.
