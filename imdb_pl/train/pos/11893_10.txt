The next two seasons of this original series were less than nondescript. In recent seasons, catastrophic shocks have contributed to his short three-year life. Maybe if the plug was pulled out after the first season, it would get worship. <br /> <br /> Besides, the first season was really fun! Witty, clever with great writing, he was promising. The perfect brew from the first season had the right ingredients - characters / actors, storyline and so on. In addition, the comedy about the paparazzi reporter was original. Nora and her colleagues "photographers" are prowling, night after night, day after day for exclusive. <br /> <br /> Many things do not make sense to me. For example, like this show, and another favorite mine - Gross Pointe, he never did. If only the first seasons of Naked Truth and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, I am asking all who are there ?!
