A historical drama and an adult's history involving free color people in the pre-war war in New Orleans. It starts slowly, but once you know about the main characters and it starts working. This is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because they were free people. Perhaps they did not have all white rights, but they certainly had more control over their fates than their non-free ancestors. Young men and women in this story must make their own choices about how to live or undergo system corruption, whether to live with optimism and contribute to community development. I liked all the characters, but my favorites were Christophe, Anna Bella and Marcel.
