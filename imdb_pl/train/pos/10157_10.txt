This is a funny look at the Gospel presented by Johnny Cash (of course decorated with black), who sings and talks a lot. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is quite enjoyable. Also notice the blond image of Jesus in this work ... just for fun, try to think of five Jews who have blonde hair ...? In any case, it is a great presentation of the largest and most important history of all.
