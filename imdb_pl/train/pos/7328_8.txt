I really liked this movie. I rented it, expecting to spend the evening something not too bad. This turned out to be particularly rewarding. Some of the scenes were fun and they were able to find a movie that was not just a stupid slapstick comedy, but with some meanings and moral values. It works in both cases. I produced a movie. I've never seen any of these actors before, but they were nice and made me worry about what's happening to them at last, which says a lot. . I think you will not be disappointed to watch it.
