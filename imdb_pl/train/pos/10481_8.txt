A sweet little film that would not even offend your grandmother, "Saving Grace" seems to be cut from the same material as half a dozen other British comedies in the last two years ... scarcity has to do with adversities, finds the power to challenge and find out something about yourself in the process. <br /> <br /> Widowed, and thus broken, Grace is a master gardener and is committed to helping his friend / employee Matthew grow a potted plant. He does everything wrong, so Grace helps him out. They realize that he is an ideal person to collect pots from which they can benefit. He likes to smoke, he needs to raise funds to pay off the mortgage. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that Grace travels to London to deal with some of the goods, dressed in a white suit that John Travolta wore in "Saturday Night Fever" and therefore protrudes like a sore thumb. <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always watchful, and you can not say it about many people ... I can not say anyway. Ferguson is very good, and Tcheky Karyo, whom I liked in "La Femme Nikita", is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Not very moving or insightful, but extremely funny and energetic 90 minutes, it feels like a walk with friends. 8/10.
