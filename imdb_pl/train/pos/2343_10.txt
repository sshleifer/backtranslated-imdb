Thank God ABC raised it instead of Fox. The best description (for those who know) is that Wonderfalls meets Dead Like Me in the best possible way. <br /> <br /> I am not sure if the experience of death and destiny at an early stage of life makes me a fan of Brian Fuller, but I certainly like his productions. I also enjoy checkered floors, cakes, talking toys, gravels and other mischievous things :) Although a bit of "Burtonesque", I certainly think that it enjoys its own niche, which does not require J Depp or HB Carter to be a wonderfully ingenious square playground. Here we can find joys and sorrows from childhood and adulthood, which break down on everyone and really make sense and make us want to live a full life!
