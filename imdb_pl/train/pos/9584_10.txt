Yes, these movies are peaks. I do not recommend this more. Gay or strait is a great document for anyone who likes a movie. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never blunt. Great access. Film made with passion and interest in the subject. Some performances and just amazing. If you find this movie only on VHS, it's still worth watching. Great. 10 out of 10. I saw part of this document about 10 years ago and did not understand what I was watching. Interviews are very revealing about the ego of performers who are like heavy boxers trying to get out of the ghetto. The director was apparently the first clock, what an achievement. Cool. Follow it.
