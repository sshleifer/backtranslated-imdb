Postfeminist picture of cruelty and sadism. <br /> <br /> Warning about the breakup! <br /> <br /> This underestimated jewel of the film tells the story of Flavia, a 15th-century girl from Noble who was bricked up in a monastery after defining her father and the entire medieval Christian society, looking at the fallen Islamic warrior as a human rather than a demonic figure. <br /> <br /> You can not accept the patriarchal rule of the monastery (clearly marked in the scene in which the Bishop arrives on the sides of soldiers and monks) Flavia begins to clearly question society in which he finds himself and, through struggling with the whole system of subjugation, repression and violence, inevitably brings a tragic end not only for yourself, but for everyone around her. <br /> <br /> Billed as a fragment of understatement, this is far from the truth. This is a film picture of the consequences of violence, the consequences of patriarchal domination, the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> I have described this in the title of this work as "postfeminist" and ultimately Flavia's triumphs must always be corrupt, compromised and distorted by people. Even the gruesome end of Flavia is committed by men for men (women turn away and only monks look without fear. <br /> <br /> As for the widely discussed violence: it is a picture of the effects of violence and the horror of the world driven by a crazy religious excess. since violence would limit the impact of the film, it would reduce the cost of the film and allow it to be assimilated in a patriarchal discourse that reveals a medieval society. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, brilliantly played (in particular by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), containing great piovani score and still difficult after all these years Flavia is a classic of European cinema.
