I remember that at the age of 25 I got hooked in Spain, rising from, as it turned out, two escaping small Italian cheats. They did a lot outside of the law, but on the other hand carrying a small portrait of Jesus in the pocket for their protection ... Righteous and unjust, good and bad, criminals and correct, where here in the new combination, beyond the categories that I knew. "Les Valseuses" gives me, although it is a movie, not a real life, a picture similar to my own experiences: the intensity of every moment, when you only go "behind" and choose important, whatever comes along your way is another state of mind, and also a "dangerous" form of life, because, as we all know, there are people who are not ready for it and want to persecute you for "theft" etc. This film touches on "values" is a story about "what is good and what is bad ": Morality. It is the resurrection of the individual struggling against him "against false morality" and conformism ... There is danger all along the way, because how far can you go with your own "freedom" and transgress your own moral boundaries and other people? What to do with people who want to hurt you, put you in prison and even shoot at you for the things you do, like "stealing" gasoline from a multinational oil company for you the fifth car? Les Valseuses raises these questions in me, because morality, in contrast to the usual "media message", is quite complex ...
