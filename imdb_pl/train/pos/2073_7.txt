In 1958, Clarksberg was the famous city of speed traps. Significant income was generated by the running sheriff's department. Those who tried to outdo the sheriff? This gave the sheriff a chance to push them off Clarksberg's bend his Plymouth cruiser. For example, at the beginning of the movie, several soldiers on leave trying to return to the base in time are pushed to death, if I remember correctly. One day a stranger entered the city. Probably the coolest hot rodder in the world. Michael McCord. Even his name is the name of the car, as in McCord's seals. Perhaps the ultimate hot rod. Ford's black coupe with a flame of '34. Colors of death, evil and fire of hell. He is deliberately picked up for speeding by the sheriff. He checks the terrain. He is the brother of one of the sheriff's victims. He knows how his brother died. Clarksberg's government supports the sheriff. There is only one way to get justice for killing your brother and fixing things so that "it will never happen again": recreate the chase and settle for a hot rodder competition until death. He goes to Krzywa and practices. The sheriff knows that McCord knows. The race begins ... It's a movie that anyone who has ever tried to master maneuvering on a stretch of road will remember.
