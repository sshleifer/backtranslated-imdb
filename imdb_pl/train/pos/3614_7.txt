Girlfight is like cooking your grandma: the same old recipe you've tried a million times, but somehow turned into something fresh and new. Try to explain the story to people who have not seen it before: young women from the wrong side of the tracks are trying to improve their situation by taking a box, dealing with a bitter, obstructive father and growing attraction for the male rival. Watch how they look at a series of stereotypes and are right: * is * a stereotype. Nevertheless, I was mesmerized by how well this movie works because of the often excellent acting and dialogue and the sensitive direction that makes it "new". I avoided it in the cinema, because it looked like complete nonsense, but I did not make the same mistake as me. Worth seeing.
