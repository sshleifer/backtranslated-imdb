Zombie Chronicles has nothing to shout about, it's not an award-winning film, but it's a fun B movie directed by Brad Sykes, who directed Camp Blood, which was another entertaining, low budget. Acting is bad, like most cheap movies, but it makes it more entertaining, zombie makeup is cool and effective, especially with the budget, gore is also great and disgusting, the movie is like a zombie version of Vault Tales, because we have two stories about zombie encounters in the forest, stories are fun and do not let you guess, especially the first story. Zombie Chronicles is much better than some low-budget zombie movies if you like low-cost B movies or cheap zombie movies, and then check out Zombie Chronicles.
