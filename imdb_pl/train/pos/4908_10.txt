For the first time, I saw Martin's Day when I was only 10 years old, at home, on the film channel, and I still remember the impact he had on my life. It touched me like no other film touched me, and I remember how I picked my eyes out. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw it, I could not find it anywhere else. I would like to ask and nobody has ever heard of the film! I think it was one of those rare films that few people knew about because no one, I mean nobody, knew what I was talking about. For years I searched and searched, checking the shelves in video stores and scanning cable TV offers, but always appeared short. Finally, in 1996, I found out that I could order it, and I probably saw it at least 50 times - and it still makes me cry every time. <br /> <br /> Martin's Day is about Martin Steckert, a man who is in prison (but a really good guy) who wants to return to a special lake where he grew up as a boy. It was a unique place where he lived by nature, spent time with his dog and was alone to enjoy life. Soon she escapes to the movie and begins to return to the lake. <br /> <br /> Soon the policemen will find him, and Steckert catches the child as a hostage to convince the police to return outside. Soon Steckert and his hostage (the other Martin) will become the best friends and together they will experience many funny adventures - from robbing a toy truck, to a hi-jacking train, all on the way to this special lake. /> Throughout the film Steckert has wonderful memories of him in the lake as a boy. <br /> <br /> I will not go wrong, but I will tell you, this movie is obligatory. This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life! I am undoubtedly the biggest fan of this EVER movie! I managed to find a song that two Martina sing in the whole movie ("I'm going back to the place where I come from ...). I even plan a trip to Canada to see a lake and a house where Martin Day was filmed Crazy, I know - but this movie means so much to me.
