The original vampires (1998) belong to my favorites. I was curious to see how the sequel would work because they did not use any of the original characters. I was very surprised how it happened. As a rule, sequels are never as good as the original, with a few exceptions. Although this movie was not a great movie, the writer was good at keeping the main themes and knowledge of vampires from the first one. Jon Bon Jovi was initially a flaw, but he turned out to be half-decent Slayer. I doubt, however, that anyone can pass James Wood's performance at first unless ... bring Buffy! <br /> <br /> In total, it was a decent watch and I would watch it again. > <br /> However, I have two questions left ... what happened to Jacek Crow and how did Derek Bliss become a conqueror? I think we will have to leave it to the imagination.
