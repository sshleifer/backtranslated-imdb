The figure of the Danes finally let the Buddha have a terrible truth. "Leave me alone, kiss the men if you like," she shouts with conviction in front of everyone, thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long. Pretty girl. This may be a place to reconsider everyone about the giggling charm Danes pour into this figure, a great reason to feel compassion for her lying in bed and dying, but hey, remember, there are no errors, maybe except this movie. <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. This irony is intentional! It's actually a masterpiece of ironic humor, yes! But somehow I doubt that the creators of this movie meant, unfortunately. Maybe there are a few mistakes.
