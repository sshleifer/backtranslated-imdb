I admit that I have a weakness for alternative stories, from HIS GREAT LIFE to DAY GROUNDHOG by 12:01. Among those wonderful is this little gem. It is difficult to go through MR. DESTINATION without gratitude to any member of the cast, from cordial James Belushi to the murderous Courtney Cox. This film lacks gravity and scale to make it a great movie, but it's great on a rainy afternoon. It's also a great rental for an affordable date.
