From the very beginning you can see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra create such a fun team! The songs that sing together are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is great and really sweet. Dean Stockwell is the sweetest child actor I've never seen before. If you like to play the piano, you will be surprised by Jos√© Iturbi. This movie was the first one that combined animation with real actors and did it wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number. No doubt one of the funniest films of Kelly.
