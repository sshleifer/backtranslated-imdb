Honestly, I find this film too depressing for my own good. It is very depressing until the very end. I can not in any way justify issuing judgments to any character who did things I did not like (well, except for the hideous character played by Fredrick Forrest). But it is still frustrating when we see people behaving in this way, surrounding themselves with walls, as soon as one word can break the ice and promote healing. <br /> <br /> A terrible tragedy hits the Montana family. They believe that they have lost one son, but it turns out that they have lost 2. The key is that if they simply communicate with each other and struggle with their sadness, they will not lose their second son permanently. <br /> <br /> But they just can not. Something is blocking this family from sharing their sorrows. Some family retreats into silence and resentment, while others point to guilt (and then cheat on their poor pregnant wife, seducing a pretty girl deceased ... that Andy's figure is really a snake!) The only family member who somehow does not he threatens Arnold, is his grandfather (Wilford Brimley). Grandfather seems to be able to talk to a boy without judgment or even children's gloves. He seems to know what the child is thinking, though Arnold does not speak much these days. It's really a blessing for a poor kid to have someone to turn to. No one else realizes that Arnold can be shocked, denying, or that his way of grieving may not be in the same style or at the same speed as they would have expected. It is so easy to judge and be angry and feel that someone is "made of stone" just because they do not grieve in the way we believe they should. <br /> <br /> The story is very calm and naturalistic. You will not get any narration fed with a spoon or Hollywood resolution. I was very concerned that the child was so guilty that he felt hitchhiking a few hundred miles to apologize to Andy's wife for something he should not blame. Arnold could accidentally kill his brother, but no one is responsible for the end of this marriage, which was evidently bad, except for two in marriage. It's just stupid luck Arnold did not get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer. <br /> <br /> Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are frustratingly effective as parents who somehow can not communicate with their son alone to find out what Arnold is going through. Jason Presson, whom I have not seen anywhere except EXPLORERS 'favorite childhood and the horrifying ghost story called THE LADY IN WHITE, did an amazing job as Arnold, a great performance by a child actor. <br /> <br /> In addition to being a bit slow sometimes, THE STONE BOY is a great and very depressing movie.
