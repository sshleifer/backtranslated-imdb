Because this movie is entirely in the Swiss dialect, most German speakers are probably hard to follow this movie. I am not from Switzerland, but I worked there for several years, so I had the opportunity to understand this great trick of the Lord of the Rings. I've seen a lot of this type of movie (eg. A scary movie, lots of Scifi counterfeits etc.), but this one is the best of the kind I've seen so far. I give 9 out of 10. The only reason I can not give 10 is that there are a few small details that could be done better and because they did not provide any subtitles in any language on DVD, so there is almost no chance of non-Swiss understanding .
