Great entertainment from beginning to end. Great performances Belushi, Beach, Dalton and Railsback. Several twists and lots of action scenes. The movie was made for me! Funny lines in the script, good music. Dalton as a hard sheriff and Railsback as a "black dragon". I have to recommend this movie to every action fan! 10/10
