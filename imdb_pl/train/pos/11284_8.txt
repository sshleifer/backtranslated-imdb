When I was a kid, it was the time of Lex Barker as Tarzan. I have often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller was "Tarzan" and I would not understand why since I saw several recent Weismuller films in this character and I thought he was somewhat out of place. Not after many years I came across "Tarzan and his husband", and then I understood. Weismuller is in the form in this photo and has a presence and a rugged look whose characters do not meet yet other Tarzans, such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. <br /> <br /> Regarding this film, I was also surprised by the sensual presence of the beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, selfish, active and "uninhibited" woman as Jane before the time the movie was made (Tarzan is pressing her amused in the pond, one of the explorers kisses her in surprise and although he does not kiss him, in a sense he let him do a bit and he does nothing about it, such behaviors were unthinkable when the future "Janes", such as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart, all playing too perfectly sweet, helpless women who make it hard to believe that they can survive in a hostile place like the African jungle. <br /> <br /> Brilliant personality of the character O ' Sullivan steals the show of Tarzan himself, except of course the actions, and Weismuller easily takes over the lead, the combination is perfect. Another attraction in the film is the secondary role of Cheeta, not g home of the role as Tarzan in the later paintings, which often saves the day. <br /> <br /> "Tarzan and his friend" is a great product in his genre (Tarzan's Movies) and perhaps the best, although I must admit that I liked "Tarzan's Greatest Adventure" (1959) made with a higher budget and strong cast (and despite the fact that Gordon Scott was in the lead role) with his too-perfect "all gymnasial" physical appearance, which does not match the rustic monkey man. <br /> <br /> Good for Jane and her partner!
