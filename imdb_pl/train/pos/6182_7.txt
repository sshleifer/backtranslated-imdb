This mystery of murder with musical numbers is long in the atmosphere and character, but rather short in terms of tension and credibility. Based on the play of Broadway, Earl Carroll and others, he combines the crime story with the scenes (the murder investigation takes place on the opening day of the theater where the musical revue takes place). > The cast is impressive and varied: stupid fool Victor McLaglen as a police officer who investigates and never fails, going idiotically towards what is just in sight; Jack Oakie (Jack Lemmon pre-war? Is Jack Lemmon, post-war Jack Oakie?) As a harassed director who has to coordinate the staging, as well as chaos behind the scenes; always homey Jessie Ralph as a lover with deep, dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, who has a stunning monologue up close at the end, as a quivering chambermaid in love with male lead; Carl Brisson, a Danish star, the same man who leads the classic "Cocktails for Two" not once but twice; Kitty Carlisle, operationally depicting where they come from and where they are going, and other Johnston-Coslow songs; Glorious Gertrude Michael, who parted with us too early, as an upset dancer whose love for Brisson was rejected; usually funny Toby Wing, which at least here is the center of laughter playing jokes. <br /> <br /> When plot complications get out of control, there is always an interesting performer or a funny and melodic number to distract the viewer. The most known sequence of the film is the "Marahuana" number, led by Michaels, but apart from its controversial history, it is really one of the smaller music offers. All the songs here are displayed as if they could fit into the standard space of proscenium theater, in contrast to the cinematic imagery in the Busby Berkeley style.
