The French movie Ester Williams would love. But synchronized swimming was just a hook for the story of three girls from the Parisian exorcism who found themselves. There is no doubt where Sciamma's sympathy is, because all the boys are portrayed as "animaux", but in reality only 3 girls are in the spotlight and all the time, with a few adults and other teenagers in the background. Marie is a girl's chick, unattractive but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and forces herself to Floriane (beautiful Renaissance quality for one reviewer), and she is a friend of convenience for Anna: unattractive, but her time of perfection was short, and now she is a teenager in a woman's body. What is related to this is a journey to self-realization without a road map, but there are three who are not natural: where is the cheerfulness and thoughtless chatter of young people? While d√©nouement was breathtaking, and Floriane's self-absorption was beautifully presented, and the equally beautiful combination of Marie and Anne, it all seemed abstract, Sciamma's puppets.
