It looks like this movie is polarizing us. You like it or you hate it. I loved it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment you said, you must "feel" this one. <br /> <br /> Also at the beginning of the movie Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend is an image made by Monet - Impressionist painter. Monet's style is based on painting with tiny spots, so a close-up image looks like a mess, but from a distance you can determine what the subject is. Cruise mentions that the painting has a "vanilla sky". I believe that this is a tip for the film-maker. This movie is like this impressionistic painting. This is the impressionistic creation of movies! And it is no coincidence that the title of the film refers to this image. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical line story. It requires more thought. There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump and no, you will not always be sure what is going on. But in the end everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You have to concentrate on this movie, but I think people make a mistake by concentrating on it too much. After finishing it, you should think about it. If you try to figure it out as you grow, you will overwhelm yourself. Just let it happen ... "go" with this ... keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. <br /> <br /> I found all the performances at the highest level and thought that it was extremely unique, extremely creative and charming. <br /> <br /> will not criticize the intelligence of those of you who did not like it. It appeals to a certain taste. If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, provocative, challenging, spiritual movies, see them. If you prefer something a bit lighter, skip it. <br /> <br /> But if you like what I've described, you'll love it.
