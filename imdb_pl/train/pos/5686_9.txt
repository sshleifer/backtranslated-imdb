* Wonderland SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> July 1, 1981: five people, Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Susan Launius (Christina Applegate), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo) is attacked while sleeping and brutally hits the head with steel pipes in his home at 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA. Only Susan is going through. <br /> <br /> Main suspect: John Holmes (Val Kilmer), former king of porn, owner of a 30 cm long dick, and now hopeless addict. <br /> <br /> Two interrogators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Nico (Ted Levine), investigate the case and try to break it with a witness who claims that John at least participated in the murders, David Lind (Dylan McDermott ), Barbara's boyfriend, and tries to get a witness report from Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), a 19-year-old girl from Holmes and from Susan who sadly remembers nothing more than the shadows that night her husband's head was stuck and her fate met the same fate and the name of Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), the main drug king (who is always near women like Barbie (Paris Hilton)), appears as a suspect planner in the Wonderland massacre. <br /> <br /> But what happened that night? And can Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), John's wife, know something about it? "Wonderland" is a taught, intense thriller, a desperate love story and a story of a man's sad fall in one; there is a clever use of the "Rashomon" technique (we see the events of that memorable day and night in the eyes of David, John, Dawn, Susan (though very short) and Sharon), a nice direction and a great script, but it is above all convincing for performances, especially for Kilmer who occupies the central stage with his hopeless, tormented, sometimes childish Holmes, Lucas, whose Launius is strangely attractive, strong Sharon and the innocent Dawn Kudrow. <br /> <br /> Wonderland: 9/10.
