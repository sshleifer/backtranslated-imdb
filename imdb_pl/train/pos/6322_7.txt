This film was recommended to me by a friend. I never saw an ad nor a trailer, so I did not know Clooney was in it and did not care that his role was so small. It seemed to me that the entire cast was right and the movie was quite pleasant. The opening scene, with a small band of bandits standing on the side of the road, looking scourged and emaciated, immediately drew my attention. It had a way to tell you, "Do not go away; it will not be boring "and it really was not. It turned out to be an interesting, light comedy with enough twists to keep you in place until the end, but when it's over, I felt a bit cheated ... just a bit. Events have continued to evolve, so you expect them to continue building, but at a moment I can not define, in a sense it equalizes, ending with a slight disappointment. I think that I was expecting a greater climax, but it turned out to be a kind of low-key. If you watch a movie with that in mind and you can live without the high doses of George Clooney, you should consider this movie very funny and worth watching. Now I would like to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it is probably a rare find in the United States.
