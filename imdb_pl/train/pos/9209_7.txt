RATING STARS: ***** The Works **** Just misses the brand *** It's a bit between ** Lagging for * The Pits <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) is calmly doing the way in the Wild West when he sees a group of men bullying a woman. Being a gentleman, he naturally enters and stops it, killing the son of the nasty enforcer. This is just the beginning of the battle for all guns to the finish line, from which there will be only one winner. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star that has never really been able to take off with me. Maybe I discovered it too late and after I saw in it last Monday another movie, The Human Shield, it was another Dud (ha ha) added to the list. But I have something to do with westerns because movies that simply take me to a different time and place provide real escapist entertainment, and that's why Dudikoff chose one of his better scenarios because his movies go anyway. <br /> <br /> The film hits a few low points in the form of a naffish black character, sounding like an empty Marlon Brando and a few actors generally playing some actors, along with obligatory cheap sets. But if for some strange reason your life depended on watching Dudikoff's movie, it would be one of your best choices. ***
