To judge the film fairly, you have to think about the genre to be: a child. They had more clues to do to make this movie (which means he could not get away with a bit of humor or language from the first one), taking everything in this movie that was fun and enjoyable to watch. Sequences usually annoy me, but he did quite well. Knowing that Fraiser is not as powerful as George, they used humor and I believe that Showeman was doing quite well as a leader. The story is easy to follow and perhaps the camp sometimes suits a young audience well, if you want to watch a movie and hope to be honored, this is not it, but if you want to watch a simple, fun, full of energy this choice would be good.
