"Hitler: The Rise of Evil" was covered with controversy even before it was aired, and this controversy may obscure the realization of the film. <br /> <br /> Those who criticized the film they had not seen, so they did with good intentions, based on the wrong thought that it would be too compassionate for Hitler. However, they misunderstood the point: humanization of evil Hitler does not sympathize with him. It is far more unsettling to realize that unspeakable acts committed by one of the greatest villains of history have been committed by man. A sick, sick maniac, but certainly a man. It is necessary to know the history of how Hitler was able to come to power to prevent its repetition. <br /> <br /> "Rise of Evil" is accentuated by the brilliant, best career performance of Robert Carlyle, who makes Hitler human without redeeming him in any way. Carlyle unmistakably captured the appearance and mannerisms of the Nazi leader, never letting impersonation become cartoony or distanced us (something that Anthony Hopkins could not achieve when he portrayed Hitler in "Bunker", another very good TV movie ). While they were repelled by Hitler's depravity and virulent anti-Semitism, Carlyle gives him a certain magnetism and power that the real Adolf Hitler must have. Finally, while another nation would follow him? <br /> <br /> From various storylines, by far the most convincing features of Matthew Modine as reporter Fritz Gehrlich, who makes his life's work to draw attention to the reality of Hitler and Nazism. While Modine's performance is slightly better in Part 1, it seems that Part 2 has settled in it, the hero gives us a real hero in a movie full of villains. Peter Stormare and Liev Schrieber also give strong support. <br /> <br /> Part 1 of this two-part series of the past has suffered a bit due to excessive uncertainty, including a look at Hitler's childhood, which only lasts the opening time of the loans. In Part 2, sections describing Hitler's relations with his niece and lover Eva Braun are less effective than the central plot, but they serve to inspect his mental and emotional state. <br /> <br /> In the end, no film about Hitler can understand us. The average person is fortunately unable to understand a man who would try to exterminate the entire race of people. "Hitler: The Rise of Evil" tries less to understand Hitler and even more so that we understand how he has become a power. This is an important story to tell and one can not believe that anyone who has seen this movie would accuse her of having anything other than the best intentions and the ability to do anything but good. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10. *** 1/2
