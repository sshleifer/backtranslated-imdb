....... Playing Kaddiddlehopper, Cola San Fernando etc. The man was quite wide and screamed. I love to watch him interact with Amanda Blake, Don Knotts or whatever - he apparently had the ball and think that he also made it easier for his guests - as long as they knew that it was not disciplined, 19 he took on the type of production. Relax and be relaxed, it was clearly the name of the game. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of guys like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, and maybe Jerry Lewis. Great sense of time, old gags that for decades kept the audience seams, pure joy of what he did. His sad little clown he played in was also good - but in a tactile way. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's great, having just bought two DVD sets with his performances from 1961, brings his things back to me. I remember seeing him on TV at the end of his run when he finished the series in 1971. <br /> <br /> Check it out if you're a fan or an interesting person. He was a rebellion.
