At a time when Hollywood earns money by showing our weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs and war, this film reminds us of the concept of the "Unbearable Spirit." If you feel beaten, this movie will free your mind and raise you up. We all know how difficult life can be, sometimes we need to remind us that perseverance and courage will lead us. That's what this movie did for me and I hope it's for you.
