For the first film in the proposed series, it achieves the right balance. This is done with the style and class showing the early days of Modesta as a refugee and the beginning of her coming to power in the criminal world. I think this is a very honest / true portrait of her character exactly as the writer Peter O'Donnell intended. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is stunningly beautiful and a great choice. He behaves very convincingly as a person who has experienced hard moments with a cool / intelligent / innocent surface. And full marks for Tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role - much more reliable, for a new face to create this role. I can not wait for the next movie.
