This movie breaks you off your feet. This debut film by Tom Barman (known from the Belgian rock band dEUS) presents 8 intriguing people building a fascinating film mosaic. Each of them survives one day and one night in the metropolis of Antwerp. Bartender paints his characters with a lot of vigor and competently intertwines his individual stories, a concert tour reminiscent of the best works of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. A conglomeration of anecdotes surprises, moves and entertains; dialogues are so natural that they seem to be improvised. Great performances by Matthias Schoenaerts, Natalia Broods and an extremely entertaining duet from Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is an unforgettable "Windman", a bizarre guy dancing throughout the film. Sam is also responsible for the stunning choreography and of course Tom Barman himself took care of the super cool soundtrack. We were very impressed: Any Way The Wind Blows is a movie that breaks you off your feet.
