I saw it when I was small and was perfect. Kelsey White as Lisa and Meecy Mices, where sweet. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was interesting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. What Hilarius think Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. What a sad thing that Little Bunny Foo Foo who robs Meecy Mices on the head and then through the fairy, gives Little Bunny Foo Foo a few wishes and then turns into a goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, and Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This program is excellent, children will like this program, new words, songs and watch them while playing.
