A slow but beautifully set history of the American Revolution. Griffith's story seems far less complicated than in earlier historical epics, and his work is fully integrated with the action. Lionel Barrymore is a complete pig, Neil Hamilton is poor but murderous, and Carol Dempster is ... well, Carol Dempster is mostly angry at Griffith during this period, but he does not appear often enough to slow down the pace and drama. <br /> <br /> Note that the curiosities for this movie say that it appeared originally in just over 2 hours after the first release, but there is no cut that lasts more than 90 minutes. However, the dvd version was presented at a lower frame rate, which increases the voltage and restores it to just over two hours. <br /> <br /> Much better in terms of storytelling than sound versions such as PATRIOTA. Although this is not the best Griffith league, for example WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, the perfect way to spend a few hours.
