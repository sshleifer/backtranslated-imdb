Addictive, honest, bold and unforgettable psychological horror, which touches the painful experience of pain caused by rape - "Descent" is a film that went to the advice due to lack of distribution because, to be honest, the film is so brutal in its performances that if it was released theatrically, she could meet with some strong tendency hatred. <br /> <br /> The movie deserves to be discovered, not only its dark motifs and not only for its incredible direction and authentic style - but above all for its performances. Chad Faust is absolutely stunning, he brings enough disease and enough susceptibility to create it, not refer to him, but he understands this broken man with a distorted perspective on his sexuality not only with women who are raping, but also with uncertain deep uncertainties in my own self. . It is a supporting performance that is so complex, brave and emotional on the part of Faust. And it's hard to forget. <br /> <br /> However, Rosario Dawson stands out, whose performance is an absolute revelation. Extremely realistic dramatic tics and one of the most subtle, yet loud performances in a long time. While Dawson is seen in several good supporting performances in some great films, he proves that he has what it takes to deliver emotionally large and moving performances, reliably and thematically. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of this year (and 2007 was strong) - if this underestimated and intelligent film hit the cinema premiere, I would shout for it, like Dawson and Faust. It is a pity that it was too blunt to be able to invoke it. Such films deserve better!
