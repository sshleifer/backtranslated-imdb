B Film? Yes. DIY? Yes. The first movie? Yes. But aesthetically A +. This movie had definitely bad sound / editing / lighting / operation / etc etc. problems. However, this movie has many positive features. First of all, the most annoying figure dies first! Second, it is supposed to be a parody / funny movie Horror B Rated. The comments our killer makes to his victims have left me and my friends rolling on the floor laughing. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people try to make every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take what it is, a group of kids from high school made their first movie. It's just really good.
