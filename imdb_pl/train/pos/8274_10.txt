This movie is perfect. I find it very interesting. I thought the Wendigo legend was pretty cool. Acting was also great, as were the costumes, production, photography, direction and script. <br /> <br /> A very happy family on vacation is orphaned after they hit a deer. The hunter then appears and is very angry and indignant at the fact that one of the deer antlers is broken. Then he begins to persecute the family and strange things happen to them. <br /> <br /> See this movie. It is worth it. Recognition for cast, crew and filmmakers. Two thumbs up!
