Kurt Russell, whose career began when he kicked REAL Elvis in the movie It Happened At the World Fair, will probably never achieve his role as King in this biographical film, directed by carpenter and shocking Carpenter. Sometimes you feel that you are watching Elvis until something comes back to reality ... maybe the memories of the unfortunate Don Johnson of Elvis and the Queen of Beauty? All performances here are excellent: the Hubley season as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as a colonel, even Shelley Winters brings the right level of nerves and hysteria to its rendering Mommy Presley. <br /> <br /> Kurta Bing's father here plays Elvis's father, Vernon, and there's a great understated performance by Robert Gray as a friend of Elvis and Red West security guard. <br /> <br /> Must see for rock n roll fans.
