A very entertaining film from the east and the west, which was influenced by the closure of Flint GM in Michigan in the eighties and the growth and integration of Japanese automakers in the USA. He performs in western Pennsylvania and offers great performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe and George Wendt. Music of the legend of the blues Stevie Ray Vaughan.
