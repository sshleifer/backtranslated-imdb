"Casomai" is a masterful story depicting the story of a young couple who is breaking through the dark waters of a marriage. The story is very credible in the story of a strange vision between forgetfulness and constant interference of others, which is quite typical in Italy (you can, however, wonder if such events are different elsewhere). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing and this is one of the strengths of the film. The game of Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo is sober and thrilling. And the figure of a nice priest is fun and well rounded. In summary, a truly remarkable movie, probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
