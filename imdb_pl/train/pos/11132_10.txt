Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe is shocked by the haunted childhood. He has strong fear and hatred for religion because of his traumatic baptism. He throws a job as a dishwasher and goes out into the street for wealthy people. He meets unmatched Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and two on the relationship. They go out and work together, helping each other. They become thieves. They both grow extremely close and soon can not live without each other. But there is something very important that Ratso did not tell Joe, and maybe destroy all hope that they will survive the city together. This is one of the greatest films in history. It is a painful and shocking portrait of too lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other. Their story is devastating to watch, but ultimately it is important for people. This is one of those movies in which characters are almost like seemingly crazy people who can sometimes be found on the street. The difference is that this movie is from their perspective. Their lives are shown to us, and it's terrible to see how the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt, especially if we were once one of those people. However, the movie does not try to get you out of guilt. Instead, it shows the rough side of the lifestyle. This is not a pleasant and easy-going lifestyle, like in many Hollywood movies, such as MILK MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN. The lifestyle of a male hustler is a dirty, lively and ugly life, and it is sad that people have been depleted like Joe in this film. What surprised me the most in this film is that it appeared in 1969 and perfectly survived the test of time. Today's audience will continue to have great significance in this film and will continue to love and cherish it as well as critics and audiences everywhere in 1969. The film was rated as X, but what I noticed in this movie is that sexuality is presented in a much more honest, realistic and effective way. Anyone who has had sex before will know how funny, awkward and frightening it can be, and this movie does not avoid it. Sex in this film may not be as graphic as it once was. Movies that have been classified as X, such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, GREETINGS, LAST TANGO IN Paris and FRITZ THE CAT, seem to be extremely tame compared to the shocking things people can get today in the R ranking. Sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY will seem quite strong, but they are certainly not sexy. They are not graphic, but they are realistic and people should remember watching this movie. The language of the course that is used in the film, in particular the word "pedal", is used effectively and is not free. Violence is very shocking to watch even today, but again it is necessary for the conspiracy to represent the world of the hustler. I'm really happy that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not outdated and still has the same negative impact as in 1969, if not more. I can not recommend this classic enough and I hope that it will still find the audience, because it is a truly unique and unforgettable experience that will soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> PROS: <br /> <br /> -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both shocking and amazing. They have never played such roles before and are completely different than usual. You will forget who plays them in a few minutes! <br /> <br /> - Beautiful result <br /> <br /> - No old or camp movie like many movies from this decade like today <br /> <br /> - Fantastic and fast assembly work <br /> <br /> KONS: <br /> <br /> - Only for mature audiences <br /> <br /> - Opening scenes are well done, but they can be a bit stronger.
