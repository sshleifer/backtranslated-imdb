I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and I loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as a father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from parole in Alaska to his family in Brooklyn. He appears there because his brother died, and embarks on a journey to slowly repair his foreign relations with his brother's wife and child and his father, who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family. History takes us deeply into the hearts and minds of this family and allows us to better understand the complexity of their lives. The images of the wood industry and Brooklyn background also set a tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
