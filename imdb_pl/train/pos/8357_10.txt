A great, freely flowing, often lyrical movie that pulls you, always smiling, even if there are really shocking events along the way. One is gasping at the way women treat them, and yet they seem to be doing well and it is a great merit of all those involved that so many potentially catastrophic scenes work so well. This is probably the best performance of Depardieu, certainly the most natural one. Jeanne Moreau performs superbly in a role that must have been very difficult to play, including energetic sex scenes with a few guys aged at least half her age. Miou-Miou is cute and again has very difficult scenes to play. At first it seems to be a nasty and dirty misogynistic rant / romp, but when the story and characters evolve, a much more sensitive and honest picture appears. After all, this uncompromising and bold movie requires respect.
