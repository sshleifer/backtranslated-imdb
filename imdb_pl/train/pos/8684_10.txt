This is one of the first and best Columbos with Robert Culp and Ray Milland. Robert Culp appeared on another Columbo, as did several other villains, including Patrick McGoohan, William Shatner and Jack Cassidy. Ray Milland also appeared later. <br /> <br /> Ray Milland is convinced that his beautiful wife, played by Patricia Crowley, has an affair, so he hires Culpa to investigate. Culp has blackmail aside, so he gives Milland a false report and threatens Crowley if he does not pay. They're fighting at Culp's house and she's murdered. Go to Columbo. <br /> <br /> Culp does everything in his power to reject Columbo, including offering him a job, but Columbo is there from the beginning. <br /> <br /> A great episode.
