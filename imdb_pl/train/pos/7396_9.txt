Another outstanding foreign movie that accurately touches endless patches from Hollywood! It's a story of life and life. No, it's definitely not the perfect little life so often depicted in completely artificial Hollywood movies, but rather a real life full of real characters, each of which has strengths and weaknesses, just like real people in our lives and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of all these lives, intertwined in the walls of this bathhouse, especially her aging owner, is wonderful, moving heart and provoking to think. <br /> <br /> Sit, relax and get carried away by a simple and beautiful life. There's real wisdom in this movie if you just open it up. <br /> <br /> You will not be disappointed.
