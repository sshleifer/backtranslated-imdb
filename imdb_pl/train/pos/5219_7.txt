Gere and Danes play 2 employees in the public security department who follow released sex offenders. Gere, who plays Babbage, describes them as his flock. Gere is obsessed with vigilance, who is on his way. He trains, newcomer Allison, to take over his job. Gere sees his pack as very sick, disturbed puppies. Asks them questions that are not on the list, and tries to act like the police and solve crimes. He is constantly warned about this behavior, hence the reason why he is being replaced. During the last few days of work, a young girl has gone missing, and Babbage is certain that one of his flocks has gone astray. He and Allison narrow down the list and discover that some criminals have been SLOWED. So he decides to follow the missing girl instead of helping the police. This part is a bit stretched. <br /> <br /> This film shows sick, twisted things. Like when Babbage and Allison go to this building, where a group of sick people do things that interfere with each other. There are also people who kidnapped a girl. At the end of the movie, we see who the sick weirdies are. However, I would not call this movie excessive, because it can not be seen too much in the film. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERSION: If you like thrillers and films about serial killers and cops that hunt down killers, you'll like it.
