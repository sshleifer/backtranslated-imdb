If any style of film could be called my "pleasure of guilt", it would be a typical kind of fantasy. He is, however, guilty of a bad word because I am very pleased that I am an escapist from time to time. "Stardust" is a good stock fantasy that you can expect from Neil Gaimanie (or Gaiman's adaptation). This is not Mirrormask's visual dream, it is not an excuse for an adult Pan's Labyrinth, and it is not a class that loves to play The Princess Bride, but it contains what a fantasy lover is sufficiently familiar with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing. Fantasy enthusiasts should be happy - special effects have finally become good and cheap enough, so that these things are now in regular production. <br /> <br /> The story of Star Dust involves a young man named Tristan, who, in order to obtain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town Wall, embarks on an adventure to recover a fallen star. To make it difficult, however, Tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named Yvaine and is not the only person who is looking for her ... some witches have greedy eyes on the immortality that a star's heart can give, and on a brother's breach of a magical kingdom leads a murderous princes in her direction. <br /> <br /> From there everything is quite predictable, but it is associated with some attractive fantasy elements, a warm commentary on the nature of love and the best part, Robert DeNiro as a gay pirate. In this respect, DeNiro's performance is in place ... it's not the excessive lisping that most actors use to portray gays, but surprisingly effective from someone who has been seen as a rough and harsh typographic (and so a continuous joke surrounding his character) for DeNiro's own opening to alternative forms of acting). DeNiro is not so special for his image from Brazil, and that says something. <br /> <br /> Stardust is a kind of film that can last for a long time on shelves for children and fans of fantasy. I can not say that it offers something new, but it really is not. It is those who are most familiar with the tracks who will enjoy the most. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
