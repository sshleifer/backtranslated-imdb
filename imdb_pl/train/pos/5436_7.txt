For years, I thought that this knockout comedy was a product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaglen as one of the leaders. He certainly has the same rough home humor that Ford associates his films with. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I found out that it was George Stevens who directed it. I still do not believe that this movie was not offered to John Ford, but he was probably in Monument Valley, creating Stagecoach. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen together with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. sergeants in the Indian army who have a nice colleague / companionship / camaraderie. But the old gang is falling apart because Fairbanks is engaged to Joan Fontaine. Not if his two friends can help him, helped by the regimental Gung Din beast played by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> The poem by Rudyard Kipling was the inspiration for this RKO film about barracks life on the British Paradise. The comical lead game is so good that it obscures the unbelievably racist message of the film. It was not that the creators were racists, but that was the assumption of the British at the time, including our leaders, and Gunga Din shows it most effectively. <br /> <br /> The British increased the number of India, doing business here and there with the local rulers under the weak Mogul emperor, which was liquidated in the mid-nineteenth century. They rarely ruled India, it would be impossible. Their governments depended on the native branches that you see here. Note that soldiers can not rise above the rank of corporal, and Gunga Din has much lower status. <br /> <br /> Note that rebels are in fact Hindus, not Muslims. There are as many strains of this religion as there are Christian sects, and this strangling cult was quite real. Of course, for those who are strangled, they may not have the same view of their liberators. But as long as India did not organize the independence movement until the Congress Party was established, these people were the voice of free India. <br /> <br /> But whatever you cut it, strangling people is not pleasant. and the British had their point of view here. When I watch Gung Din, I think about Star Trek and the flood for which the first directive was made. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant had to play his real dick here, not the grumpy Cary we were used to. Fairbanks and McLaglen cope well with roles that are completely adapted to their personality. <br /> <br /> The best role in the film, however, is Eduard Ciannelli as a guru, head of cult strangler. Pay attention to the fire and passion in his performance, he blows everyone off the screen when it's on. <br /> <br /> The favorite scene in Gunga Din is Ciannelli calling his soldiers to their mountain temple. Notice how Stevens gradually darkens the background around Ciannelli until you see your eyes and teeth like a ghostly mask for Halloween. Haunting, frightening and very effective. <br /> <br /> It was just after the action of this film in the late nineteenth century that more and more British public began to question the basic assumptions justifying Paradise. But this is the subject of Gandhi. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is still a great movie, funny and funny. It should be shown from A Passage to India and Gandhi, and you can determine how the Indian independence movement evolved.
