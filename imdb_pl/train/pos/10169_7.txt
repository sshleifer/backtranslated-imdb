Over Her Dead Body was a nice, small movie. It was decent and fun, and at the same time it was quite fun. There were a few stereotypes, but most things were fresh. At first I did not think it would be good at all when it began. However, if you manage to go through the first 20 minutes, the movie will start to get more and more interesting. This movie was not exploding with hilarious laughter, and whether OH MY GOSH was not great. you can sit back and enjoy how pleasant it was. I do not understand how this movie was bad. This rating is a bit too low. I could deal with 5.5, but with 4.8? 1 is disgraceful. It was pretty good and there was nothing terrible about giving him 1, which most people gave him.
