It suits the musical Sunday to stimulate your heart and no one can do it better than Little Richard. The man could sing drawers from women and define rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Look at Leon to provide a definitive look, as he did with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. 'n' Roll: the story of Alan Freed. <br /> <br /> It was a fascinating biographical film, when we saw how Little Richard is struggling with his father, with his church and himself over who he was. He won the battle and there is no one else who has his voice or style.
