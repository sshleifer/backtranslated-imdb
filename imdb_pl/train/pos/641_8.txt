This program has a few stereotypes and a few on top, moments reminiscent of Creek Dawson (16-year-old tells about returns, when life makes sense?), But generally it seems to be a decent show. Most of the heroes seem very real, and history seemed to move well in the pilot - ending with a good lesson in the end. I just hope that every episode will not change life, like the first one, which would be just too dramatic for this vehicle. Jeremy Sumpter does a great job as a teenager with a passion for baseball. I believe that many of us may refer to his admiration and sometimes to the tunnel for the band he always wanted to have.
