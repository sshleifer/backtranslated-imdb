I thought this movie was really great because in the cinemas in India everything you see is leather, music and bad acting ... in this movie you can see tradition, ethnicity and at least some decency ... although some parts were a little bit dramatic, guess what? that's what Indian cinema is all about! after watching this movie, at least you do not feel a headache because of all the loud overrated music or any violence, it's only true, teaches love and of course taking care of the person you love all your life ... I think it was an amazing movie. .. Children can see it without a doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that once was a certain depth of India ... until all of these rap hits, miniskirts and skin shows have become a part of it.
