I watched the McCoys convention and I was pleased to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! To see them now, it was wonderful because I always watched the adolescent program, so when the TV said that the meeting would take place, he was so excited !!!! The only thing I could not figure out was why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke) were not there. I know Walter Brennan died. So I got into my computer and tried to find out about them and find this site, so if there's anyone who can tell me what happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke, I would be grateful !!) I searched every day and not I had luck, the only thing I could learn about Michael Winkelman was that he was supposed to be born in 1946. This show had the value and morality that each show gave a lesson that you can learn. The whole cast was amazing, the only thing it would be better than meeting them, because it is impossible, if there is someone who can help, please !!!
