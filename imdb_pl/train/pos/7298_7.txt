It's about a mad scientist who creates a half-shark - a human half-human on an unknown island, and then calls all his former people and academic colleagues to come and see his work (bad laughter), but in fact he wants his shark he killed them! Many bad GCI, stupid story elements and babes sweating in tight shirts follow them. <br /> <br /> These monstrous movies have a similar formula, but this one gives a bit of humor (I guarantee the people who did it, they had firmly embedded tongues on the cheek), not to mention sexy babes. But let's mention these sexy babes - a few hot staves, in tight shirts, sweating profusely. One is in her undies at the beginning, the other at the end. Thank you, thank you, the creators of bad movies! The plot is full of stupid things, a guy is jeeping a jeep, hits him straight into a tree, and then he proposes that everyone should land a helicopter from the island. Yes, um, well, what are we thinking about for a moment; we'll be back to you. A shark is funny - or a terrible CGI or a comedic guy in a rubber suit. Crazy scientist gives quite good results; He's angry, he's motivated, he's not apologizing. <br /> <br /> In general, if you want a stupid FUN B movie, this one should do this job.
