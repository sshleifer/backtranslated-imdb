The combination of excellent black and white photography and "Eugene Onegin with an unexpected story" meant that it was a real fear for me. The atmosphere created by mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasionally very bright overexposed proteins was catchy. There was a great moment in which the foils - seemingly conventional photos from the holidays, but where the faces of the actors subtly, but immediately showed the character and the situation - were shown in the company of the thrilling aria Lenskiego from the opera Tchaikovsky Eugene Onegin. <br /> <br /> For me, the sign of a good movie is that it should use the opportunities created by this medium, which means that history is often less important than images and atmosphere - last year in Marienbad a good example of such movie. Krisana is in the same form.
