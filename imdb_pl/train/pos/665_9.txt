"And All Through the House" is a special episode of the crypt not only because it comes from the first season, but this episode was the first one I saw! I remember that as a young man on vacation with my parents this summer in 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO, I saw this episode and I was buried in the Crypt just then and forever! I've always been a fan of a series of horror movies and I liked monster movies, and thanks to this series started by HBO I had a terrible pleasure again. This episode, which I saw first, is unforgettable for me and one of my favorites, it is just so pleasant and pleasant. "And All Through the House" has a pleasant, cozy setting on the snowy Christmas Eve, which is an ideal way to relax during festive cutting! In any case, you have Mary Ellen Trainor (who plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy wife who looks after her husband, waiting for money and a new affair. Just as with most horror movies, things get meaningful for the worst, and bad people get what they deserve. Chances are very big when a maniac dressed up as Santa Claus escapes from the local house of nuts, which makes a holiday on Christmas Eve! As with the old comic lessons of E.C., you learn that bad people get what they want! Well, this story ends with a perfect holiday scream! This story was also in the movie from 1972 and included Joan Collins, it is undoubtedly one of my favorites and probably one of the classic episodes of all time!
