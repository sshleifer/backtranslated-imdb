Drunk with symbolism and full of great pictures, Extase is more than an erotic drama that we all expect. It is almost silent cinema, in which there is a dialogue in German and a highly simplified German language. Perhaps the creators of the film wanted the film to reach the widest possible European audience, because anyone who can easily learn German can opt out of the subtitles. History does not matter, because the film is successful at the cinema level, not narrative. Symbols of fertility and power of nature overwhelm human figures - there are even scenes in which flowers cover the face of the alleged star Hedy Lamarr - and there are moments that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to convey, I think it is a political film: the bourgeois man is shy and powerless; a working-class man is a happy, productive creature; and the woman is a creator destined to be unfulfilled until she gives birth to a child. This mixture of Soviet socialist realism and national socialist dogmas does not overwhelm the film in any way - it's a beauty to watch from the beginning to the end - but places it in a very explicit artistic era. And, oh yes, Hedy makes her a set.
