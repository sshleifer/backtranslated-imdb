After seeing Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor should ever show such self-importance to imagine that he could ever get close to the portrait of Mr. Brett, "one of the most interesting figures in literature." Jeremy Brett TO Sherlock Holmes and in my opinion it can not be different. I must admit that the great actor Basil Rathbone is close to the second, but he is still the second. One would argue that Mr Rathbone's scenarios were worse than the absolutely top-class production Mr Brett gave me and that I would agree. However, when everything is said and done, Jeremy Brett will always and forever be the only actor who really "becomes" Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this subject, and we, the audience, have left the unique performances of Mr. Brett. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
