This program is great fun, and the title song is so catchy that I can not get it out of my head. I'm getting more and more drawn by wrinkles that do things, and these four are perfect in their efforts. Some of what they do are scandalous, but brilliant, given that in our PC world today we would never be able to do it in real life. I always learn something from shows. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy and a bit of forensics, you'll love this program. It reminds me of Quincy, ME in one way and Barney Miller in a different way in which they work and react with each other. They spoil a lot, but they do their job and it counts.
