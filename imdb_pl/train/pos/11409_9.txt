When Philo Vance (Edmund Lowe) stands awkwardly on the edge of the balcony high above the city, apparently hypnotized and just before he died, I immediately recalled an almost identical image from another film made nine years later "The Woman in Green" in which Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) similarly throws himself into space, being hypnotized. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes experience attempts to murder unscrupulous criminals. An exciting cinematic tension in both scenes. When will they learn that you can not hide the minds of the great fictional detectives?
