It took me some time to watch this version, because unfortunately I can not rent it in the video store, only a different version, but I fell in love with it. I've always been on the border with the other Emma. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, because they are not British, naturally have to stress, and for me it does not seem natural. It seems to be imposed. I'm sorry, but do not think that Toni and Gwenneth did a great job there. I could not warm up to any of the characters, but this version is a more warming heart and more of the type of person I imagined was Emma. This is definitely the version to which I will come back from now. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley did not look better, but he is convincing. I also like Jane Fairfax better (played by Olivia Williams). I never warmed up to it in the movie version, but it is better presented in this version. Think about it (except Mr Knightley) all characters are played better and a lot less. Unfortunately, both appeared more or less at the same time, and the Paltrow version gained more publicity. It's a pity ...... I also love the new scene at the end. Well done to Kate Beckingsale! Therefore, if you are a Jane Austen fan, do not forget to watch this.
