From the great acting game of the extremely impressive cast to the intelligently written (and highly cited) script, from sumptuous cinematography to the beautiful music of Carter Burwell, Rob Roy offers a rare film experience: one that is almost impossible to find a fault in any area. <br /> <br /> Several comparisons were made with Braveheart, which appeared in the same year. With all appreciation for Mel Gibson, Braveheart struck me as too much self-conscious and polite epic to rival Rob Roy, as a kind of movie that I would like to see more than once. While Braveheart works hard to be a serious epic, Rob Roy simply grabs you and absorbs you into a tightly edited story. One scene is not wasted. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy has an ideal balance between dramatic tension, action, and even occasional humor. The characters are well-modeled, they perfectly convey the vernacular and manners that anchor them in their authentic time. <br /> <br /> What's more, they are not caricatures of good and evil, which are too often seen even in a modern movie. <br /> <br /> For example, although we hope that the heroic Rob Roy will win, we realize that his troubles are the product of his own pride and sense of honor. Tim Roth plays one of the most hateful villains in cinema history, but there are times when we can understand how events in his life shaped him into who he is. Rob Roy applies a character development level that makes his story even more credible and addictive. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a great treasure, containing one of the greatest swordfights ever directed, and a climate ending worthy of all tense expectations.
