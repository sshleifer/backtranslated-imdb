This little movie has long been on my list of "caregivers." Do people realize how stressed, menopausal, emotionally used women (as well as mentally retarded) were REALLY treated by doctors at the turn of the century? !! All the pious, Christian attitudes of those times were deadly for discovering TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, let alone examine what it means to accept our humanity. Can you really imagine (according to today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he considered women to be emotional and emotional reactions as big as a man's? Think about it! The sensitivity of this film still draws me in and gives recognition to the director for capturing this in his eyes.
