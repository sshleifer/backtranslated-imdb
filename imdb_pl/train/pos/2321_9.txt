Here is the kind of love story I like to watch. And mainly for two reasons. First of all, it focuses on young people, VERY young people. People who are still teenagers and experience love for the first time or at least think they are. We were all there in our lives, and the "Man on the Moon" is a great reflection of our memories, perhaps adding a few more details and strengthening them further than any of us experienced. The second reason is a love triangle. And I believe that as teenagers it is the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe that the characters really can be in love, or just are so beloved, that they just believe strongly that they are, and after the tragedy, if it happens, they will believe it for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> The cast of "The Man on the Moon" is full of great, talented names. It features Sam Waterston, who is a truly versatile actor capable of playing hard district lawyers as well as harsh but caring and wise fathers, like in this film. There is also Tess Harper, Jason London and a young, young Reese Witherspoon. You look at a young, talented actress at the age of fourteen and you think that about ten years later she will win an Oscar. All cast members make great performances and, thanks to the dialogue of a convincing script, they look like real people in real situations. As if all this really happened. The type of movie I would like to see appears more often. A love story or not. I would like to see movies that make everything look real and is not in any way false or unreliable.
