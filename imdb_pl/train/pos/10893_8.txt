It's good that I borrowed the movie before I saw the viewer's rating from this page. It was a great movie that I will add to my Christmas selection. The cast was greatly chosen, and Ben Affleck plays the main role. I would say to viewers who have not seen the movie to buy it. I judge it for Christmas. The film was very funny and well written, and Ben plays very well the eccentric rich performer. The things that he says and do is how I imagine a person who has too much money to act. The film is much more fun than Santa Claus and Christmas with Frames. Plus it has a good storyline and teaches the true meaning of Christmas, which means you can not buy love for money.
