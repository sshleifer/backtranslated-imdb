Australian Fred Schepisi (A Cry in the Dark) is directing this comedy / romance, which is fun, relaxing and set in spring. You will laugh while watching this movie. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) is a car mechanic, Ed Walters, with a high IQ, which grows with the help of Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them about their shoes. Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, You have a post) is Catherine Boyd, Einstein's niece who is a competent but not very reliable mathematician. Maybe because he's surrounded by all this genius. He thinks that if he marries someone with a high IQ. her children will have a high IQ. also, but she does not know what she wants. Between Tim Robbins, the sweet smile and smartness of Meg, it's a refreshing movie. I love sweet stories. People of all ages should enjoy this movie. Catherine is engaged to the jerk James Moreland, who works in the behavior of animals, but is very stuffy. This is a kind of first contact contact between the mechanic and the mathematician. Witty lines and subliminal lines! The photos are nice. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the spring. With great help from all these brilliant men, Catherine falls for Ed, not knowing that he is a car mechanic. <br /> <br /> Favorite scenes: Ed takes a multiple-choice test before the crowd with the help of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein are riding a motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris release all the research animals! <br /> <br /> Favorite quotes: Albert Einstein: "Do not let your brain interfere with your heart". Ed Walters: "When was the last time you said" Wahoo ""? Catherine Boyd: "I'm sure I do not know." It's a refreshing movie, I recommend it. I have a tape and I will watch it once in a while.
