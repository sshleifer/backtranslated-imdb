This film seems to me one of the most successful attempts to obtain reliable answers to some nagging questions that have emerged in recent science about the relationship of "Passion" (suffering and death of Christ) in the New Testament. (What motivated Judas if money was not a problem What would a Sanhedrin meet on a high holy day? Why Pilate?). A movie for serious, thinking Christians: fans of the "Passion of Christ" will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of a bloody performance and arc. As for me, I think that the portrait is painted here - the willingness of ordinary people to carelessly dedicate to common decency, when their own interest is at stake - much more realistic and deeply disturbing. (Unselfish, "just doing your job" look at the face of a man who stabs the first nail into the wrist of Christ, is as freezing as at any moment in the film). they invariably feel more "righteous" than many other highly valued efforts. It is a slow movie, but if you accept its imposed restrictions (after all it is "Death" - not Life - "Christ"), it is ultimately very satisfying.
