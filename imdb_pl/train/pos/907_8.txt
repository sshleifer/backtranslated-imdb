It is a shared family story showing all the ethics that every person should follow when communicating with every relative in the area. desi intends to tie a knot with Amrita Rao, who is also very Desi, and also works pretty well ... The genre of the movie is the same as HAHK and such films deserve to be done in India to revive old traditional values ​​.... Videos do not have 10 because they are not very good in music, which is very important in every film, besides it is flawless ....
