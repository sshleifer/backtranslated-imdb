I saw this movie because it was the second movie on the album containing the previously banned movie Nasty 'Blood Rites'. Because Blood Rites was totally horrible, I really did not expect much after this movie; but it really seems that the trash director Andy Milligan has gone through himself this time, because Seeds of Sin is stylish at the forefront of Blood Rites and is as tall as more than the corresponding sexploitation piece from the sixties. The plot is quite similar to Blood Rites, because we focus on the dysfunctional family and of course; a fall is at stake. The film is shot in black and white, and the appearance and style remind me of the classic "The Curious Dr Humpp." There are almost no shows, and the director seems more focused on sex, with incest motives and hatred pervading. Acting is usually kitschy, but most women appear at some point in the nude and despite their poor reputation, director Andy Milligan seems to have an eye for this type of thing, because many of the sequences in this movie are actually quite beautiful. The plot is paper thin, and most of the film is a filler; but the music is catchy, and the director does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves, because most of them are slightly erotic. Overall, this is not a great movie; but it can appeal to a cult fan and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality "Blood Rites".
