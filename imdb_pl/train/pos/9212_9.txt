Yesterday I went alone to the cinema, because here in Mexico, most of the films from other countries are part of the so-called "cam√°ra alternativa" (alternative camera). But after watching this movie, I realized that not all foreign films are alternative. Unfortunately, this is a good example. But I must say that I liked the film so much ... that I was finally happy ... this movie is a small spoon of hope these days. The main lesson for me is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. It's a good option to see a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention good music ... especially the main movie song .. Cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena .... Excellent song! !!
