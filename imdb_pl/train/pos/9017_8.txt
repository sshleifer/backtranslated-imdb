This film perfectly captures the fate of the suffering from ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). The subject is carried out with compassion and humor. Helena Bonham Carter is as persuasive as an ALS person that it was hard for me to believe that she only played. Kenneth Branagh, a great actor, meets the expectations of a bizarre artist who is behaving badly and is compelled to accompany Helen as part of his "social service," an alternative to jail time. Watching the development of the relationship between the two is a feast from beginning to end. The fact that it is a fairy tale does not diminish fabulous performances. I care for two of them deeply.
