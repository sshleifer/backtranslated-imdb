Yesterday I watched the movie for the third time. He was recommended to me by fried a few weeks ago. I have never watched it before, or even noticed it, because it falls (so typically) in the category of "Swedish film", and those who were (like me) in Hollywood productions are skeptical about any foreign films. What a paradigm shift! The film touches me because it supports my hope that humanity can change for the better. The Swedish village is only a model for all areas of the earth, where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions, hidden brutality, but also the ability to play, meet, sing ... Need a trigger from the outside to snatch the masks to all (who hold them) and let them feel that we are all just people with the desire to live their lives. I can never stop seeing such stories because it supports my hope as described above. The five minutes that contain the story of the Gabriella song, including her performance, is one of my most important events in history! Thank you, Kay Pollak, only for 5 minutes, which made me happy!
