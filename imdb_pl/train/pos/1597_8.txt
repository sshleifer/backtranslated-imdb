It is a kind of film for a snowy Sunday afternoon, when the rest of the world can run its own business, going down to a large armchair and mild for several hours. Wonderful shows Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) gently paddle along the plot. There are no rapids to cross, no dangerous waters, only warm and witty rowing through the life of New York at its best. Family film in every sense and deserving praise.
