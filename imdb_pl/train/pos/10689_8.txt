As usual in the stereotypical Hollywood EVERYTHING in the film. But this one is a classic - from a tense banker with a white collar to a Russian woman !! Good job. Even the facial expressions were great! The language was excellent (even in Russian) and Nicole did a great job !! Hey guys - you get what you pay for :)
