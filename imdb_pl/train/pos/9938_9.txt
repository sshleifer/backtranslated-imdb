For our bilingual children we bought a DVD set "Es war einmal das Leben" (German) / "Once Upon a Time ... Life" (English), because everyone loved "Es war einmal der Mensch" (German) / "Seria" Dawno a long time ago "(English) (our parents saw it as children) and exceeded even high expectations! The series is very well made, it does not show its age, and our children of all ages really like watching it. At the same time, they learn things that parents did not know until later. The series covers everything that concerns the human body with organs, all senses, blood, infections, antibodies and many more in the animated 20-25-minute episodes. Topics that some people may consider "reasonable", such as digestion and reproduction, are discussed in a tasteful, discreet and child-friendly way (the reproduction episode begins mainly where the child begins to grow), and at the same time (as usual) informative and funny. <br /> <br /> Children are usually fascinated by how their bodies work, and thanks to episodes they understand it in the context of their surroundings. The episode format switches between the outside world (family with two children) and the interior of the body. For example, in an episode involving infections, the boy cuts accidentally and the wound is infected, and the episode involves the body's response. Similarly, episodes of the senses, eg hearing, seeing, combining what is happening inside the body, with the context of the external world, and the episode of breathing and circulation of oxygen in the blood encompasses the entire life cycle, including (briefly) where the oxygen (plants) comes from. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best programs for children - I would say that it is a must for every family with children!
