It's an amazing looking movie, entirely made in six or seven colors. When he appeared over 15 years ago, he stunned the audience with his color scheme, being so different from anything ever filmed. These colors, at least for me, make it an absolutely fascinating movie to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes that I would like to freeze and somehow convert them into a picture to study their works. <br /> <br /> Characters and history do not match the size of photography, but they're all on top, especially villains. Famous actors who played here had to have a great time on the set playing "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips", "Mumbles" etc. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she is as sweet and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo, as a young boy Dick and Tess taking under his wings. The other colorful characters are Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names they know, but they are too numerous to list here. Check out the full credits on the home page and you will be surprised. <br /> <br /> The only negatives I've found are Pacino's voice, which after a while makes you mad, Madonna's singing voice and the fact that the film will be better cut about 10 minutes. These "mistakes" are all minor, because in general, it's a funny movie .... a cartoon strip comes alive in incredibly colorful fashion ... like nothing you've ever seen.
