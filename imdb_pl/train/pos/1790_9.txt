I love this movie and it is a great example of a family threat, a romantic love story and a very sad storyline. Everything was so perfect and perfect in this movie. It was such a great mix of actors and actresses, and with some laughter and many shouts this movie deserves many awards. With the mention of a beautiful scenario and although I would like to refer this film to "Notepad" and "Family Stone", it was much more cunning, sad and genius than these films. The evening tells a love story between an old woman dreaming of her younger years and her two daughters staying with her while it is not good. The story goes so far and so great that I was sitting on the edge of my seat. You really get to know all the characters and at the end I wanted to see them again. It is an extremely sad and lively movie that is truly one of a kind and should be watched by everyone for how great it really is. All performances are amazing, and the movie captures your attention from the beginning and never lets go. I loved it and I'm glad I watched it because it was a really amazing movie ...
