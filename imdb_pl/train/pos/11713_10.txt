I think it took a lot of courage to do that. It is a pity that when a celebrity suffers, it helps people the most. But in her case, what she did was unusual. I have been in the field of mental health for five years and I think it's great that mental illness is no longer a terrible word and I believe it has helped. I always thought it was great and it will always be. I am glad that she wrote this book and that the film was made. She is an extraordinary woman and I hope she will continue to work. She went through a lot and stood in front of her. I would really like to see her more work with children, especially with children's actors. Her attempt should not happen and I think she would be great as a mentor for young people. The film was so moving for me that I was very touched. Suffering from the TBI that caused the onset of my disorder and PTSD, it's good to know that someone has the courage to show their lives like her. I believe that this has helped this nation, and people generally realize that they are like them and that there is help. Thank you, Mrs. Duke, or Annie, who you'll ever prefer.
