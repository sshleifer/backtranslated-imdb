Rich alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall's secretary. He marries her and is so happy that he stops drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks's best friend, Rock Hudson. And sister Nymphomaniac Stacks, Dorothy Malone, lusts Rock. Throw a few complications and the movie will get out of control (in a good way). <br /> <br /> A very shiny film in a beautiful Technicolor with stunning fashion and furniture (check out the Bacall hotel room at the beginning). They all look perfect and dress in beautiful, matching clothes. Basically, it's a soap opera with class A production values. The story itself is great and some of the dialogue is fun at first. Hudson, Stack and Bacal's acting is not very good, but seeing them so young and charming is great ... especially Stack ... when he smiled, my knees weakened! In turn, Dorothy Malone is fantastic - she deserved the best supporting role for the role. She's sexy, brutal, cruel and nice ... all convincing. <br /> <br /> Funny, shiny garbage. Do not miss it!
