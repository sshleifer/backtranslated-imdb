Imprisoned: buried alive takes us to the center, which has just opened, and will soon close. <br /> <br /> We start with a guy in an inventory planting a snowdrift to avoid the possibility of avalanches. it does not make sense anyhow. in any case, he is going to blow one particularly large when he notices that the center is open. despite his best efforts, the higher authority tells him that his day is over. <br /> <br /> shortly, as everyone expects, an avalanche hits. <br /> <br /> Listen, I will not reveal more, I can only say that it was a B movie designed for a family channel (which I just saw, and the fact that there are no ads, which means that it is a B movie ), is quite a decent movie, but partly unrealistic. <br /> <br /> first hand, when people are buried by ice and snow, they are buried. not only tracked by powder. or what about a screwdriver CD? this is not possible. and finally, what I can not stress enough is that the explosion can not stop the avalanche, guaranteed. <br /> <br /> in addition, it is worth renting or watching on television, but is not the owner. 7/10. <br /> <br /> The movie is rated as PG, but maybe he should have received something stronger. the boy almost loses his foot in the elevator, but his leg is cut around the ankle, the guy is roasted with electricity and diesel, and in the weight room dead people lie around. <br /> <br /> have fun.
