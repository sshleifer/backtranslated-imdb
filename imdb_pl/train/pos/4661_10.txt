I can only repeat the praise of other reviews here. It is a delightful movie with a good sense that it achieves without exceeding the limit of sentimentality. Naturally sweet - no added sugar. <br /> <br /> One small point: it seems to me that the mild objections raised by Pendelton, the hero of Ustinov, who is able to enter and overcome system security, ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / scholar in such matters. Yes, the movie was quite an illiterate computer, but it showed Pendelton "studying computers" in his apartment, and I think the implication was that his gifts just let him devour the whole subject, virtually overnight. <br /> <br /> There were some strange moments when in some scenes it appeared that Gnatpole tried to check Pendelton's knowledge and name his bluff. I'm not sure if we were to believe that Pendelton cleverly dealt with these situations, or whether he was competent enough to pass tests - it was a bit vague. <br /> <br /> Surely he must have known enough to set up fake accounts. Presumably, Wallach and Ustinov relied on their own vague idea of ​​how computers worked in those days, and to understand in detail what was happening, one must know what their concept was. They knew that there was something important in "procedures"; they believed that "intelligent light" can control safety, not just indicate its condition; they believed that the functions of the (stupid) user's terminal would have a strong influence on what can be done on the mainframe itself - although, apart from elements such as graphics, I do not see it myself. <br /> <br /> Mainly I think that they tried to avoid the subject of real computer operations as much as they could, and they did it quite well. Giving them some artistic license, I do not think their efforts have any drawbacks worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> CD
