Nice character development in a pretty cool environment. Being a man, I probably do not qualify to completely understand it, but from the beginning they do well in a restrictive Victorian environment. It is not as gloomy as it was in reality, and the treatment of women was probably even sharper. What makes it go is great chemistry among the main characters. Everyone has their "thing" that they struggle with. When they leave the rain and break out of the spider's network, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I liked about this film is that it was not intended for a cheap comedy. It did not try to throw in the lesson. People who seem completely worthless are really well-developed people who see the light. I had little trouble with the character of Alfred Molina, who had such a revelation so quickly, but in this world had to happen. Good acting around with something positive in the lives of some good people.
