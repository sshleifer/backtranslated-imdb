The new history page of Victoria and Albert was brought to life by director Jean-Marc Valle. Most cursory thoughts of Queen Victoria apply to women who ruled for several decades and lived in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable of the title role, because it gives viewers a different perspective. He presents Victoria in his youth, joining the throne and early years. Blunt's Victoria, both fresh and restrained throughout the film. Her strongest scenes are Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All actors are doing well, including Miranda Richardson in a role that could be rejected. <br /> <br /> Although it is not a story about dramatic arcs and histrionic "actor" moments, the story is still interesting enough to be worth watching. There are several historical freedoms that have been adopted by writing on screen, the film tries to remain faithful to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and royal structure of this period. The set design and costumes are outstanding. <br /> <br /> This film will be most appreciated by those who attract history, period dramas, and Blunt and other actors. I heartily recommend. <br /> <br /> Class: A
