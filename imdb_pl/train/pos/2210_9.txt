I can not believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite concert host. I hate gossip about celebrities and I generally do not like talk shows, but when Hal Sparks hosted Talk Soup, I had to see a TV for me. I rarely missed the episode during his run and it saddened me when the hosts started to drop in (although most of the guests were still doing well). <br /> <br /> In any case, for all people who do not like Hal Sparks, I imagine they've never seen special weekends. They were hourly episodes of Talk Soup, which contained the best clips of the whole week and were padded with pieces of sketch comedy. The original pieces that Hal Sparks did was fun. In one of them he was possessed by a bad comedy demon, and in an exorcist-like scene his head spun as he told old jokes about the food of airlines. One episode was devoted to mocking with Multiplicity, as the group of cloned Hal Sparks kept multiplying the entire episode, overflowing the studio. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe they do not sound so funny, describe them, but I only know that in addition to Talk Soup, the only two other programs I've watched consistently in these years are The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O ' Brian. So if you like the comedic designs of these concerts, you'll probably like Talk Soup during Sparks. <br /> <br /> He said that Henson and Tyler were also great hosts. All three of the hosts brought something different to the table, but in my opinion they were all great comedians. Of course, for years, Tyler and host celebrities, my interest in this series began to diminish, but from time to time I catch The Soup, the spiritual successor of the show, and certainly the new host can bring some unexpected laughter with time to time. <br /> <br /> OK, I've wasted enough time talking about a TV program that's not on the air anymore, and on the channel I usually despise. Go watch something else!
