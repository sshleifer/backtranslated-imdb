There really is not much to say about this movie .... it's primitive, but it's fun. <br /> <br /> Zarys tale (From IMDB) <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> Two losers from Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone), think about a new basketball game using baseball rules. When the game becomes a huge success, together with the help of a billionaire, they create a professional Baseketball league, in which everyone receives the same pay, and no team can change the city. The Coop & Remer team, Milwaukee Beers is the only team standing in the way of major regulatory changes that the owner of Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to establish. <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> Acting is pretty good because there are not many big stars in this movie. Although I'm not a huge fan of the "Southpark", Parker and Stone are doing quite a good job in their first real movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny moments in this movie that I can not name them all. He never really gives up, and they do not try to introduce some primitive drama to make him more serious. <br /> <br /> And my favorite aspect of this movie: The Soundtrack. Great. I especially like Reel Big Fish's "Take me on" and "Beer". Very underrated. <br /> <br /> In general, a stark but extremely funny movie. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James 'Black Wolf' Johnston
