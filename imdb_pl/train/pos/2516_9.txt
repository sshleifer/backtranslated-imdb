Based on the idea of ​​Gackta, Moon Child took place in a poor country called Mallepa. In the futuristic timeline, history has followed the fate of the two main heroes, Kei (HYDE) and Sho (Gackt) and their friends who grew up together. <br /> <br /> In spite of some actions it may be too complicated or maybe humorous, I strongly believed that it was a film about friendship. Even among all the difficulties between each character, in the end, each of them wanted to have someone on their side, have friends. <br /> <br /> Unlike most vampire characters, Kei played a vampire who hated the idea of ​​killing to live. The vampire found a friendship in the hands of a young boy, Sho, who is not afraid of Kei. Regardless of what some might think, I see Kei as a paternal Sho figure. Kei was there for the entire life of Sho, he took care of him and taught him to live in a world where power between gangs controls their lives. On the other hand, Sho, who may be perceived as an innocent, enthusiastic young man, has grown into a man who realized that life is not just fun and games, that death exists and is able to take his loved ones. <br /> <br /> I love the part where Lee Hom, the actor who played Son, first appeared on the screen. The way they met was really cool. Son also has a big role in this film, the fact that he comes from a different race, from Taiwan, has had a big impact on the subject of friendship in the film. The way the friendships were created despite the differences in the background was perfectly presented in this film. <br /> <br /> I believed that every actor did a great job, considering that it was the first time they appeared in such a big screen. Both HYDE and Gackt managed to work quite well and created quite reliable characters. In contrast to films in which the musician changed actors and filled the film with songs, they did a great job of acting! Moon Child really influenced me, gave me a new meaning and attention that we must appreciate every friendship in our lives. The film shows a lot of hope, despite all the bad things that happen in their lives, there is always hope. Life can be cruel, it seems that hope no longer exists. It also shows a very strong sense of friendship among themselves, even when the Son became an enemy, Sho had some "fun" during the last battle. Each of them finally desired peace, no matter how far away they were. The final scene showed it to us.
