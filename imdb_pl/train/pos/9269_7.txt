I probably doubled my knowledge about Iran when I saw the Secret ballot (2001). Now I know about four times more (I doubt I learned a lot from Not Without My Daughter (1991)). <br /> <br /> Offside is a great Iranian budget comedy about a group of girls (working individually) to take part in the decisive football match for the place of your country in the World Cup. Women can not participate in football matches, so the armed forces of the nation have been mobilized to save all women who are trying to enter from each other. Some (teenage?) Girls try to break a party, dress like boys, but get caught. The film is mostly embedded in this pen, where the girls are stopped by the soldiers, waiting for an unspecified punishment (although the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was one insignia away from the execution)> The film examines the absurdity of the situation. Thinking that the bars of women from football matches boil down to being too lewd an experience for the fair sex - a philosophy not known in the West less than 100 years ago. This farce comes to mind when the girl has to go to the bathroom, so the escorting soldier demands that she cover her eyes so she does not see graffiti. The conflict is not just about the fight of the sex: at some point there is a friction between the village soldier and the town girls. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this film was not very esoteric, that the comedy was lost on this neighbor and cultural cousin of the Great Satan. You must be in this mood, but no one should avoid this movie because they think they will not get it.
