It is surprisingly above the average slasher, which is pleasant and well made, with some decent gore !. All characters are decent, and the story is quite funny, and Molly Ringwald played this annoying bitch very well. I bought it in a pawnshop for $ 1, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were quite good for the budget, and I loved the mask that the killer wore because it was actually a little scary. The final was really cool because I loved how they beat the killer, and the predictable ending was also very fun, and all characters except Ringwald were surprisingly nice! It's decently made and written, and I thought it was sometimes quite creative and original, and some death scenes were very impressive. The killer was not around, and I loved it, and Slasher fans (like me) should really enjoy the movie, and the opening was really bad because they were filming! It is a surprisingly above-average slasher, which is pleasant and well made, with some decent gore, and I say it is worth watching! The direction is good. Kimble Rendall does well! work here with reliable camera operation, using frightening settings, good angles and keeping the film at a fast pace. Acting is solid! Molly Ringwald plays a bitch very well, and I had trouble with her regret after being a heroine, she was better at the end, but not because I'm surprised she decided to do this movie, but she did a great job! Frank Roberts is fantastic as an assassin, he is threatening, frightening and has a mask, and this guy was not afraid, he was fantastic! Kylie Minogue plays a little bitch very well. Jessica Napier is adorable and she's just like the other heroine. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall worth the watch! *** from 5
