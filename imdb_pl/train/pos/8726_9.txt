Here's what a family movie should be! There are several films from recent years that have been directed to families or children who really deserve to be watched; but this IS one of them. All my family left the movie, delighted, funny, dazed and happy. We are still quoting small anecdotes from this place. The children loved the same and we (hubbie and I are 36 and 32 years old respectively)! <br /> <br /> In addition to a beautiful and striking animation, characters (small as they can be and imagined as they are)) are very well developed. There is not one of them that you can not empathize with. The personalities that enliven these little creatures are well-staffed voice talents, combined with the skills and craftsmanship of the best Disney animators. This is a movie worthy of Walt Disney. I think Mr. Disney would be happy to praise this new movie ... Flick, Dot and their friends from tiny heroes can become as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our day. <br /> <br /> It's one of the families who leaves the theater that wants to see again ... and buy it on video or DVD. I will gladly see it again to pick up what I could miss the first time. (I have never seen my children so fast and I have vividly identified myself with heroes and embraced them before ... my daughter still talks about a small "Dot".) <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, quick-tempered, smart and great fun for the whole family!
