it was a real pleasure to blame ... I saw the trailer and the whole ad, so I thought: "why not check this video vh1?" and, as they said on tv, "I can not believe I watched the whole thing!" Quinn and Harris were credible Beatle boys and although the accents were a bit exaggerated and difficult to decipher sometimes, I felt that the dialogue is credible. The film touched on a weak relationship len / mc and showed how deep down they were just two guys who grew up close and shared a passion for music - however, they came to her with various sets of problems and personal needs. You regret that they did not jump into a taxi to set out on an impromptu meeting that would destroy the world socks, but you also gained more recognition why they did not.
