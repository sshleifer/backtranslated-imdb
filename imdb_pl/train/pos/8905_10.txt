Old horrors are interesting, lots of screams, lots of screams and lots of humor to work with them. "The Blob" is a classic in its work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager who tries to become a hero in his city. Going out on a date with a girl is rather typical for all teenagers. But when the old man discovers the same falling object from the sky, he becomes a victim, and Steve helps him best. When it comes to the power of teenagers, this movie really does. I know that most adolescents have experienced difficulties when they rise, when danger arises, they must learn to forget about the past and start doing something good to save humanity. When adults in the city have learned hard work on "The Blob" with a running amok, they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior improve. The emerging juggernaut was rather sweet in my life and in my opinion it was JELL-O! When everyone stops to stop the threat, the city is safe again thanks to good old cooperation. I still eat Jello and I watch this movie all the time, if you do not like Jello, TOUGH! RATING 5 STARS
