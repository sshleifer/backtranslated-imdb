Probably the best fantasy film ever made. Great color, spectacular sets, amazing, spot music Miklos Rosza, perfect for any scene and mood. Acting is also great in what could have been stiff and pretentious in smaller hands, but here the poetic dialogue is clever, sensitive (humor is subtle and delightful too). they were fascinated by this. Along with The Four Feathers (1939), one of the two best movie films released by Alexander Korda and London Films --- and one of the best films ever. <br /> <br /> A real, convincing classic!
