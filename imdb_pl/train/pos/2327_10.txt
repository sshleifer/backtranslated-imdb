The 14-year-old girl for the first time falls seriously in love with a 17-year-old boy who lives nearby, at the same time trying to overcome a sense of deprivation in comparison with his older sister. This is the simple premise of this beautiful, poetic film directed by Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for his early directing of Summer of '42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the genre of the coming century. Here she directs new actors in the main roles: Reese Witherspoon, in her film debut, as a 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield, as a big sister; Jason London, as Court, a 17-year-old boy. Reese Witherspoon is amazingly good in her film debut, showing all the emotions that a 14-year-old girl feels in experiencing young love and pain without ever hitting a false note. Warfield and London are just as good. The film accurately depicts the thoughts and feelings of each teenager in relation to love with affectionate sensitivity, never turning into maudlana excess, even once. Recognition for the autobiographical scenario of Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the few films about young love that is sincere and consistent in tone, without being emotionally dishonest or sensational. The music is wonderfully simple, accentuates tone and mood from stage to scene, but never becomes obtrusive. Beautiful pictures were taken by the famous director of horror Freddie Francis, who was 70 years old when it was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play with the parents of girls with accurate accuracy for 1957, caring, raw and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is also good as a boy's mother. There are feelings to be solved, lessons to learn and truths to face in this sweet film that has an emotional effect. Until now, this is Robert Mulligan's last film. This is one of the best films from 1991. **** 4 stars.
