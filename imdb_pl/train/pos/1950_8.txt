Diane Keaton has played several "heavy" games for many years on the big screen, but is known mainly for "light and fluffy" things with Woody Allen, such as Annie Hall. She deserves an Oscar for best actress in the drama for this effort and it really does not matter what the competition was in the year in which it was first shown. Try to find a scene where it will not appear. And all this was a heavy drama, exhausting pace and repetitive, operating at full speed. Make-up meant that she was as young as possible and fit in the age category of 30 years, even in close-ups, but she played in the middle of her age and very fast. The film, in general, was quite well done, exposed and well filmed with a strong cast, but Keaton carried the load.
