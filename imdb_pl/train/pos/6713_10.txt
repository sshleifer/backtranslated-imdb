I liked the TV program because it was his own business. A girl who is sixteenth birthday learns that she is a witch, and she lives with her aunts at home and they are both witches. It took her several weeks to get used to it. When she used her powers for the first time, it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple. She had to turn back time and repeat the day. This series is really cool and is a typical series for teenagers, but she was skinny when she moved out of the house and into the apartment with colleagues with friends, and then it became boring and I stopped watching. and the other one was really stunning. I loved Valerie and I hated Libby, the enemy of Sabrina, she was ugly.
