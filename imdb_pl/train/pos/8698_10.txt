I saw this movie after its release and I valued it ever since. What a great group of actors (I always consider the cast to be one of the most interesting aspects of the film). I really enjoyed seeing the dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role, and Wallace Shawn is always hoot. The script is clever, sly and cheeky, joking with almost everything "Beverley Hills". Beloved "doctor" Paul Bartel and servant Ray Sharkey. It was lewd and primitive, but thank God! If you are not prudish, I highly recommend this film. FYI for anyone who likes to play six degrees Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel were in "Rock & Roll High School." Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were together in "Night of the Comet". Everyone was three in "Eating Raoul."
