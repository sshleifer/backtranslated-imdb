THE NIGHT LISTENER (2006) ** 1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra Oh, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Dir. Patrick Stettner) <br /> <br /> Hitchcock's lift gives Williams a distinctive low performance. <br /> <br /> What about stars and fans? What is close to paranoia is associated with the other and why is it almost a norm? <br /> <br /> In the latest scenario with derange fans based on real events, Williams appears as a radio personality named Gabriel Nikt, who reads the stories he wrote on the airwaves and has collected an interesting fan of a young boy named Pete Logand (Culkin), who submitted the manuscript about the hardships of his restless youth to the editorial office of Nobody, Ashe (Morton), who gives it to Nobody to read it himself. <br /> <br /> No one is naturally disturbed, but ultimately intrigued by Pete's nightmarish existence, who has been abducted and sexually abused for years, until he was finally saved by a nurse named Donna (Collette giving an excellent performance) who She accepted the boy, but her correspondence with Nobody reveals that Pete dies of AIDS. Naturally, Nobody wants to meet fans, but suddenly he has doubts about their cunning hidden motives, when the seed was planted by his distant lover Jess (Cannavale), whose sudden departure from the apartment in New York has no one in the emotional tail, which has only now it turned into a storm in a glass of water when he decided to examine the backgrounds of Donna and Pete, discovering the truths he had not foreseen. <br /> <br /> Written by Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the script with his former lover Terry Anderson and the film's beginner director Stettner) and based on the true story of the mystification of the fan, several Hitchcock moments were discovered that run at full speed like any good old pot kettle. This helps Williams stand out as a key character with good faith who sincerely wants to believe that his number one fan is really real and he loves him (the only thing that has escaped his own reality) and has some disturbing terrible moments with the terrifying Collette, which one physical trait will go unnoticed, but it emphasizes the desperation of her character that can put you in the nail on the head. <br /> <br /> However, the movie ends up with gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable, despite the precisely filmed piece of the whim and mystery of Stettner, it pays to listen to your own inner voice: watch what you hope for.
