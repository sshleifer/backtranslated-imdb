Rosenstrasse is a moving story of courage in adversity. Reichdeutts women discover that their Jewish husbands were locked in anticipation of deportation. One of the aristocrats, whom Lena Fischer denied from her family, is in the crowd, like sister General Gudarian. But the rank and privilege do not deserve special attention. <br /> <br /> Neither the service of the Reich, as the detained woman whose husband is in Ostfront will find out. In one of the most frightening scenes of the film, the guards take the wedding ring from the soldier's husband. <br /> <br /> So that you do not think it's a typical German brutality, we in America today, Lady Bush, orderly arrest the mothers of the Golden Star (mothers of American service members killed in action) because their presence is offensive. Unfortunately, unfortunately, it has changed in 60 years from Der Fuher to Der Fumbler. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, eight-year-old daughter Ruth escapes capture. <br /> <br /> Waiting for freezing weather at Rosenstrasse Lena Fischer initially reluctantly treats Ruth in a way that we treat as typically German. Even Lena Fisher's brother, Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who is aware and against Holocost, warns Lena against him. but Lena decides to accept the idea of ​​American rebelliousness, even changing the name to Ruth, the more the aryan is Helga Lehmann. <br /> <br /> The siege ends preferably on Rosenstrasse, but Lena mourns: What happened to Rut after the war? Many years later, Ruth's daughter, Hannah, sets out to look for her mother's past and meets 90-year-old Lena on the pretext of writing a personal history of the war. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that Hannah wanted to look for her family so much, but you never checked the fate of her grandfather, who is known to have served in Ostfront.
