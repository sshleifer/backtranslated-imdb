William H. Macy is the most sympathetic and convincing here, as an assassin and a loving father who wants to leave the family business without the anger of his overbearing parents. He approaches the same territory as the television "Sopranos" when it comes to the crisis of the middle age with criminal topics (here also visits the curator), but it is still worth watching because of Brommel's tense direction (I'm waiting for what this guy is leading further), excellent script and great performances. Macy's perfect as always. This is probably his best role since "Fargo". Donald Sutherland is the best in her native father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly thrilling dramatic turn as Macy's wife. The young David Dorfman is great as a bright and sensitive son of Macy (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (whom I usually find repulsive) is as compelling as a worried young woman who catches Macy's eye. All this is interrupted by a moving result and a clear pace that leads to a predictable but still powerful climax and significant and moving consequences. This film deserved a much wider edition, I suspect, it would have a relationship with the audience.
