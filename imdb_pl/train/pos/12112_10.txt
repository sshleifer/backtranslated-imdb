The premise of this anime series is bread, everything on which to base the story! I really laughed. The main character has the special power of bread with which he was born and goes to the school of baking bread. I would like it to be available on DVD, and it does not matter if it's written or dubbed - that's good. Even the theme itself is fun. At some point in the song, an African-Japanese man with an afro on horseback appears, wielding a French baguette as if it were a samurai sword. These images will not make sense if you do not see anime. You will laugh until your sides ache. This is by far the most unique anime I have seen so far.
