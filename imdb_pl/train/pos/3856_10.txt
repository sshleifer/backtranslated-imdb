"De vierde man" (The Fourth Man, 1984) is considered one of the best European thrillers of the eighties. This last work of the Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his native country, before he moved to Hollywood to become a big star of films such as "Total Recall", "Basic Instinct" and "Starship Troopers", concerns a psychopathic and disappointed author I'm going to the seaside to regain strength. There he meets a mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and begins a deadly affair with her. Addicted to her with her heart and soul and learns that her three previous men all died in mysterious circumstances ... <br /> <br /> "De vierde man" is heavily influenced by the old Hollywood film noire and the psycho thriller Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells. Creating a dark and thrilling atmosphere takes a lot of time, and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right effect to convey the story straight. Tension is sometimes almost unbearable and sometimes resembles the work of Italian cult director Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> The cast is also outstanding, especially Krabbe's performance as a mentally disturbed writer who opened the door for his international film career ("Living daylight", "Fugitive"). If you have the opportunity to watch this brilliant psychological thriller on TV, video or DVD, do not miss it!
