Wow, it's been years since I last saw the movie. Watching it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986. At first, I did not think that I would survive this movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so unbearable, arrogant and disrespectful that I could not see him. He personified every negative stereotype of the Americans. If that was not enough, it turned out that the best employees of a small American town showed that the picture deteriorated. In the reverse spectrum, the Japanese were depicted as emotionless, robotic workaholics. The film was not even so funny that I only hung there because of its nostalgic value. And I'm happy that I continued my watch. <br /> <br /> Like boxing, the referees are disturbed by the way the round ends. This movie went from about three to seven, I judged him because of the ending. The end was perfect. You always want a harmonious ending and that was it. It is great that the city had to keep a job there and maintain the factory, but the most special was the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values. It was an average movie that ended with a high note.
