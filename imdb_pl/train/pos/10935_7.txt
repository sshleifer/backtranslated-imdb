I must say it was a good movie. Despite the fact that dubbing was pretty bad, and there were also strange moments in which the film seemed dark blue for no apparent reason, I was not disappointed. The story was really interesting: the last member of the Clan of Poisons must track down the other five members and discover who uses their skills for evil and who uses them for good. The grip is that during the training the whole clan was masked and everyone returned to society in disguise and changed their names. <br /> <br /> Fights are a joy to watch, because every member of the Clan Poison has a different fighting style: toad (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and centipede. Combat scenes make the actors jump around the place and fortunately the camera remains planted and uses a sufficiently wide shot, so you can clearly see the whole action. <br /> <br /> The only disadvantage of the movie is that history tends to drag in the first half until the first battle sequence. But stick with it and you will not be disappointed!
