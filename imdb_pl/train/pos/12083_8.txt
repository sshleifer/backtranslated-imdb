The second function is for a young woman in London who is desperately looking for a job, willing to take a secret position live with an elderly woman and her son. Thrillers about people kept at home against their will always make me a bit worried - after all, I feel like a prisoner - but this rather classic B movie is neither scary nor claustrophobic. It is far-fetched and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is on her feet. Reproduction of this in 1986 (As "Dead Of Winter") turned out to be a little wise, because the plot elements are not contemporary. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short for 65 minutes!), But nicely sticks to the course until the hasty climax, which seems a bit sloppy. *** with ****
