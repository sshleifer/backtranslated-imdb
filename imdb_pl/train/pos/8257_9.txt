I just saw World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and we loved it. Here we have a welcome remake of the genre, which is considered pioneer (certainly "developed" and successfully) by George Romero. But this is the Canadian film of a Canadian director and it's a comedy! And yes, I think it's better than "Shawn of the Dead". Exactly credible, and perhaps even more important, pleasant performances by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and young actor K'Sun Ray, whom I suspect we will see in the future. I must admit, however, that I liked the delicious rotation of Tim Blake Nelson as a neighbor of Mr. Theopolis, who basically played the animated version of Victor Van Dort from the Corpse Bride (or for those who saw the film, or even read it as Corpse Pride?) And of course the Scottish actor Billy Connolly in his least animated but somehow moving role of the title character. Think, he would not get this role if it were not for Peter Stormare's commitment to Prison Break (as revealed in the Q & A after the show on Thursday evening). I can not resist speculation that the writers had to get a lot of inspiration from Day Of The Dead's Zombie 'Bub'. I do not like to reveal the details of the plot during the commentary and I will not start now. Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those grim, graphically bloody Zombie movies that you can rely on in Romero. It is rather a movie that makes you laugh all the time and (and I had to think it over) there is a large dose of blood and violence, excellent humor, so well enhanced by the surrealistic environment created by director Currie and his co-writers, goes far in the direction of making this something that should be assessed by PG-13. I encourage you to see this little jewel of Canuck. I will definitely buy a DVD when it appears, I hope, next summer.
