Well, what can I say, this movie really came to me, it's not as bad as many say, I really liked it, although the idea seems so simple and rather boring, it is not. First of all, I liked the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really suits the movie. The second simple story, and the drama of the Spirit attracts your attention. One of the things I like the most is that they did not give the stallion a human voice to interact with other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, now the little animation seems realistic, right? But ... I do not know, making talk about animals is just ... bad. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, one of the most beautiful animations of 2002, I recommend it to everyone, not only to children :), because it is very relaxing.
