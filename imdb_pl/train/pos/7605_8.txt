Lost is an amazingly well-made TV series about people lost on the island. there are so many twists that you really can not decide who your favorite character is, one minute is his and then he does something, so he's coolest, so he's going to do something, so he's the coolest, and the tension is growing just like you to end the episode and yours as nieeeooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! so you have to wait all week, see the next episode, but wait. Suspension, action, romance, humor has everything except topless girls, but that's good because it means you can concentrate on history, and history is what it's all about. so if you like a good story and you like tension, it's a good idea 24, but I think it's probably better. (I also have a review on this subject so you can check it out.) because it is so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
