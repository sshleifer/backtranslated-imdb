YOUTH FROLIKA A short topic. <br /> <br /> The teenager, embarrassed by the fear of dogs, runs away from home. The abandoned spaniel helps him change his mind. <br /> <br /> PARDON MY PUPS is a nice movie in which Shirley Temple steals all scenes as a hero's live sister. Opened gag - for soaking in the night - is in bad taste, but is quickly forgotten. The most important: culinary fistuffs that look impressive realistically. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or ignored, short and one-piece topics were useful in college as important training areas for new or developing talents, both in the front and back of the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short theme was completely different than in a full-length film, resembling rather a short story rather than a novel. Economical in production both in terms of budget and schedule, and enabling the presentation of a wide range of materials, short themes were a perfect complement to the studio's feature films.
