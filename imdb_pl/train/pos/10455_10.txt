It must be one of the poignant and touching films that meet a boy and a girl. While "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Say Anything" provide nice portraits, these films remove unnecessary plot lines and divergences in Hollywood. This film focuses exclusively on watching the beginning of a beautiful romance. You never doubt that the film will lead to a romantic combination of these two people. Almost immediately, you sense synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it's just pure joy to see them find. This film is mostly based on dialogue. But every conversation is also very intriguing. What makes this combination so romantic is how true it is. As in all this conversation, although it often has no impact on something critical, you can feel the nuances when the two become more fond of each other and trust each other. This is exactly the way you would dream that you would meet someone special. And what makes it so real is that it is not even fantastic to believe. This can happen if you were confident enough to start a conversation with the person you accidentally spotted. And what makes the cherry in this film is the wonderful backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place. This only adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this movie, I do not think I'm ever tired of it.
