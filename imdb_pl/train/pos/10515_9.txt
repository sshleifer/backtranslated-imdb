A small, charming little movie, but it's definitely great. Gwyneth Paltrow shines at this early show of her British accent, and the cast gathered around her bypasses dialogue. This happened during Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I do not know why this remark attracted all of Oskar's attention. Emma is the most accessible and least stifling story of Jane Austen.
