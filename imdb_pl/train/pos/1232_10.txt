A very funny movie. Eddie Murphy's classic movie from the 80's. I saw when I was a child and I have a good memory. Murphy's classic irony does not disappoint, the movie is fun, well done. Murphy in the 1980s made many action movies that were a way for him to joke about anything that is dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some, but the movie has changed since 1986. The atmosphere of the film of this time is good and the special effects are good for the movie from that period. Nice movie that you can see and enjoy the taste of ironic Murphy, an actor who has just disappeared. The last part is an anthology, a nice actor who plays the role of a Tibetan Monk. this is it!
