Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chitchely, the Rostov Ripper, who killed 52 people in 8 years, mainly women and children. It shows how the investigation was hampered by the Soviet bureaucracy, how difficult it was to investigate the crimes. He does it in such a brilliant way that he will not leave anyone intact. At the beginning, it may be a bit slow, but it really catches you when the story unfolds. I can only say that next to "The Silence of the Lambs" this is by far the best serial killer movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to say which actor's performance stands out from the movie. Stephen Rea is truly brilliant as an inexperienced forensic expert who is responsible for the investigation. The performance of Donald Sutherland as his cynical supervisor and the only person in the Russian government who wants to help him is as prominent as Rea. And what to say about Jeffrey DuManien, who plays serial killer? DuMann has created a character that inspires empathy rather than hatred. Yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad figure, oppressed and ridiculed by his wife, boss, colleagues ... He is tortured, embarrassed, and extremely malicious. /> I can recommend this film to anyone who is interested in a well-prepared drama, in which the actors are more important than special effects. He deserves at least 9/10, maybe even more, if you ask me about it.
