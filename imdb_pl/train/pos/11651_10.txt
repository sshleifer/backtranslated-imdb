WHEN FRIENDS KILL, in my opinion, it is very moving and a kind of poignant drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic. Each time Lexi (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) vomited, I wanted to vomit. It is difficult to explain why. If you ask me, they should have cooperated more on various matters. However, I was happy to see them doing things together, and their parents lecturing. Before summing it up, I would like to say, "If you ask me WHEN FRIENDS KILL, it really shows how being anorectic or bulimic can affect a person's body." Now, in conclusion, I recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it. You are in tears and have fun, so the next time you're on TV, kick your friend and watch.
