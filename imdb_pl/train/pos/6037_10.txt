What a GREAT British movie, shouting good laughter and sexy Gary Stretch, and a lot of motorcycles and charming Welsh landscapes. <br /> <br /> Members of our club ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club appear in additions! Bravo !! <br /> <br /> There are some really fun pieces, a good game, a good idea. <br /> <br /> I met with the director, Jon Ivay at a show in Wareham, Dorset. A great man, down to earth and good laughter. This movie has to be supported, as all great UK films should do! <br /> <br /> So please go and see if you can, have a website with the cinemas that show it, so find one of them! <Br /> <br /> I can not wait to get a DVD. Some of our biker friends have seen this movie two or three times and can not. <br /> <br /> Amanda
