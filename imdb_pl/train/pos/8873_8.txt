This movie came and went to theaters. Because of his character, you can see why he was not well received. It was unjustly deceived because his subject was more than the film itself. Higher education is not spectacular, but a good movie tried to talk about a terrifying topic in America: racism. <br /> <br /> Plot / Story: Higher learning focuses mainly on Malik (played by Omar Epps) star naive track, which is dealing with the fact that he is not fast enough and a strict professor (in this role Laurence Fishburne). He makes friends with Fudge (Ice Cube), as well as with a beautiful woman named Deja (Tyra Banks). Then they have to deal with some of the skinheads on campus. Remy (playing Michael Rapaport) is a confused kid who befriends local campheads on the skinhead. When they impose their views on him, he becomes as racist as they are. <br /> <br /> Opinion: higher education is not without flaws: character development is limited, good results Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and leader of skinheads (whose name I forgot), Busta Rhymes does not match this film at all. Plus, women turning into gays after being used by men were trivial "before this movie, so you know I did not like this part of the movie with Kristy Swanson. Besides, this movie was not half bad. Laurence Fishburne was good as Professor Phipps (though I could do without an accent), Fudge was the best Ice Cube performance, and Michael Rapaport was good as a bewildered Remy. In total, it was one of the best films of John Singleton and is one of the reasons why I am browsing the rubbish that he now seems. Cinema needs more movies, such as Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X, and fewer movies like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and the very pointless remake of Shaft.
