It started with a film about Bronx street culture in New York. We managed to create a new culture and way of life for American youth. What other movie did he do except for Rebel Without A Cause? One of the most important films of all time. The elements are simple but fascinating. History is timeless, young people are trying to succeed against all adversities. However, history is always credible and never depressing. The heroes are so realistic, the city's residents recognize them as neighbors. The story is fun and ends with a satisfying ending. Buy this one for your permanent collection. It is a fragment of American history.
