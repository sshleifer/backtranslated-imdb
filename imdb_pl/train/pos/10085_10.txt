I just watched this movie today with my children (son, 10 and daughter, 4,5 years old) at the 3rd annual film festival of Roger Ebert. After the film, children from the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director of Tian-Ming Wu. He (through an interpreter) told a few stories about his life and creating a movie. <br /> <br /> Aside, all my children really liked this movie. Of course, I had to paraphrase many subtitles for my daughter, but most of the movie is obviously visually. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything, but the most important thing is that this movie is MUCH better than 95% of Hollywood nonsense (especially children's films). <br /> <br /> Cheers. <br /> <br /> ps There is a "real" / original King of Masks who can / could do 12 masks simultaneously. The actor in the film coached and learned to do up to 4 masks simultaneously (then cut and change into 4 new masks).
