This is the best film version of classic Dicken's story. I have seen it many times in VHS, and recently I have purchased a DVD version that is formatted on a television (not on a wide screen). What interests me in this teleplay is the cast of English actors who are now recognizable because many of them have appeared in other movies / programs in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, "The Equalizer", like Ghost of Christmas Present.
