This film is the best movie ever. I do not remember when the last time the movie drew tears from me. with a tear in my eye I admire the film. It has all the elements that a good movie must have: excellent dialogues, music, acting, plot / story. The story of friendship, courage, kindness and loyalty between the street, which is famous for the King of masks and a little girl who sold herself as a boy in the bazaars. The little girl liked to be his granddaughter, and the King of the Mask liked his grandson. In fact, they were not conventional. Every scene in which they were together was invaluable. Camera work is impeccable and keeps you. Acting is inspired. Xu Zhu was perfect as the King of masks. Renying Zhou "Doggie" looks nice and played his character very well. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played his helpful and kind character very well. If you do not have this video, try it once.
