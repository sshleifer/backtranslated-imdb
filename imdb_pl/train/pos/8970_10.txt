I searched this video a bit and discovered a website that claims it was an internal joke about the gay and lesbian world in Greenwich Village after World War II. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, sorcerers and witches represented this alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten, who wrote the stage play, was apparently cheerful and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought it was ironic because for the first time I saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in the fifth or sixth grade just because my parents took me. It was difficult for me to get into a movie that would not include horses, machine guns or alien monsters, and I planned to get bored. But I remember the moment Jimmy Stewart took Kim Novak on top of the Flatiron building and threw off his hat while the camera followed him flapping to the ground. As George Duning's great love theme rose, I suddenly felt what it was like to fall in love. The first stirrings of romantic / sexual love left me stunned when I left the theater. I am sure that I am not the only boy before growing up who was seduced by Kim Novak's surprising, direct look. It is ironic that the gay parable was able to induce heterosexual adolescence in many of us. I'm in the late 1950s and I watched the movie yesterday evening, and the same feelings moved when I watched this hat touch fifty years later. . .
