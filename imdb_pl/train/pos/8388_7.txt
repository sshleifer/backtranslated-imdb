Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman presented in full and very reliable, even though she is so long-winded that she has no limits. She will do everything to make her marital work include shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. And so, under the superficial exterior, it reveals a rather sweet system of values. The film suffers from a sudden and unexpected ending, which then seems completely insufficient, with the convenience known for the end of creative writing in the school of "and then I woke up." It's also finished with a book on the other end with the most eccentric sequence of titles I've ever seen, but do not let it put you off.
