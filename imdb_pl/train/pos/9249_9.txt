This film is witty, visible and totally touching. And now you often meet Jean Harlow (or other actress of this era) to give another woman a quick blow to the jaw? (Twice!) <br /> <br /> After Ruby Harlow is sent to the correction facility after being mixed up with Edward Hall Gable (he's out of this tacky but charming, crooked smile), her the situation becomes even more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant and is convinced that this plunder has abandoned her, but in fact her love reformed him and comes to her, even though he will be arrested, and with the help of the minister he is married. <br /> <br /> The great relationship that Harlow shares with his fellow prisoners is only giving way to her electrical chemistry with Gable, who was her most frequent leader. Her cynical character fits perfectly into Gable's swindler. What do you dislike? <br /> <br /> "You know, you would not be a bad-looking lady - if not your face!" Ruby sharply comments on the Gypsy, her rival. "If you want to approach me, I will have to open another window!" <br /> <br /> Priceless !!!
