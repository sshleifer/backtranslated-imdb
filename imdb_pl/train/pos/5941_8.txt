It is a fanatic short film that pretends to be a new movie that connects Batman and Superman! It is a movie that fans love and watch in places like ComicCon and was created by the same person who created BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> Regarding this movie, I could easily choose it separately. Of course, the CGI effects are not perfect, and the costumes are far from perfect. BUT, it was on a modest budget, and the movie for fans is amazing. I was impressed by the very picky Superman - he was not a boyfriend! If only it were the preview of a real movie - they would have fans in the queue to Omaha to see him. Good job.
