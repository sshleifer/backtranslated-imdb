I always wanted David Duchovney to go to the film industry, and he did it, and made me proud. This movie met my expectations. Duchovney played his character very well, maintaining consistency with something new, instead of playing Agent Agent, to which we are accustomed. That's why I give him extra recognition for his role, also because I have not seen anyone else play this particular character. David was great, but nothing compared to psychotic Timothy Hutton. Excellent performance that you will not get bored of throughout the movie, because it will never surprise you. It has weaknesses and strengths, making history more reliable. I loved the narration, added it to history and had some very memorable quotes that I still use all the time. This movie also had a great result. I recommend it to anyone who likes drama and does not mind blood.
