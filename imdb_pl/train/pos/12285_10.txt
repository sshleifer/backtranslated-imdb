A brilliant adaptation of the novel that caused the death of famous relatives of the Chilean President, Salvador Allende. Surrounded by a large estate that arises from ruins, becoming a force to abuse and exploit indignation, a luxurious property for a beginner Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family, the brilliant Danish director Bille August reproduces in micro, which at that time would be the process leading to the greatest disgrace its history for the hardened Chilean people whose main protagonist would be Augusto Pinochet (similarities with him are inevitable: let us remind, as an example, this image of the senator with darkness) glasses that make him wink at the general to begin creating the palace. <br /> <br /> Bille August attends a unique cast in Jeremy's protruding irons, whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty, a hard lesson that this life always makes us almost force us to change. In Esteban, the law of resonance is fully applied, with great wisdom, describes Solomon with these words: "Things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you". <br /> <br /> Glenna Close's unforgettable rail, the contaminated sister Stephen, whose sin, driven by loneliness, spiritual and platonic love, was the wife of his cruel, snowy brother. Meryl Streep was also a brilliant woman, whose name came to him like Clara's glove. With telekinetic, cognitive and mediaistic power, this hardened woman, faithful to her dumb, conservative husband, is an indicator of the character and self-control that we desire for ourselves and for all people. <br /> <br /> Each character is a portrait of virtuosity (unhappy, like the unlucky leader of the rebel Blanca Pedro Segundo ...) or a portrait of humiliation, like Stephen Jr., an unruly child of the Senator who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. <br /> <br /> The film touches the guts, we have recreated several facts that should never be repeated, but this is always absurd (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that, against all odds, life is great because there is always there are people like Isabel Allende and only Bille August.
