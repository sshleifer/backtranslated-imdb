The Rookie was smiling from beginning to end. Dennis Quaid played a part to perfection. The little boy who plays his son was fantastic. He made a father-son movie of it. Messages are good. Follow your dreams. The chase failure is fine as long as you try. Excitement is tangible. I believe that this film will be a classic.
