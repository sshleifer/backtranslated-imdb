This movie was supposed to be better than the average action movie and it went well in this respect. This film had spectacular pictures with spectacular mountain snow and high altitudes, a very matching Stallone, which also did a good job, an exciting storyline and a great performance from its main villain, because it really shocked him with his evil ways. The film does not have the rank of all time due to poor screen play. The story and the story call for the film to become a special person, as well as the characters from the film Rambo or Rocky or Bond. They decided to humanize the character of Stallone in what is right, but taking into account the style of the story, it weakens the element of excitement. Dialogue was sometimes tacky and carelessly condescending. realistic and less "talkative". Another weak point was the unrealistic scenes of filming. The creators of the film should have been more careful about how they flopped and hit. They should have continued the quality of shooting sequences during the abduction of the aircraft at the beginning of the film. Instead, they decided to light up many shooting sequences (TV series "A-Team"), as soon as the villains set foot on the summit had enormous potential. The Crisper action sequences, better dialogue and more emotions / determination in the style of Rambo / Rocky from Stallone would bring this film to a higher level. I know it was not Stallone's fault. the feeling that the director wanted to tone the character of Stallone and try to steal the film, taking into account his direction, which was not so great if it was not for his operator.
