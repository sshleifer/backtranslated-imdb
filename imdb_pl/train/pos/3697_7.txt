One late afternoon I caught this movie on the Sundance channel on the cable. You can say that "Who Loves the Sun" is the perfect pastime of history, why not. You can meet with the trio: Lukas Haas to Will (returns after suddenly leaving all years ago), Molly Parker is Maggie (we learn that he is a very part of the Bloom family), and Adam Scott is Daniel (whether he is a friend or foe or fianc√©) through picturesque Falcon Lake, Manitoba, Canada, captured in graphic compositions juxtaposed in vivid summer colors against the sun and shadows. Supporting the trio, there are two family members who reveal their mix: Wendy Crewson is Mom Mary Bloom, and R.H. Thomson is Dad Arthur Bloom. Screenwriter and director Matt Bissonnette presented a brilliant story and its various links - do not worry, Haas may have an "apathetic" face, but humor will come when Parker and Scott come into the circle of friends, connected by smiles. Break and getting to know the bliss. Dialogues may be concise or even zero, and yet we will get the taste of what is cooked, bewildered or puzzling. <br /> <br /> Yes, "Who loves the sun" can be very well classified as a sleeping jewel. Chemistry between all five major manufacturers guarantees gelling and "burning", giving an energetic team. After all, it's all in the family, and the film certainly does not take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> It seems that the official site is still available on the site "wholovesthesun.com" and there is information about the Mac McCaughan soundtrack (Portastatic with melodies and guitar strings), in which the music fragments are played, and behind the scenes, production notes, an interview with writer-director-producer Bissonnette about how the film and concept, casting and more were made. I have always appreciated Molly Parker since her free, yet hypnotizing performance in 1996, "Kissed" by Lynne Stopkewich and she is the wife of Bissonnette, who "wrote part of Maggie for Molly."
