I'm not interested in the rap and culture of the ghetto, I'm white and I like classical rock, but that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy. It's rather the sequel to This Is Spinal Tap in the sense that it's the same movie, just rap or rock. But it is fun. There are many fun jokes, but not without a few jokes that just fall. All characters are very funny and reliable. I just watched because it made me laugh at 3am, and any movie that can do it guarantees at least a trial show. One of the reasons why movies were so funny was that he was laughing at rap from another. Rap deals with bad things today and deals with studio noise and little talent. This film comes from a time when rappers deserved more points. Overall, this is a funny video with many jokes about racism, sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor. This is highly recommended for every fan of This is Spinal Tap. They are essentially the same movie, only about different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both movies.
