I used to watch Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10 years old. It was just behind the Bay City rollers. I saw that one day he came to the Family Channel and recorded it for my three-year-old daughter. I forgot all the things that I loved as a child, a magic flute, a broomstick zoom, a Witcheepoo makeup. <br /> <br /> This program is definitely not technologically advanced. The mayor is certainly the precedent of Mayor McCheese, and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying, challenging eyes. But children love it. They would do it, they would rather watch a guy working in a sock puppet than they sat in front of technologically advanced computer animation. It is a (mild) slapstick, but there are no adult themes such as sex or dying people, and children accept Jimmy's patterns. Children think that it would be good to carry a bag of smoke and convince someone that their house is on fire, and I loved that every time my daughter saw a stream of jets in the sky, she thought Witchypoo was flying overhead. Music is old, but you really got used to it, and my daughter really loved her. In the car she sang "it's hard, otherwise it's lonely". My daughter watched this program at least once a day for about 5 months and is still one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I see that the new Pufnstuf 2000 is at work. I really hope that they try to keep the old taste and do nothing like computer animated characters etc. I think that the whole new generation will love Pufnstuf.
