For the first time, we watched this film as part of the festival of new Argentine films in 2000 in Walter Reade. Although we liked it, we did not think it was extraordinary. Watching it a second time, we found a different meaning in this view of life in Buenos Aires. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place on one of the darkest days of Argentina, because the administration of DeLaRua ended. The country was in chaos after the economy, which flourished earlier in the 1990s, under the artificial climate created by President Menen. It was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen, and people survived a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The story begins as Santamarina, a bank employee, is fired because of the collapse of the economy. Instead of receiving sympathy from his wife, he closes him from the apartment, and he, for practical reasons, becomes homeless. He goes out into the streets trying to make ends meet. <br /> <br /> The second story introduces us to Ariel, a young Jew who gives an interview in search of a job in a Spanish company. It's almost a miracle that he got a job. His father, Simon, has a small restaurant in the Jewish district "El Once" in the city center. Things change from bad to worse when Ariel's mother dies suddenly. Only Estela, a young woman in love with Ariel, comes to help her father and son. <br /> <br /> Santamarina, who is a pure man, has to resort to taking a shower wherever it is possible. She chooses a ladies' room at one of the metro stations. When the maid, Elsa, finds him naked, she becomes furious, but she recovers when she realizes the unfortunate circumstances of this man who has seen better times. They are romantically involved, and Santamarina, in one of her trips through street garbage, finds a baby. Elsa, surprised, wants to do the right thing. But Santamarina convinces her of the importance of innocent life in their lives and strengthens their love. <br /> <br /> Ariel, who met the wonderful Laura at work, begins a stormy and heavy affair with his beautiful unknown worker is involved in lesbian affairs. Ariel, who frees lance by photographing weddings and other occasions, feels passion for Laura, but she realizes what Estela has devoted to helping her father and still loves him. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman, whose "El Abrazo Partido" we thought was perfect, we did miracles with this film. After the second view, things are in the right perspective and we have to apologize that we did not see it for the first time. If anything, for the second time, the set design nuances, which Burman and Emiliano Torres wrote, make more sense because they reflect the confusion of what the country lived in those dark days. <br /> <br /> Daniel Hendler, who plays Ariel, previously collaborated with Mr. Burman, getting surprising results. He is not a "beautiful movie star", but he is handsome. This actor shows great honesty in his work. Enrique Pineyro is another great surprise. His Santamarina is disarming. Despite all the bad things that have fallen on him, he keeps a pink attitude towards everyone he meets. Stefania Sandrelli, an interesting Italian actress, makes a great contribution to the film with her Elsa. Hector Alterio, one of the best Argentine actors, plays a small part of Simon. The wonderful Chiara Coselli is seen as Laura, and Melina Petrielli as noble Estela. <br /> <br /> "Esperando al mesias" proves that Daniel Burman is the voice to be reckoned with in the Argentine cinema.
