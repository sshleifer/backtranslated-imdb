This film shows intricate film techniques in which instead of the landscape to capture the attention of the camera, there are small details about how someone appears, how a woman can wear a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet. As a husband can wear a hat and socks, shoes and underwear, and both look so comfortable and comfortable. As a woman is provocative, it is another feature of the tableau that the director decides to convey to us that he is a free sexual spirit and strives for the pleasure he is seeking, without directly flirting or with any particular sensitivity to what the man feels. The relationship between wife and husband is unique. It is open, in which there is nothing back, no special shame about how she behaved and wants to share these facts with him because her main goal is always the fact of their marriage. There is nothing and nobody between them. Only chances of fate can intervene - his imprisonment during the war, and thus after his return in the end. A very intriguing movie that is completely absorbing.
