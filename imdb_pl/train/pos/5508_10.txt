It is 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, being a Cuban citizen for the past five years, disappears from the face of the Earth, leaving Fidel Castro's light to announce that he is probably dead, when he actually left Cuba will move to Bolivia to live in the assumed identity. Living in La Paz, Guevara takes up the idea of ​​overthrowing a corrupt, bourgeois government there. Once again, Steven Soderberg decides where "Che: Part One" will go away (this time better). The tempo is more intentional, the acting is always great (including the sick Benecio Del Toro, as Che Guevara). Suffice it to say that it will probably be best if you see both films to get to know Guevara's real story and what a man he was (I had a rare open window to see both films on one show ---- talk about a long trip!). As with "Che-Part 1: The Argentine", this movie has no MPAA rating, but it contains enough salty language and violence to easily capture "R".
