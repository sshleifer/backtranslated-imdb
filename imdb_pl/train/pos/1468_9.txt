The person who wrote the review "enough already with sweating and spitting" has no idea what cultural, literary or psychological criticism is. He rejects Zizek's interpretations because they do not seem to be "in line" with what the director originally intended. So what? The meaning of the intentions of the director (or author) is not important in critical theory. This is known as the "intentional error of the author" and should be avoided. <br /> <br /> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy Text or video CAN be analyzed by many theories, many of which disagree with each other, and completely ignore the author's intention. This is the most fundamental idea of ​​critical theory. <br /> <br /> Because of this, whoever wrote this wall of text wasted a lot of time and effort insulting Zizka. In fact, anyone who studies theory would immediately discredit this guy's opinion (I suggest I should too) because it's totally out of place. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... If you are interested in Freudian Laconian or Kristevian discourse at all, this movie is a must. He combines these theories with a popular movie, making them much more tangible and more pleasant than just reading or thinking about them.
