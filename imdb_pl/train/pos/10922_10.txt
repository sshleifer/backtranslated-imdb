When I was very young at a local TV station, on Saturday they showed kung fu movies of all kinds. I have seen many Kung Fu movies on weekends. I remember them a lot. I've seen great films like Crippled Masters, Blind Fist Bruce, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunken Monk, Rage of the Master, Tattoe Dragon and ... Five deadly venoms. I remember that day. Me and my dad just got lunch at Burger King. we'll see what the movie will be this Saturday. We ran into the house and jumped on the couch, switched on the set and threw it on the 56. The usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words of Kung Fu Saturday. Then the title was the title of the movie. He said Five deadly venom. Then the movie started. I got bitten into a hamburger amused by the pre-credit sequence. I loved this movie the moment it appeared. Toad Venom. In this age, the plot was difficult to make, but it was not what lured me ... it was a fight. The fights were so ... amazin g.I moaned every time an ad appeared and soon 2 hours of the best movie I've ever seen ended.
