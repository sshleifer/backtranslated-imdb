I have read many negative reviews of this movie and finally I had the opportunity to see it on DVD. Honestly, I really do not know what the problem is. <br /> <br /> This is a decent thriller for a mysterious murder, shown from various angles, from the eccentric cast of potential drug / suspects, including the late king of porn, John Holmes. The exact description of the story is in the summary of the plot - I would like to add more to the review than to summarize. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have gone so far as to give the film the lowest rating because of violence, but I really can not see it. MORE modern movies were worse - Saving Private Ryan was ultimately more brutal than the film, which often relies on alleged blood stains than real brutal killings (the murders depicted in this film were made with lead pipes, afterall). <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by both parts of the movie - the first showed John Holmes as a hopeless hungry drug addict, and the other half showed his side as a tiny conspirator in senseless bloodshed. The movie has a great acting act, although Dylan McDemorant looks more than out of place in his motorcyclist personality and the goatee personality of the evil boy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also amazing - a fantastic mix of Rock from the '70s and unclear pop, spread over a few hours in the right places, the Boaie Nights.
