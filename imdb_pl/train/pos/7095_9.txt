The stunning full-length adaptation of Chris Marker's LA JETEE, Terry Gilliam, is full of surprising surprises, but thanks to the wonderful cast still moves your heart. Gilliam's performance for a phantasmagoric work is based on David and Janet Peoples' scenario to play with your head just as with poor James Cole (Willis in the most similar to Steve McQueen - even better than McQueen!) Traveling condemned from the future who literally does not know whether he's coming or going, because a team of scientists is still sending him back to the wrong epochs, trying to prevent the 1995 plague that is deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Willis, rightly nominated for Oscar Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a good intentional psychiatrist, give some of the best results of their career. Even the Paul Buckmaster-style tango result is haunted. Do not miss it!
