Well, this is once again a movie that plays with your sentiments, and you come out all soft as opposed to a rocky movie. But I am a sucker for them, so I gave him a good result ... the acting was very good and there were many feelings. Violence is kept to a minimum, which causes change. I would give him 9, if not for the salute at the end! All in all a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
