If you like "Othello", you'll love this movie because half of the movie revolves around stage production. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great cast from Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as a woman in Colman's Life, while Edmond O'Brien plays an entrepreneurial press agent. <br /> <br /> Some of the supporting players I particularly liked are Millard Mitchell as a gray-haired reporter who sees the angle and Joe Sawyer, a response from 1940 to Drew Carey who plays a policeman in the case. <br /> <br /> Great raw moments in this with all realism noir.
