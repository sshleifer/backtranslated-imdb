My whole family is film lovers, so this site is extremely helpful in solving many debates. I am now deployed in Iraq. It helps me stay in touch with the world I know in the states. Thank you IMDb. I recommend this website to all my friends. Dolemite rules! Do not take my word for it, check it out for yourself.
