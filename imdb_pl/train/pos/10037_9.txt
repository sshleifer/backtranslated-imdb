The ship might have sunk, but the film did not! Director James Cameron of "The Terminator" did it again thanks to this amazing image. One of my favorite scenes is the "The Dinner table" scene in which the Rose family and friends meet Jack after he rescues her. Rose has the expression that every woman should have when you meet "THE ONE" ... I hope that I will have this look when I am in the room with my future husband. <br /> <br /> Jack and Rose have a connection, which is "MOVIE STUFF", but it's a good movie material. We have a greedy mother, and her entire elite is stuck in the company of co-workers who live on the husband's wealth. Rose almost commits suicide, but Gilbert Grape's star rescues her. I really liked hanging the boat on stage. It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The film is long but fantastic !!! Good story, good flow, good actors !!! Go see him twice, if you want, it's worth it!
