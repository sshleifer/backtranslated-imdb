Excellent pirate entertainment! It has all the good ingredients that attract attention - an engaging story about intrigue, a fire pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara), which attracts irresistible Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) who is in a secret private mission. They make a great romantic couple on the screen - sigh! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is a mean, evil pirate, heaving his wicked network of sharing and conquest. I noticed a very well-known face of Mildred Natwick, who served as an auxiliary as Mrs. MacGregor, defender of the young princess Patmy (Alice Kelley). <br /> <br /> There is a beautifully filmed landscape of the banks, ships and the bay. A lot of actions also in the fights of swords, battles of ships, bold leaps of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard the ship!). I heard from the fiery redhead one day in an interview for Maureen O'Hara that he boasts a great command of a bull and can also outdo Flynn in sword fighting at the time, but there will be no need to try it here. <br /> <br /> A very nice movie.
