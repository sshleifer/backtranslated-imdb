Like many of them, I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many here, who have done it, I love this program! I think it has been very well done and thought out. Everything that goes with it means spin-off, which should not be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it's a parody of other cartoons with one bad guy trying to get better than a good guy. Thanks to well-known figures of Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, it is much easier to engage the viewer in a parody from the beginning of every 30-minute episode. <br /> <br /> There have always been Scooby-Doo spin-offs that have annoyed fans. The classic are Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts from the 80's. These spin-offs took their place: they allowed the sale of new content, created new fans and kept Scooby-Doo goods on the shelves. I would agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get directions!" Does not fit into this traditional role, but probably what I've always wanted Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts to be: an action-packed show that focuses on the best / the funniest Scooby-Doo characters! Good program features: animation, voices, attention to detail, bad guys, "Best friend" relation between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, constant humor! Bad features: None, although the restored Mystery Machine is sometimes close. <br /> <br /> Well done Warner Bros. Animation! One of the wisest cartoons for a long time!
