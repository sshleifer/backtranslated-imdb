Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan origin. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in attitudes and values. By the way, his father announces that Reda will lead him to Haj (pilgrimage) to Mecca - something that Reda does not care about, but agrees only with his duty. As a result, from the very beginning, Reda is angry, but being a traditional Muslim, his father is difficult to talk or discuss his fears. Both father and son seem very stiff and inflexible - and it's very ironic when dad tells his son that he should not be so stubborn. <br /> <br /> When I read the summary, it talks about how many heroes grew and began to get to know each other. However, I really do not think it will happen and it is a fascinating and sad aspect of the film. Sure, there were moments of understanding, but there was a mainstream of hostility and repression. I liked it and I appreciate the fact that it could not be solved in full - how it would look fake. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is well-preserved and fascinating - giving Western people an extraordinary insight into Islam and hajj. It also provides a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional Islam with the younger secular generation. Although slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship in the whole movie may annoy some, I think it gave the film intense realism and made it look like a movie about people - not a formula. A nice and unusual movie.
