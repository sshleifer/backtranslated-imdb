I'm happy to admit that I'm a sucker of a beautiful film, and enough imaginative camera moves and angles may be enough to interest me with a fairly long movie. Though not as long as Gojoe, though he had one of the most amazing photos I've seen since the Korean MUSA. However, Gojoe provides much more than just beautiful images (just like MUSA ... which does not mean contrast) - this is the second biggest strength is a great acting game and a fascinating story with a very dark philosophy. I have to admit that I'm not sure what it is all about, but it definitely provokes thinking. Unclear, but definitely thinking: p <br /> <br /> One section where the movie could be better is action. There is a huge amount of bloodletting in the film, but the whole action is filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups and often obscured by objects in the foreground. It creates very intense and impressive visual effects, but it would be nice to see a few more real moves, which will make it more reliable that the villains will be able to wade through whole armies wasting everyone. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie is definitely one of the most interesting and beautiful movies I have seen in a long time. Recommended!
