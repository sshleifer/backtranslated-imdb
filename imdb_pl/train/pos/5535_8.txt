The first picture of the film shows the mountain ridge in the autumn morning fog, and my idea was: "It's almost too beautiful." And it looks like this: landscape images and animals that look like a series of romantic images, each of which is perfect in every detail. Even the girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. It may seem outdated and escapist, but it fits the story, which itself is a mute beauty, happening on the border between life and fairy tales, between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute. Extreme film saving, simple, slow story, only one actor and almost no special effects, exerted strong magic. That is why I think it regrettable that this saving was abandoned in the last minutes when suddenly two additional actors were introduced (a girl as an adult woman and her son). Another disadvantage is music, which is often obtrusive, Hollywood and sometimes inappropriate: I could not bring an English pop song along with French mountain glory. I went to the movie with my two young daughters, but I also recommend it to adults because they appreciate this kind of film. Of course, not everyone does that.
