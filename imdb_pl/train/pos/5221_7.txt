I did not have much interest in watching The Flock. Andrew Lau co-directed the Infernal Affairs trilogy, but was released from The Flock and was replaced by the Director of Emergencies, Niels Mueller. I had the impression that Lau made a good movie, but he did not satisfy him, so they fired him and employed another director. It usually does not work well (remember the Invasion). But Flock turned out better than I expected. great movie, but it's an interesting and fun thriller. Character development is very well done and I could know the heroes very well. Also, the relationship between the two main heroes is natural and reliable. Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring competent performances. , let's get to the negative points. One of the elements that really bothered me (there was a moment when it irritated me) was an excess of editing tricks to give the film more "attitude" and style. Their presence is arbitrary. I think the film should be more ambitious. Nevertheless, I recommend The Flock as a good thriller. It is not unforgettable at all, but it is fun.
