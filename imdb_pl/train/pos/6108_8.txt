I really liked this movie. Many Koreans will be familiar with this film because many of them have educators when they go to school. The cinematography was average. The film would have been better if the angel or camera movement were more irregular. The edition, however, was very clean and unusual. <br /> <br /> Acting was also very good. Kim Ha Neul usually played an innocent, weak girl in the Korean soap opera. But this time the sweet tomboy plays very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays a very credible role. <br /> <br /> I like the movie the most, the characters' emotions are not too exaggerated. There are many Korean romance movies that the characters cry in front of the audience, and I always thought he was very old. There was no such shit in this movie. <br /> <br /> Very funny and well done.
