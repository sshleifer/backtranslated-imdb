The actors are doing great, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's good that Robin Williams got the Osiric comedy role, otherwise it would be strange to see him in such production. It's really great that Kenneth decided to use the most complete version of the text, which happens not too often ... Thanks to that, viewers can see the whole, not the parts chosen by the director. Also - thank God that the film is in a classic form; NOT for surreal fanfaberies! Even so, "Tytus Andronicus" was impressive, but Hamlet is still a different story, at least that's my point.
