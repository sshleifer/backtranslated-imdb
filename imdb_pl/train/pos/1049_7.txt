The nuns will be released theatrically on March 24 in Sweden. A good opportunity for our Scandinavian friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It was shown in Gothenburg with a retrospective devoted to Kim Longinotto, the "director" of the festival. She gave a master class, very appreciated, talking about her method as a documentary and told the audience about the special circumstances that led her to make the sisters twice: the first version was lost for good, so the second shooting was organized at the end the film turned out to be different. There was a terrible problem, in this case to create the possibility of a very strong movie.
