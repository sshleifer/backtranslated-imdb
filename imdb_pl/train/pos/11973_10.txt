Full House is a wonderful sitcom about his father, Danny Tanner, whose wife had just died in a car accident. So Danny asks his brother-in-law Jesse Katsopolis and best friend Joey Gladstone to help raise three girls, Donna Jo 'DJ' Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite program in history and I can watch it throughout the day. Something in Full House always makes me laugh and sad. At Full House, there is never a boring moment. The main characters are Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner) and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle Tanner).
