Charleton Heston wore one, James Franciscus wore one, but Mark Wahlberg prefers not to wear a traditional cloth. I hope that no one will throw him as Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first two films of Planet, but Estrella Warren barely shows her cleavage - her hair is always on the road. Tim Burton could photograph this monkey saga and give the viewer something to watch. Even the pure Helena Bonham Carter never goes out of her outfit that looks like a big veil. She is adorable, but all love things are limited to restless looks and a little kiss at the end. Just like in Artificial Intelligence, which discusses sex between species among robots and humans, but never provides - Planet of the Apes suggests romance between species between humans and monkeys, but only clues. Lisa Marie is the only monkey who dares to be sexy. This film has three great actors, Tim Roth, Mrs. Carter and Paul Giamatti, who are experiencing the scenery as three monkeys and having fun. The superlative costume (some Oscars) costumes, sets, music make this hit a summer movie from 2001.
