Recently, I had the pleasure to see The Big Bad Swim in Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival and I have to say it's the best movie I've seen all year and the only movie that ever inspired me to write a comment / review. This film was beautifully directed and combined the script with realistic dialogues, a great acting game and an inspiring message. Ordinary life meets in the adult swimming class and becomes extraordinary in the celebration of the diversity of life. This is illustrated with images from the first minute of this captivating movie, in which we see only the legs and torso of people of various shapes and sizes entering the puddle of water. This film is superbly directed, because the actors are placed and placed in captivating scenes that attract attention and imagination.
