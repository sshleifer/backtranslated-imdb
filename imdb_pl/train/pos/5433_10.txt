This movie is one of my favorites. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... what a cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy in one. The final battle scene still gives me chills, and the ending always leaves me in tears. If you have not seen it, I definitely recommend it.
