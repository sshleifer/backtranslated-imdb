This is the weekend in which I watched this funny movie. and I really like it. all children are cute, they remind me of my own childhood with these stupid thoughts. is a real entertainment film for a family group on a weekend evening that can bring a lot of memories and laughter. Children's humor always works. nice game also. a simple story, but a nice shooting. good work for the director to find the child's way. when it comes to children's film, I think about '12 and holding '. next year, but it differed in the aspect of the world of a kid who is real and cruel. well done. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood that every child and family needs. P.S. I think Twitch is Nemo's voice from Finding Nemo.
