I just want to say that I've seen this movie twice and I love it! Acting is great and even if it's a similar conspiracy to "Raise Your Voice", I think the story never bores people who like this type of thing. He has some great lessons and shows us that we can do anything if we try. Incredible movie. I'm sure it will be the one that I will watch for a long time. Although Britney Spears writes a book, it's a very realistic plot, maybe it's not about falling in love, but about the fact that it's different and fights, but in the end it's the best in real life. The only small criticism is why the main girl in these films is always beautiful? Do you really think that Holly would meet the perfect guy of her dreams if she was ugly or mediocre? I doubt it ..
