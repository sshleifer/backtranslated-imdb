I missed almost the entire first season, but when other concerts were repeated, I began to watch. I finished buying the first season of iTunes. This is one of my favorite comedy programs. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor makes me keep on going. David Spade is funny, but sometimes a bit of Russell goes a long way. I like other cast members more (but I'm not saying that it does not add to the performance). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. If you have not checked it yet, try. If you can catch the episode where "Jeff" goes to the sperm bank, you'll see how good the program is. <br /> <br /> I hope this series will last a long time.
