Meryl Streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous Linda Chamberlain, who was accused and tried to kill Azarii Chamberlain's own child and using her alibi of predatory pontoons as her defense. Based on the book "Evil Angels" and titled so in the Australian edition, A CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly movie to watch. It presents a scenario that is too real for us in America: the witch-hunt against a person considered an easy target. <br /> <br /> Linda Chamberlain was the woman. Being someone who spoke her mind, someone who did not play cards of sympathy, and someone who was hard enough to continue his life despite her terrifying trial, she was described as a suspect and hated outside of understanding, even when it was clear not he killed her own child. The media began to tighten the loop and the ongoing invasion of privacy, which soon led the entire nation to stick to their sets when they gutted this piece piece by piece. And through it all, Lindy remained as stoic as ever, even when her husband Michael was falling apart. <br /> <br /> This attitude is of course a force, as unpleasant as it may look, and people react strongly to it. They want their worried mother to weep and cry, and sometimes she fainted, did not sit, and did not look empty. People do not understand that not everyone is grieving in the same way and when someone decides to become strong, begins speculation. Meryl Streep embodies this contaminated woman and does so with a cold but non-irritating woman who stood by her convictions, even if her freedom cost her. Because of her, Sam Neill is allowed to let his character slowly fall into despair - someone must, or Chamberlains would be too detached and no one wants to see it. Only that monster, which at the time of writing this text became an information media. They will always ride wrecks of trains and feed massacred manure to uninformed citizens.
