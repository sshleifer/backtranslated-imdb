It's a really great movie. Some songs have become immortal classics, and Fred and Ginger's dance is one of the best in history. But basically, all Fred and Ginger movies are the same. After singing and dancing, other movie characters make a movie. What really bothers me, why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub story of the movie is the reason why I watch it over and over again. Adds to this movie, does not detract from this. He has a winning personality and a great smile. Randy is in my top ten on the list of favorites. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. OK, so he's not really a great actor, but like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. He was very nice and in some ways he could reach the top. All Fred and Ginger's films had subplots that depended on other actors to fill the space between the music numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be cut by about half an hour. I would like more people to appreciate Randy and feel the need to face him.
