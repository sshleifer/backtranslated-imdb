I watched the presentation at PBS in the United States, when it was originally broadcast in 1988 (?). Assuming the miniseries were available on DVD, I bought the first editions of all three books last year. Since then I've been looking for a series on websites with online videos. Today I found this website. I will quit searching. <br /> <br /> I would also like to buy this set - 26 episodes - miniseries. After buying DVDs, I read every book, and then watched episodes for this book. That's what I did with Karl LeCarre's trilogy and the Texas Ranger trilogy of Larry McMurty. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have any suggestions for great books or book series that have become a very good television miniseries - or a movie series - that are now available on DVD?
