"8 SIMPLE PRINCIPLES ... FOR DATING MY DAUGHTER DAUGHTER" is my opinion, this is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I did not see every episode, but I still liked it. It's difficult to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always fun when the accident happened. I always laughed at it. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked the show more when John Ritter was a leading man. If you ask me, his sudden departure was very tragic. Everyone always gave a good performance, the spectacle was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope that some network will restore it to the fans of the series.
