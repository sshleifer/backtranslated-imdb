Not as bad a movie as I thought it would be. <br /> <br /> He has a good cast. It's good to see Roger Moore back on the screen, as well as the use of other British actors. <br /> <br /> You would like to see more Olivia D` in future projects. Perhaps he will appear opposite her cousin, sexy Maryam D 'Abo. <br /> <br /> Also good use of invisible locations such as Luxembourg. <Br> <br /> We hope that we will see more of such co-productions in Great Britain.
