This is a bar that is not the most fun movie I've ever seen. Starting with the sending of four fathers by their fathers to the Military Academy in Wienberg, there is a tone that continues throughout this goofball movie and does not give way for a moment. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to describe this movie; elements of humor are so clear and ingeniously convinced that after the first look it seems to be nothing more than a silly comedy about the desire of teenagers from the 80s. But that's much more! Fresh from the minds of these people from the magazine MAD, Up the Academy gives a formula and style that I have never seen, like ANY of the "funniest" offers that have come out of Hollywood in recent years. Basically, the movie is so full of infantile maize material that you can guess that the authors were alone with fourteen-year-olds. See this movie if you like to act "immature". Classic. *****
