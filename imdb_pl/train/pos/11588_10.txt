This movie was great and I would like to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to catch the young eagle. the boy must feed and take care of the eagle until he is old enough to be sacrificed for cultivation. the boy saves the eagle from being killed and escapes from the tribe. The eagle helps him feed, catching a duck from a small pond, which the boy is terrified. Later, the boy shoots the deer he asks for the baby because their shots were very similar. Only when they check the thickness of the red lines will they determine who actually got the deer. But that was unfortunate, because it made other boys even more cruel, and at the end chase him on the cliff, but when you think he will fall away from pure love, the eagle turns him into a golden eagle with a necklace as a reminder of who he was . If anyone knows where I can buy this movie, let me know. I have not seen him for over 30 years, but I still remember the fragments of the film. Deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
