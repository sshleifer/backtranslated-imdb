Kurt Russell is so reliable and works so constantly that he needs to think about him later, to realize that there were sincere good things important [overcoming the fear of a Stranger, learning to overcome early conditions, the power that friendship can bring, etc. .] in the story. It is very rare for a "action guy" that even me [who thinks that A / A is a brutal mush] liked this movie and recommended it to every guy I know ... it's a pity that this guy was overlooked because he agreed with law it should be one of the biggest box office hits in action and adventures - it has something for everyone, without imposing credulity or losing almost immediate shares. I'm afraid that the answer to not being a hit is that adults did not go to see him. Anyone who is less than 20 years old probably not only saw more violent actions in their video games, but probably would not get into multi-layered, multi-threaded looks or care about her. This movie can transform anyone who avoids A / A as mindless violence. If a guy takes his woman [or hires her or sees her in the cable list] to see the movie, he'll be much more inclined to get her to go to other action movies with him.
