Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the fourth film from the series Dirty Harry. Clint is older, but he still has it, Harry was asked for a vacation after the troubles that took place because of the robbery (where the memorable slogan "Make My Day" comes from)! the woman turned into vigilance after a rape attack in a funfair and begins to win punks one by one. The last movie in which we'll see Sandra Locke in Clint Eastwood's movie! Improved after the Enforcer, which was a bit more comedic and less serious. Clint Eastwood sunglasses are Gargoyles that are best known for the sunglasses worn by Arnold Shwartzeneger in The Terminator. Worth watching if you like Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry movies or crime thrillers.
