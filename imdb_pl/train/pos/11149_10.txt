Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides to leave his little life in Texas and make them big in Big City. Women are there asking, and men are mainly "tutti-fruttis". With wide-open eyes, he comes to New York, unprepared for a series of humiliating adventures he experiences, one worse than the other. In the midst of this chaos, he meets and befriends Rico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless man who lives in a seemingly condemned building. <br /> <br /> There are few stories as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes intended to present not only the fate of Joe Buck in the City, but also interfere with his past and show us in the shock sections and semi-psychedelic dream sequences fragments of his past : his failed relationship with his girlfriend Annie (Jennifer Salt), who was raped by a gang, his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by grandma, who also used to bust people for money. Pessimistic air dominates in the film almost from the beginning of the year, when Nilsson plays his deceptively flowery "Everybody's Talking" in the first songs; we feel that even if we want Joe to finally reach his goal in the city, the chances are high, he will not be and he will work for pennies in a dead end - shown in a master shot from his outer point, see later the movie when he looks like a man he works as a dishwasher in the soup kitchen by the window and sees himself. We know from the look in his eyes do not want to end this way. <br /> <br /> The dark story of interrupted hopes, John Schlesinger creates haunted images of lost souls in the late 1960s and the center, a prevailing friendship between two men who struggle to give their lives a meaning among the intangible comfort of a dignified life . There is a presumed belief that they could be lovers - Ratso stretches out his hand to hug Joe on the party scene, and their final hug at the end certainly shows it - but it's basically a buddy movie that manages to survive, literally, until death and to bring some form of hope to Joe, who at the end in Florida seems to be much changed, older, wiser.
