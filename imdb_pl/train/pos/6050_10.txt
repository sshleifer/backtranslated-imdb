Eventually! A decent British comedy that does not focus on some macabre bank robbers, nor does it break out of the television series. John Ivay's film is a psychoactive tale of discovery, dressed in a motorcycle outfit. The three heroes are gentle fools with a penchant for failure, and each of them is a turning point in their lives, giving a sensitive, emotional trio of sub-story elements to together create a rebellious comedy. The chemistry between the three amigos is tangible and is a moving companion with funny dialogue and classic comedic moments. He feels part of Withnail and me, part of American Werewolf in London and part of Quadraphenia (but only because of cycling gangs and Phil Daniels). In fact, the nice daddy Phil Daniels reminds you of Danny, dealer in Withnail and me, with his scientific approach and scientific involvement in drugs. This is a great movie, especially for those who in the past had fun with psychoactive substances who will have to deal with many moments in the film. The personal favorite is a genius scene in a Welsh corner shop, buying munchies while stumbling over "mushrooms". This delicate comedy will warm up the hearts of the heart and make you laugh loudly. And you do not have to ride bikes or even like them. But it will add to it if you do. Excellent.
