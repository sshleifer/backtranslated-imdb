In my opinion, VIVAH is the best film from 2006, from a director who has been successful in his entire career. I do not like romantic movies at the moment because I see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable. However, I watched the movie three times ... and believe me, it's an amazing movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH returns to the traditional route, displaying simple characters in a sensible and realistic travel history between engagement and marriage. The film plays in all ways because it can be reflected in what we do (or would do) when it comes to marriage. In this sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya did his homework well and presented a very realistic story in a well-made, very entertaining film. <br /> <br /> Some of the sequences in this movie will be immediately interesting: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way he tries to look at her without making this too obvious to her and her family. The song "Do Anjaane Ajnabi" fits well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita when she comes to see her - i.e. Shy Shy, not knowing exactly what to talk about, but pulling a decent conversation. Also the naive nature of Amrita, limited eye contact, shy characteristics and a gentle response to Shahid's questions. <br /> <br /> * Emotional breakdown of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath), when she feeds him at Shahid's party in the form of a daughter-in-law other than her uncle's beloved niece. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film belongs to Amrita Rao. The actress portrays the role of Poonam with such conviction that you can not imagine anyone replacing it. It looks beautiful throughout the film and perfectly presents the innocent and shy traditional girl. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor does a great job too. He provides a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to playing Sooraj R. Barjatya. In fact, Shahid and Amrita create a lovely pair on the screen, without a shadow of a doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (Excellent), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very good). <br /> <br /> In general, VIVAH provides what he promised, a well-made and realistic story of two families. The film has top-class performances, excellent history and great music that match the film, as well as directing by the fantastic Sooraj R. Barjatya. This is a must see!
