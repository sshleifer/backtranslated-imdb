I feel a bit protected from this film because it was my introduction to the poem U.N.C.L.E. It was 1972, and I.T.V. he ran all eight functions in one run on the bumper (and then on Saturday evenings the "The Persuaders" with the participation of Tony Curtis and Roger Moore again appeared). "Karate Killers" was chosen to open the season. It started with a nice action sequence, when the sports car Solo and Kuryakina was attacked by the THRUSH mini-copter squadron. Since then, I have been a fan of life. <br /> <br /> After the main subtitles (nice to see a special sequence of titles instead of the usual practice of slowing down the material), we go to the laboratory of dr. .Simon True (Jim Boles), inventor of the new formula for the extraction of gold from seawater. True wife Amanda (Joan Crawford) has an affair with agent THRUSH Randolph (Herbert Lom). A ruthless guy, he kills both the doctor and his wife before he looks for a formula. Truth prepared for this event - divided it into five segments, each of which is written in his photograph and sent to his five daughters, all of whom are scattered all over the world. <br /> <br /> Solo and Kuryakin set out to get the first formula, leading to a series of episodes in various locations and episodes such as Telly Savalas (as a tight Italian count), Terry-Thomas and Curt Jurgens. One of Dr.True's daughters - Sandy (Kim Darby) - accompanies U.N.C.L.E. boys in their global search. <br /> <br /> After collecting the formula, THRUSH appears and tells them to pass it, and then throws them to their secret base at the North Pole ... <br /> <br /> From all of UNCLE feature films, then is the one that I should have produced especially for the cinema. It hurts to be a TV product, although even one is a bit more expensive than usual. No photos were shot, and individual segments are repeatable, usually ending with a fragment between U.N.C.L.E. and THRUSH. From the cast of Joan Crawford, we are undoubtedly in a small role, and Curt Jurgens behaves badly as a sugar dad. As a London bobby, Terry-Thomas is as delightful as ever, and Herbert Lom is good as the main villain. Kim Darby is crouching as "Sandy". She should have told her to stay home. <br /> <br /> It's surprising that she manages to be more fun and funny than many official releases of the time, including "In Like Flint, Casino Royale" and "The Ambushers." I would like to know how Solo and the company escaped from THRUSH H.Q. after Randolph's death.
