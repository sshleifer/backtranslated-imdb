I really liked this movie. He managed to do something that several films are doing now; provided family values ​​while having fun. Nancy Drew is a heroine of all generations and a role model for young girls. The little girls with whom I was, I really liked the film and we talked constantly about Nancy when we left the theater. The film has relatively few problems for families and I do not think that parents get bored while sitting in the theater. No, he will not win an Oscar and show great special effects or even a scary terrible secret, but he entertained me and stood in the spirit of books. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has a young girl (she will love her!) Or any fan of books. You will not be disappointed.
