I think James Cameron can become my favorite director because it's my second review of his films. In any case, everyone remembers RMS Titanic. It was big, fast and "unsinkable" ... until April 1912. It was all news and one of the greatest tragedies in history. Well, James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it, but he played two fictional characters to be the center of attention instead of the ship. Well, for the main review, but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero facts, and the only fact that will be present is the movie event. <br /> <br /> So our two main heroes are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not too annoying, but watch this and you will find out why they can become annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The main villain, I think, is bad luck, fate, the hand of God (without blasphemy) or the usual Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what will you get ?! Oh yes! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting heroes are: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber) (idk was so nice), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) and many more. We also have a contemporary treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to history, something good. The action here is amazing, especially in the second half, the drama is also good. In the end you can lose sight of thunderstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and works. The treasure hunter is looking for the Ocean Heart and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing this diamond. He calls and tells his story about the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by the social class and ultimately the fate of the ship. Everything in this story works and there are very few defects. I give the Titanic an amazing 86%
