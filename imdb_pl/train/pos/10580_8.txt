This fantastic movie must be seen, knowing that millions have gathered together 10 cents to see it and forget about the gloomy everyday economic conditions in the 1930s. Remember that 10 cents bought a loaf of bread then, so for many people it was a small luxury. It is a testimony to how Hollywood tried to make the United States feel a little better about itself. You'll notice that many Hollywood actors and actresses have been cast in similar films with the Hollywood studio system, such as James Cagney, William Powell, Ruby Keeler, Frank McHugh, Joan Blondell and Guy Kibbee. Also, the US Army troops were always respected with enthusiasm and patriotism, just like the use of precise marching by the great choreographer Busby Berkeley.
