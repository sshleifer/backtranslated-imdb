The star of this movie is the script. Attention to detail in the period of clothing, language, social customs (we do not harm women) and politics are noteworthy. This is a reminder of today's Kosovo. Subtle fragments of action scenes are for the attentive viewer, and the choreography of these action sequences is great. Perhaps this movie is close to the bones of reality to get the support it should receive. It is like a staircase of increasing violence with transient intervals of peace and quiet between each step. Great movie ....
