A great surprise for the Spanish cinema. I never thought that Jordi Molla could be such a great director, in the end I do not care about his choice in movies. However, this movie was absolutely fantastic and unpredictable ... something that I ALWAYS enjoy! He did not enjoy the good press and I really do not think he will ever be released on the US market. If we even have to settle for a DVD or VHS ... I do not want to talk much about this story because I do not want to ruin it, but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes a new messiah just for kicks and some money (how many ...) before he realizes that he is immersed in a life he did not count on.
