The title slightly inflates the content of this film, which may lead to some unfulfilled expectations. Honestly, there is not much "panic in the streets" here. In fact, very few people in the whole film know that there is a murderer in the wild who can spread the plague to everyone and everyone he meets. Having said that, we have a very well-made story with a level of tension that starts quite high anyway (because, unlike people "on the street", the viewer knows what is happening) and the director Elia Kazan builds it very purposefully. When the pestilence killer is sought, one of the more interesting sidebars I found was the growing relationship between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and Warren's captain (Paul Douglas). At the beginning, both of them really do not like each other, even though they have to cooperate with each other. At the end, they created a real bond of mutual respect. Kazan did a good job. <br /> <br /> Almost all performances here were excellent. Widmark and Douglas were great, and I looked at Jack Palance very early on in his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes was a bit flat like Reed's wife, Nancy, but her role was not so important in history. In summary, great work. 9/10
