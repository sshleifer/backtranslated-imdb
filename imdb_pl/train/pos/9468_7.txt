I saw a special screening of this film today. I have to tell you that I'm not a big fan of Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I really did not have any expectations. It ended up being a bit liked. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life is a story of a widower with 3 daughters who spends the weekend with his family. When she is in a bookstore, she meets a woman of her dreams, only to find out that she is his brother's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite well done - the soundtrack, photos and acting are top notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem was mainly that there was a lack of character development, mainly with Data Cook. We'll never take a closer look at the relationships between Dane figures and Steve, and I felt that it could help to show what is Dan's inner conflict about falling in love with Danny's girlfriend. In addition, Dan in Real Life is definitely a solid, sweet movie - definitely a nice break from all the horrors and action movies we've won this year.
