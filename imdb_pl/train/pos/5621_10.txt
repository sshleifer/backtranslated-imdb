Gentle, tiny, almost unimportant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something huge. At the front and behind the camera, he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces I have had the pleasure to see and see again. It has never let me down. People, even people who know me quite well, think / think there was / is something wrong with me, based on my attractiveness, or should I say devotion for "Le Locataire" They may be right, I do not know, but there is something irresistibly fascinating in the darkness of Polanski and I have not even mentioned humor. The secret surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant, the secret that takes over and of course us, me. This building is populated by great old Oscar winners: Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lila Kedrov. For anyone who loves movies, it's a must watch. One, two, three, many, many views.
