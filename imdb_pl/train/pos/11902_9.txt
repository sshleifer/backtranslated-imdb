These films describe the life and times of William's castle. He made a series of low-budget horrors in the 1950s and 1960s, which he sold with tricks. In "13 Ghosts" you need viewers to see ghosts (they were in color, the movie was in b & w). "Tingler" had theater seats equipped with a buzzer that shook the audience when the monster escaped to the cinema. "Marabre" issued an insurance policy to all members, in case they were scared to death! The films themselves were very bad, but the tricks made people hurry to see them. In this document, there are interviews with Castle inspired directors, actors in his films and his daughter. He also falls into his home life and the kind of man he was (in all respects he was a great guy). The document is affectionate, very funny and absolutely riveting. It is very short (under 90 minutes) and it is never boring. Be sure to see Castle fans and horror fans. My only complaint - very few sequences have been shown in his photos. Besides, it's just great.
