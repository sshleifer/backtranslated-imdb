I rarely see a movie in which I am completely absorbed; It was one of them. He had good acting, dialogue, story, and the scenery was beautiful. I laughed loudly many times, especially the scene dealing with the invasion of the kitchen. The slapstick comedy made by the rented lunkhead had me on the floor, but I admit that I'm a sucker on the slapstick. The story concerned a group of thirty people returning to the summer camp, in which they participated 20 years earlier. It was a farewell camping week because the place will be closed permanently at the end of the season. As adults, the camp looked different and felt different to him and each other. I recommend this funny, moving film to everyone. <br /> <br />
