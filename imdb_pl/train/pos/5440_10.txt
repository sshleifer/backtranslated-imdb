Three buddies, sergeants in the British Army, play and fight in imperial India. Intensely loyal to each other, they encounter their greatest and most deadly challenge when they encounter the revival of a hideous cult and its mad, implacable guru. Now they have to rely on the weakest servant of the regiment, the water carrier GUNGA DIN, to save dozens of the queen's soldiers before a massacre. <br /> <br /> Based more on the Three Musketeers than on the classic poem by Kipling, this is a great adventure epic - a worthy entry into the Golden Year of Hollywood in 1939. Full of tension and humor, while keeping the romantic interludes as little as possible, it attracts the viewer's attention and keeps him up to (sentimental) conclusion. <br /> <br /> It is virtually fruitless to discuss the nuances of the performance of three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Because they are really three parts of one organism - inextricably and, as a rule, and goals, not to distinguish. However, it does not reduce anything from great fun by simply watching their great time. <br /> <br /> (It is worth noting, in parentheses, that McLaglen boasted an outstanding military career from the First World War, Fairbanks would have an unbreakable record in World War II - mainly in secret affairs and earning as many as 4 honorable knights after the conflict, when Grant reportedly worked under the guise of British intelligence, guarding Hollywood Nazi sympathizers.) Real acting laurels should go to Sam Jaffe, taking over in the title role. He fills the humble man with radiant dignity and great courage, thanks to which the last line of Kipling's poem is true. It is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague Love is actually steadfast like a regimental major, while Eduardo Ciannelli is Evil Incarnate as Thuggee guru. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, are effective, but they have little to do. The film's heroes recognize Cecil Kellaway in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine's father. <br /> <br /> The film chose the villains well. The demonic cult of Thuggee, worshipers of the hideous, blood-soaked Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction, was the bane of Indian life for six centuries, ritually choking up to 30,000 deaths a year. In 1840, the British army, in cooperation with a number of princely states, finally managed to suppress religion. From now on he will remain a material of novels and nightmares.
