This amazing document gives us an insight into the lives of brave women in the court system of Cameroon - policewomen, lawyers and judges. Despite the huge difficulties - lack of resources, desperate misery of people, many languages ​​and many legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious / ethnic origin of the accused and the accused - these brave, strong women make a difference. <br /> <br /> It's a rare thing - a really inspiring movie that brings back a little faith in humanity. Despite the atrocities that we see in the film, justice is served thanks to these passionate, hardworking women. <br /> <br /> I just hope that this movie will be widely released in the United States. The more people see this movie, the better.
