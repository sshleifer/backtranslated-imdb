Space Camp is a pretty decent movie. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, and the special effects are decent at this time. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally released on the time of the shuttle disaster and it really made it difficult on the subject of popularity. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the swing door is open in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen, it is ... on the TV ... it looks just average. I remember the scene in the theater. It made you feel like you really were there. <br /> <br /> That would be a good movie to watch on IMAX, but I'm sure it will never happen.
