This film is nothing but a dark, rough masterpiece. I can be biased because the era of apartheid is an area in which I have always felt. But I would say it's okay with Cry Freedom and Cry the Beloved Country. Unfortunately, I have never heard about this movie a few days ago. Inside is one of the most underrated films of all time, probably because it was a small film company, I've never heard of it before. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors, is credible and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays his role well. Do not look for humor in this movie, there is none. It is real, wild and rough to the last, and for sensitive people I would say bring a box of tissues. But movies as big as it makes you wonder why the biggest movies are never heard?
