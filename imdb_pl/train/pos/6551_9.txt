I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst ... because of the bad reviews of everyone else. I thought: even if I do not read books, it does not look like Nancy Drew, which I've heard of. But I was wrong. Of course, it was not a copy of books, but when you're making a movie from something, you have to modify it to become entertainment on the big screen. The plot was pleasant and exciting with many real horrors and I thought Emma Roberts was really credible in her own way of presenting this classic character. There were a few funny moments, on the contrary, in many statements Nancy is in no way disappearing. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and honest. One of the things that this film did well was to equate the whole with a mix of comedy, romanticism, moments of tension and heart. I loved this movie. What a flutter, what a quick move! And if you're smart and decide to trust me and go see, be prepared for terrible, hell, moments, because I was crazy! Go, see this or be a bum-bum and let other people decide what you think about this movie for you ... a mistake I almost made. I love it, I want to have this movie! Now I also love Emma Roberts. It's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp with DH. Love it, love it.
