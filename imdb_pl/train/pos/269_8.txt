I am a fan of TV movies in general and it was one of the good ones. The performances in the entire cast were quite solid and there were twists and turns that I did not see before each ad. For me it was a bit like Medium met CSI. <br /> <br /> Did someone else think that at some lights the daughter looks like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they connected in any way? I would definitely look at it or rent it if it ever appeared on the video. <br /> <br /> Dedee was great. I did not see many things in her, and she did her work very convincingly. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy watching mysterious TV movies, check this out if you have a chance.
