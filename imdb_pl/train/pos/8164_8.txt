This movie was very nice, but you'll like it only when: - you hate going to the dentist, but you are not afraid of a movie in which one of them goes to beserk - you love horrory <br /> <br /> I especially liked the fact that they tried to explain the brutal actions of the main character. The fact that he is completely obsessed with purity (especially in the mouth), and then catches wives who provide some oral pleasure to a mud-covered man with a pool, is quite a plausible reason to go overboard. <br /> <br /> liked it. I give him 8.
