As a great fantasy fan in general, and especially the works of Neil Gaiman *, I am eagerly awaiting this film with such zeal, so hungry and with such a bitter-sweet mixture of expectation and fear of disappointment that I can hardly believe that it is finally here. And you know what? I did not have to worry that the movie version is amazing. It differs from the book, but in a good way - less capricious, more comic, still deeply sweet and charming. <br /> <br /> The special effects are absolutely spotty and make magic a natural and proper part of the Wall world without being overtly spectacular and obtrusive. <br /> <br /> Proper attention was devoted to telling stories and stimulation, and casting is largely triumphant, with ghastly Princes (whose appeals read almost as "Who's Who" now a cool British comedy - Rupert Everett, David Walliams of celebrity Little Britain, two guys from Green Wing, etc.) steals most of the best lines and almost all the funniest moments of movies that exist in abundance. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of the small critics I have in the whole movie is that sometimes the comedic elements become a bit OTT, subtlety comes out of the window into an obstacle in the main story .... For example, an episode of Ricky Gervais was much too "Ricky Gervais was doing his usual comedic David Brent in the Office", as I like it, and in my opinion he created an unwelcome and shocking break from the magic spell of the evolving history (though in honesty, from my memory I believe that the character of Ferdy in the original book WAS Beautiful "Ricky Gervais" - I ask when I come back to her) ... <br /> <br /> But this is a small argument, an otherwise impeccably cast and script story with a good mix of action and romance. Charlie Cox, as the hero of Tristan, captures the right mix of naivety, subtle comedy and self-fulfillment required for a story in which "a humble young boy embarks on a life-changing task"; Claire Danes as Yvaine is beautiful, pugnacious and just a bit alien or airy, a perfect interpretation of her stellar role; Robert De Niro in the episode that every reviewer speaks about, deserves praise, good fun (it looks like he also has a ball) ... and Michelle Pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty like the wicked witch Lamia, my favorite overall performance of the movie. If you liked her wonderfully ugly performance in the latest "Hairspray", then you will also enjoy it. <br /> <br /> So, to summarize this review: you will definitely laugh, smile, and you can even cry - Stardust is a beautiful, warming heart fairy tale for the whole family, with a heart of gold and more sass'n smarts, than it is immediately visible. One of my favorite films is the absolutely fabulous princess fianc√©e, and Stardust is easily compared to this, for good reason, because it's a very similar kind of movie exploring similar themes and territories ... and the same as The Princess Bride. , wise and funny twenty years after the first release, I believe that delicious sweetness in Star Dust dust will appear as a favorite family on our TVs (or similar future device!) for many years.
