I was adopted after birth and for sure I had NO problems that Antwone Fisher had in the film, but I still share some emotions and this movie really helped me get them out and force them to deal with them. It even caused me to realize that I had a "missing piece" and now I am going to find my siblings. <br /> <br /> I cried for almost a day after I saw it for the first time. Antwone's confrontation with his birth mother combined with his father's family reaction to his sudden appearance is powerful for those of us who do not know what will happen if we find our nascent parents. And his self-confidence and affirmations towards his mother and the perpetrators of his past were so powerful. I really could identify with my need to tell people "yes, I was put away by my parents when I was born. BUT another set of parents raised me and loved me. And now I am a success! "<Br> <br /> It also helped my wife to understand me and our adopted children who had lived through their tragic experiences before they came to our home. It helped me to realize how much our social system collapsed. If you remember how you read last year the story of a Florida foster child who was "lost," followed by the story of "Miranda and Ashley" in Oregon City, where SCF ignored many complaints about sexual abuse about a man who ultimately killed them he killed AND in the week in which this movie was released, another story in New Jersey, three children who were ignored by the system. One died. The state apparently thought that the house they were in was okay, because the carer was employed (as a stripper) and "only from time to time" used heroin! <br /> <br /> There are so many problems in this movie - and the script deals with them so well, and the actress that Antwone Fisher should be nominated for the "Best Picture" for sure. Regardless of whether you are adopted or not, it is a heartbreak that no one can ignore when it comes to children in our society.
