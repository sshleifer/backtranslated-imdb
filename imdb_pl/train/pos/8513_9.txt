I've always had a philosophy that every person has a different taste, I think this movie is amazing and I think that every college student can agree with me. Despite this, it is not a "plot movie", but about real guys and some "problems" that they face. I consider the film to be funny (especially the parts that played jokes). Simply put, if you have the same 'wavelength' like these people, this movie will be amazing. I do not think it will win in the Golden Globes or Oscars, or that the people in this film will become the future Hollywood stars, but it is a kind of "classic classic" among young people who can relate to their experiences. For me, the guy who stands out the most is Hans: a Scandinavian guy who, according to him, "is not an observer", but gets all (or some) chicks. "Little People" also play a big role in the film, especially when they're drunk. If I keep going, I can give a spoiler and I do not want to do it, just go and get a movie and you will not regret it. I give him 8/10
