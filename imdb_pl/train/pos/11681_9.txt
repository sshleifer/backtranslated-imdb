Many of the reviews and comments I've read about this movie say it's a rather outdated movie and performance by Clary Bow. Although the storyline was rather typical of Clara's later silence, I still think it's a little heart-wrenching and incredibly funny. Clara plays a happy Hawaiian girl who will not stop to win the man he loves ... no matter that the man is married! Clara's lack of modesty was shocking during the day, but I believe that it is suitable for sweets and overall movie fun. Although it is definitely not a brilliant story (basically typical), this movie is a pleasant showcase of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
