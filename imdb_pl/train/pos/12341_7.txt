Although the Lang version is better known, Borzage's work is not without interest, far from it: her "heavenly" sequences are even better. The metaphor of the train (perhaps borrowed from the end of "la roue" by Abel Gance) is ultimately more convincing than the "above" heavenly world. <br /> <br /> Borzage's delicacy for his characters shows Marie and love outside the grave is one of his favorite subjects (ending "three companions"). The park seems to be everywhere: we see it even when we are in the poor home of Marie. I do not think the sets are so bad, they are stylized as a mistake. Fairs from far away are almost suitable for sci-fi film. <br /> <br /> Borzage never forgets his social fears: in a heavenly train going up, the Gods can not stand being confused with the riffraff, but as the "main judge" he says: "there is no difference". <br /> <br /> This is not an important job for Borzage (or Lang version), but search if you're interested in a great director's career.
