I thought that the sentry would be an average film. When I finally saw it, I made a good surprise. The film is not great, but it is very funny and the action scenes are very well done. 24 or Alias ​​series. It is very similar to this series and reminded me of the Wolfgang Petersen thriller In the line of fire. If you're expecting one of the most original and one of the biggest movie history thrillers, you'll be disappointed. But if you go with little expectations, you'll like the sentry. <br /> <br /> Mark: 7
