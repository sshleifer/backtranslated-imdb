These are cult things. Me and my friends meet once a year to enjoy this movie. It is very funny and very dry. I have seen this movement several dozen times and I am not happy about it yet. The actors are funny and with every watching is getting better! If you liked "Morons from out of Space", you'll love it. A great game in War of the Worlds. I love the madness of the Red Neck to get the aliens, the worm on the mask, the DOD, Look for the warmth of the Annihilator, the Mine Field, the Red Camouflage, breaking the speed limit by 1800 mph! "I'll take a bucket!" Very funny. I would like it to come out on a DVD! Forget about negative opinions, see for yourself!
