I'm not going to lie, it's a great movie. I saw it about 4 months ago in my local theater. I saw it a second time and I was a little bored in slow scenes. Sid (laziness) is not so flattering, but Diego (I think the mountain lion) is really good in the movie. The animation is unique and the story has a moving end. It is worth taking children up to 10 years old, but teenagers will probably find it a bit boring. Also, the character's uniqueness is so interesting. As I said, this is a pretty good movie, but I'm evaluating "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" above. 8/10
