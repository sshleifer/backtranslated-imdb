Richard Dreyfuss starred in the film Moon Over Parador in 1988, starring Paul Mazursky, starring Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfuss plays an actor from New York, Jonathan Nolan, in the Caribbean country of Parador, to make a movie. When the dictator suddenly dies, the head of the secret police (Julia), who actually controls the dictator and the country, pulls Jonathan to the role of a dictator, noting the similarity between them. Soon Jonathan is imprisoned in the palace as Alphonse Simms, and Madonna (Braga), prostitute Simms, who realizes that he can help him in every possible way. <br /> <br /> Mazursky, who appears as a drag in Simms "Mom, let's look at how the CIA works in third world countries. Winters' character, apparently the salesperson, is actually a CIA agent. The film, however, flirts with, but really does not approach very serious events and is more fun and at the same time funny. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss performs a fantastic job as Jonathan the actor and Alphonse dictator, creating two separate characters and nailing both. The wonderful Sonia Braga is as great as Madonna, and Raul Julia plays Strausmann, a man behind the dictator in a funny way. This is one of those performances in which you never know what a character thinks - it can be nice or at any time become a psychic. Charo is on hand as a maid and at the same time can be fun and discreet. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, not a big hit, but very funny.
