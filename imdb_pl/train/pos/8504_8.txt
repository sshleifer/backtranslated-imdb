You play as a B.J. Blazkowicz, a tough soldier of an American secret agent who is sent to uncover the secret of the Nazis and turn the tide of World War II. This means everything from the outbreak of the Nazi dungeon to the foiling of Hitler's war machine and even the FÃ¼hrer himself. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most influential game in those days. That's because it literally inspired this obsession. At the time there were many games, and even more, but every now and then you get a real thief. It's one of them. Like Tetris before him, and more recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in every way, but the photos heard around the world that led to one of the largest tidal waves of games were fired by B.J. Blazkowicz. Space soldiers, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and other legions owe their existence to ID boys. Regardless of whether directly or in most cases indirectly, but still do. <br /> <br /> Even with old looks, very old graphics, super simple gameplay (it's really a game, games now border with "level") and high rectangular levels, the range of all six episodes provides a lot of fun. Particularly discovering these secrets with the help of treasure and chaos in them. <br /> <br /> Also: "Stop!" * bang! bang! bang! * "AARRRGH !!!" never gets old. --- 8/10 <br /> <br /> The PC-13 was assessed for "deep slaughter" voluntarily. However, this is extremely tame compared to what games have today.
