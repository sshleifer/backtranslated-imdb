it's a great movie. I like it when ning goes down to get ink, and the skeletons chase him, but luckily he escaped them, opened the window and did not even notice them. xiao qian is also very pretty. and when he put the needle in Wu's ass, his hysteria. and when he says that love is the greatest thing on earth, standing between two swords is great too. then also the part in which he eats scones, watching how a guy kills many people. then you see him singing poems when he ran away from the wolves. love scenes are romantic, xiao qian and ning look lovely together. add comical timing, gigantic language, and you have horror, romance, comedy, everything at once. not to mention great special effects in the 90's.
