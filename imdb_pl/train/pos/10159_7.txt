There are several movies or movies that I consider to be favorite for years. The gospel path was one of them. I watched this as a young teenager and would like to have the opportunity to watch it again. My favorite parts are the fact that <br /> <br /> 1 / Jesus was blonde. <br /> <br /> 2 / the last supper was a great meal, <br /> <br /> 3 / he liked to play with dzieci, <br /> <br /> 4 / His death was for all people and forever. <br /> <br /> The movie may not have been a theological or high quality sound, but it touched my heart at the time. Besides, I'm a fan of Johnny Cash and it was a bold undertaking. If he ever comes out on a DVD, I'll buy it exclusively for sentimental reasons.
