Nicolas Roeg's designs are at least variable, but they are never less interesting. "Littleness" is, of course, primarily a tailor-made set design: it is quite concise and quite "connected with peace". BUT, it pays to watch this film more than once: the basic themes are not explicitly presented, and what's more, it takes some time to adapt to the set and reversal of the roles of four heroes: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein is stunned by the guilt about Hiroshima, but he likes the simplicity of sexual contact with Munro; Munro is tired of being seen as a bimbo and wants intellectual credibility; Senator McCarthy is at the peak of his ability to hunt witches, but he is a powerless sagazebag; DiMaggio is uncertain about his fame, is obsessed with himself and is prone to violence. Each of them contains grains of its own destruction. Each character has a troublesome, abusive / offensive past and a dubious future. Gradually, we see that obsession itself is the main topic. America's obsession with post-war icons of culture and customs; Obsessions of heroes of something that no one can have: peace of mind and / or happiness. <br /> <br /> Compared to the theory of relativity, the proposed unified field theory, and even the cosmos itself, all the aspirations and interactions of the Roeg heroes seem irrelevant. However, these aspects of the physical universe (all this is quantum, trust me!) They influence us when they are applied to the development of means to destroy us. Monroe's mention of the principle behind the neutron bomb (without naming it as such) is not an anachronism per se, but can only be understood by contemporary audiences. Indeed, ALL references in the script are only available to an experienced viewer: one au fait with events from the 1950s / personality cults and their influence on us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This film and its script are either very, very clever or very opaque and pretentious. Ultimately, however, probably unimportant. <br /> <br /> live long and prosper :) <br /> <br />
