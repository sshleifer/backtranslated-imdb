I grew up watching Scooby and I was a fan forever. This cartoon departs from the same old routine that can be boring to viewers. Crooks in Mask routine is getting old and this cartoon is a change. This is not meant to replace the Scooby gang, but I'm sure it's just a break from the same old crime scene for viewers and writers. He focuses on Scooby and Shaggy, who inherits a large sum of money and uses this money to thwart the plans to conquer the world by a mad scientist and his thugs. From time to time small gang tributes and gangs appear. If you're a Scooby-Doo fan, you can still appreciate the bond between the boy and his talking dog, and the jokes that come with it. Just enjoy the cartoon and support creators / writers and producers so that it is not the last Scooby Cartoon.
