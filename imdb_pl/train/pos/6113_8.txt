After watching the movie "Marrying Mafia" I almost lost my faith in the Korean film business. But this brought me faith. <br /> <br /> The leading female figure who is a university student is forced to teach a spoiled, rich but charismatic guy from high school. In fact, it is the age of a female figure. For some funny quarrels, these two are great friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that kwan sang woo, the novice, did his work with the excellency. He was such a revelation !! Actress Kim ha nul was also adorable as usual. <br /> <br /> This movie tried to avoid all the clich√©s that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. And it did not show us any unnecessary naked scenes and sex. It was great, beautiful, fresh, made me want to see it again. <br /> <br />
