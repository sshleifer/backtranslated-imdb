It's a sublime movie track. It flows at the right pace all the time. The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear. Funny parts are fun and even more supported by the depressingly tragic nature of the film. <br /> <br /> However, despite many comments about the inherent tragedy of the story, watching me was not depressing. I really enjoyed it in a way that I have not experienced for a long time. This means that it is excellent, yet without all the common pitfalls of contemporary movies, such as; sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life" has nothing that would be without the usual flaws. It has a fully mature story that simply does not require, and would even be ruined by any further beautification. At the same time, the topic is completely adult. It is a work of art that completely encloses you and you do not want anything more than what it already offers. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that are a bit "Waltons", but in fact they make sense. in the long run, because they contrast more dysfunctional moments. The Rosary gives way to tragedy, which then turns into an idyllic one, which turns into a darker, etc. This undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state similar to lithium stability. The peaks and troughs are gentle, but more than enough in the pleasures they bring. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this movie, no matter what genre you usually like. Set aside all prejudices, because it has to be seen!
