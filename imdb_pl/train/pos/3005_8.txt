It is still a reference point that assesses all people from the Golden Age, and given the limited technology and questionable ethical standards of the authorities (on the screen), it copes well with all generations of similar attempts since the time of film and television. Quickly and furiously with a lot of Warner Bros handkerchiefs and fortunately, there is no time to interest in love, galloping along, taking with him a wonderful cast to the brutal end. I never understood why the district attorney had to track Vance everywhere. Palette as a detective, especially Girardot as a doctor, is delightfully eccentric and without a computer - looking at the victim of the second murder, he smells that there are too many people in the world. Of course it's William Powell as Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as the director) that makes the movie the way it is - when Powell ever did a dud? <br /> <br /> An army of cops at the crime scene is not "I'm really doing finding a second dead body, and the unconscious dog did it! The best thing is that Vance tells us the whole sequence of events surrounding the murders - suspicious sets of models combine with the fantastic angles of the camera wandering to create a very modern look and surprising what has already happened. The only problem is, as usual, the conclusion can not match the general deduction processes displayed throughout and a somewhat elaborate end is called; some of Chana, Moto and many others, of course, could also be ended this way. But because it happens so quickly and is ... somewhat morally doubtful, it does not diminish my opinion about the status of KMC as a classic! <br /> <br /> All the prints I've ever seen in KMC (in the worst case) like looking at a bowl of goldfish, so if you're interested in it, until you get sucked.
