Dear God, where to begin. this is a bar that is not the best movie I've ever seen. camera angles are great, but in my opinion acting was the best. why the screenwriters of this film do not write large budget films that I will never understand. the cast is another. it is wonderful. this is definitely the best movie ted raimi. I know that some of you probably think "there is not much better", but there is nothing wrong with that. the predatory island is a work of art. I hope he should have the best movie of the year instead of that bad movie Crash with a group without names and without raptors. I believe that this movie is really the greatest thing EVER.
