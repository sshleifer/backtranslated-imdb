There are marionettes in the Micro Phonies. In this short cut the trio is a handymen working in a recording studio. Finally, they watch Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) singing in the spring. The voice is amazing. Curious drags is heard by Mrs. Bixby (Symon Boniface). Maybe he's calling Curly Senior Cucarach. Three puppets end the party, where Curly intends to wear a tramp. They play the notes of spring and everything goes well until Moe does not destroy the plate on Curly's head. In the end, they use the sex doll Lucia until the baritone recognizes them and does not detach them. Alice Van Doren catches the boy screaming and hides behind the curtain to help them. All right, until the baritone wonders how he sings Curly without the help of a phonograph, he discovers Alice behind the curtain. Three puppets turn out to be cheats, but Alice's father discovers her daughter's talent and agrees that she should become a singer. The guard is thrown out of the room. Perfect.
