This is one of the greatest love movies I've ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem outdated, but this does not divert attention from the movie. You should try to observe, criticize and enjoy any form of art in retrospect. Apparently, according to the "Sex in the City" standards, Charlie Chaplin was terribly boring. However, from the perspective of America in 1925, he was fantastic. Similarly, Sayonara is a breakthrough movie in her view of a mixed-race romance, arrogance and prejudice of the American "obvious destiny" and the complexity of different cultures. This is a natural next step to films like the Gentleman's Agreement. His goal, however, was not only social comment but it is fun and pleasant, with countless lines that are simply not forgotten. <br /> <br /> However, even if it's just a love story, it's great. Although some are attacking Brando's accent, he is the best in nuance and characterization. The buttons and Umeki (who won the Oscars) and the rest of the cast add a lot to the movie. <br /> <br /> Such a real star performs a fantastic job that makes you feel the passion she has for Brando, torn by her sense of duty and loyalty. Her speech, when she meets and talks with Brando for the first time, is classic and rarely seen in the cinema. The dialogue between Taka and Brando in her wardrobe in Tokyo at the end of the film is equally good. Of course, there is no sucking in, no mentioning of traces and worse, which is an example of love in today's movies, but that makes it all the better. It presents true love and passion, not just "warmth". If this movie does not touch you, you are too young, too cynical or dead.
