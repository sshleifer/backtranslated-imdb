This amazingly formal movie from the band "Walker, Texas Ranger" contains some of the most unbelievable scenes in the history of the television movie. In addition, you can predict the result from the very beginning. However, it is a funny movie that performs the task: it entertains. That's all that was to be done and it happens. Acrobatics and explosions are fun and exciting, and the plot is not half wrong. Acting is also decent, which is not a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you're a genre fan (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you'll love it. If not, do not waste time. 8/10
