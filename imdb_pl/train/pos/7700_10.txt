it was one of those $ 50 cents - formerly --- and a lot more complex than most people realize - and it was in color! not only are the effects extraordinary, and nonsense such as "Earth versus flying saucers" - the real "killer" is "the universality of the plot" - everything depends on two principles - the ancient concept hidden father's desire for incestuous thinking about his daughter and the idea of ​​what happened if the world had reached the point where all the desires of citizens would become visible. <br /> <br /> needless to say that everyone we regret will not die, not if much, if at all - and this has happened to the population of the "forbidden" planet - actually rather modern. unfortunately, "Krell" equipment - wasted by ignorance, remains, and "Morpheus", an incestuous father, knows how to get access to such a technique - and he does it to prevent his daughter from losing one. ancient plot, beautifully delivered. <br /> <br /> and considering its age, it remains a staggering tension, action, human classic emotion --- and visually very modern --- do not give it - announces all modern science fiction - and its psiological content raises go, beyond any genre - a timeless work --- <br /> <br /> and soundtract! you will not see / hear the pure "synthesizer" and the perfectly absorbed background of Moog --- "do not miss" ---
