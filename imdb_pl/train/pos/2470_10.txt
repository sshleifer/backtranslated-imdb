After the initial shock of realizing that Mr. Branagh had filmed it, I was literally shaking with excitement that this epic was right in front of me. I was not disappointed. So faithful to Shakespeare, yet so available. It enraged my mind. I always like to watch or listen to Branagh and I was wondering ... is this movie called in other countries? It would be like painting mustache on Mona Lisa.
