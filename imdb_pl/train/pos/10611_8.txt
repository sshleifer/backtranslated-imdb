What I call the other reviewer a lack of character development is an understatement. The film did not hit the head with excessive expansion or unnecessary history. Yes, there were many unspoken stories that we only saw, but it was primarily a one-day drop of events that catalyzed changes in all forms. The performance of Henry Thomas was a really beautiful study of the power of action, which focuses more on reaction than on action. Good rental.
