Absolutely the first movie that horrified me to death. It happened to me to catch it when my older brother (r.i.) watched him. He was on a black and white television and was not a good picture, but it interested me. Shortly thereafter, my people bought a set of colors and, as luck would have it, The Million Dollar Movie showed it on one Sunday. <br /> <br /> I forgot most of the plot, but it did not take long to catch up ... and I was so scared that it was hard to sleep tonight! I mean, it was just a movie, but the game included a creature that not only came from space, but it could not be heard or seen ... and when it gets to you it was too late. Even now, after such a long time, my spine is still shaking. A real classic and an even better classic, which I saw to scare new generation pants! <br /> <br /> Long live The Blob!
