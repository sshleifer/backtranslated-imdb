What a masterpiece. Take on the conflict of the Cold War and move it into the future. This film is the first-class satire. In my humble opinion, it surpasses Dr. Strangelove. <br /> <br /> Clever nomenclature of two superpowers, like the Confederation and the Market. Cons are commies and Market, The West! outstanding. Clever use of Joxs genes was ahead of its time. only we really see the risks associated with genetic engineering. The joxs robot coped with this issue in 1989. <br /> <br /> The message of this film concerns the humbleness of humankind and how it can overcome the government's wishes. These movies are screaming NOT to DO THAT YOU WANT TO KILL US EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> PERFECT 10/10
