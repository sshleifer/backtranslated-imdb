My husband and I like DoodleBops the same as our 8-month-old child. We bought him DVDs and CDs so we could see them and hear them. They are fun, energetic and very funny. They encourage children to be active, share and care. They always have a positive message along with entertaining entertainment. Every time our son hears a theme song, he quickly turns his head towards the TV and starts bouncing in excitement. Dee Dee is a great singer, she has a great voice. Maybe he is a great dancer. I would recommend DoodleBops to anyone who has children. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You just can not help but you smile and you want to dance when you hear it.
