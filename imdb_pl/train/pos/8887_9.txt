When I saw the movie, I was really shocked when I saw what it was all about in the 1960s. I know that I may be wrong in some cases, but it looked like the 1960s had an impact on people in those days. Some said they would like to come back to the 1960s. From what I saw, I would say so for excitement and not for the result. But that's my opinion.
