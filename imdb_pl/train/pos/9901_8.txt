This movie looked like a classic in the cheesy genre of the '80s, which is my favorite genre of them all, so when I saw that it was Free on Demand, I had to watch it! It features Caroline Munro from both Phibes' films (she was his wife who died!), Dracula AD 1972, Sinbad's Golden Journey, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, Spy who loved me, maniac and without a face. /> <br /> Provided by people standing behind Do not Open Til Christmas and Pieces, Here are my thoughts on this topic ... <br /> <br /> Opening on April Fools Day, where a group of kids play an elaborate joke in school nerd - promising him sex in the shower, and giving him public humiliation and face in the toilet (while he is naked!). Coach stops, but both parties swear revenge. But cool kids will finally burn a live nerd. <br /> <br /> A break in the future and a meeting in high school, or at least think so (bwahahha?). The only ones who received the invitations were a gang that burned the kid and his April Fool's Day (actually the day before April Fool's Day, but the fun starts at midnight), but they do not see the case and they spend time in front of school until dusk. Then they finally break into the school and start to demolish. <br /> <br /> Inside they find food / drink and a small chapel for each of them, each of the cabinets and things, along with the Marty's locker (suckers) and a vintage. They also find an old black janitor / caretaker who spends time saying "Oooh yesser! Yesser! I do not want any trouble, sir! "And then he is killed immediately. Pretty pointless character, but it's still my favorite. <br /> <br /> The film takes the page from the Alien book, in a wonderfully bloody way that you just have to see! Then everyone realizes that they are there to die, and they start going crazy, except for Shirley, who decides that it would be best to take a bath in old school showers at that moment. Of course, it spills blood and acid, and its face melts (very good, remember this). The rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs and Marty kill everyone, wearing a mask of a jester. What plans them? "All we have to do is not fall asleep and wait until noon. Marta will not kill us in the middle of the day! " Seriously, that's what he said. Apparently you can only kill at night. But will they survive the night? Who will live and who will die? And why do all the bodies disappear? Rent, buy or steal this great movie to find out! The film is really very good, filled with clich√©s (the car does not start, DAMMIT!) And just pure fun. Not to mention that everyone has names like Carol, Nany, Frank, Joe and Susan. I recommend it to everyone! And not to mention the fact that he has Spin Off! Cutting Class from 1989 is a side effect of this slasher jewel and this film begins the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: 2 people having sex, the guy wants to end, but the girl does not. "Talk to me dirty, Frank !!" she screams "Uh ... tits!" "DIRTIER!" "Uh ... tits. F * ck. Tits. Tits. F * ck. " It seems to work in its favor and with its culminating killer, it strikes both of them!
