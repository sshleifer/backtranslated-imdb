/ * light spoilery * / <br /> <br /> Coming back before Evangelion was born, before Hideaki Anno became an idol and a home name for many anime fans, and before Gainax became fanfavorite, Gunbuster was created. Only when Gainax produced the Honneamise Wings, as well as the famous Otakon shorts or, of course, Gunbuster had some hard things to do. It was not easy for him to choose a genre that had already been done countless times, the space opera. <br /> <br /> Luckily, Gainax decided to put it as a six-part OAV (directly to the video) series. As a result, the series has a larger range than would be possible if it was created in the film. It also prevents that it becomes too boring and too long, with many pointless battles and filler on the way. In addition, they have made every effort to stay away from the tested mechanics of the space opera used in Macross or Gundam and many other popular space operas. <br /> <br /> First of all, the shows start quite clearly, from Noriko in Okinawa High School for mechapilloring. Noriko is the daughter of a respected commander of a ship who died in battle when she was still a small child. This makes her life at the academy quite difficult, because some of her classmates are beginning to suspect that professors prefer Noriko. The first episode is largely a comedy drama, focusing on heroes and the school's surroundings. Things change quickly when the threat of alien invasions is announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (the best girl in the class) are elected to help the collected fleet. <br /> <br /> The middle part of Gunbuster leaves our female volition space, focusing on personal drama and acting. There are a few more signs, and parts of Noriko's past are being retracted. In addition, the threat of strangers is getting closer and closer to every minute, and the Battleship, the last hope of humanity, is presented. Intelligent as the writer Okada, he incorporated the principles of time dilation to make it a little bit more varied. In short, time is slower for those who travel at the speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that lasts almost a century. The dramatic aspect of this phenomenon is also emphasized when Noriko again sees her friends after returning to the base, who have aged much more than she. Science may not be perfect, but it is presented in a fairly reliable way, even for some short short SD films between sections where Noriko, Kazumi and their trainer give a brief description of the scientific principles used in the series. /> <br /> Animation for the 80's series is definitely good. The designs are of course in the style of the 80s, but they have their charm. The animation is smooth enough and the designs are pretty, although the costumes betray <br /> <br /> some fanservice fascinations that Gainax will use fully. Mechs throughout the show are also pretty cool, with Gunbuster as the best killing machine, strong and huge. The last episode was entirely made in black and white. Although it is generally believed (but not confirmed) that it was done for budgetary reasons, it gives the series a completely different atmosphere that fits perfectly into the second part. <br /> <br /> Music is a very typical space for opera fairs. Too bombastic in places, very general and definitely not worth buying. Mostly fits the series, but sometimes it can be quite annoying. Tanaka is not really a known composer, and the only respectable series he has worked on is Dragon Half. If you think about 80's anime music, you'll know what to expect. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, the attention slowly shifts from the drama to the space opera to an epic battle, but in this way the viewer will hardly notice it. Step by step, the drama will be toned down and the battles will take over the first row. However, none of these aspects is completely abandoned. With the last episode in sight, Noriko and his crew are fighting for the further existence of mankind, and with the last battle in sight, some questions are asked about the position of the human race in the galaxy and how far can guarantee self-preservation. Although they will never get an answer, they still present interesting ideas for thinking. The last episode is very epic, with a nice but quite predictable ending, although not all endings should of course contain many bizarre twists. It matches the series again. <br /> <br /> Gunbuster can sound like your average cosmic operatic anime at the beginning, with alien invasions, huge battles and some personal drama, and for the most part. But this is an exceptionally good solution for change. Instead of constantly combining old elements, six long episodes, Gunbuster presents us with a change from a small drama to epic heroism on a large scale. Along the way, we meet some interesting and well-modeled figures, whose mutual relations change very much due to the phenomenon of time dilation. The performance is very closely written, although in some places it has a tendency to slip. Too dramatic events and too bad mecha attacks could easily be avoided. In summary, the trip that Gunbuster takes you is very relaxing, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic. Maybe it has not destroyed the borders and boundaries of the genre of the cosmic opera, but at least it bends them a bit. Very pleasant anime classic, but not without flaws. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
