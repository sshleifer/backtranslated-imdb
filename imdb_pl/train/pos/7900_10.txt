I admit that for the first time I saw "Even cowgirls Get the Blues", I did not think it was unforgettable in any respect. But now, after seeing him for the seventh time, I admit that he grew up on me. The heroes of Sissy, Mrs. Jellybean and the Countess have become very endearing. And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean seems very sweet. Although the plot is very poor, I think satirical humor makes up for it more. There is also a great soundtrack in which there are extremely talented K.D. Lang (who reminds me a bit of Patsy Cline) at its best. I can not come up with any movie that would "grow up" after a bad first impression, just like Cowgirls.
