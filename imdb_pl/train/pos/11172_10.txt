Personally, I love this movie and the novel (I read the book first and decided to watch the movie). First of all, the plot is truly original and one of a kind. Acting is also great and I love casting. Judd Crandall (Fred Gwynne) perfectly fits his role and really sells it to you. There are also a few nasty lines (Idk, if they were supposed to be trivial), but they really will improve the mood and ensure good laughter. The atmosphere of Maine is really the perfect place to make this movie and it attracts you throughout the movie. Not only will you love it, but you will want to see it again, I recommend it to 100% of horror fans !!
