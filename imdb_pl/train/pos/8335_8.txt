While the sparkling chemistry between Ryan and Robbin is enough to see this movie, the additional cast (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning and the funny Jacobi trio, Saks and Maher) is an additional plus. Matthau shines like Einstein, Fry is perfect as Ryan's clinical fianc√©, and Einstein's Shaluba line is, as noted, one of the main attractions of the film. The speech Robbins presents for the first time in public is pure poetry. Recognition for writers for handling this foam with wit and lightness. I also thought Keene Curtis was as good as Eisenhower. It can be considered a kind of hatchling, but I think everyone will have a chance. Eight very solid points.
