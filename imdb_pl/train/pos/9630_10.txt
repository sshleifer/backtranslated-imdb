I've seen Dirty Work several times and it's probably my favorite short Stan and Ollie. <br /> <br /> In this, Stan and Ollie are chimney sweepers and they get the job of cleaning the chimney in Professor Noodle's home (Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle is doing crazy experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos trying to clear the chimney and make a mess in the living room. The end is that Ollie falls into a tank with a special formula that Noodle uses for his experiments, and that turns him into a chimpanzee! The best part is that Ollie falls on the chimney and a lot of bricks land on his head, but it seems he hates it. <br /> <br /> Dirty job is the funniest Stan and Ollie. Great fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 stars out of 5.
