Bedknobs & Broomsticks are another of Disney's masterpieces. He was filmed with sequences of animations, and actors and actresses interact with animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins, when children and Mary disappear in the art of the pavement.) I assess this film mainly through the eyes of a child because I have not seen it for years. Then it was one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (a conflict beginning with ghastly armor going into battle) were my favorite. There was also a lot of stop animations with spells (ie People turning into rabbits), which can now be a bit outdated and stupid. (In addition, I think the movie starts slowly.) The child's eyes are a funny movie and it's easy for children to get into the children's places in the movie. It is a film with imagination, which today is largely forgotten.
