A few years ago I added a comment to IMDB on the television series "The Real McCoys". I said then and I will repeat now that it was a charming, funny and entertaining show, well-preserved with great characteristics. <br /> <br /> I recently saw on DVD four old episodes of PLUS the Reunion 2000 with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. As another writer mentioned, it is interesting that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) did not have much to pay attention to, but maybe they could be followed by SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The convention performance was well done and gave us many unknown insights about this program. One of the internal information we did not receive was whether Kathy Nolan wished she had given up on the unpleasant contractual dispute, which made Luke a "widow" last year, which was not very good. Nolan made the bomb of the Broadside comedy about women nurses in the Pacific during World War II. Get? Side? No, not funny. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the dingy, full of humor and brutal TRASH on television, which is undermining our values ​​so much, "The Real McCoys" play with decent values ​​and good human beings. And thank you to all involved, including the creator, Irving Pinkus, for bringing it to my family. We have never missed it.
