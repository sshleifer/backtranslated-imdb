Kubrick again presents his amazing ability to create the perfect atmosphere for the film. Mainly thanks to cinematography, but also thanks to the ingenious result, it creates a cool and sinister tone that rests throughout the film and makes my spine swarm from the beginning. It is this flawless atmosphere that makes 'Shining' my work. Of course, it does not hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the biggest performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrait of a crazy mind. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial to be nice, but it's easy to look over them when the rest of the movie is so brilliant. In addition, it contains the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
