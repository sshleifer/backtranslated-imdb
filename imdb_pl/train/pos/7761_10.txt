*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Released in 1956 And considered quite rude at the time, Douglas Sirk over the top candy-colored melodrama is still a great thing. The story is about the events in the dysfunctional oil family of Texas, which includes Kyle's big brother who is uncertain, weak, wounded and very alcoholic, played by Robert Stack in a very moving and disgraceful show, and his better sister Marylee played an extremely by Dorothy Malone. The performance of Ms. Malone is sent to us through her eyes, which she uses to show us her emotions, which mainly consist of lust (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I have ever seen in films that first falls into the room. Do not get me wrong, her performance is at least an absolute bang and is one of the best jobs in the camp in the 1950s. But she is also terrible because she is as nice and attractive as Malone, she is not a very good actress, and she is not capable of subtle or shading. Her performance has one note. He makes the wicked Mambo, and during the big assembly, like the loving daddy always played by good Robert Keith, he falls to death, climbing the stairs, Sirk mixes it with mad Malone, making an orgasmic dance when he undresses. Stack (who should have won an Oscar) and Malone (who won the award, but he should not), are real movie stars, those who have created all hysteria, both sexually and on the move, while the "real stars" of the movie, Hudson and Bacall, disappear into gray and brown, which are the colors in which they are mainly dressed. Hudson, who was a better actor, then gave recognition for childhood plays and Stack's best friend, and for Malone's persecuted love interest, who moans and moans over Rock most of the movie. But Hudson does not want to have her, and instead is in love with Bacall, who is Stack's wife. Nobody is very happy and no one is happy for a long time. After a year, the Stack-Bacall marriage falls apart very much, and Stack is almost forgotten because he thinks he is sterile and can not give Bacall a child to prove he is a man. Sirk, who was a very intelligent man and had a long and fascinating career in both movies and theater in Germany, ended his Hollywood career in the mid-1950s with a series of intense, colorful "women's films" or melodramas. Although they were mainly adapted from medical or shoddy source material, in Sirka's hands they became masterpieces of this genre. Sirk had a great sense of color and design that he brought into these films, filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played their emotional lives amid strange combinations of colors and lighting, believed in shadows and many mirrored reflections. In "Written" characters always glance from the windows, listen at the door or sneak. So finally, after many acts of violence, accidental murder, miscarriage and many other events, Sirk ends the film with the final and surprising scene of the "reborn" and reformed Malone in a suit tailored to a man sitting at a desk with a mini oil pan.
