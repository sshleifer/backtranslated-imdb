Conclusion - the best romantic comedy in history. This film realizes what all great films strive for: creating a world and time that we want to visit again and makes us happy that we are part of the human race. When I am blue, this movie raises my spirit and makes me laugh (and it is still true after many watching - always fresh). <br /> <br /> All actors are in top form. The characteristics are so dead and the characters are so well connected that they forget about the actor (usually difficult to do with Matthau, Robbinsem and Ryan). Supporting cast is consistently brilliant: Fry ("agae", "total pygmy package!" Something we can fire with NJ "), Shalhoub and Whaley (head of Robbins and associate at the service station) and Curits (Eisenhower - how comedies does Eisenhower have? ?). <br /> <br /> Don, I miss this overlooked treasure.
