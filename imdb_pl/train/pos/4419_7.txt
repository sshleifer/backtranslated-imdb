I saw this movie and heard the writer-director Juan Gerard speaking at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Everything I knew about this is the story of an 8-year-old boy during the Cuban revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family. <br /> <br /> His opening scene is reminiscent of "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is full of references to classic films: The Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), "chicken clucking" (Rebel Without a Cause), reference to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; you'll find more. Homeless (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to Cuban folklore, which often uses a black man as a kind of Greek choir. <br /> <br /> What this film really is is the culmination of a dream. Gerard's desire to honor the family and medium of the film he loved all his life. <br /> <br /> This is the real story of Juan Gerard, and all the people in it are real, just like the events presented. Gerard is in fact an architect and engineer (and passionate about the film), but his dream was to create this film. He and his wife decided to live this dream, and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to his production and star. Keitel holds the screen firmly as a mysterious and mysterious grandfather of "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the first half of the movie suffers from rigid line delivery and some exaggeration, but stay with it. The last half is much better because the events of the revolution combine into a bittersweet and honest climax. This is Juan Gerard's first effort, but he is as honest as he is, and his passion and heart really go away, including the sincere first effort. I will definitely see it again and I hope that it continues its film career. <br /> <br />
