Much has been said about the Shinjuku Triad Society as the first real film "Miike" and I thought that this description could be a clich√©. But, like all stereotypes, it is based on truth. All Miike trademarks are here, violence, black humor, homosexuality, taboo testing and a central figure difficult to believe. However, Shinjuku is one of the most perfectly formed Miike films. He says in an interview that if he did it again, it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think it means that the film has a really captivating energy and a raw edge that seems so fresh that although it may be able to capture a more complex visual or technical film, it can not repeat or improve the purity of the movie. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, violence is absolutely visceral, gushing blood and lively beatings are complemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a shattered chair on her face. (Only Miike's movie could let you get away with it.) The movie has a fantastic pace, unlike Dead or Alive, which starts and ends strongly and dips in. Dead or Alive also deals with similar matters, Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and the Chinese in the post-war period, and this emotional subject is treated well here, the central figure really comes alive when you start to understand your past. <br /> <br /> I can not sing Shinjuku praise enough. I do not want to give away too much. This is Miike, before he started using CGI to animate his movies and almost resembles something from Sonatine Kitano. The central characters are perfectly realized, and the final turn of the action guarantees that once the movie ends, you will re-enable it to solve it all.
