There are many reasons to watch this film: see the reality that beats Latin America in connection with kidnappings, police corruption at the continental level, among so many realities that we live Latinos. <br /> <br /> Denzel Wahington's performance was brilliant, this guy is still a great actor and he continues this way. Dakota Fanning just 10 years old, became a great actress and I congratulate her. The rest of the movie was wonderful, I have it in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope this has happened with those who produce Hollywood to film the whole of Venezuela, where they better show our reality in relation to crime, drug traffic or political problems. These were the few films played by the Venezuelan land (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly), which should do more as well as in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The song "Una Mirada" I hope it stays in the soundtrack, it's perfect. My voice is 10/10
