Like the new BSG, it was not what fans of the original series expected, so Caprica may not deliver what the fans of the new BSG expected (mostly). This is very interesting, if not a bit involved program, at least the pilot is. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for great excitement related to CGI (new) BSG, you will be very disappointed. If you liked the drama, you'll probably find something you like, or maybe even identify with. <br /> <br /> The story explores how the Cylons evolved, why Adam hates them and the beginnings of a monotheistic society. The authors also manage to cope with the human "playing God (s)" and the creation or reproduction of "human" life. It will be interesting how it will go. <br /> <br /> I discovered that in some parts it works, and in others it is too loud, but in total it was promising. A small part of me wants (or hopes) that there may be some minor incidents with BSG (except for the story I mentioned), but that would probably narrow the story too much. Like BSG, I will have to wait and see if Caprica is growing on me, but it's too early to say so. <br /> <br /> It would be really easy to write it as a failure if you compare it to the previous series, but I'm ready to give it a chance. In conclusion, I thought it was interesting enough to see what the series looks like before "throwing in (proverbial) a towel".
