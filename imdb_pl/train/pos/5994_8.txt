I had the pleasure of watching the short film "The Cure" by the first director Ryan Jafri. What really impresses me is the work with the camera and music. <br /> <br /> I think that many young filmmakers (as I myself am one of them) will experience hard times thanks to cinematography when they start creating indie music. We see that the results are not exactly what we have visualized or below our ambitions. But this film, the directorial debut of the young director, did very well on the screen. Camera movement, color, lighting, compositions contribute to the plot and thrill of the film. <br /> <br /> Music as a key element of the film language also helps a lot. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to present the woman's heart, her desire, her fear, especially briefly. But I still have to admit that I am not a fan of v / o (narrative), especially when the film is developed by narrative, not the shots and cuts. My personal feelings about the narrative part are that I'm guessing that the narrator tried a little too much. So energy pushes the audience away from the emotions of the movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a short movie done nicely, I've seen the director's contribution. Move, Ryan! Welcome from China, we're waiting for your next <br /> <br /> time
