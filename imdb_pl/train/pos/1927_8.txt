With the death of GEORGE NADER, on February 4, 2002, I thought about this most interesting program, which, although it had a short run, was a huge idea with good stories. Generally invisible for over 40 years, it is worth to see it again. In the first films there were many different paintings, one of which was a fragment of COLONEL JAN PAUL STAPPA, riding on the famous rocket sleigh, at the point where he was often referred to as "The Fastest Living Man".
