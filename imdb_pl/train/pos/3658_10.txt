This movie is like an allegory of the gospel. He has such direct honesty and innocence that one can not believe that it was created after the World War, when Italy was ravaged and devastated, and was filled with a huge, homeless, poor population. It is a monument to the best features of the human spirit, as well as the endless creative resources of this land of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Toto is a character like Doestoevisky's "Idiot", a modern Christ who finds himself in a big city. He is goodness and purity, strengthened with love, and his actions change the people he meets, just like a dove acting miraculously. The story is told in a natural way and a simple style, but imbued with magic, which is almost a premonition of Fellini's surrealist fantasies. This is one of the most inspirational, uplifting movies ever made.
