I've seen this movie many times and I like all the bad teachers to give it ten to ten, but they feel it would be unfair to other good movies. I think, however, that this is one of those rare jewels: the perfect comedy. I would risk one of the greatest comics of all time. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched. The script is so sharp that you have to stop the bleeding. The story is well known and has already been described in other comments. Both of them perform extraordinary performances, the girls are great and the situations are extremely fun. Not a single curse in your eyes (note that Hollywood, you do not have to swear that you are funny, you must be witty), and the transition from the scene to the movie is trouble-free. They do not do it anymore. Timeless.
