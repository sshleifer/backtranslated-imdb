Finally, I saw this classic TV movie on an unofficial disc recorded from the old VHS, it is a classic horror movie. It is a pity more of this neglected corner of horror regarding official releases on DVD and VHS ... television horror. Recommended for all fans of the TV movie from the 70s, like the trilogy of terror. Those interested should receive a book about this subject by David Deal - Television fright Films from the 70s. Send me an e-mail to see how it is ..... it's fantastic to see it again. <br /> <br /> It has problems, like in many TV movies, they have to be quite ingenious, and even it seems that 70 minutes can be long. We are all used to a more modern edition, but still great things and much better than many theatrical horrors released today.
