It's a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to watch the movie and somehow it ended. I have never heard of it or anyone in it (excpet Mike from Friends). <br /> <br /> But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paul give amazing performances. Humor is always dry and witty. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd plays the character of Mike from Friends (which works great). Other characters are stereotypes, and the story is formal (I mean, we're not talking about "Apocalypse Now"). But the characters are nice, the story is addictive, the soundtrack, production and direction work well. <br /> <br /> All in all a great movie that really deserves more than it deserves. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their tastes, but I really do not understand one-star opinions on this subject.
