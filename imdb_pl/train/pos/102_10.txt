I heard about this film for the first time about 20 years ago, when I was a child in elementary school (!), It so happened that one day I was looking through encyclopedias in the classroom, and under the slogan of movies (or cinema, I do not remember), there were several pictures for various films from the mainstream to the experimental one, and one of them shown on the page was a form for OffOn. It really intrigued me, because the most stood out on the site (it was a photo from the movie scene with an eye with other elements imposed on it). <br /> <br /> About 18 years later, the public library here, where I live, had at its disposal a whole set of 4-DVDs "Treasures of American Film Archives" published by the National Film Preservation Foundation. So when I read the notes about the DVD boxes per set, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that OffOn is on one of the disks. After all these years I could finally see the movie! After watching this, I did not expect it to happen (it was a more organic film, not a bad thing, but I expected it would have more electronic aesthetics), but it was still an impressive movie, IMHO, taking the techniques that Scott Bartlett used to make the film, including the manual staining of the film itself and the use of video equipment for some film scenes (filmed from a video monitor), giving him more of a difficult situation, look less. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the techniques used in this movie were pretty groundbreaking in 1972. That's why it's still one of my favorite short / experimental films, and creative inspiration also for me ...
