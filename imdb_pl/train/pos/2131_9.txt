It's a movie that gets better every time I see it. There are many nuances in it. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight, bringing a sharp comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only "villian" in the film, and his oily charms are well used here. Frank Morgan is delightful as the owner of the title store, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar way here is well used. I particularly liked the performance of Felix Bressart as Pirovitch. Very credible in every aspect of your role. <br /> <br /> Both are equally successful, and Margaret Sullivan does a great job by depicting a somewhat desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman. <br /> <br /> This film, however, belongs to Jimmy Stewart. The film is presented from his point of view, with the action revolving around him. Mr. Stewart is more than able to make a movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart when he is dismissed because of a misunderstanding. It is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that this traumatic event causes, so perfectly. In my opinion, James Stewart is undoubtedly the greatest film actor in the history of this medium. No one else has been captured on a film that would be able to convey so completely what it feels to the public. While he was making this film, he still had most of his career ahead of him, but he is completely a master of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewartt's best movies, and one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you'll find. I highly recommend this film, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
