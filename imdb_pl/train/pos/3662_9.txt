It's really a strange movie - and this is NOT a bad thing. It is a combination of a neo-realistic film about a homeless and fairy tale. I'm sure some people may find this movie a bit strange, but I liked it. Once again, this director gathers a great cast of everyday people (not actors) and gets a great team performance. Both films, though not as sad as Umberto D, have a very similar point of view - this is what he does in a very absurd way. Ignore the bad special effects - in the end it was created in the early 50s, and special effects are not so important (or at least should not be in the movies). Instead, sit back and enjoy a very strange and stupid ride. If you are not a total curmudger, you will have a ball. <br /> <br /> By the way, since I first reviewed this movie, I saw another film directed by DeSica, which is absolutely necessary and which is CHILDREN WATCHING US. Although it is not fantasy or light in the spirit, like MIRACLE IN MILAN, it's a great movie.
