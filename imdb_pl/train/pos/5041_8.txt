Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) in his FBI office. He claims he has information about a serial killer being hunted by the FBI. When Agent Doyle arrives at the office, he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother. Agent Doyle asks for some evidence, and the man tells the story of his life from childhood. It was a simple family of three: his widow of his father Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night his father collects two brothers and tells them that God's angel has just visited him and appointed his family to destroy the demons. What happens next is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four months ago on VHS, and I watched it again yesterday, now on DVD. Although it is a low-budget movie, the script is sharp, without flaws. The cast is excellent, but I would like to emphasize the performance of Matt O'Leary as a young Felton. It is a very difficult and complex role of a young teenager. Bill Paxton's direction is unusual. There is no obvious violence in this horror film. A great debut behind the camera. I regret the Brazilian title of the film: "A Mão do Diabo" (Devil's hand). If it were at least the "Hand of God", it could be acceptable. But calling this movie a "devil's hand" is really funny. Brent Hanley, screenwriter, did not deserve such disrespect from the Brazilian distributor. This movie is highly recommended. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("Devil's Hand")
