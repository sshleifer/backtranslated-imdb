I grew up in Houston and was nine years old when this movie appeared. As a result, I do not remember anything about the film. But I remember the impression that this caused Gilley and the mechanical bull in the hit Johnny Lee's "Lookin 'for Love," which still brings back my childhood memories when I hear them. <br /> <br /> However, a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is that I was amazed. Few movies hit me harder. This movie is as raw and real as you can. Out of Ranch Ranch uncle Bob's house, the Texas City chemical facility, Gilley's and Bud's and Sissy's dance halls. And maybe because of this there is no major appeal. But no matter how you feel about country music (I can not stand it despite my roots in Houston) Urban Cowboy is a unique piece of American cake. For this reason, I love it!
