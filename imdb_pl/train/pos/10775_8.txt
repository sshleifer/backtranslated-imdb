Nice movie with a great soundtrack that covers the rock landscape of the '70s and' 80s. Radiofreccia describes the generation, describes life in a small village near Correggio (the home town of Ligabue, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie), describes the lives of young people and their problems related to the world. Reminds Trainspotting, with a touch of Italian touch.
