This lucky military swashbuckler from 1939, based rather on the memorable poem by Rudyard Kipling, and his novel Soldiers Three, qualifies as a first-class entertainment about the British Imperial Army in India in the 1880s. Cary Grant delivers more striking fists than in all her films combined. This six-story yarn, set in distant India, deals with the exploits of three raw British sergeants and their native water carriers Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe), who fight against the bloodthirsty cult of the murderous Indians called Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant from "The Last Outpost"), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar winner Victor McLaglen from "The Informer") and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. "Dawn Patrol"), is a competitive trio of hard-drinking, adventurous and Alpha's loving men, whose frolics are about to become history, because Ballantine plans to marry Emma Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the tea industry. Naturally, Cutter and MacChesney are preparing various programs to derail Ballentine's plans. When their superiors order them to come back to work with a sergeant. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote from "The Sheik Steps Out"), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham so that he could not accompany them, and Ballantine must replace him. Half of the fun is to watch the directors trying to outwit each other without hate. Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in a great style and range when our heroes are intertwined with an army of bandits. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for outstanding black and white photographs.
