For the first time I saw this movie in a theater at a foreign film festival, I thought it was an intriguing, fascinating, sensitive bi-sexual artist. So European, very Dutch! I recently rented it for a second review and I could not help laughing about this overworked topic of a mad writer with a religious persecution complex. Get a grip! This guy is a freelancer living from society. I suspect that the real reason why he has these fancy nightmares of "spiderwoman" is that his complex guilty conscience begins after a year of ignoring the mother's advice regarding getting into cars (and beds) with strangers! He not only makes scandalous sums (probably duty free) for making up short stories (lying with guilt), but he is too cheap to pay for cutting hair, so he pushes the owner of a beauty salon. Then he has the courage to complain about the bill! But I also suspect that the world has changed since the creation of this film. Seriously, it was fun to see some of Jan de Bont's camera work and one of Paul Verhoeven's earlier films. Hmmm, maybe the world has not changed so much?
