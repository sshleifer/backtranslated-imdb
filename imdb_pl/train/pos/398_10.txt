I'm a stuntman, I have to admit I've never seen a movie with such a good story and no fighting scene stopping martial arts. If you like a fantastic genre like me, you'll definitely be more than happy! The whole character has a very nice power, and the special effect is almost perfect, in a word, without complaint! I listen to this film a lot in the years to come.
