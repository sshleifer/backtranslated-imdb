Earlier, I wrote that I love "Titanic", I cried at the end (many times) and I am a guy in his sixties. I was also wondering why this great movie, which has won so many awards and been applauded by so many critics, has only received 7.0 ratings from imdb.com users. <br /> <br /> Well, I looked at the collapse of user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes gave him a score of 10, 10.7% gave him a score of 1. These 10.7% of those irrational users have in effect reduced the overall score to 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments I blamed this very unusual pattern of voting (a sudden increase in the number of 1 ratings, with a high grade of 10, falling only gradually and then suddenly withdrawing and jumping on level 1) only one: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I have tuned in to a sufficient number of chat rooms to see the teasing of young people (mainly young men) who have slandered him left and right. They absolutely hate this man and will not have any share in granting him any title in the "Titanic". (To answer one other user: I am NOT talking about someone who really does not like the movie so much, and gave him 5 or 6, etc. Everyone has and has the right to own taste). But no one can convince me that the imdb score of only 7.0 for "Titanic", attracted to this level by a huge number of funny 1 ratings, is a good reflection of the whole movie.) <br /> <br /> Let me demonstrate their point of view, comparing the voting pattern of imdb "Titanic" users with 5 randomly selected checkouts and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but the 5 will prove my point of view). "Heaven's Gate" (1980) was quickly withdrawn from cinemas after very poor cash results, and the ratings of voters were imdb: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall score 6.1). "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) obtained 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% ratings (overall score 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) received 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating 5.8). "Blind Date" (1987) scored 3.0% 10 and 2.8% 1 (overall grade 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) received 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating 5.2). WHAT DO ALL OF THE FILMS HAVE TO COMMON WITH "TITANIC"? ALL PERCENTS OF THEIR 1 RATING ARE LOWER !!!! THAN THE "TITANIC" AND ANY OF THE UNCLASSIFIED WAS NOT NOMINATED FOR ONE PRIZE. Again, "Titanic" received 10.7% of ratings! Compare this with the other 5 films I mentioned. <br /> <br /> Can there be any other explanation than hatred for the Leo factor? <br /> <br />
