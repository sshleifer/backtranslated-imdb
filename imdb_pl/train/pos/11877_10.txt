Directed by Brian De Palma, written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a film that will not be forgotten. The Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Pacino) arrives in America on the American Dream. Montana becomes the "king" in the world of drugs when he ruthlessly directs his crime empire in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This movie has about 180 words F and lasts almost three hours. This movie is fun and you never get bored. You support the Drug Lords, and in some scenes you find out that Montana is not as bad as other Crimean Lords. This is a masterpiece and I recommend to see it. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
