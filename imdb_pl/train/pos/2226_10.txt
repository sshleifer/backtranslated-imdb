I'm surprised by the low IMDb rating of this video. With all due respect, his low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated it so poorly. They would rather see a movie with cheap thrills, more budget and more gore. <br /> <br /> The first mistake people make is that it is a horror movie. It is not so, nor does the film mislead you, it's one thing. This is a psychological thriller. This is for people who really want an intellectual experience while watching a movie. Reel.com is a great example of how I feel about this movie. All other negative reviews do not make much sense. It's almost like trying to make an original movie for a change - very rare these days - there is something wrong and it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> I will reveal a few spoilers for morons who said it was boring and not. does not make sense. Martha was brainwashed and experimenting on herself to be a caring mother while she was really a bad Nazi who would kill without warning. The evidence is in pudding, and the fact that at first glance we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the film is a testimony to the direction and writing of the film. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this film should at least be rated in the range of 6 originality. I recommend this film to people on the other end of the IQ scale - known as intelligent people - because this movie is apparently murdered by those who prefer to watch Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. also. In the case of such a low-budget movie, you are amazed that this movie did not go to your local cinema in the great direction, writing and acting. Do not be fooled by the IMDb rating. This movie is worth it. Actually, I recommend buying a movie because the first viewing on rent will not bring this justice.
