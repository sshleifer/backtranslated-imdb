Watching "Impulsu" is a very rewarding experience. Unpredictable films are so rare when it comes as "Impuls", it is something to grasp. The script is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton give credible performances. It could look like a zombie movie, but "Impulse" far surpasses any boring "zombiefest", and the originality shines in almost every scene. You have the impression that something like this could happen, even though the script is pure fiction. With the "grabber" opening, up to posting loans, you will be fascinated. Very funny and definitely recommended. - MERK
