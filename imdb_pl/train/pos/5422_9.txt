The story of the untouchable, who acted like a great soldier, saving the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, tells the movie from 1939 "Gunga Din". The film based on Rudyard Kipling's poem is superbly directed by George Stevens and plays by Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor Mclagen. The title role is played by Sam Jaffe, well known in my age as the boss of Ben Casey, Dr. Zorba, a name that has become synonymous with large, uncontrolled hair. Say "Dr Zorba hair" to anyone in my generation and know what you're talking about. <br /> <br /> Set up in India during the British occupation, three soldiers - two romantic, happy characters in Grant and Fairbanks, and McLagen as a large lug - they are interludes - in fact three overgrown boys. Gunga Din is a carrier of water, treated somewhat maliciously - verbatim, in any case - by McChesney (McLaglen), but Cutter (Grant) likes him. When he catches Din (pronounced Deen) practicing being his soldier's gait and saluting when he retrieves the unit during maneuvers, Cutter gives him some tips. <br /> <br /> A cheerful group of musketeers will fall apart when Ballantine (Fairbanks) announces that she will soon marry a charming young woman (Joan Fontaine) and leave the service. However, when Gunga Din and Cutter stumbled upon Thugees, a guru's cult led by a guru (Eduardo Cianelli), Gunga Din escapes to warn the individual, and Ballantine insists on re-enlisting to help save Cutter. It's finally a buddy movie. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" begins carelessly, with a slapstick and a wonderful, wide comedy, especially by Cary Grant, who is quite funny. Both he and Fairbanks are so handsome, it is difficult to decide which one to see first. A large part of the movie consists of huge sequences of actions that are very exciting. In the last part the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense, exciting battle. <br /> <br /> Grant has the weakest role, Fairbanks is a romantic lover, and McLaglen as McChesney, mainly because of his treatment Gung Din is the most unlikely figure, although he detects his soft heart in love for his elephant Annie. His softness approaches the end of the film, especially in the very touching, tearing final scene. <br /> <br /> Always gentle and pleasant actor, Sam Jaffe gives a beautiful performance as Gunga Din, a simple, brave man with a big smile, powerful imagination and lofty dreams. Without much dialogue Jaffe wonderfully transmits the soul of Gung Din. <br /> <br /> This is really the best adventure movie, massive, with a good stage, thrilling scenes, great musical score and beautiful film images. Another of this extraordinary year 1939. I highly recommend it.
