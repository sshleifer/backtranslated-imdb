In a word - perfectly. It is a film. Go and see it. Director Ron Howard ... I mean, director Ron Howard did a fantastic job, as usual. Amazing attention to detail, vibrant colors and decorations, the breathtaking atmosphere of Whoville, the amazing variety of costumes. Wait, it's something more - the story is very good too. There is clearly a message that should be extracted from it by well-thought-out viewers. Jim Carrey is at the highest level. He is probably the best Grinchem possible. The girl, Taylor Momsen, is really good. I'm sure he has a great future. The dog is cool. In summary, it is a very high-quality Christmas fairy tale. If you like fairy tales, it's for you. If you like Christmas, it's for you. <br /> <br /> Reading other reviews here ... Live. It hurts me every time I see people who ... well ... their hearts are two sizes too small.
