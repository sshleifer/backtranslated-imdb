Very good western. It was the first time Richard Wilson directed the film, and it was also the first film by Samuel Goldwyn Jr. as a producer. It's nice to see a very young and pretty Angie Dickinson as a saloon girl. Robert Mitchum comes to this city dominated by outlaws and is employed as a city conqueror, but people are afraid that he will go too far, also for the damage he will cause to urban enterprises. In "Warlock", which was created in 1959, There are some similarities. This movie retains a very fast and exciting pace, it really keeps you on the edge.
