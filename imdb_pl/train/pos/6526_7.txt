I have always liked to watch it when it appeared on television every year in the 1960s. It's a typical Hollywood epic story, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies, but so what a funny movie and a good looking movie. Cecil B. DeMille is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 movie at the end of his life. His son-in-law actor Anthony Quinn, who had a supporting role in the film Beluche in 38, is the director in his debut and swan song, because he has never directed the film before and will never be again. DeMille assembled a team that had recently worked on his 10 commandments to help Quinn include, including longtime DeMille collaborator / actor Henry Wilcoxon overseeing the project. The ten commandments also include screenwriter Jesse Lasky, operator Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, director of the second unit Arthur Rosson, artistic directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designers Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester, who as a team of costume designers received only the nomination for Oscar The Buccaneer. A great cast from the DeMille team led by Yell Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future president general Andrew Jackson. The cast also includes Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. In a little over two hours, it drags in some places, but makes up for it with great battle scenes. I would give him 7.5 out of 10.
