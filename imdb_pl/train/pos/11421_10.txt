I do not know what the previous reviewer was watching, but I think that these are reviews, personal taste. This film lacked depth, a very deep film, many layers of emotions, influencing. The currents of suspended love because of subordination to social beliefs, taboo of times and classes, racial relations are not in a very good condition of equality, guilt, longing, hatred, confusion, very dark emotionally. I thought that under the skin you have to surrender to his film, flowing film, not as slow as mentioned earlier, free yourself to the stream of film, emotions will show, characters will reveal their faults, odious interiors, perfect and indeed very cruel!
