*** 1/2 Z ***** Although I do not care about the fact that this is an English version of dubbing, which some reviewers have mentioned, it should be noted that it appears to be in many of Quebec's native hearts. But it was a movie as a child, of which I was a devoted admirer; remembering now that it was created for children, I judge it on the relative basis. The story is that children during the winter break build a magnificent snow fort and push back with weapons, such as snowballs and other potions, as inactive hands and free time lessons in their free time. If I had children, it would definitely be a movie that I would like to interest because the snow fort delighted me when I was young and I think that even today's children will agree, though with Pixar and all computer animation, maybe I'm out of date and just not I realize this. In addition, the message of the film is wonderfully allegorical and positive in this case for children (and adults).
