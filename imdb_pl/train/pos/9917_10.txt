This is the most confronting documentary I've ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea. Edward Burtynsky, based on the pictures of hidden industrial landscapes centered around China's modern industrial development, enlivens the confrontation with the problems we so easily chose to ignore. <br /> <br /> Without taking into account any political parties, this film is a neutral moving picture of realities that our western societies do not want to educate us - byproducts of economic growth, externalities paid by citizens of less developed communities, sources of our comforts and waste of our consumer lifestyle. /> <br /> Amazing, groundbreaking, impossible to ignore. It is a difficult journey, but worth taking - stop being ignorant, or at least see pictures of the truth, without any pressure to deal with these matters. 10/10 definitely!
