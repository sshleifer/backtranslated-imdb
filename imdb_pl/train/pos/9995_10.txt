This is the kind of movie you want to see with a glass of wine, fire and legs. It does not require so much brain power to keep up, so it's very good after a long day. I would say that it is very unrealistic - if you are expecting something serious, do not worry, but it is very funny. Just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in a slum for some time and then really enjoy it ... I definitely recommend it.
