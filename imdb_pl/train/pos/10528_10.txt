I was very impressed with the film version of Jane Austen's novel "Emma" by Doug McGrath, and I liked Rachel Portman so much that when one day I went to the video store and discovered that the two reunited together "Nicholas Nickleby" I immediately rented it without any other attention. <br /> <br /> I have read the book, and for those too critical adaptation fans, Jane Austen, I do not know what else McGrath could have done to better capture the spirit and main elements of the Miss Austen storyline, especially given the limitations of a two-hour movie (which some they complained about too long!). As for Gwen Paltrow's accent, I must admit that I was not very familiar with her when I initially saw it in the theater, and I was absolutely convinced that she was an English actress! <br /> <br /> I am surprised by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery. This is one of the things I like and that I can not wait for in the pieces from the era embedded in the English countryside. The beautiful background of the film is the main factor influencing its attractiveness and success. If your idea of ​​an escapist is something more grim, then maybe you should rent something like "Death Wish III!" <br /> <br /> English country settings are as attractive and charming as cast and combine with history and soundtrack to entertainment that does not bother repeating views. McGrath is a miracle in choreographing the game of subtle expressions that are so important in communicating the intricate romantic intrigue that appears in this story. <br /> <br /> This refreshing movie can also be a clinic about how pleasurable a film can be minus sex, violence, and even a vile antagonist. History is often funny, endearing and sometimes quite moving. <br /> <br /> I have seen many competent adaptations of Jane Austen's books, but this is my favorite question without a doubt.
