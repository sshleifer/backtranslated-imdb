You know this story - a group of carefree jumpers enter the competition, which apparently has no chance of winning - this story was made to death by Hollywood (Bring It On, The Karate Kid, Escape to Victory, Best of the Best etc.) Now Korea gives cope with the Taekwondo team fighting for glory? and guess what ?? the result is predictable, but ultimately satisfying. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie does not fall flat on your face depends on a talented young cast who really cares about heroes, and that keeps you watching until the end. <br /> <br /> Fans of a typical martial arts film can be disappointed? Taekwondo does not provide ordinary movements and acrobatics in most Kung Fu movies; the action is limited to (although impressive) kicking and occasional impact. It does not matter, however, because it is the interaction of the heroes and their fight that create something of themselves, which makes the film a success.
